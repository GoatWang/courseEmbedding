was a key figure during the scottish enlightenment era he is best known for two classic works the theory of moral sentiments  and an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations  the latter usually abbreviated as the wealth of nations is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics smith studied social philosophy at the university of glasgow and at balliol college oxford where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow scot john snell after graduating he delivered a successful series of public lectures at edinburgh leading him to collaborate with david hume during the scottish enlightenment smith obtained a professorship at glasgow teaching moral philosophy and during this time he wrote and published the theory of moral sentiments in his later life he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout europe where he met other intellectual leaders of his day smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory the wealth of nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics in this and other works he developed the concept of division of labour and expounded upon how rational selfinterest and competition can lead to economic prosperity smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by tory

the county of fife scotland his father also adam smith was a scottish writer to the signet senior solicitor advocate and prosecutor judge advocate and also served as comptroller of the customs in kirkcaldy in  he married margaret douglas daughter of the landed robert douglas of strathendry also in fife his father died two months after he was born leaving his mother a widow the date of smiths baptism into the church of scotland at kirkcaldy was  june  and this has often been treated as if it were also his date of birth which is unknown although few events in smiths early childhood are known the scottish journalist john rae smiths biographer recorded that smith was abducted by gypsies at the age of three and released when others went to rescue himn  smith was close to his mother who probably encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions he attended the burgh school of kirkcaldy—characterised by rae as one of the best secondary schools of scotland at that period—from  to  he learned latin mathematics history and writing formal educationedit a commemorative plaque for smith is located in smiths home town of kirkcaldy smith entered the university of glasgow when he was fourteen and studied moral philosophy under francis hutcheson here smith developed his passion for liberty reason and free speech in  smith was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at balliol college oxford under the snell exhibition adam smith considered the teaching at glasgow to be far superior to that at oxford which he found intellectually stifling in book v chapter ii of the wealth of nations smith wrote in the university of oxford the greater part of the public professors have for these many years given up altogether even the pretence of teaching smith is also reported to have complained to friends that oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of david humes treatise on human nature and they subsequently confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it according to william robert scott the oxford of smiths time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework nevertheless smith took the opportunity while at oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large bodleian library when smith was not studying on his own his time at oxford was not a happy one according to his letters near the end of his time there smith began suffering from shaking fits probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown he left oxford university in  before his scholarship ended in book v of the wealth of nations smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at english universities when compared to their scottish counterparts he attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at oxford and cambridge which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students and to the fact that distinguished men of letters could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the church of england adam smiths discontent at oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in glasgow francis hutcheson hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the university of glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students colleagues and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations which he sometimes opened to the public his lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy but to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives appropriately acquiring the epithet the preacher of philosophy unlike smith hutcheson was not a system builder rather it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as the never to be forgotten hutcheson—a title that smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people his good friend david hume and influential mentor francis hutcheson teaching careeredit smith began delivering public lectures in  in edinburgh sponsored by the philosophical society of edinburgh under the patronage of lord kames his lecture topics included rhetoric and belleslettres and later the subject of the progress of opulence on this latter topic he first expounded his economic philosophy of the obvious and simple system of natural liberty while smith was not adept at public speaking his lectures met with success david hume was a friend and contemporary of smith in  he met the philosopher david hume who was his senior by more than a decade in their writings covering history politics philosophy economics and religion smith and hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the scottish enlightenment in  smith earned a professorship at glasgow university teaching logic courses and in  he was elected a member of the philosophical society of edinburgh having been introduced to the society by lord kames when the head of moral philosophy in glasgow died the next year smith took over the position he worked as an academic for the next thirteen years which he characterised as by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period of his life smith published the theory of moral sentiments in  embodying some of his glasgow lectures this work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator or the individual and other members of society smith defined mutual sympathy as the basis of moral sentiments he based his explanation not on a special moral sense as the third lord shaftesbury and hutcheson had done nor on utility as hume did but on mutual sympathy a term best captured in modern parlance by the twentiethcentury concept of empathy the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being following the publication of the theory of moral sentiments smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at glasgow to learn under smith after the publication of the theory of moral sentiments smith began to give more attention to jurisprudence and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals for example smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour rather than the nations quantity of gold or silver which is the basis for mercantilism the economic theory that dominated western european economic policies at the time françois quesnay one of the leaders of the physiocratic school of thought in  the university of glasgow conferred on smith the title of doctor of laws lld at the end of  he obtained an offer from charles townshend—who had been introduced to smith by david hume—to tutor his stepson henry scott the young duke of buccleuch smith then resigned from his professorship to take the tutoring position he subsequently attempted to return the fees he had collected from his students because he resigned in the middle of the term but his students refused tutoring and travelsedit smiths tutoring job entailed touring europe with scott during which time he educated scott on a variety of subjects—such as proper polish he was paid £ per year plus expenses along with a £ per year pension roughly twice his former income as a teacher smith first travelled as a tutor to toulouse france where he stayed for one and a half years according to his own account he found toulouse to be somewhat boring having written to hume that he had begun to write a book to pass away the time after touring the south of france the group moved to geneva where smith met with the philosopher voltaire from geneva the party moved to paris here smith came to know several great intellectual leaders of the time invariably having an effect on his future works this list included benjamin franklin turgot jean dalembert andré morellet helvétius and notably françois quesnay the head of the physiocratic school so impressed with his ideas smith considered dedicating the wealth of nations to him had quesnay not died beforehand physiocrats were opposed to mercantilism the dominating economic theory of the time illustrated in their motto laissez faire et laissez passer le monde va de lui même let do and let pass the world goes on by itself they were also known to have declared that only agricultural activity produced real wealth merchants and industrialists manufacturers did not this however did not represent their true school of thought but was a mere smoke screen manufactured to hide their actual criticisms of the nobility and church arguing that they made up the only real clients of merchants the wealth of france was virtually destroyed by louis xiv and louis xv in ruinous wars by aiding the american insurgents against the british and perhaps most destructive in terms of public perceptions was what was seen as the excessive consumption of goods and services deemed to have no economic contribution—unproductive labour assuming that nobility and church are essentially detractors from economic growth the feudal system of agriculture in france was the only sector important to maintain the wealth of the nation given that the english economy of the day yielded an income distribution that stood in contrast to that which existed in france smith concluded that the teachings and beliefs of physiocrats were with all their imperfections perhaps the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy the distinction between productive versus unproductive labour—the physiocratic classe steril—was a predominant issue in the development and understanding of what would become classical economic theory later yearsedit in  henry scotts younger brother died in paris and smiths tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter smith returned home that year to kirkcaldy and he devoted much of the next ten years to his magnum opus there he befriended henry moyes a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude as well as teaching moyes smith secured the patronage of david hume and thomas reid in the young mans education in may  smith was elected fellow of the royal society of london and was elected a member of the literary club in  the wealth of nations was published in  and was an instant success selling out its first edition in only six months in  smith was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in scotland and went to live with his mother in panmure house in edinburghs canongate five years later as a member of the philosophical society of edinburgh when it received its royal charter he automatically became one of the founding members of the royal society of edinburgh and from  to  he occupied the honorary position of lord rector of the university of glasgow he died in the northern wing of panmure house in edinburgh on  july  after a painful illness and was buried in the canongate kirkyard on his death bed smith expressed disappointment that he had not achieved more smiths literary executors were two friends from the scottish academic world the physicist and chemist joseph black and the pioneering geologist james hutton smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication he mentioned an early unpublished history of astronomy as probably suitable and it duly appeared in  along with other material such as essays on philosophical subjects smiths library went by his will to david douglas lord reston son of his cousin colonel robert douglas of strathendry fife who lived with smith it was eventually divided between his two surviving children cecilia margaret mrs cunningham and david anne mrs bannerman on the death of her husband the reverend w b cunningham of prestonpans in  mrs cunningham sold some of the books the remainder passed to her son professor robert oliver cunningham of queens college belfast who presented a part to the library of queens college after his death the remaining books were sold on the death of mrs bannerman in  her portion of the library went intact to the new college of the free church edinburgh personality and beliefsedit characteredit james tassies enamel paste medallion of smith provided the model for many engravings and portraits that remain today not much is known about smiths personal views beyond what can be deduced from his published articles his personal papers were destroyed after his death at his request he never married and seems to have maintained a close relationship with his mother whom he lived with after his return from france and who died six years before his own death smith was described by several of his contemporaries and biographers as comically absentminded with peculiar habits of speech and gait and a smile of inexpressible benignity he was known to talk to himself a habit that began during his childhood when he would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions he also had occasional spells of imaginary illness and he is reported to have had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study according to one story smith took charles townshend on a tour of a tanning factory and while discussing free trade smith walked into a huge tanning pit from which he needed help to escape he is also said to have put bread and butter into a teapot drunk the concoction and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had according to another account smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up  miles  km outside of town before nearby church bells brought him back to reality james boswell who was a student of smiths at glasgow university and later knew him at the literary club says that smith thought that speaking about his ideas in conversation might reduce the sale of his books and so his conversation was unimpressive according to boswell he once told sir joshua reynolds that he made it a rule when in company never to talk of what he understood portrait of smith by john kay  smith has been alternately described as someone who had a large nose bulging eyes a protruding lower lip a nervous twitch and a speech impediment and one whose countenance was manly and agreeable smith is said to have acknowledged his looks at one point saying i am a beau in nothing but my books smith rarely sat for portraits so almost all depictions of him created during his lifetime were drawn from memory the bestknown portraits of smith are the profile by james tassie and two etchings by john kay the line engravings produced for the covers of th century reprints of the wealth of nations were based largely on tassies medallion religious viewsedit there has been considerable scholarly debate about the nature of smiths religious views smiths father had shown a strong interest in christianity and belonged to the moderate wing of the church of scotland the fact that adam smith received the snell exhibition suggests that he may have gone to oxford with the intention of pursuing a career in the church of england angloamerican economist ronald coase has challenged the view that smith was a deist based on the fact that smiths writings never explicitly invoke god as an explanation of the harmonies of the natural or the human worlds according to coase though smith does sometimes refer to the great architect of the universe later scholars such as jacob viner have very much exaggerated the extent to which adam smith was committed to a belief in a personal god a belief for which coase finds little evidence in passages such as the one in the wealth of nations in which smith writes that the curiosity of mankind about the great phenomena of nature such as the generation the life growth and dissolution of plants and animals has led men to enquire into their causes and that superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them from more familiar causes or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods some other authors argue that smiths social and economic philosophy is inherently theological and that his entire model of social order is logically dependent on the notion of gods action in nature smith was also a close friend and later the executor of david hume who was commonly characterised in his own time as an atheist the publication in  of smiths letter to william strahan in which he described humes courage in the face of death in spite of his irreligiosity attracted considerable controversy published worksedit the theory of moral sentimentsedit main article the theory of moral sentiments  printing of an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations in  smith published his first work the theory of moral sentiments sold by copublishers andrew millar of london and alexander kincaid of edinburgh smith continued making extensive revisions to the book up until his deathn  although the wealth of nations is widely regarded as smiths most influential work it is believed that smith himself considered the theory of moral sentiments to be a superior work in the work smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time and suggests that conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek mutual sympathy of sentiments his goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankinds ability to form moral judgement given that people begin life with no moral sentiments at all smith proposes a theory of sympathy in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behavior the feedback we receive from perceiving or imagining others judgements creates an incentive to achieve mutual sympathy of sentiments with them and leads people to develop habits and then principles of behavior which come to constitute ones conscience some scholars have perceived a conflict between the theory of moral sentiments and the wealth of nations the former emphasises sympathy for others while the latter focuses on the role of selfinterest in recent years however some scholars of smiths work have argued that no contradiction exists they claim that in the theory of moral sentiments smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the impartial spectator as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathise with their sentiments rather than viewing the theory of moral sentiments and the wealth of nations as presenting incompatible views of human nature some smith scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation otteson argues that both books are newtonian in their methodology and deploy a similar market model for explaining the creation and development of largescale human social orders including morality economics as well as language ekelund and hebert offer a differing view observing that selfinterest is present in both works and that in the former sympathy is the moral faculty that holds selfinterest in check whereas in the latter competition is the economic faculty that restrains selfinterest the wealth of nationsedit main article the wealth of nations later building on the site where smith wrote the wealth of nations there is disagreement between classical and neoclassical economists about the central message of smiths most influential work an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations  neoclassical economists emphasise smiths invisible hand a concept mentioned in the middle of his work – book iv chapter ii – and classical economists believe that smith stated his programme for promoting the wealth of nations in the first sentences which attributes the growth of wealth and prosperity to the division of labour smith used the term the invisible hand in history of astronomy referring to the invisible hand of jupiter and once in each of his the theory of moral sentiments  and the wealth of nations  this last statement about an invisible hand has been interpreted in numerous ways as every individual therefore endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can he generally indeed neither intends to promote the public interest nor knows how much he is promoting it by preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry he intends only his own security and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value he intends only his own gain and he is in this as in many other cases led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it by pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it i have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good it is an affectation indeed not very common among merchants and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it those who regard that statement as smiths central message also quote frequently smiths dictum it is not from the benevolence of the butcher the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner but from their regard to their own interest we address ourselves not to their humanity but to their selflove and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages the first page of the wealth of nations  london edition smiths statement about the benefits of an invisible hand may be meant to answercitation needed mandevilles contention that private vices … may be turned into public benefits it shows smiths belief that when an individual pursues his selfinterest under conditions of justice he unintentionally promotes the good of society selfinterested competition in the free market he argued would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services nevertheless he was wary of businessmen and warned of their conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices again and again smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests which may form cabals or monopolies fixing the highest price which can be squeezed out of the buyers smith also warned that a businessdominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants in any particular branch of trade or manufactures is always in some respects different from and even opposite to that of the publicthe proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order ought always to be listened to with great precaution and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined not only with the most scrupulous but with the most suspicious attention thus smiths chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government by contrast in the absence of such special political favours he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society it is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts in consequence of the division of labour which occasions in a wellgoverned society that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for and every other workman being exactly in the same situation he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity or what comes to the same thing for the price of a great quantity of theirs he supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society the wealth of nations ii the neoclassical interest in smiths statement about an invisible hand originates in the possibility to see it as a precursor of neoclassical economics and its general equilibrium concept samuelsons economics refers  times to smiths invisible hand to emphasise this relation samuelson quotes smiths invisible hand statement putting general interest where smith wrote public interest samuelson concluded smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisiblehand doctrine indeed until the s no one knew how to prove even to state properly the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market very differently classical economists see in smiths first sentences his programme to promote the wealth of nations taking up the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process means that to have growth the inputs of period must excel the inputs of period therefore the outputs of period not used or usable as input of period are regarded as unproductive labour as they do not contribute to growth this is what smith had heard in france from among others quesnay to this french insight that unproductive labour should be pushed back to use labour more productively smith added his own proposal that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the division of labour smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living—general plenty and universal opulence—for all extended markets and increased production lead to continuous reorganisation of production and inventing new ways of producing which lead to further increased production lower prices and increased standards of living smiths central message is therefore that under dynamic competition a growth machine secures the wealth of nations smiths argument predicted britains evolution as the workshop of the world underselling and outproducing all its competitors the opening sentences of the wealth of nations summarise this policy the annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes …  this produce … bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it … but this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances first by the skill dexterity and judgment with which its labour is generally applied and secondly by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour and that of those who are not so employed emphasis added smith added however that the abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter criticism and dissentedit alfred marshall criticised smiths definition of economy on several points he argued that man should be equally important as money services are as important as goods and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare instead of just wealth the invisible hand only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets with small atomistic producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate in conditions of monopoly and oligopoly the invisible hand fails nobel prizewinning economist joseph e stiglitz says on the topic of one of smiths better known ideas the reason that the invisible hand often seems invisible is that it is often not there other worksedit smiths burial place in canongate kirkyard shortly before his death smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed in his last years he seemed to have been planning two major treatises one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts the posthumously published essays on philosophical subjects a history of astronomy down to smiths own era plus some thoughts on ancient physics and metaphysics probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise lectures on jurisprudence were notes taken from smiths early lectures plus an early draft of the wealth of nations published as part of the  glasgow edition of the works and correspondence of smith other works including some published posthumously include lectures on justice police revenue and arms  first published in  and essays on philosophical subjects  legacyedit in economics and moral philosophyedit the wealth of nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics in this and other works smith expounded how rational selfinterest and competition can lead to economic prosperity smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by tory writers in the moralising tradition of hogarth and swift as a discussion at the university of winchester suggests in  the wealth of nations was named among the  best scottish books of all time former uk prime minister margaret thatcher it is said used to carry a copy of the book in her handbag in light of the arguments put forward by smith and other economic theorists in britain academic belief in mercantilism began to decline in britain in the late th century during the industrial revolution britain embraced free trade and smiths laissezfaire economics and via the british empire used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world characterised by open markets and relatively barrier free domestic and international trade george stigler attributes to smith the most important substantive proposition in all of economics it is that under competition owners of resources for example labour land and capital will use them most profitably resulting in an equal rate of return in equilibrium for all uses adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training trust hardship and unemployment paul samuelson finds in smiths pluralist use of supply and demand as applied to wages rents and profit a valid and valuable anticipation of the general equilibrium modelling of walras a century later smiths allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention contrasted with malthus ricardo and karl marx in their propounding a rigid subsistence–wage theory of labour supply joseph schumpeter criticised smith for a lack of technical rigor yet he argued that this enabled smiths writings to appeal to wider audiences his very limitation made for success had he been more brilliant he would not have been taken so seriously had he dug more deeply had he unearthed more recondite truth had he used more difficult and ingenious methods he would not have been understood but he had no such ambitions in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense he never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers he led them on gently encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations making them feel comfortable all along classical economists presented competing theories of those of smith termed the labour theory of value later marxian economics descending from classical economics also use smiths labour theories in part the first volume of karl marxs major work capital was published in german in  in it marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital the labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production this contrasts with the modern contention of neoclassical economics that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing the adam smith theatre in kirkcaldy the body of theory later termed neoclassical economics or marginalism formed from about  to  the term economics was popularised by such neoclassical economists as alfred marshall as a concise synonym for economic science and a substitute for the earlier broader term political economy used by smith this corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the natural sciences neoclassical economics systematised supply and demand as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income it dispensed with the labour theory of value of which smith was most famously identified with in classical economics in favour of a marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side the bicentennial anniversary of the publication of the wealth of nations was celebrated in  resulting in increased interest for the theory of moral sentiments and his other works throughout academia after  smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both the wealth of nations and the theory of moral sentiments and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics his homo economicus or economic man was also more often represented as a moral person additionally economists david levy and sandra peart in the secret history of the dismal science point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality including racial inequality and provide additional support for those who point to smiths opposition to slavery colonialism and empire they show the caricatures of smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article emphasised also are smiths statements of the need for high wages for the poor and the efforts to keep wages low in the vanity of the philosopher from equality to hierarchy in postclassical economics peart and levy also cite smiths view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical they also cite smiths opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense smith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions but avarice and ambition in the rich in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment are the passions which prompt to invade property passions much more steady in their operation and much more universal in their influence wherever there is great property there is great inequality for one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many the affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor who are often both driven by want and prompted by envy to invade his possessions it is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property which is acquired by the labour of many years or perhaps of many successive generations can sleep a single night in security he is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies whom though he never provoked he can never appease and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it the acquisition of valuable and extensive property therefore necessarily requires the establishment of civil government where there is no property or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days labour civil government is not so necessary civil government supposes a certain subordination but as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property … men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs all the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them they constitute a sort of little nobility who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority civil government so far as it is instituted for the security of property is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor or of those who have some property against those who have none at all source the wealth of nations book  chapter  part  in british imperial debatesedit smiths chapter on colonies in turn would help shape british imperial debates from the midnineteenth century onward the wealth of nations would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question in his chapter on colonies smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the atlantic among the empires thirteen american colonies he offered two different proposals for easing tensions the first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence and by thus parting on a friendly basis britain would be able to develop and maintain a freetrade relationship with them and possibly even an informal military alliance smiths second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade smiths most prominent disciple in nineteenthcentury britain peace advocate richard cobden preferred the first proposal cobden would lead the anticorn law league in overturning the corn laws in  shifting britain to a policy of free trade and empire on the cheap for decades to come this handsoff approach toward the british empire would become known as cobdenism or the manchester school by the turn of the century however advocates of smiths second proposal such as joseph shield nicholson would become ever more vocal in opposing cobdenism calling instead for imperial federation as marcwilliam palen notes on the one hand adam smith’s late nineteenth and early twentiethcentury cobdenite adherents used his theories to argue for gradual imperial devolution and empire ‘on the cheap’ on the other various proponents of imperial federation throughout the british world sought to use smith’s theories to overturn the predominant cobdenite handsoff imperial approach and instead with a firm grip bring the empire closer than ever before smiths ideas thus played an important part in subsequent debates over the british empire portraits monuments and banknotesedit a statue of smith in edinburghs high street erected through private donations organised by the adam smith institute smith has been commemorated in the uk on banknotes printed by two different banks his portrait has appeared since  on the £ notes issued by the clydesdale bank in scotland and in march  smiths image also appeared on the new series of £ notes issued by the bank of england making him the first scotsman to feature on an english banknote statue of smith built in – at the old headquarters of the university of london  burlington gardens a largescale memorial of smith by alexander stoddart was unveiled on  july  in edinburgh it is a  feet  mtall bronze sculpture and it stands above the royal mile outside st giles cathedral in parliament square near the mercat cross thcentury sculptor jim sanborn best known for the kryptos sculpture at the united states central intelligence agency has created multiple pieces which feature smiths work at central connecticut state university is circulating capital a tall cylinder which features an extract from the wealth of nations on the lower half and on the upper half some of the same text but represented in binary code at the university of north carolina at charlotte outside the belk college of business administration is adam smiths spinning top another smith sculpture is at cleveland state university he also appears as the narrator in the  play the low road centred on a proponent on laissezfaire economics in the late eighteenth century but dealing obliquely with the financial crisis of – and the recession which followed—in the premiere production he was portrayed by bill paterson a bust of smith is in the hall of heroes of the national wallace monument in stirling residenceedit adam smith resided at panmure house from – this residence has now been purchased by the edinburgh business school at heriot watt university and fundraising has begun to restore it part of the northern end of the original building appears to have been demolished in the th century to make way for an iron foundry as a symbol of free market economicsedit adam smiths spinning top sculpture by jim sanborn at cleveland state university smith has been celebrated by advocates of free market policies as the founder of free market economics a view reflected in the naming of bodies such as the adam smith institute in london the adam smith society and the australian adam smith club and in terms such as the adam smith necktie alan greenspan argues that while smith did not coin the term laissezfaire it was left to adam smith to identify the moregeneral set of principles that brought conceptual clarity to the seeming chaos of market transactions greenspan continues that the wealth of nations was one of the great achievements in human intellectual history p j orourke describes smith as the founder of free market economics other writers have argued that smiths support for laissezfaire which in french means leave alone has been overstated herbert stein wrote that the people who wear an adam smith necktie do it to make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and limited government and that this misrepresents smiths ideas stein writes that smith was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea he viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticismyet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system he did not wear the adam smith necktie in steins reading the wealth of nations could justify the food and drug administration the consumer product safety commission mandatory employer health benefits environmentalism and discriminatory taxation to deter improper or luxurious behavior similarly vivienne brown stated in the economic journal that in the th century united states reaganomics supporters the wall street journal and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of smith portraying him as an extreme dogmatic defender of laissezfaire capitalism and supplyside economics in fact the wealth of nations includes the following statement on the payment of taxes the subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state some commentators have argued that smiths works show support for a progressive not flat income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state among them luxury goods taxes and tax on rent yet smith argued for the impossibility of taxing the people in proportion to their economic revenue by any capitation the wealth of nations viik smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting justice and certain publick institutions that were necessary for the benefit of all of society but that could not be provided by private enterprise the wealth of nations ivix additionally smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in the wealth of nations book v ch i included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system grant patents and copy rights provide public goods such as infrastructure provide national defence and regulate banking it was the role of the government to provide goods of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual such as roads bridges canals and harbours he also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies he supported partial public subsidies for elementary education and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society in such cases however smith argued for local rather than centralised control even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves    are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue under the management of a local and provincial administration than by the general revenue of the state wealth of nations vid finally he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate such that they are equal or above the public in fashion he even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansionhouse of a doge in addition he allowed that in some specific circumstances retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial the recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods he added however that in general a retaliatory tariff seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people to do another injury ourselves not only to those classes but to almost all the other classes of them the wealth of nations ivii economic historians such as jacob viner regard smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government what smith called natural liberty but not as a dogmatic supporter of laissezfaire economist daniel klein believes using the term free market economics or free market economist to identify the ideas of smith is too general and slightly misleading klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of smiths economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the smithian identity economist david ricardo set straight some of the misunderstandings about smiths thoughts on free market most people still fall victim to the thinking that smith was a free market economist without exception though he was not ricardo pointed out that smith was in support of helping infant industries smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood it would be unwilling to surrender the government help smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence some have also claimed emma rothschild among them that smith would have supported a minimum wage although there is no direct textual evidence supporting the claim indeed smith wrote the price of labour it must be observed cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour not only according to the different abilities of the workmen but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters where wages are not regulated by law all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly though it has often pretended to do so the wealth of nations book  chapter  smith also noted a rough equality of bargaining power a landlord a farmer a master manufacturer a merchant though they did not employ a single workman could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired many workmen could not subsist a week few could subsist a month and scarce any a year without employment in the long run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him but the necessity is not so immediate see alsoedit organizational capital list of abolitionist forerunners list of fellows of the royal society of arts notesedit  in life of adam

smith frsa  june  ns  june  os –  july  was a scottish economist philosopher and author he was a moral philosopher a pioneer of political economy and was a key figure during the scottish enlightenment era he is best known for two classic works the theory of moral sentiments  and an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations  the latter usually abbreviated as the wealth of nations is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics smith studied social philosophy at the university of glasgow and at balliol college oxford where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow scot john snell after graduating he delivered a successful series of public lectures at edinburgh leading him to collaborate with david hume during the scottish enlightenment smith obtained a professorship at glasgow teaching moral philosophy and during this time he wrote and published the theory of moral sentiments in his later life he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout europe where he met other intellectual leaders of his day smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory the wealth of nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics in this and other works he developed the concept of division of labour and expounded upon how rational selfinterest and competition can lead to economic prosperity smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by tory writers in the moralising tradition of

father also adam smith was a scottish writer to the signet senior solicitor advocate and prosecutor judge advocate and also served as comptroller of the customs in kirkcaldy in  he married margaret douglas daughter of the landed robert douglas of strathendry also in fife his father died two months after he was born leaving his mother a widow the date of smiths baptism into the church of scotland at kirkcaldy was  june  and this has often been treated as if it were also his date of birth which is unknown although few events in smiths early childhood are known the scottish journalist john rae smiths biographer recorded that smith was abducted by gypsies at the age of three and released when others went to rescue himn  smith was close to his mother who probably encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions he attended the burgh school of kirkcaldy—characterised by rae as one of the best secondary schools of scotland at that period—from  to  he learned latin mathematics history and writing formal educationedit a commemorative plaque for smith is located in smiths home town of kirkcaldy smith entered the university of glasgow when he was fourteen and studied moral philosophy under francis hutcheson here smith developed his passion for liberty reason and free speech in  smith was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at balliol college oxford under the snell exhibition adam smith considered the teaching at glasgow to be far superior to that at oxford which he found intellectually stifling in book v chapter ii of the wealth of nations smith wrote in the university of oxford the greater part of the public professors have for these many years given up altogether even the pretence of teaching smith is also reported to have complained to friends that oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of david humes treatise on human nature and they subsequently confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it according to william robert scott the oxford of smiths time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework nevertheless smith took the opportunity while at oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large bodleian library when smith was not studying on his own his time at oxford was not a happy one according to his letters near the end of his time there smith began suffering from shaking fits probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown he left oxford university in  before his scholarship ended in book v of the wealth of nations smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at english universities when compared to their scottish counterparts he attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at oxford and cambridge which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students and to the fact that distinguished men of letters could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the church of england adam smiths discontent at oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in glasgow francis hutcheson hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the university of glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students colleagues and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations which he sometimes opened to the public his lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy but to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives appropriately acquiring the epithet the preacher of philosophy unlike smith hutcheson was not a system builder rather it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as the never to be forgotten hutcheson—a title that smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people his good friend david hume and influential mentor francis hutcheson teaching careeredit smith began delivering public lectures in  in edinburgh sponsored by the philosophical society of edinburgh under the patronage of lord kames his lecture topics included rhetoric and belleslettres and later the subject of the progress of opulence on this latter topic he first expounded his economic philosophy of the obvious and simple system of natural liberty while smith was not adept at public speaking his lectures met with success david hume was a friend and contemporary of smith in  he met the philosopher david hume who was his senior by more than a decade in their writings covering history politics philosophy economics and religion smith and hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the scottish enlightenment in  smith earned a professorship at glasgow university teaching logic courses and in  he was elected a member of the philosophical society of edinburgh having been introduced to the society by lord kames when the head of moral philosophy in glasgow died the next year smith took over the position he worked as an academic for the next thirteen years which he characterised as by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period of his life smith published the theory of moral sentiments in  embodying some of his glasgow lectures this work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator or the individual and other members of society smith defined mutual sympathy as the basis of moral sentiments he based his explanation not on a special moral sense as the third lord shaftesbury and hutcheson had done nor on utility as hume did but on mutual sympathy a term best captured in modern parlance by the twentiethcentury concept of empathy the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being following the publication of the theory of moral sentiments smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at glasgow to learn under smith after the publication of the theory of moral sentiments smith began to give more attention to jurisprudence and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals for example smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour rather than the nations quantity of gold or silver which is the basis for mercantilism the economic theory that dominated western european economic policies at the time françois quesnay one of the leaders of the physiocratic school of thought in  the university of glasgow conferred on smith the title of doctor of laws lld at the end of  he obtained an offer from charles townshend—who had been introduced to smith by david hume—to tutor his stepson henry scott the young duke of buccleuch smith then resigned from his professorship to take the tutoring position he subsequently attempted to return the fees he had collected from his students because he resigned in the middle of the term but his students refused tutoring and travelsedit smiths tutoring job entailed touring europe with scott during which time he educated scott on a variety of subjects—such as proper polish he was paid £ per year plus expenses along with a £ per year pension roughly twice his former income as a teacher smith first travelled as a tutor to toulouse france where he stayed for one and a half years according to his own account he found toulouse to be somewhat boring having written to hume that he had begun to write a book to pass away the time after touring the south of france the group moved to geneva where smith met with the philosopher voltaire from geneva the party moved to paris here smith came to know several great intellectual leaders of the time invariably having an effect on his future works this list included benjamin franklin turgot jean dalembert andré morellet helvétius and notably françois quesnay the head of the physiocratic school so impressed with his ideas smith considered dedicating the wealth of nations to him had quesnay not died beforehand physiocrats were opposed to mercantilism the dominating economic theory of the time illustrated in their motto laissez faire et laissez passer le monde va de lui même let do and let pass the world goes on by itself they were also known to have declared that only agricultural activity produced real wealth merchants and industrialists manufacturers did not this however did not represent their true school of thought but was a mere smoke screen manufactured to hide their actual criticisms of the nobility and church arguing that they made up the only real clients of merchants the wealth of france was virtually destroyed by louis xiv and louis xv in ruinous wars by aiding the american insurgents against the british and perhaps most destructive in terms of public perceptions was what was seen as the excessive consumption of goods and services deemed to have no economic contribution—unproductive labour assuming that nobility and church are essentially detractors from economic growth the feudal system of agriculture in france was the only sector important to maintain the wealth of the nation given that the english economy of the day yielded an income distribution that stood in contrast to that which existed in france smith concluded that the teachings and beliefs of physiocrats were with all their imperfections perhaps the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy the distinction between productive versus unproductive labour—the physiocratic classe steril—was a predominant issue in the development and understanding of what would become classical economic theory later yearsedit in  henry scotts younger brother died in paris and smiths tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter smith returned home that year to kirkcaldy and he devoted much of the next ten years to his magnum opus there he befriended henry moyes a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude as well as teaching moyes smith secured the patronage of david hume and thomas reid in the young mans education in may  smith was elected fellow of the royal society of london and was elected a member of the literary club in  the wealth of nations was published in  and was an instant success selling out its first edition in only six months in  smith was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in scotland and went to live with his mother in panmure house in edinburghs canongate five years later as a member of the philosophical society of edinburgh when it received its royal charter he automatically became one of the founding members of the royal society of edinburgh and from  to  he occupied the honorary position of lord rector of the university of glasgow he died in the northern wing of panmure house in edinburgh on  july  after a painful illness and was buried in the canongate kirkyard on his death bed smith expressed disappointment that he had not achieved more smiths literary executors were two friends from the scottish academic world the physicist and chemist joseph black and the pioneering geologist james hutton smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication he mentioned an early unpublished history of astronomy as probably suitable and it duly appeared in  along with other material such as essays on philosophical subjects smiths library went by his will to david douglas lord reston son of his cousin colonel robert douglas of strathendry fife who lived with smith it was eventually divided between his two surviving children cecilia margaret mrs cunningham and david anne mrs bannerman on the death of her husband the reverend w b cunningham of prestonpans in  mrs cunningham sold some of the books the remainder passed to her son professor robert oliver cunningham of queens college belfast who presented a part to the library of queens college after his death the remaining books were sold on the death of mrs bannerman in  her portion of the library went intact to the new college of the free church edinburgh personality and beliefsedit characteredit james tassies enamel paste medallion of smith provided the model for many engravings and portraits that remain today not much is known about smiths personal views beyond what can be deduced from his published articles his personal papers were destroyed after his death at his request he never married and seems to have maintained a close relationship with his mother whom he lived with after his return from france and who died six years before his own death smith was described by several of his contemporaries and biographers as comically absentminded with peculiar habits of speech and gait and a smile of inexpressible benignity he was known to talk to himself a habit that began during his childhood when he would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions he also had occasional spells of imaginary illness and he is reported to have had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study according to one story smith took charles townshend on a tour of a tanning factory and while discussing free trade smith walked into a huge tanning pit from which he needed help to escape he is also said to have put bread and butter into a teapot drunk the concoction and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had according to another account smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up  miles  km outside of town before nearby church bells brought him back to reality james boswell who was a student of smiths at glasgow university and later knew him at the literary club says that smith thought that speaking about his ideas in conversation might reduce the sale of his books and so his conversation was unimpressive according to boswell he once told sir joshua reynolds that he made it a rule when in company never to talk of what he understood portrait of smith by john kay  smith has been alternately described as someone who had a large nose bulging eyes a protruding lower lip a nervous twitch and a speech impediment and one whose countenance was manly and agreeable smith is said to have acknowledged his looks at one point saying i am a beau in nothing but my books smith rarely sat for portraits so almost all depictions of him created during his lifetime were drawn from memory the bestknown portraits of smith are the profile by james tassie and two etchings by john kay the line engravings produced for the covers of th century reprints of the wealth of nations were based largely on tassies medallion religious viewsedit there has been considerable scholarly debate about the nature of smiths religious views smiths father had shown a strong interest in christianity and belonged to the moderate wing of the church of scotland the fact that adam smith received the snell exhibition suggests that he may have gone to oxford with the intention of pursuing a career in the church of england angloamerican economist ronald coase has challenged the view that smith was a deist based on the fact that smiths writings never explicitly invoke god as an explanation of the harmonies of the natural or the human worlds according to coase though smith does sometimes refer to the great architect of the universe later scholars such as jacob viner have very much exaggerated the extent to which adam smith was committed to a belief in a personal god a belief for which coase finds little evidence in passages such as the one in the wealth of nations in which smith writes that the curiosity of mankind about the great phenomena of nature such as the generation the life growth and dissolution of plants and animals has led men to enquire into their causes and that superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them from more familiar causes or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods some other authors argue that smiths social and economic philosophy is inherently theological and that his entire model of social order is logically dependent on the notion of gods action in nature smith was also a close friend and later the executor of david hume who was commonly characterised in his own time as an atheist the publication in  of smiths letter to william strahan in which he described humes courage in the face of death in spite of his irreligiosity attracted considerable controversy published worksedit the theory of moral sentimentsedit main article the theory of moral sentiments  printing of an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations in  smith published his first work the theory of moral sentiments sold by copublishers andrew millar of london and alexander kincaid of edinburgh smith continued making extensive revisions to the book up until his deathn  although the wealth of nations is widely regarded as smiths most influential work it is believed that smith himself considered the theory of moral sentiments to be a superior work in the work smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time and suggests that conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek mutual sympathy of sentiments his goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankinds ability to form moral judgement given that people begin life with no moral sentiments at all smith proposes a theory of sympathy in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behavior the feedback we receive from perceiving or imagining others judgements creates an incentive to achieve mutual sympathy of sentiments with them and leads people to develop habits and then principles of behavior which come to constitute ones conscience some scholars have perceived a conflict between the theory of moral sentiments and the wealth of nations the former emphasises sympathy for others while the latter focuses on the role of selfinterest in recent years however some scholars of smiths work have argued that no contradiction exists they claim that in the theory of moral sentiments smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the impartial spectator as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathise with their sentiments rather than viewing the theory of moral sentiments and the wealth of nations as presenting incompatible views of human nature some smith scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation otteson argues that both books are newtonian in their methodology and deploy a similar market model for explaining the creation and development of largescale human social orders including morality economics as well as language ekelund and hebert offer a differing view observing that selfinterest is present in both works and that in the former sympathy is the moral faculty that holds selfinterest in check whereas in the latter competition is the economic faculty that restrains selfinterest the wealth of nationsedit main article the wealth of nations later building on the site where smith wrote the wealth of nations there is disagreement between classical and neoclassical economists about the central message of smiths most influential work an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations  neoclassical economists emphasise smiths invisible hand a concept mentioned in the middle of his work – book iv chapter ii – and classical economists believe that smith stated his programme for promoting the wealth of nations in the first sentences which attributes the growth of wealth and prosperity to the division of labour smith used the term the invisible hand in history of astronomy referring to the invisible hand of jupiter and once in each of his the theory of moral sentiments  and the wealth of nations  this last statement about an invisible hand has been interpreted in numerous ways as every individual therefore endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can he generally indeed neither intends to promote the public interest nor knows how much he is promoting it by preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry he intends only his own security and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value he intends only his own gain and he is in this as in many other cases led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it by pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it i have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good it is an affectation indeed not very common among merchants and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it those who regard that statement as smiths central message also quote frequently smiths dictum it is not from the benevolence of the butcher the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner but from their regard to their own interest we address ourselves not to their humanity but to their selflove and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages the first page of the wealth of nations  london edition smiths statement about the benefits of an invisible hand may be meant to answercitation needed mandevilles contention that private vices … may be turned into public benefits it shows smiths belief that when an individual pursues his selfinterest under conditions of justice he unintentionally promotes the good of society selfinterested competition in the free market he argued would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services nevertheless he was wary of businessmen and warned of their conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices again and again smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests which may form cabals or monopolies fixing the highest price which can be squeezed out of the buyers smith also warned that a businessdominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants in any particular branch of trade or manufactures is always in some respects different from and even opposite to that of the publicthe proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order ought always to be listened to with great precaution and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined not only with the most scrupulous but with the most suspicious attention thus smiths chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government by contrast in the absence of such special political favours he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society it is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts in consequence of the division of labour which occasions in a wellgoverned society that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for and every other workman being exactly in the same situation he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity or what comes to the same thing for the price of a great quantity of theirs he supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society the wealth of nations ii the neoclassical interest in smiths statement about an invisible hand originates in the possibility to see it as a precursor of neoclassical economics and its general equilibrium concept samuelsons economics refers  times to smiths invisible hand to emphasise this relation samuelson quotes smiths invisible hand statement putting general interest where smith wrote public interest samuelson concluded smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisiblehand doctrine indeed until the s no one knew how to prove even to state properly the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market very differently classical economists see in smiths first sentences his programme to promote the wealth of nations taking up the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process means that to have growth the inputs of period must excel the inputs of period therefore the outputs of period not used or usable as input of period are regarded as unproductive labour as they do not contribute to growth this is what smith had heard in france from among others quesnay to this french insight that unproductive labour should be pushed back to use labour more productively smith added his own proposal that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the division of labour smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living—general plenty and universal opulence—for all extended markets and increased production lead to continuous reorganisation of production and inventing new ways of producing which lead to further increased production lower prices and increased standards of living smiths central message is therefore that under dynamic competition a growth machine secures the wealth of nations smiths argument predicted britains evolution as the workshop of the world underselling and outproducing all its competitors the opening sentences of the wealth of nations summarise this policy the annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes …  this produce … bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it … but this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances first by the skill dexterity and judgment with which its labour is generally applied and secondly by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour and that of those who are not so employed emphasis added smith added however that the abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter criticism and dissentedit alfred marshall criticised smiths definition of economy on several points he argued that man should be equally important as money services are as important as goods and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare instead of just wealth the invisible hand only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets with small atomistic producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate in conditions of monopoly and oligopoly the invisible hand fails nobel prizewinning economist joseph e stiglitz says on the topic of one of smiths better known ideas the reason that the invisible hand often seems invisible is that it is often not there other worksedit smiths burial place in canongate kirkyard shortly before his death smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed in his last years he seemed to have been planning two major treatises one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts the posthumously published essays on philosophical subjects a history of astronomy down to smiths own era plus some thoughts on ancient physics and metaphysics probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise lectures on jurisprudence were notes taken from smiths early lectures plus an early draft of the wealth of nations published as part of the  glasgow edition of the works and correspondence of smith other works including some published posthumously include lectures on justice police revenue and arms  first published in  and essays on philosophical subjects  legacyedit in economics and moral philosophyedit the wealth of nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics in this and other works smith expounded how rational selfinterest and competition can lead to economic prosperity smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by tory writers in the moralising tradition of hogarth and swift as a discussion at the university of winchester suggests in  the wealth of nations was named among the  best scottish books of all time former uk prime minister margaret thatcher it is said used to carry a copy of the book in her handbag in light of the arguments put forward by smith and other economic theorists in britain academic belief in mercantilism began to decline in britain in the late th century during the industrial revolution britain embraced free trade and smiths laissezfaire economics and via the british empire used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world characterised by open markets and relatively barrier free domestic and international trade george stigler attributes to smith the most important substantive proposition in all of economics it is that under competition owners of resources for example labour land and capital will use them most profitably resulting in an equal rate of return in equilibrium for all uses adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training trust hardship and unemployment paul samuelson finds in smiths pluralist use of supply and demand as applied to wages rents and profit a valid and valuable anticipation of the general equilibrium modelling of walras a century later smiths allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention contrasted with malthus ricardo and karl marx in their propounding a rigid subsistence–wage theory of labour supply joseph schumpeter criticised smith for a lack of technical rigor yet he argued that this enabled smiths writings to appeal to wider audiences his very limitation made for success had he been more brilliant he would not have been taken so seriously had he dug more deeply had he unearthed more recondite truth had he used more difficult and ingenious methods he would not have been understood but he had no such ambitions in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense he never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers he led them on gently encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations making them feel comfortable all along classical economists presented competing theories of those of smith termed the labour theory of value later marxian economics descending from classical economics also use smiths labour theories in part the first volume of karl marxs major work capital was published in german in  in it marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital the labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production this contrasts with the modern contention of neoclassical economics that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing the adam smith theatre in kirkcaldy the body of theory later termed neoclassical economics or marginalism formed from about  to  the term economics was popularised by such neoclassical economists as alfred marshall as a concise synonym for economic science and a substitute for the earlier broader term political economy used by smith this corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the natural sciences neoclassical economics systematised supply and demand as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income it dispensed with the labour theory of value of which smith was most famously identified with in classical economics in favour of a marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side the bicentennial anniversary of the publication of the wealth of nations was celebrated in  resulting in increased interest for the theory of moral sentiments and his other works throughout academia after  smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both the wealth of nations and the theory of moral sentiments and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics his homo economicus or economic man was also more often represented as a moral person additionally economists david levy and sandra peart in the secret history of the dismal science point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality including racial inequality and provide additional support for those who point to smiths opposition to slavery colonialism and empire they show the caricatures of smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article emphasised also are smiths statements of the need for high wages for the poor and the efforts to keep wages low in the vanity of the philosopher from equality to hierarchy in postclassical economics peart and levy also cite smiths view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical they also cite smiths opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense smith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions but avarice and ambition in the rich in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment are the passions which prompt to invade property passions much more steady in their operation and much more universal in their influence wherever there is great property there is great inequality for one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many the affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor who are often both driven by want and prompted by envy to invade his possessions it is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property which is acquired by the labour of many years or perhaps of many successive generations can sleep a single night in security he is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies whom though he never provoked he can never appease and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it the acquisition of valuable and extensive property therefore necessarily requires the establishment of civil government where there is no property or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days labour civil government is not so necessary civil government supposes a certain subordination but as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property … men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs all the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them they constitute a sort of little nobility who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority civil government so far as it is instituted for the security of property is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor or of those who have some property against those who have none at all source the wealth of nations book  chapter  part  in british imperial debatesedit smiths chapter on colonies in turn would help shape british imperial debates from the midnineteenth century onward the wealth of nations would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question in his chapter on colonies smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the atlantic among the empires thirteen american colonies he offered two different proposals for easing tensions the first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence and by thus parting on a friendly basis britain would be able to develop and maintain a freetrade relationship with them and possibly even an informal military alliance smiths second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade smiths most prominent disciple in nineteenthcentury britain peace advocate richard cobden preferred the first proposal cobden would lead the anticorn law league in overturning the corn laws in  shifting britain to a policy of free trade and empire on the cheap for decades to come this handsoff approach toward the british empire would become known as cobdenism or the manchester school by the turn of the century however advocates of smiths second proposal such as joseph shield nicholson would become ever more vocal in opposing cobdenism calling instead for imperial federation as marcwilliam palen notes on the one hand adam smith’s late nineteenth and early twentiethcentury cobdenite adherents used his theories to argue for gradual imperial devolution and empire ‘on the cheap’ on the other various proponents of imperial federation throughout the british world sought to use smith’s theories to overturn the predominant cobdenite handsoff imperial approach and instead with a firm grip bring the empire closer than ever before smiths ideas thus played an important part in subsequent debates over the british empire portraits monuments and banknotesedit a statue of smith in edinburghs high street erected through private donations organised by the adam smith institute smith has been commemorated in the uk on banknotes printed by two different banks his portrait has appeared since  on the £ notes issued by the clydesdale bank in scotland and in march  smiths image also appeared on the new series of £ notes issued by the bank of england making him the first scotsman to feature on an english banknote statue of smith built in – at the old headquarters of the university of london  burlington gardens a largescale memorial of smith by alexander stoddart was unveiled on  july  in edinburgh it is a  feet  mtall bronze sculpture and it stands above the royal mile outside st giles cathedral in parliament square near the mercat cross thcentury sculptor jim sanborn best known for the kryptos sculpture at the united states central intelligence agency has created multiple pieces which feature smiths work at central connecticut state university is circulating capital a tall cylinder which features an extract from the wealth of nations on the lower half and on the upper half some of the same text but represented in binary code at the university of north carolina at charlotte outside the belk college of business administration is adam smiths spinning top another smith sculpture is at cleveland state university he also appears as the narrator in the  play the low road centred on a proponent on laissezfaire economics in the late eighteenth century but dealing obliquely with the financial crisis of – and the recession which followed—in the premiere production he was portrayed by bill paterson a bust of smith is in the hall of heroes of the national wallace monument in stirling residenceedit adam smith resided at panmure house from – this residence has now been purchased by the edinburgh business school at heriot watt university and fundraising has begun to restore it part of the northern end of the original building appears to have been demolished in the th century to make way for an iron foundry as a symbol of free market economicsedit adam smiths spinning top sculpture by jim sanborn at cleveland state university smith has been celebrated by advocates of free market policies as the founder of free market economics a view reflected in the naming of bodies such as the adam smith institute in london the adam smith society and the australian adam smith club and in terms such as the adam smith necktie alan greenspan argues that while smith did not coin the term laissezfaire it was left to adam smith to identify the moregeneral set of principles that brought conceptual clarity to the seeming chaos of market transactions greenspan continues that the wealth of nations was one of the great achievements in human intellectual history p j orourke describes smith as the founder of free market economics other writers have argued that smiths support for laissezfaire which in french means leave alone has been overstated herbert stein wrote that the people who wear an adam smith necktie do it to make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and limited government and that this misrepresents smiths ideas stein writes that smith was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea he viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticismyet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system he did not wear the adam smith necktie in steins reading the wealth of nations could justify the food and drug administration the consumer product safety commission mandatory employer health benefits environmentalism and discriminatory taxation to deter improper or luxurious behavior similarly vivienne brown stated in the economic journal that in the th century united states reaganomics supporters the wall street journal and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of smith portraying him as an extreme dogmatic defender of laissezfaire capitalism and supplyside economics in fact the wealth of nations includes the following statement on the payment of taxes the subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state some commentators have argued that smiths works show support for a progressive not flat income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state among them luxury goods taxes and tax on rent yet smith argued for the impossibility of taxing the people in proportion to their economic revenue by any capitation the wealth of nations viik smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting justice and certain publick institutions that were necessary for the benefit of all of society but that could not be provided by private enterprise the wealth of nations ivix additionally smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in the wealth of nations book v ch i included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system grant patents and copy rights provide public goods such as infrastructure provide national defence and regulate banking it was the role of the government to provide goods of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual such as roads bridges canals and harbours he also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies he supported partial public subsidies for elementary education and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society in such cases however smith argued for local rather than centralised control even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves    are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue under the management of a local and provincial administration than by the general revenue of the state wealth of nations vid finally he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate such that they are equal or above the public in fashion he even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansionhouse of a doge in addition he allowed that in some specific circumstances retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial the recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods he added however that in general a retaliatory tariff seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people to do another injury ourselves not only to those classes but to almost all the other classes of them the wealth of nations ivii economic historians such as jacob viner regard smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government what smith called natural liberty but not as a dogmatic supporter of laissezfaire economist daniel klein believes using the term free market economics or free market economist to identify the ideas of smith is too general and slightly misleading klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of smiths economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the smithian identity economist david ricardo set straight some of the misunderstandings about smiths thoughts on free market most people still fall victim to the thinking that smith was a free market economist without exception though he was not ricardo pointed out that smith was in support of helping infant industries smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood it would be unwilling to surrender the government help smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence some have also claimed emma rothschild among them that smith would have supported a minimum wage although there is no direct textual evidence supporting the claim indeed smith wrote the price of labour it must be observed cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour not only according to the different abilities of the workmen but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters where wages are not regulated by law all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly though it has often pretended to do so the wealth of nations book  chapter  smith also noted a rough equality of bargaining power a landlord a farmer a master manufacturer a merchant though they did not employ a single workman could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired many workmen could not subsist a week few could subsist a month and scarce any a year without employment in the long run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him but the necessity is not so immediate see alsoedit organizational capital list of abolitionist forerunners list of fellows of the royal society of arts notesedit  in life of adam smith rae writes in his fourth year while on a visit to his grandfathers house at strathendry on the banks of the leven smith was stolen by a passing band of gypsies and for a time could not be found

smith frsa  june  ns  june  os –  july  was a scottish economist philosopher and author he was a moral philosopher a pioneer of political economy and was a key figure during the scottish enlightenment era he is best known for two classic works the theory of moral sentiments  and an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations  the latter usually abbreviated as the wealth of nations is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics smith studied social philosophy at the university of glasgow and at balliol college oxford where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow scot john snell after graduating he delivered a successful series of public lectures at edinburgh leading him to collaborate with david hume during the scottish enlightenment smith obtained a professorship at glasgow teaching moral philosophy and during this time he wrote and published the theory of moral sentiments in his later life he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout europe where he met other intellectual leaders of his day smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory the wealth of nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics in this and other works he developed the concept of division of labour and expounded upon how rational selfinterest and competition can lead to economic prosperity smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by tory writers in the moralising tradition of

father also adam smith was a scottish writer to the signet senior solicitor advocate and prosecutor judge advocate and also served as comptroller of the customs in kirkcaldy in  he married margaret douglas daughter of the landed robert douglas of strathendry also in fife his father died two months after he was born leaving his mother a widow the date of smiths baptism into the church of scotland at kirkcaldy was  june  and this has often been treated as if it were also his date of birth which is unknown although few events in smiths early childhood are known the scottish journalist john rae smiths biographer recorded that smith was abducted by gypsies at the age of three and released when others went to rescue himn  smith was close to his mother who probably encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions he attended the burgh school of kirkcaldy—characterised by rae as one of the best secondary schools of scotland at that period—from  to  he learned latin mathematics history and writing formal educationedit a commemorative plaque for smith is located in smiths home town of kirkcaldy smith entered the university of glasgow when he was fourteen and studied moral philosophy under francis hutcheson here smith developed his passion for liberty reason and free speech in  smith was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at balliol college oxford under the snell exhibition adam smith considered the teaching at glasgow to be far superior to that at oxford which he found intellectually stifling in book v chapter ii of the wealth of nations smith wrote in the university of oxford the greater part of the public professors have for these many years given up altogether even the pretence of teaching smith is also reported to have complained to friends that oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of david humes treatise on human nature and they subsequently confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it according to william robert scott the oxford of smiths time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework nevertheless smith took the opportunity while at oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large bodleian library when smith was not studying on his own his time at oxford was not a happy one according to his letters near the end of his time there smith began suffering from shaking fits probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown he left oxford university in  before his scholarship ended in book v of the wealth of nations smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at english universities when compared to their scottish counterparts he attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at oxford and cambridge which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students and to the fact that distinguished men of letters could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the church of england adam smiths discontent at oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in glasgow francis hutcheson hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the university of glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students colleagues and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations which he sometimes opened to the public his lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy but to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives appropriately acquiring the epithet the preacher of philosophy unlike smith hutcheson was not a system builder rather it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as the never to be forgotten hutcheson—a title that smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people his good friend david hume and influential mentor francis hutcheson teaching careeredit smith began delivering public lectures in  in edinburgh sponsored by the philosophical society of edinburgh under the patronage of lord kames his lecture topics included rhetoric and belleslettres and later the subject of the progress of opulence on this latter topic he first expounded his economic philosophy of the obvious and simple system of natural liberty while smith was not adept at public speaking his lectures met with success david hume was a friend and contemporary of smith in  he met the philosopher david hume who was his senior by more than a decade in their writings covering history politics philosophy economics and religion smith and hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the scottish enlightenment in  smith earned a professorship at glasgow university teaching logic courses and in  he was elected a member of the philosophical society of edinburgh having been introduced to the society by lord kames when the head of moral philosophy in glasgow died the next year smith took over the position he worked as an academic for the next thirteen years which he characterised as by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period of his life smith published the theory of moral sentiments in  embodying some of his glasgow lectures this work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator or the individual and other members of society smith defined mutual sympathy as the basis of moral sentiments he based his explanation not on a special moral sense as the third lord shaftesbury and hutcheson had done nor on utility as hume did but on mutual sympathy a term best captured in modern parlance by the twentiethcentury concept of empathy the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being following the publication of the theory of moral sentiments smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at glasgow to learn under smith after the publication of the theory of moral sentiments smith began to give more attention to jurisprudence and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals for example smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour rather than the nations quantity of gold or silver which is the basis for mercantilism the economic theory that dominated western european economic policies at the time françois quesnay one of the leaders of the physiocratic school of thought in  the university of glasgow conferred on smith the title of doctor of laws lld at the end of  he obtained an offer from charles townshend—who had been introduced to smith by david hume—to tutor his stepson henry scott the young duke of buccleuch smith then resigned from his professorship to take the tutoring position he subsequently attempted to return the fees he had collected from his students because he resigned in the middle of the term but his students refused tutoring and travelsedit smiths tutoring job entailed touring europe with scott during which time he educated scott on a variety of subjects—such as proper polish he was paid £ per year plus expenses along with a £ per year pension roughly twice his former income as a teacher smith first travelled as a tutor to toulouse france where he stayed for one and a half years according to his own account he found toulouse to be somewhat boring having written to hume that he had begun to write a book to pass away the time after touring the south of france the group moved to geneva where smith met with the philosopher voltaire from geneva the party moved to paris here smith came to know several great intellectual leaders of the time invariably having an effect on his future works this list included benjamin franklin turgot jean dalembert andré morellet helvétius and notably françois quesnay the head of the physiocratic school so impressed with his ideas smith considered dedicating the wealth of nations to him had quesnay not died beforehand physiocrats were opposed to mercantilism the dominating economic theory of the time illustrated in their motto laissez faire et laissez passer le monde va de lui même let do and let pass the world goes on by itself they were also known to have declared that only agricultural activity produced real wealth merchants and industrialists manufacturers did not this however did not represent their true school of thought but was a mere smoke screen manufactured to hide their actual criticisms of the nobility and church arguing that they made up the only real clients of merchants the wealth of france was virtually destroyed by louis xiv and louis xv in ruinous wars by aiding the american insurgents against the british and perhaps most destructive in terms of public perceptions was what was seen as the excessive consumption of goods and services deemed to have no economic contribution—unproductive labour assuming that nobility and church are essentially detractors from economic growth the feudal system of agriculture in france was the only sector important to maintain the wealth of the nation given that the english economy of the day yielded an income distribution that stood in contrast to that which existed in france smith concluded that the teachings and beliefs of physiocrats were with all their imperfections perhaps the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy the distinction between productive versus unproductive labour—the physiocratic classe steril—was a predominant issue in the development and understanding of what would become classical economic theory later yearsedit in  henry scotts younger brother died in paris and smiths tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter smith returned home that year to kirkcaldy and he devoted much of the next ten years to his magnum opus there he befriended henry moyes a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude as well as teaching moyes smith secured the patronage of david hume and thomas reid in the young mans education in may  smith was elected fellow of the royal society of london and was elected a member of the literary club in  the wealth of nations was published in  and was an instant success selling out its first edition in only six months in  smith was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in scotland and went to live with his mother in panmure house in edinburghs canongate five years later as a member of the philosophical society of edinburgh when it received its royal charter he automatically became one of the founding members of the royal society of edinburgh and from  to  he occupied the honorary position of lord rector of the university of glasgow he died in the northern wing of panmure house in edinburgh on  july  after a painful illness and was buried in the canongate kirkyard on his death bed smith expressed disappointment that he had not achieved more smiths literary executors were two friends from the scottish academic world the physicist and chemist joseph black and the pioneering geologist james hutton smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication he mentioned an early unpublished history of astronomy as probably suitable and it duly appeared in  along with other material such as essays on philosophical subjects smiths library went by his will to david douglas lord reston son of his cousin colonel robert douglas of strathendry fife who lived with smith it was eventually divided between his two surviving children cecilia margaret mrs cunningham and david anne mrs bannerman on the death of her husband the reverend w b cunningham of prestonpans in  mrs cunningham sold some of the books the remainder passed to her son professor robert oliver cunningham of queens college belfast who presented a part to the library of queens college after his death the remaining books were sold on the death of mrs bannerman in  her portion of the library went intact to the new college of the free church edinburgh personality and beliefsedit characteredit james tassies enamel paste medallion of smith provided the model for many engravings and portraits that remain today not much is known about smiths personal views beyond what can be deduced from his published articles his personal papers were destroyed after his death at his request he never married and seems to have maintained a close relationship with his mother whom he lived with after his return from france and who died six years before his own death smith was described by several of his contemporaries and biographers as comically absentminded with peculiar habits of speech and gait and a smile of inexpressible benignity he was known to talk to himself a habit that began during his childhood when he would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions he also had occasional spells of imaginary illness and he is reported to have had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study according to one story smith took charles townshend on a tour of a tanning factory and while discussing free trade smith walked into a huge tanning pit from which he needed help to escape he is also said to have put bread and butter into a teapot drunk the concoction and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had according to another account smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up  miles  km outside of town before nearby church bells brought him back to reality james boswell who was a student of smiths at glasgow university and later knew him at the literary club says that smith thought that speaking about his ideas in conversation might reduce the sale of his books and so his conversation was unimpressive according to boswell he once told sir joshua reynolds that he made it a rule when in company never to talk of what he understood portrait of smith by john kay  smith has been alternately described as someone who had a large nose bulging eyes a protruding lower lip a nervous twitch and a speech impediment and one whose countenance was manly and agreeable smith is said to have acknowledged his looks at one point saying i am a beau in nothing but my books smith rarely sat for portraits so almost all depictions of him created during his lifetime were drawn from memory the bestknown portraits of smith are the profile by james tassie and two etchings by john kay the line engravings produced for the covers of th century reprints of the wealth of nations were based largely on tassies medallion religious viewsedit there has been considerable scholarly debate about the nature of smiths religious views smiths father had shown a strong interest in christianity and belonged to the moderate wing of the church of scotland the fact that adam smith received the snell exhibition suggests that he may have gone to oxford with the intention of pursuing a career in the church of england angloamerican economist ronald coase has challenged the view that smith was a deist based on the fact that smiths writings never explicitly invoke god as an explanation of the harmonies of the natural or the human worlds according to coase though smith does sometimes refer to the great architect of the universe later scholars such as jacob viner have very much exaggerated the extent to which adam smith was committed to a belief in a personal god a belief for which coase finds little evidence in passages such as the one in the wealth of nations in which smith writes that the curiosity of mankind about the great phenomena of nature such as the generation the life growth and dissolution of plants and animals has led men to enquire into their causes and that superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them from more familiar causes or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods some other authors argue that smiths social and economic philosophy is inherently theological and that his entire model of social order is logically dependent on the notion of gods action in nature smith was also a close friend and later the executor of david hume who was commonly characterised in his own time as an atheist the publication in  of smiths letter to william strahan in which he described humes courage in the face of death in spite of his irreligiosity attracted considerable controversy published worksedit the theory of moral sentimentsedit main article the theory of moral sentiments  printing of an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations in  smith published his first work the theory of moral sentiments sold by copublishers andrew millar of london and alexander kincaid of edinburgh smith continued making extensive revisions to the book up until his deathn  although the wealth of nations is widely regarded as smiths most influential work it is believed that smith himself considered the theory of moral sentiments to be a superior work in the work smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time and suggests that conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek mutual sympathy of sentiments his goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankinds ability to form moral judgement given that people begin life with no moral sentiments at all smith proposes a theory of sympathy in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behavior the feedback we receive from perceiving or imagining others judgements creates an incentive to achieve mutual sympathy of sentiments with them and leads people to develop habits and then principles of behavior which come to constitute ones conscience some scholars have perceived a conflict between the theory of moral sentiments and the wealth of nations the former emphasises sympathy for others while the latter focuses on the role of selfinterest in recent years however some scholars of smiths work have argued that no contradiction exists they claim that in the theory of moral sentiments smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the impartial spectator as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathise with their sentiments rather than viewing the theory of moral sentiments and the wealth of nations as presenting incompatible views of human nature some smith scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation otteson argues that both books are newtonian in their methodology and deploy a similar market model for explaining the creation and development of largescale human social orders including morality economics as well as language ekelund and hebert offer a differing view observing that selfinterest is present in both works and that in the former sympathy is the moral faculty that holds selfinterest in check whereas in the latter competition is the economic faculty that restrains selfinterest the wealth of nationsedit main article the wealth of nations later building on the site where smith wrote the wealth of nations there is disagreement between classical and neoclassical economists about the central message of smiths most influential work an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations  neoclassical economists emphasise smiths invisible hand a concept mentioned in the middle of his work – book iv chapter ii – and classical economists believe that smith stated his programme for promoting the wealth of nations in the first sentences which attributes the growth of wealth and prosperity to the division of labour smith used the term the invisible hand in history of astronomy referring to the invisible hand of jupiter and once in each of his the theory of moral sentiments  and the wealth of nations  this last statement about an invisible hand has been interpreted in numerous ways as every individual therefore endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can he generally indeed neither intends to promote the public interest nor knows how much he is promoting it by preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry he intends only his own security and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value he intends only his own gain and he is in this as in many other cases led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it by pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it i have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good it is an affectation indeed not very common among merchants and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it those who regard that statement as smiths central message also quote frequently smiths dictum it is not from the benevolence of the butcher the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner but from their regard to their own interest we address ourselves not to their humanity but to their selflove and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages the first page of the wealth of nations  london edition smiths statement about the benefits of an invisible hand may be meant to answercitation needed mandevilles contention that private vices … may be turned into public benefits it shows smiths belief that when an individual pursues his selfinterest under conditions of justice he unintentionally promotes the good of society selfinterested competition in the free market he argued would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services nevertheless he was wary of businessmen and warned of their conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices again and again smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests which may form cabals or monopolies fixing the highest price which can be squeezed out of the buyers smith also warned that a businessdominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants in any particular branch of trade or manufactures is always in some respects different from and even opposite to that of the publicthe proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order ought always to be listened to with great precaution and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined not only with the most scrupulous but with the most suspicious attention thus smiths chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government by contrast in the absence of such special political favours he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society it is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts in consequence of the division of labour which occasions in a wellgoverned society that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for and every other workman being exactly in the same situation he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity or what comes to the same thing for the price of a great quantity of theirs he supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society the wealth of nations ii the neoclassical interest in smiths statement about an invisible hand originates in the possibility to see it as a precursor of neoclassical economics and its general equilibrium concept samuelsons economics refers  times to smiths invisible hand to emphasise this relation samuelson quotes smiths invisible hand statement putting general interest where smith wrote public interest samuelson concluded smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisiblehand doctrine indeed until the s no one knew how to prove even to state properly the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market very differently classical economists see in smiths first sentences his programme to promote the wealth of nations taking up the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process means that to have growth the inputs of period must excel the inputs of period therefore the outputs of period not used or usable as input of period are regarded as unproductive labour as they do not contribute to growth this is what smith had heard in france from among others quesnay to this french insight that unproductive labour should be pushed back to use labour more productively smith added his own proposal that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the division of labour smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living—general plenty and universal opulence—for all extended markets and increased production lead to continuous reorganisation of production and inventing new ways of producing which lead to further increased production lower prices and increased standards of living smiths central message is therefore that under dynamic competition a growth machine secures the wealth of nations smiths argument predicted britains evolution as the workshop of the world underselling and outproducing all its competitors the opening sentences of the wealth of nations summarise this policy the annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes …  this produce … bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it … but this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances first by the skill dexterity and judgment with which its labour is generally applied and secondly by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour and that of those who are not so employed emphasis added smith added however that the abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter criticism and dissentedit alfred marshall criticised smiths definition of economy on several points he argued that man should be equally important as money services are as important as goods and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare instead of just wealth the invisible hand only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets with small atomistic producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate in conditions of monopoly and oligopoly the invisible hand fails nobel prizewinning economist joseph e stiglitz says on the topic of one of smiths better known ideas the reason that the invisible hand often seems invisible is that it is often not there other worksedit smiths burial place in canongate kirkyard shortly before his death smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed in his last years he seemed to have been planning two major treatises one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts the posthumously published essays on philosophical subjects a history of astronomy down to smiths own era plus some thoughts on ancient physics and metaphysics probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise lectures on jurisprudence were notes taken from smiths early lectures plus an early draft of the wealth of nations published as part of the  glasgow edition of the works and correspondence of smith other works including some published posthumously include lectures on justice police revenue and arms  first published in  and essays on philosophical subjects  legacyedit in economics and moral philosophyedit the wealth of nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics in this and other works smith expounded how rational selfinterest and competition can lead to economic prosperity smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by tory writers in the moralising tradition of hogarth and swift as a discussion at the university of winchester suggests in  the wealth of nations was named among the  best scottish books of all time former uk prime minister margaret thatcher it is said used to carry a copy of the book in her handbag in light of the arguments put forward by smith and other economic theorists in britain academic belief in mercantilism began to decline in britain in the late th century during the industrial revolution britain embraced free trade and smiths laissezfaire economics and via the british empire used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world characterised by open markets and relatively barrier free domestic and international trade george stigler attributes to smith the most important substantive proposition in all of economics it is that under competition owners of resources for example labour land and capital will use them most profitably resulting in an equal rate of return in equilibrium for all uses adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training trust hardship and unemployment paul samuelson finds in smiths pluralist use of supply and demand as applied to wages rents and profit a valid and valuable anticipation of the general equilibrium modelling of walras a century later smiths allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention contrasted with malthus ricardo and karl marx in their propounding a rigid subsistence–wage theory of labour supply joseph schumpeter criticised smith for a lack of technical rigor yet he argued that this enabled smiths writings to appeal to wider audiences his very limitation made for success had he been more brilliant he would not have been taken so seriously had he dug more deeply had he unearthed more recondite truth had he used more difficult and ingenious methods he would not have been understood but he had no such ambitions in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense he never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers he led them on gently encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations making them feel comfortable all along classical economists presented competing theories of those of smith termed the labour theory of value later marxian economics descending from classical economics also use smiths labour theories in part the first volume of karl marxs major work capital was published in german in  in it marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital the labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production this contrasts with the modern contention of neoclassical economics that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing the adam smith theatre in kirkcaldy the body of theory later termed neoclassical economics or marginalism formed from about  to  the term economics was popularised by such neoclassical economists as alfred marshall as a concise synonym for economic science and a substitute for the earlier broader term political economy used by smith this corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the natural sciences neoclassical economics systematised supply and demand as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income it dispensed with the labour theory of value of which smith was most famously identified with in classical economics in favour of a marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side the bicentennial anniversary of the publication of the wealth of nations was celebrated in  resulting in increased interest for the theory of moral sentiments and his other works throughout academia after  smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both the wealth of nations and the theory of moral sentiments and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics his homo economicus or economic man was also more often represented as a moral person additionally economists david levy and sandra peart in the secret history of the dismal science point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality including racial inequality and provide additional support for those who point to smiths opposition to slavery colonialism and empire they show the caricatures of smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article emphasised also are smiths statements of the need for high wages for the poor and the efforts to keep wages low in the vanity of the philosopher from equality to hierarchy in postclassical economics peart and levy also cite smiths view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical they also cite smiths opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense smith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions but avarice and ambition in the rich in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment are the passions which prompt to invade property passions much more steady in their operation and much more universal in their influence wherever there is great property there is great inequality for one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many the affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor who are often both driven by want and prompted by envy to invade his possessions it is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property which is acquired by the labour of many years or perhaps of many successive generations can sleep a single night in security he is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies whom though he never provoked he can never appease and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it the acquisition of valuable and extensive property therefore necessarily requires the establishment of civil government where there is no property or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days labour civil government is not so necessary civil government supposes a certain subordination but as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property … men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs all the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them they constitute a sort of little nobility who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority civil government so far as it is instituted for the security of property is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor or of those who have some property against those who have none at all source the wealth of nations book  chapter  part  in british imperial debatesedit smiths chapter on colonies in turn would help shape british imperial debates from the midnineteenth century onward the wealth of nations would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question in his chapter on colonies smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the atlantic among the empires thirteen american colonies he offered two different proposals for easing tensions the first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence and by thus parting on a friendly basis britain would be able to develop and maintain a freetrade relationship with them and possibly even an informal military alliance smiths second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade smiths most prominent disciple in nineteenthcentury britain peace advocate richard cobden preferred the first proposal cobden would lead the anticorn law league in overturning the corn laws in  shifting britain to a policy of free trade and empire on the cheap for decades to come this handsoff approach toward the british empire would become known as cobdenism or the manchester school by the turn of the century however advocates of smiths second proposal such as joseph shield nicholson would become ever more vocal in opposing cobdenism calling instead for imperial federation as marcwilliam palen notes on the one hand adam smith’s late nineteenth and early twentiethcentury cobdenite adherents used his theories to argue for gradual imperial devolution and empire ‘on the cheap’ on the other various proponents of imperial federation throughout the british world sought to use smith’s theories to overturn the predominant cobdenite handsoff imperial approach and instead with a firm grip bring the empire closer than ever before smiths ideas thus played an important part in subsequent debates over the british empire portraits monuments and banknotesedit a statue of smith in edinburghs high street erected through private donations organised by the adam smith institute smith has been commemorated in the uk on banknotes printed by two different banks his portrait has appeared since  on the £ notes issued by the clydesdale bank in scotland and in march  smiths image also appeared on the new series of £ notes issued by the bank of england making him the first scotsman to feature on an english banknote statue of smith built in – at the old headquarters of the university of london  burlington gardens a largescale memorial of smith by alexander stoddart was unveiled on  july  in edinburgh it is a  feet  mtall bronze sculpture and it stands above the royal mile outside st giles cathedral in parliament square near the mercat cross thcentury sculptor jim sanborn best known for the kryptos sculpture at the united states central intelligence agency has created multiple pieces which feature smiths work at central connecticut state university is circulating capital a tall cylinder which features an extract from the wealth of nations on the lower half and on the upper half some of the same text but represented in binary code at the university of north carolina at charlotte outside the belk college of business administration is adam smiths spinning top another smith sculpture is at cleveland state university he also appears as the narrator in the  play the low road centred on a proponent on laissezfaire economics in the late eighteenth century but dealing obliquely with the financial crisis of – and the recession which followed—in the premiere production he was portrayed by bill paterson a bust of smith is in the hall of heroes of the national wallace monument in stirling residenceedit adam smith resided at panmure house from – this residence has now been purchased by the edinburgh business school at heriot watt university and fundraising has begun to restore it part of the northern end of the original building appears to have been demolished in the th century to make way for an iron foundry as a symbol of free market economicsedit adam smiths spinning top sculpture by jim sanborn at cleveland state university smith has been celebrated by advocates of free market policies as the founder of free market economics a view reflected in the naming of bodies such as the adam smith institute in london the adam smith society and the australian adam smith club and in terms such as the adam smith necktie alan greenspan argues that while smith did not coin the term laissezfaire it was left to adam smith to identify the moregeneral set of principles that brought conceptual clarity to the seeming chaos of market transactions greenspan continues that the wealth of nations was one of the great achievements in human intellectual history p j orourke describes smith as the founder of free market economics other writers have argued that smiths support for laissezfaire which in french means leave alone has been overstated herbert stein wrote that the people who wear an adam smith necktie do it to make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and limited government and that this misrepresents smiths ideas stein writes that smith was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea he viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticismyet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system he did not wear the adam smith necktie in steins reading the wealth of nations could justify the food and drug administration the consumer product safety commission mandatory employer health benefits environmentalism and discriminatory taxation to deter improper or luxurious behavior similarly vivienne brown stated in the economic journal that in the th century united states reaganomics supporters the wall street journal and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of smith portraying him as an extreme dogmatic defender of laissezfaire capitalism and supplyside economics in fact the wealth of nations includes the following statement on the payment of taxes the subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state some commentators have argued that smiths works show support for a progressive not flat income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state among them luxury goods taxes and tax on rent yet smith argued for the impossibility of taxing the people in proportion to their economic revenue by any capitation the wealth of nations viik smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting justice and certain publick institutions that were necessary for the benefit of all of society but that could not be provided by private enterprise the wealth of nations ivix additionally smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in the wealth of nations book v ch i included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system grant patents and copy rights provide public goods such as infrastructure provide national defence and regulate banking it was the role of the government to provide goods of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual such as roads bridges canals and harbours he also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies he supported partial public subsidies for elementary education and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society in such cases however smith argued for local rather than centralised control even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves    are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue under the management of a local and provincial administration than by the general revenue of the state wealth of nations vid finally he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate such that they are equal or above the public in fashion he even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansionhouse of a doge in addition he allowed that in some specific circumstances retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial the recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods he added however that in general a retaliatory tariff seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people to do another injury ourselves not only to those classes but to almost all the other classes of them the wealth of nations ivii economic historians such as jacob viner regard smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government what smith called natural liberty but not as a dogmatic supporter of laissezfaire economist daniel klein believes using the term free market economics or free market economist to identify the ideas of smith is too general and slightly misleading klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of smiths economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the smithian identity economist david ricardo set straight some of the misunderstandings about smiths thoughts on free market most people still fall victim to the thinking that smith was a free market economist without exception though he was not ricardo pointed out that smith was in support of helping infant industries smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood it would be unwilling to surrender the government help smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence some have also claimed emma rothschild among them that smith would have supported a minimum wage although there is no direct textual evidence supporting the claim indeed smith wrote the price of labour it must be observed cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour not only according to the different abilities of the workmen but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters where wages are not regulated by law all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly though it has often pretended to do so the wealth of nations book  chapter  smith also noted a rough equality of bargaining power a landlord a farmer a master manufacturer a merchant though they did not employ a single workman could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired many workmen could not subsist a week few could subsist a month and scarce any a year without employment in the long run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him but the necessity is not so immediate see alsoedit organizational capital list of abolitionist forerunners list of fellows of the royal society of arts notesedit  in life of adam smith rae writes in his fourth year while on a visit to his grandfathers house at strathendry on the banks of the leven smith was stolen by a passing band of gypsies and for a time could not be found but presently a gentleman arrived who had met a gypsy woman a few miles down the road carrying a child that was crying piteously scouts were immediately dispatched in the direction indicated and they

smith frsa  june  ns  june  os –  july  was a scottish economist philosopher and author he was a moral philosopher a pioneer of political economy and was a key figure during the scottish enlightenment era he is best known for two classic works the theory of moral sentiments  and an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations  the latter usually abbreviated as the wealth of nations is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics smith studied social philosophy at the university of glasgow and at balliol college oxford where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow scot john snell after graduating he delivered a successful series of public lectures at edinburgh leading him to collaborate with david hume during the scottish enlightenment smith obtained a professorship at glasgow teaching moral philosophy and during this time he wrote and published the theory of moral sentiments in his later life he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout europe where he met other intellectual leaders of his day smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory the wealth of nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics in this and other works he developed the concept of division of labour and expounded upon how rational selfinterest and competition can lead to economic prosperity smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by tory writers in the moralising tradition of

father also adam smith was a scottish writer to the signet senior solicitor advocate and prosecutor judge advocate and also served as comptroller of the customs in kirkcaldy in  he married margaret douglas daughter of the landed robert douglas of strathendry also in fife his father died two months after he was born leaving his mother a widow the date of smiths baptism into the church of scotland at kirkcaldy was  june  and this has often been treated as if it were also his date of birth which is unknown although few events in smiths early childhood are known the scottish journalist john rae smiths biographer recorded that smith was abducted by gypsies at the age of three and released when others went to rescue himn  smith was close to his mother who probably encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions he attended the burgh school of kirkcaldy—characterised by rae as one of the best secondary schools of scotland at that period—from  to  he learned latin mathematics history and writing formal educationedit a commemorative plaque for smith is located in smiths home town of kirkcaldy smith entered the university of glasgow when he was fourteen and studied moral philosophy under francis hutcheson here smith developed his passion for liberty reason and free speech in  smith was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at balliol college oxford under the snell exhibition adam smith considered the teaching at glasgow to be far superior to that at oxford which he found intellectually stifling in book v chapter ii of the wealth of nations smith wrote in the university of oxford the greater part of the public professors have for these many years given up altogether even the pretence of teaching smith is also reported to have complained to friends that oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of david humes treatise on human nature and they subsequently confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it according to william robert scott the oxford of smiths time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework nevertheless smith took the opportunity while at oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large bodleian library when smith was not studying on his own his time at oxford was not a happy one according to his letters near the end of his time there smith began suffering from shaking fits probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown he left oxford university in  before his scholarship ended in book v of the wealth of nations smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at english universities when compared to their scottish counterparts he attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at oxford and cambridge which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students and to the fact that distinguished men of letters could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the church of england adam smiths discontent at oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in glasgow francis hutcheson hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the university of glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students colleagues and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations which he sometimes opened to the public his lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy but to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives appropriately acquiring the epithet the preacher of philosophy unlike smith hutcheson was not a system builder rather it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as the never to be forgotten hutcheson—a title that smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people his good friend david hume and influential mentor francis hutcheson teaching careeredit smith began delivering public lectures in  in edinburgh sponsored by the philosophical society of edinburgh under the patronage of lord kames his lecture topics included rhetoric and belleslettres and later the subject of the progress of opulence on this latter topic he first expounded his economic philosophy of the obvious and simple system of natural liberty while smith was not adept at public speaking his lectures met with success david hume was a friend and contemporary of smith in  he met the philosopher david hume who was his senior by more than a decade in their writings covering history politics philosophy economics and religion smith and hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the scottish enlightenment in  smith earned a professorship at glasgow university teaching logic courses and in  he was elected a member of the philosophical society of edinburgh having been introduced to the society by lord kames when the head of moral philosophy in glasgow died the next year smith took over the position he worked as an academic for the next thirteen years which he characterised as by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period of his life smith published the theory of moral sentiments in  embodying some of his glasgow lectures this work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator or the individual and other members of society smith defined mutual sympathy as the basis of moral sentiments he based his explanation not on a special moral sense as the third lord shaftesbury and hutcheson had done nor on utility as hume did but on mutual sympathy a term best captured in modern parlance by the twentiethcentury concept of empathy the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being following the publication of the theory of moral sentiments smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at glasgow to learn under smith after the publication of the theory of moral sentiments smith began to give more attention to jurisprudence and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals for example smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour rather than the nations quantity of gold or silver which is the basis for mercantilism the economic theory that dominated western european economic policies at the time françois quesnay one of the leaders of the physiocratic school of thought in  the university of glasgow conferred on smith the title of doctor of laws lld at the end of  he obtained an offer from charles townshend—who had been introduced to smith by david hume—to tutor his stepson henry scott the young duke of buccleuch smith then resigned from his professorship to take the tutoring position he subsequently attempted to return the fees he had collected from his students because he resigned in the middle of the term but his students refused tutoring and travelsedit smiths tutoring job entailed touring europe with scott during which time he educated scott on a variety of subjects—such as proper polish he was paid £ per year plus expenses along with a £ per year pension roughly twice his former income as a teacher smith first travelled as a tutor to toulouse france where he stayed for one and a half years according to his own account he found toulouse to be somewhat boring having written to hume that he had begun to write a book to pass away the time after touring the south of france the group moved to geneva where smith met with the philosopher voltaire from geneva the party moved to paris here smith came to know several great intellectual leaders of the time invariably having an effect on his future works this list included benjamin franklin turgot jean dalembert andré morellet helvétius and notably françois quesnay the head of the physiocratic school so impressed with his ideas smith considered dedicating the wealth of nations to him had quesnay not died beforehand physiocrats were opposed to mercantilism the dominating economic theory of the time illustrated in their motto laissez faire et laissez passer le monde va de lui même let do and let pass the world goes on by itself they were also known to have declared that only agricultural activity produced real wealth merchants and industrialists manufacturers did not this however did not represent their true school of thought but was a mere smoke screen manufactured to hide their actual criticisms of the nobility and church arguing that they made up the only real clients of merchants the wealth of france was virtually destroyed by louis xiv and louis xv in ruinous wars by aiding the american insurgents against the british and perhaps most destructive in terms of public perceptions was what was seen as the excessive consumption of goods and services deemed to have no economic contribution—unproductive labour assuming that nobility and church are essentially detractors from economic growth the feudal system of agriculture in france was the only sector important to maintain the wealth of the nation given that the english economy of the day yielded an income distribution that stood in contrast to that which existed in france smith concluded that the teachings and beliefs of physiocrats were with all their imperfections perhaps the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy the distinction between productive versus unproductive labour—the physiocratic classe steril—was a predominant issue in the development and understanding of what would become classical economic theory later yearsedit in  henry scotts younger brother died in paris and smiths tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter smith returned home that year to kirkcaldy and he devoted much of the next ten years to his magnum opus there he befriended henry moyes a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude as well as teaching moyes smith secured the patronage of david hume and thomas reid in the young mans education in may  smith was elected fellow of the royal society of london and was elected a member of the literary club in  the wealth of nations was published in  and was an instant success selling out its first edition in only six months in  smith was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in scotland and went to live with his mother in panmure house in edinburghs canongate five years later as a member of the philosophical society of edinburgh when it received its royal charter he automatically became one of the founding members of the royal society of edinburgh and from  to  he occupied the honorary position of lord rector of the university of glasgow he died in the northern wing of panmure house in edinburgh on  july  after a painful illness and was buried in the canongate kirkyard on his death bed smith expressed disappointment that he had not achieved more smiths literary executors were two friends from the scottish academic world the physicist and chemist joseph black and the pioneering geologist james hutton smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication he mentioned an early unpublished history of astronomy as probably suitable and it duly appeared in  along with other material such as essays on philosophical subjects smiths library went by his will to david douglas lord reston son of his cousin colonel robert douglas of strathendry fife who lived with smith it was eventually divided between his two surviving children cecilia margaret mrs cunningham and david anne mrs bannerman on the death of her husband the reverend w b cunningham of prestonpans in  mrs cunningham sold some of the books the remainder passed to her son professor robert oliver cunningham of queens college belfast who presented a part to the library of queens college after his death the remaining books were sold on the death of mrs bannerman in  her portion of the library went intact to the new college of the free church edinburgh personality and beliefsedit characteredit james tassies enamel paste medallion of smith provided the model for many engravings and portraits that remain today not much is known about smiths personal views beyond what can be deduced from his published articles his personal papers were destroyed after his death at his request he never married and seems to have maintained a close relationship with his mother whom he lived with after his return from france and who died six years before his own death smith was described by several of his contemporaries and biographers as comically absentminded with peculiar habits of speech and gait and a smile of inexpressible benignity he was known to talk to himself a habit that began during his childhood when he would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions he also had occasional spells of imaginary illness and he is reported to have had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study according to one story smith took charles townshend on a tour of a tanning factory and while discussing free trade smith walked into a huge tanning pit from which he needed help to escape he is also said to have put bread and butter into a teapot drunk the concoction and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had according to another account smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up  miles  km outside of town before nearby church bells brought him back to reality james boswell who was a student of smiths at glasgow university and later knew him at the literary club says that smith thought that speaking about his ideas in conversation might reduce the sale of his books and so his conversation was unimpressive according to boswell he once told sir joshua reynolds that he made it a rule when in company never to talk of what he understood portrait of smith by john kay  smith has been alternately described as someone who had a large nose bulging eyes a protruding lower lip a nervous twitch and a speech impediment and one whose countenance was manly and agreeable smith is said to have acknowledged his looks at one point saying i am a beau in nothing but my books smith rarely sat for portraits so almost all depictions of him created during his lifetime were drawn from memory the bestknown portraits of smith are the profile by james tassie and two etchings by john kay the line engravings produced for the covers of th century reprints of the wealth of nations were based largely on tassies medallion religious viewsedit there has been considerable scholarly debate about the nature of smiths religious views smiths father had shown a strong interest in christianity and belonged to the moderate wing of the church of scotland the fact that adam smith received the snell exhibition suggests that he may have gone to oxford with the intention of pursuing a career in the church of england angloamerican economist ronald coase has challenged the view that smith was a deist based on the fact that smiths writings never explicitly invoke god as an explanation of the harmonies of the natural or the human worlds according to coase though smith does sometimes refer to the great architect of the universe later scholars such as jacob viner have very much exaggerated the extent to which adam smith was committed to a belief in a personal god a belief for which coase finds little evidence in passages such as the one in the wealth of nations in which smith writes that the curiosity of mankind about the great phenomena of nature such as the generation the life growth and dissolution of plants and animals has led men to enquire into their causes and that superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them from more familiar causes or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods some other authors argue that smiths social and economic philosophy is inherently theological and that his entire model of social order is logically dependent on the notion of gods action in nature smith was also a close friend and later the executor of david hume who was commonly characterised in his own time as an atheist the publication in  of smiths letter to william strahan in which he described humes courage in the face of death in spite of his irreligiosity attracted considerable controversy published worksedit the theory of moral sentimentsedit main article the theory of moral sentiments  printing of an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations in  smith published his first work the theory of moral sentiments sold by copublishers andrew millar of london and alexander kincaid of edinburgh smith continued making extensive revisions to the book up until his deathn  although the wealth of nations is widely regarded as smiths most influential work it is believed that smith himself considered the theory of moral sentiments to be a superior work in the work smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time and suggests that conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek mutual sympathy of sentiments his goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankinds ability to form moral judgement given that people begin life with no moral sentiments at all smith proposes a theory of sympathy in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behavior the feedback we receive from perceiving or imagining others judgements creates an incentive to achieve mutual sympathy of sentiments with them and leads people to develop habits and then principles of behavior which come to constitute ones conscience some scholars have perceived a conflict between the theory of moral sentiments and the wealth of nations the former emphasises sympathy for others while the latter focuses on the role of selfinterest in recent years however some scholars of smiths work have argued that no contradiction exists they claim that in the theory of moral sentiments smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the impartial spectator as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathise with their sentiments rather than viewing the theory of moral sentiments and the wealth of nations as presenting incompatible views of human nature some smith scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation otteson argues that both books are newtonian in their methodology and deploy a similar market model for explaining the creation and development of largescale human social orders including morality economics as well as language ekelund and hebert offer a differing view observing that selfinterest is present in both works and that in the former sympathy is the moral faculty that holds selfinterest in check whereas in the latter competition is the economic faculty that restrains selfinterest the wealth of nationsedit main article the wealth of nations later building on the site where smith wrote the wealth of nations there is disagreement between classical and neoclassical economists about the central message of smiths most influential work an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations  neoclassical economists emphasise smiths invisible hand a concept mentioned in the middle of his work – book iv chapter ii – and classical economists believe that smith stated his programme for promoting the wealth of nations in the first sentences which attributes the growth of wealth and prosperity to the division of labour smith used the term the invisible hand in history of astronomy referring to the invisible hand of jupiter and once in each of his the theory of moral sentiments  and the wealth of nations  this last statement about an invisible hand has been interpreted in numerous ways as every individual therefore endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can he generally indeed neither intends to promote the public interest nor knows how much he is promoting it by preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry he intends only his own security and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value he intends only his own gain and he is in this as in many other cases led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it by pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it i have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good it is an affectation indeed not very common among merchants and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it those who regard that statement as smiths central message also quote frequently smiths dictum it is not from the benevolence of the butcher the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner but from their regard to their own interest we address ourselves not to their humanity but to their selflove and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages the first page of the wealth of nations  london edition smiths statement about the benefits of an invisible hand may be meant to answercitation needed mandevilles contention that private vices … may be turned into public benefits it shows smiths belief that when an individual pursues his selfinterest under conditions of justice he unintentionally promotes the good of society selfinterested competition in the free market he argued would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services nevertheless he was wary of businessmen and warned of their conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices again and again smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests which may form cabals or monopolies fixing the highest price which can be squeezed out of the buyers smith also warned that a businessdominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants in any particular branch of trade or manufactures is always in some respects different from and even opposite to that of the publicthe proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order ought always to be listened to with great precaution and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined not only with the most scrupulous but with the most suspicious attention thus smiths chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government by contrast in the absence of such special political favours he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society it is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts in consequence of the division of labour which occasions in a wellgoverned society that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for and every other workman being exactly in the same situation he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity or what comes to the same thing for the price of a great quantity of theirs he supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society the wealth of nations ii the neoclassical interest in smiths statement about an invisible hand originates in the possibility to see it as a precursor of neoclassical economics and its general equilibrium concept samuelsons economics refers  times to smiths invisible hand to emphasise this relation samuelson quotes smiths invisible hand statement putting general interest where smith wrote public interest samuelson concluded smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisiblehand doctrine indeed until the s no one knew how to prove even to state properly the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market very differently classical economists see in smiths first sentences his programme to promote the wealth of nations taking up the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process means that to have growth the inputs of period must excel the inputs of period therefore the outputs of period not used or usable as input of period are regarded as unproductive labour as they do not contribute to growth this is what smith had heard in france from among others quesnay to this french insight that unproductive labour should be pushed back to use labour more productively smith added his own proposal that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the division of labour smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living—general plenty and universal opulence—for all extended markets and increased production lead to continuous reorganisation of production and inventing new ways of producing which lead to further increased production lower prices and increased standards of living smiths central message is therefore that under dynamic competition a growth machine secures the wealth of nations smiths argument predicted britains evolution as the workshop of the world underselling and outproducing all its competitors the opening sentences of the wealth of nations summarise this policy the annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes …  this produce … bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it … but this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances first by the skill dexterity and judgment with which its labour is generally applied and secondly by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour and that of those who are not so employed emphasis added smith added however that the abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter criticism and dissentedit alfred marshall criticised smiths definition of economy on several points he argued that man should be equally important as money services are as important as goods and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare instead of just wealth the invisible hand only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets with small atomistic producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate in conditions of monopoly and oligopoly the invisible hand fails nobel prizewinning economist joseph e stiglitz says on the topic of one of smiths better known ideas the reason that the invisible hand often seems invisible is that it is often not there other worksedit smiths burial place in canongate kirkyard shortly before his death smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed in his last years he seemed to have been planning two major treatises one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts the posthumously published essays on philosophical subjects a history of astronomy down to smiths own era plus some thoughts on ancient physics and metaphysics probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise lectures on jurisprudence were notes taken from smiths early lectures plus an early draft of the wealth of nations published as part of the  glasgow edition of the works and correspondence of smith other works including some published posthumously include lectures on justice police revenue and arms  first published in  and essays on philosophical subjects  legacyedit in economics and moral philosophyedit the wealth of nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics in this and other works smith expounded how rational selfinterest and competition can lead to economic prosperity smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by tory writers in the moralising tradition of hogarth and swift as a discussion at the university of winchester suggests in  the wealth of nations was named among the  best scottish books of all time former uk prime minister margaret thatcher it is said used to carry a copy of the book in her handbag in light of the arguments put forward by smith and other economic theorists in britain academic belief in mercantilism began to decline in britain in the late th century during the industrial revolution britain embraced free trade and smiths laissezfaire economics and via the british empire used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world characterised by open markets and relatively barrier free domestic and international trade george stigler attributes to smith the most important substantive proposition in all of economics it is that under competition owners of resources for example labour land and capital will use them most profitably resulting in an equal rate of return in equilibrium for all uses adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training trust hardship and unemployment paul samuelson finds in smiths pluralist use of supply and demand as applied to wages rents and profit a valid and valuable anticipation of the general equilibrium modelling of walras a century later smiths allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention contrasted with malthus ricardo and karl marx in their propounding a rigid subsistence–wage theory of labour supply joseph schumpeter criticised smith for a lack of technical rigor yet he argued that this enabled smiths writings to appeal to wider audiences his very limitation made for success had he been more brilliant he would not have been taken so seriously had he dug more deeply had he unearthed more recondite truth had he used more difficult and ingenious methods he would not have been understood but he had no such ambitions in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense he never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers he led them on gently encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations making them feel comfortable all along classical economists presented competing theories of those of smith termed the labour theory of value later marxian economics descending from classical economics also use smiths labour theories in part the first volume of karl marxs major work capital was published in german in  in it marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital the labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production this contrasts with the modern contention of neoclassical economics that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing the adam smith theatre in kirkcaldy the body of theory later termed neoclassical economics or marginalism formed from about  to  the term economics was popularised by such neoclassical economists as alfred marshall as a concise synonym for economic science and a substitute for the earlier broader term political economy used by smith this corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the natural sciences neoclassical economics systematised supply and demand as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income it dispensed with the labour theory of value of which smith was most famously identified with in classical economics in favour of a marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side the bicentennial anniversary of the publication of the wealth of nations was celebrated in  resulting in increased interest for the theory of moral sentiments and his other works throughout academia after  smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both the wealth of nations and the theory of moral sentiments and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics his homo economicus or economic man was also more often represented as a moral person additionally economists david levy and sandra peart in the secret history of the dismal science point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality including racial inequality and provide additional support for those who point to smiths opposition to slavery colonialism and empire they show the caricatures of smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article emphasised also are smiths statements of the need for high wages for the poor and the efforts to keep wages low in the vanity of the philosopher from equality to hierarchy in postclassical economics peart and levy also cite smiths view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical they also cite smiths opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense smith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions but avarice and ambition in the rich in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment are the passions which prompt to invade property passions much more steady in their operation and much more universal in their influence wherever there is great property there is great inequality for one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many the affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor who are often both driven by want and prompted by envy to invade his possessions it is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property which is acquired by the labour of many years or perhaps of many successive generations can sleep a single night in security he is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies whom though he never provoked he can never appease and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it the acquisition of valuable and extensive property therefore necessarily requires the establishment of civil government where there is no property or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days labour civil government is not so necessary civil government supposes a certain subordination but as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property … men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs all the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them they constitute a sort of little nobility who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority civil government so far as it is instituted for the security of property is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor or of those who have some property against those who have none at all source the wealth of nations book  chapter  part  in british imperial debatesedit smiths chapter on colonies in turn would help shape british imperial debates from the midnineteenth century onward the wealth of nations would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question in his chapter on colonies smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the atlantic among the empires thirteen american colonies he offered two different proposals for easing tensions the first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence and by thus parting on a friendly basis britain would be able to develop and maintain a freetrade relationship with them and possibly even an informal military alliance smiths second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade smiths most prominent disciple in nineteenthcentury britain peace advocate richard cobden preferred the first proposal cobden would lead the anticorn law league in overturning the corn laws in  shifting britain to a policy of free trade and empire on the cheap for decades to come this handsoff approach toward the british empire would become known as cobdenism or the manchester school by the turn of the century however advocates of smiths second proposal such as joseph shield nicholson would become ever more vocal in opposing cobdenism calling instead for imperial federation as marcwilliam palen notes on the one hand adam smith’s late nineteenth and early twentiethcentury cobdenite adherents used his theories to argue for gradual imperial devolution and empire ‘on the cheap’ on the other various proponents of imperial federation throughout the british world sought to use smith’s theories to overturn the predominant cobdenite handsoff imperial approach and instead with a firm grip bring the empire closer than ever before smiths ideas thus played an important part in subsequent debates over the british empire portraits monuments and banknotesedit a statue of smith in edinburghs high street erected through private donations organised by the adam smith institute smith has been commemorated in the uk on banknotes printed by two different banks his portrait has appeared since  on the £ notes issued by the clydesdale bank in scotland and in march  smiths image also appeared on the new series of £ notes issued by the bank of england making him the first scotsman to feature on an english banknote statue of smith built in – at the old headquarters of the university of london  burlington gardens a largescale memorial of smith by alexander stoddart was unveiled on  july  in edinburgh it is a  feet  mtall bronze sculpture and it stands above the royal mile outside st giles cathedral in parliament square near the mercat cross thcentury sculptor jim sanborn best known for the kryptos sculpture at the united states central intelligence agency has created multiple pieces which feature smiths work at central connecticut state university is

in the  play the low road centred on a proponent on laissezfaire economics in the late eighteenth century but dealing obliquely with the financial crisis of – and the recession which followed—in the premiere production he was portrayed by bill paterson a bust of smith is in the hall of heroes of the national wallace monument in stirling residenceedit adam smith resided at panmure house from – this residence has now been purchased by the edinburgh business school at heriot watt university and fundraising has begun to restore it part of the northern end of the original building appears to have been demolished in the th century to make way for an iron foundry as a symbol of free market economicsedit adam smiths spinning top sculpture by jim sanborn at cleveland state university smith has been celebrated by advocates of free market policies as the founder of free market economics a view reflected in the naming of bodies such as the adam smith institute in london the adam smith society and the australian adam smith club and in terms such as the adam smith necktie alan greenspan argues that while smith did not coin the term laissezfaire it was left to adam smith to identify the moregeneral set of principles that brought conceptual clarity to the seeming chaos of market transactions greenspan continues that the wealth of nations was one of the great achievements in human intellectual history p j orourke describes smith as the founder of free market economics other writers have argued that smiths support for laissezfaire which in french means leave alone has been overstated herbert stein wrote that the people who wear an adam smith necktie do it to make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and limited government and that this misrepresents smiths ideas stein writes that smith was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea he viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticismyet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system he did not wear the adam smith necktie in steins reading the wealth of nations could justify the food and drug administration the consumer product safety commission mandatory employer health benefits environmentalism and discriminatory taxation to deter improper or luxurious behavior similarly vivienne brown stated in the economic journal that in the th century united states reaganomics supporters the wall street journal and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of smith portraying him as an extreme dogmatic defender of laissezfaire capitalism and supplyside economics in fact the wealth of nations includes the following statement on the payment of taxes the subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state some commentators have argued that smiths works show support for a progressive not flat income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state among them luxury goods taxes and tax on rent yet smith argued for the impossibility of taxing the people in proportion to their economic revenue by any capitation the wealth of nations viik smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting justice and certain publick institutions that were necessary for the benefit of all of society but that could not be provided by private enterprise the wealth of nations ivix additionally smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in the wealth of nations book v ch i included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system grant patents and copy rights provide public goods such as infrastructure provide national defence and regulate banking it was the role of the government to provide goods of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual such as roads bridges canals and harbours he also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies he supported partial public subsidies for elementary education and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society in such cases however smith argued for local rather than centralised control even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves    are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue under the management of a local and provincial administration than by the general revenue of the state wealth of nations vid finally he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate such that they are equal or above the public in fashion he even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansionhouse of a doge in addition he allowed that in some specific circumstances retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial the recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods he added however that in general a retaliatory tariff seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people to do another injury ourselves not only to those classes but to almost all the other classes of them the wealth of nations ivii economic historians such as jacob viner regard smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government what smith called natural liberty but not as a dogmatic supporter of laissezfaire economist daniel klein believes using the term free market economics or free market economist to identify the ideas of smith is too general and slightly misleading klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of smiths economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the smithian identity economist david ricardo set straight some of the misunderstandings about smiths thoughts on free market most people still fall victim to the thinking that smith was a free market economist without exception though he was not ricardo pointed out that smith was in support of helping infant industries smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood it would be unwilling to surrender the government help smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence some have also claimed emma rothschild among them that smith would have supported a minimum wage although there is no direct textual evidence supporting the claim indeed smith wrote the price of labour it must be observed cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour not only according to the different abilities of the workmen but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters where wages are not regulated by law all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly though it has often pretended to do so the wealth of nations book  chapter  smith also noted a rough equality of bargaining power a landlord a farmer a master manufacturer a merchant though they did not employ a single workman could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired many workmen could not subsist a week few could subsist a month and scarce any a year without employment in the long run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him but the necessity is not so immediate see alsoedit organizational capital list of abolitionist forerunners list of fellows of the royal society of arts notesedit  in life of adam smith rae writes in his fourth year while on a visit to his grandfathers house at strathendry on the banks of the leven smith was stolen by a passing band of gypsies and for a time could not be found

smith frsa  june  ns  june  os –  july  was a scottish economist philosopher and author he was a moral philosopher a pioneer of political economy and was a key figure during the scottish enlightenment era he is best known for two classic works the theory of moral sentiments  and an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations  the latter usually abbreviated as the wealth of nations is considered his magnum opus and the first modern work of economics smith studied social philosophy at the university of glasgow and at balliol college oxford where he was one of the first students to benefit from scholarships set up by fellow scot john snell after graduating he delivered a successful series of public lectures at edinburgh leading him to collaborate with david hume during the scottish enlightenment smith obtained a professorship at glasgow teaching moral philosophy and during this time he wrote and published the theory of moral sentiments in his later life he took a tutoring position that allowed him to travel throughout europe where he met other intellectual leaders of his day smith laid the foundations of classical free market economic theory the wealth of nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics in this and other works he developed the concept of division of labour and expounded upon how rational selfinterest and

douglas daughter of the landed robert douglas of strathendry also in fife his father died two months after he was born leaving his mother a widow the date of smiths baptism into the church of scotland at kirkcaldy was  june  and this has often been treated as if it were also his date of birth which is unknown although few events in smiths early childhood are known the scottish journalist john rae smiths biographer recorded that smith was abducted by gypsies at the age of three and released when others went to rescue himn  smith was close to his mother who probably encouraged him to pursue his scholarly ambitions he attended the burgh school of kirkcaldy—characterised by rae as one of the best secondary schools of scotland at that period—from  to  he learned latin mathematics history and writing formal educationedit a commemorative plaque for smith is located in smiths home town of kirkcaldy smith entered the university of glasgow when he was fourteen and studied moral philosophy under francis hutcheson here smith developed his passion for liberty reason and free speech in  smith was the graduate scholar presented to undertake postgraduate studies at balliol college oxford under the snell exhibition adam smith considered the teaching at glasgow to be far superior to that at oxford which he found intellectually stifling in book v chapter ii of the wealth of nations smith wrote in the university of oxford the greater part of the public professors have for these many years given up altogether even the pretence of teaching smith is also reported to have complained to friends that oxford officials once discovered him reading a copy of david humes treatise on human nature and they subsequently confiscated his book and punished him severely for reading it according to william robert scott the oxford of smiths time gave little if any help towards what was to be his lifework nevertheless smith took the opportunity while at oxford to teach himself several subjects by reading many books from the shelves of the large bodleian library when smith was not studying on his own his time at oxford was not a happy one according to his letters near the end of his time there smith began suffering from shaking fits probably the symptoms of a nervous breakdown he left oxford university in  before his scholarship ended in book v of the wealth of nations smith comments on the low quality of instruction and the meager intellectual activity at english universities when compared to their scottish counterparts he attributes this both to the rich endowments of the colleges at oxford and cambridge which made the income of professors independent of their ability to attract students and to the fact that distinguished men of letters could make an even more comfortable living as ministers of the church of england adam smiths discontent at oxford might be in part due to the absence of his beloved teacher in glasgow francis hutcheson hutcheson was well regarded as one of the most prominent lecturers at the university of glasgow in his day and earned the approbation of students colleagues and even ordinary residents with the fervor and earnestness of his orations which he sometimes opened to the public his lectures endeavoured not merely to teach philosophy but to make his students embody that philosophy in their lives appropriately acquiring the epithet the preacher of philosophy unlike smith hutcheson was not a system builder rather it was his magnetic personality and method of lecturing that so influenced his students and caused the greatest of those to reverentially refer to him as the never to be forgotten hutcheson—a title that smith in all his correspondence used to describe only two people his good friend david hume and influential mentor francis hutcheson teaching careeredit smith began delivering public lectures in  in edinburgh sponsored by the philosophical society of edinburgh under the patronage of lord kames his lecture topics included rhetoric and belleslettres and later the subject of the progress of opulence on this latter topic he first expounded his economic philosophy of the obvious and simple system of natural liberty while smith was not adept at public speaking his lectures met with success david hume was a friend and contemporary of smith in  he met the philosopher david hume who was his senior by more than a decade in their writings covering history politics philosophy economics and religion smith and hume shared closer intellectual and personal bonds than with other important figures of the scottish enlightenment in  smith earned a professorship at glasgow university teaching logic courses and in  he was elected a member of the philosophical society of edinburgh having been introduced to the society by lord kames when the head of moral philosophy in glasgow died the next year smith took over the position he worked as an academic for the next thirteen years which he characterised as by far the most useful and therefore by far the happiest and most honorable period of his life smith published the theory of moral sentiments in  embodying some of his glasgow lectures this work was concerned with how human morality depends on sympathy between agent and spectator or the individual and other members of society smith defined mutual sympathy as the basis of moral sentiments he based his explanation not on a special moral sense as the third lord shaftesbury and hutcheson had done nor on utility as hume did but on mutual sympathy a term best captured in modern parlance by the twentiethcentury concept of empathy the capacity to recognise feelings that are being experienced by another being following the publication of the theory of moral sentiments smith became so popular that many wealthy students left their schools in other countries to enroll at glasgow to learn under smith after the publication of the theory of moral sentiments smith began to give more attention to jurisprudence and economics in his lectures and less to his theories of morals for example smith lectured that the cause of increase in national wealth is labour rather than the nations quantity of gold or silver which is the basis for mercantilism the economic theory that dominated western european economic policies at the time françois quesnay one of the leaders of the physiocratic school of thought in  the university of glasgow conferred on smith the title of doctor of laws lld at the end of  he obtained an offer from charles townshend—who had been introduced to smith by david hume—to tutor his stepson henry scott the young duke of buccleuch smith then resigned from his professorship to take the tutoring position he subsequently attempted to return the fees he had collected from his students because he resigned in the middle of the term but his students refused tutoring and travelsedit smiths tutoring job entailed touring europe with scott during which time he educated scott on a variety of subjects—such as proper polish he was paid £ per year plus expenses along with a £ per year pension roughly twice his former income as a teacher smith first travelled as a tutor to toulouse france where he stayed for one and a half years according to his own account he found toulouse to be somewhat boring having written to hume that he had begun to write a book to pass away the time after touring the south of france the group moved to geneva where smith met with the philosopher voltaire from geneva the party moved to paris here smith came to know several great intellectual leaders of the time invariably having an effect on his future works this list included benjamin franklin turgot jean dalembert andré morellet helvétius and notably françois quesnay the head of the physiocratic school so impressed with his ideas smith considered dedicating the wealth of nations to him had quesnay not died beforehand physiocrats were opposed to mercantilism the dominating economic theory of the time illustrated in their motto laissez faire et laissez passer le monde va de lui même let do and let pass the world goes on by itself they were also known to have declared that only agricultural activity produced real wealth merchants and industrialists manufacturers did not this however did not represent their true school of thought but was a mere smoke screen manufactured to hide their actual criticisms of the nobility and church arguing that they made up the only real clients of merchants the wealth of france was virtually destroyed by louis xiv and louis xv in ruinous wars by aiding the american insurgents against the british and perhaps most destructive in terms of public perceptions was what was seen as the excessive consumption of goods and services deemed to have no economic contribution—unproductive labour assuming that nobility and church are essentially detractors from economic growth the feudal system of agriculture in france was the only sector important to maintain the wealth of the nation given that the english economy of the day yielded an income distribution that stood in contrast to that which existed in france smith concluded that the teachings and beliefs of physiocrats were with all their imperfections perhaps the nearest approximation to the truth that has yet been published upon the subject of political economy the distinction between productive versus unproductive labour—the physiocratic classe steril—was a predominant issue in the development and understanding of what would become classical economic theory later yearsedit in  henry scotts younger brother died in paris and smiths tour as a tutor ended shortly thereafter smith returned home that year to kirkcaldy and he devoted much of the next ten years to his magnum opus there he befriended henry moyes a young blind man who showed precocious aptitude as well as teaching moyes smith secured the patronage of david hume and thomas reid in the young mans education in may  smith was elected fellow of the royal society of london and was elected a member of the literary club in  the wealth of nations was published in  and was an instant success selling out its first edition in only six months in  smith was appointed to a post as commissioner of customs in scotland and went to live with his mother in panmure house in edinburghs canongate five years later as a member of the philosophical society of edinburgh when it received its royal charter he automatically became one of the founding members of the royal society of edinburgh and from  to  he occupied the honorary position of lord rector of the university of glasgow he died in the northern wing of panmure house in edinburgh on  july  after a painful illness and was buried in the canongate kirkyard on his death bed smith expressed disappointment that he had not achieved more smiths literary executors were two friends from the scottish academic world the physicist and chemist joseph black and the pioneering geologist james hutton smith left behind many notes and some unpublished material but gave instructions to destroy anything that was not fit for publication he mentioned an early unpublished history of astronomy as probably suitable and it duly appeared in  along with other material such as essays on philosophical subjects smiths library went by his will to david douglas lord reston son of his cousin colonel robert douglas of strathendry fife who lived with smith it was eventually divided between his two surviving children cecilia margaret mrs cunningham and david anne mrs bannerman on the death of her husband the reverend w b cunningham of prestonpans in  mrs cunningham sold some of the books the remainder passed to her son professor robert oliver cunningham of queens college belfast who presented a part to the library of queens college after his death the remaining books were sold on the death of mrs bannerman in  her portion of the library went intact to the new college of the free church edinburgh personality and beliefsedit characteredit james tassies enamel paste medallion of smith provided the model for many engravings and portraits that remain today not much is known about smiths personal views beyond what can be deduced from his published articles his personal papers were destroyed after his death at his request he never married and seems to have maintained a close relationship with his mother whom he lived with after his return from france and who died six years before his own death smith was described by several of his contemporaries and biographers as comically absentminded with peculiar habits of speech and gait and a smile of inexpressible benignity he was known to talk to himself a habit that began during his childhood when he would smile in rapt conversation with invisible companions he also had occasional spells of imaginary illness and he is reported to have had books and papers placed in tall stacks in his study according to one story smith took charles townshend on a tour of a tanning factory and while discussing free trade smith walked into a huge tanning pit from which he needed help to escape he is also said to have put bread and butter into a teapot drunk the concoction and declared it to be the worst cup of tea he ever had according to another account smith distractedly went out walking in his nightgown and ended up  miles  km outside of town before nearby church bells brought him back to reality james boswell who was a student of smiths at glasgow university and later knew him at the literary club says that smith thought that speaking about his ideas in conversation might reduce the sale of his books and so his conversation was unimpressive according to boswell he once told sir joshua reynolds that he made it a rule when in company never to talk of what he understood portrait of smith by john kay  smith has been alternately described as someone who had a large nose bulging eyes a protruding lower lip a nervous twitch and a speech impediment and one whose countenance was manly and agreeable smith is said to have acknowledged his looks at one point saying i am a beau in nothing but my books smith rarely sat for portraits so almost all depictions of him created during his lifetime were drawn from memory the bestknown portraits of smith are the profile by james tassie and two etchings by john kay the line engravings produced for the covers of th century reprints of the wealth of nations were based largely on tassies medallion religious viewsedit there has been considerable scholarly debate about the nature of smiths religious views smiths father had shown a strong interest in christianity and belonged to the moderate wing of the church of scotland the fact that adam smith received the snell exhibition suggests that he may have gone to oxford with the intention of pursuing a career in the church of england angloamerican economist ronald coase has challenged the view that smith was a deist based on the fact that smiths writings never explicitly invoke god as an explanation of the harmonies of the natural or the human worlds according to coase though smith does sometimes refer to the great architect of the universe later scholars such as jacob viner have very much exaggerated the extent to which adam smith was committed to a belief in a personal god a belief for which coase finds little evidence in passages such as the one in the wealth of nations in which smith writes that the curiosity of mankind about the great phenomena of nature such as the generation the life growth and dissolution of plants and animals has led men to enquire into their causes and that superstition first attempted to satisfy this curiosity by referring all those wonderful appearances to the immediate agency of the gods philosophy afterwards endeavoured to account for them from more familiar causes or from such as mankind were better acquainted with than the agency of the gods some other authors argue that smiths social and economic philosophy is inherently theological and that his entire model of social order is logically dependent on the notion of gods action in nature smith was also a close friend and later the executor of david hume who was commonly characterised in his own time as an atheist the publication in  of smiths letter to william strahan in which he described humes courage in the face of death in spite of his irreligiosity attracted considerable controversy published worksedit the theory of moral sentimentsedit main article the theory of moral sentiments  printing of an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations in  smith published his first work the theory of moral sentiments sold by copublishers andrew millar of london and alexander kincaid of edinburgh smith continued making extensive revisions to the book up until his deathn  although the wealth of nations is widely regarded as smiths most influential work it is believed that smith himself considered the theory of moral sentiments to be a superior work in the work smith critically examines the moral thinking of his time and suggests that conscience arises from dynamic and interactive social relationships through which people seek mutual sympathy of sentiments his goal in writing the work was to explain the source of mankinds ability to form moral judgement given that people begin life with no moral sentiments at all smith proposes a theory of sympathy in which the act of observing others and seeing the judgements they form of both others and oneself makes people aware of themselves and how others perceive their behavior the feedback we receive from perceiving or imagining others judgements creates an incentive to achieve mutual sympathy of sentiments with them and leads people to develop habits and then principles of behavior which come to constitute ones conscience some scholars have perceived a conflict between the theory of moral sentiments and the wealth of nations the former emphasises sympathy for others while the latter focuses on the role of selfinterest in recent years however some scholars of smiths work have argued that no contradiction exists they claim that in the theory of moral sentiments smith develops a theory of psychology in which individuals seek the approval of the impartial spectator as a result of a natural desire to have outside observers sympathise with their sentiments rather than viewing the theory of moral sentiments and the wealth of nations as presenting incompatible views of human nature some smith scholars regard the works as emphasising different aspects of human nature that vary depending on the situation otteson argues that both books are newtonian in their methodology and deploy a similar market model for explaining the creation and development of largescale human social orders including morality economics as well as language ekelund and hebert offer a differing view observing that selfinterest is present in both works and that in the former sympathy is the moral faculty that holds selfinterest in check whereas in the latter competition is the economic faculty that restrains selfinterest the wealth of nationsedit main article the wealth of nations later building on the site where smith wrote the wealth of nations there is disagreement between classical and neoclassical economists about the central message of smiths most influential work an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations  neoclassical economists emphasise smiths invisible hand a concept mentioned in the middle of his work – book iv chapter ii – and classical economists believe that smith stated his programme for promoting the wealth of nations in the first sentences which attributes the growth of wealth and prosperity to the division of labour smith used the term the invisible hand in history of astronomy referring to the invisible hand of jupiter and once in each of his the theory of moral sentiments  and the wealth of nations  this last statement about an invisible hand has been interpreted in numerous ways as every individual therefore endeavours as much as he can both to employ his capital in the support of domestic industry and so to direct that industry that its produce may be of the greatest value every individual necessarily labours to render the annual revenue of the society as great as he can he generally indeed neither intends to promote the public interest nor knows how much he is promoting it by preferring the support of domestic to that of foreign industry he intends only his own security and by directing that industry in such a manner as its produce may be of the greatest value he intends only his own gain and he is in this as in many other cases led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of his intention nor is it always the worse for the society that it was no part of it by pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society more effectually than when he really intends to promote it i have never known much good done by those who affected to trade for the public good it is an affectation indeed not very common among merchants and very few words need be employed in dissuading them from it those who regard that statement as smiths central message also quote frequently smiths dictum it is not from the benevolence of the butcher the brewer or the baker that we expect our dinner but from their regard to their own interest we address ourselves not to their humanity but to their selflove and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their advantages the first page of the wealth of nations  london edition smiths statement about the benefits of an invisible hand may be meant to answercitation needed mandevilles contention that private vices … may be turned into public benefits it shows smiths belief that when an individual pursues his selfinterest under conditions of justice he unintentionally promotes the good of society selfinterested competition in the free market he argued would tend to benefit society as a whole by keeping prices low while still building in an incentive for a wide variety of goods and services nevertheless he was wary of businessmen and warned of their conspiracy against the public or in some other contrivance to raise prices again and again smith warned of the collusive nature of business interests which may form cabals or monopolies fixing the highest price which can be squeezed out of the buyers smith also warned that a businessdominated political system would allow a conspiracy of businesses and industry against consumers with the former scheming to influence politics and legislation smith states that the interest of manufacturers and merchants in any particular branch of trade or manufactures is always in some respects different from and even opposite to that of the publicthe proposal of any new law or regulation of commerce which comes from this order ought always to be listened to with great precaution and ought never be adopted till after having been long and carefully examined not only with the most scrupulous but with the most suspicious attention thus smiths chief worry seems to be when business is given special protections or privileges from government by contrast in the absence of such special political favours he believed that business activities were generally beneficial to the whole society it is the great multiplication of the production of all the different arts in consequence of the division of labour which occasions in a wellgoverned society that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people every workman has a great quantity of his own work to dispose of beyond what he himself has occasion for and every other workman being exactly in the same situation he is enabled to exchange a great quantity of his own goods for a great quantity or what comes to the same thing for the price of a great quantity of theirs he supplies them abundantly with what they have occasion for and they accommodate him as amply with what he has occasion for and a general plenty diffuses itself through all the different ranks of society the wealth of nations ii the neoclassical interest in smiths statement about an invisible hand originates in the possibility to see it as a precursor of neoclassical economics and its general equilibrium concept samuelsons economics refers  times to smiths invisible hand to emphasise this relation samuelson quotes smiths invisible hand statement putting general interest where smith wrote public interest samuelson concluded smith was unable to prove the essence of his invisiblehand doctrine indeed until the s no one knew how to prove even to state properly the kernel of truth in this proposition about perfectly competitive market very differently classical economists see in smiths first sentences his programme to promote the wealth of nations taking up the physiocratical concept of the economy as a circular process means that to have growth the inputs of period must excel the inputs of period therefore the outputs of period not used or usable as input of period are regarded as unproductive labour as they do not contribute to growth this is what smith had heard in france from among others quesnay to this french insight that unproductive labour should be pushed back to use labour more productively smith added his own proposal that productive labour should be made even more productive by deepening the division of labour smith argued that deepening the division of labour under competition leads to greater productivity which leads to lower prices and thus an increasing standard of living—general plenty and universal opulence—for all extended markets and increased production lead to continuous reorganisation of production and inventing new ways of producing which lead to further increased production lower prices and increased standards of living smiths central message is therefore that under dynamic competition a growth machine secures the wealth of nations smiths argument predicted britains evolution as the workshop of the world underselling and outproducing all its competitors the opening sentences of the wealth of nations summarise this policy the annual labour of every nation is the fund which originally supplies it with all the necessaries and conveniences of life which it annually consumes …  this produce … bears a greater or smaller proportion to the number of those who are to consume it … but this proportion must in every nation be regulated by two different circumstances first by the skill dexterity and judgment with which its labour is generally applied and secondly by the proportion between the number of those who are employed in useful labour and that of those who are not so employed emphasis added smith added however that the abundance or scantiness of this supply too seems to depend more upon the former of those two circumstances than upon the latter criticism and dissentedit alfred marshall criticised smiths definition of economy on several points he argued that man should be equally important as money services are as important as goods and that there must be an emphasis on human welfare instead of just wealth the invisible hand only works well when both production and consumption operates in free markets with small atomistic producers and consumers allowing supply and demand to fluctuate and equilibrate in conditions of monopoly and oligopoly the invisible hand fails nobel prizewinning economist joseph e stiglitz says on the topic of one of smiths better known ideas the reason that the invisible hand often seems invisible is that it is often not there other worksedit smiths burial place in canongate kirkyard shortly before his death smith had nearly all his manuscripts destroyed in his last years he seemed to have been planning two major treatises one on the theory and history of law and one on the sciences and arts the posthumously published essays on philosophical subjects a history of astronomy down to smiths own era plus some thoughts on ancient physics and metaphysics probably contain parts of what would have been the latter treatise lectures on jurisprudence were notes taken from smiths early lectures plus an early draft of the wealth of nations published as part of the  glasgow edition of the works and correspondence of smith other works including some published posthumously include lectures on justice police revenue and arms  first published in  and essays on philosophical subjects  legacyedit in economics and moral philosophyedit the wealth of nations was a precursor to the modern academic discipline of economics in this and other works smith expounded how rational selfinterest and competition can lead to economic prosperity smith was controversial in his own day and his general approach and writing style were often satirised by tory writers in the moralising tradition of hogarth and swift as a discussion at the university of winchester suggests in  the wealth of nations was named among the  best scottish books of all time former uk prime minister margaret thatcher it is said used to carry a copy of the book in her handbag in light of the arguments put forward by smith and other economic theorists in britain academic belief in mercantilism began to decline in britain in the late th century during the industrial revolution britain embraced free trade and smiths laissezfaire economics and via the british empire used its power to spread a broadly liberal economic model around the world characterised by open markets and relatively barrier free domestic and international trade george stigler attributes to smith the most important substantive proposition in all of economics it is that under competition owners of resources for example labour land and capital will use them most profitably resulting in an equal rate of return in equilibrium for all uses adjusted for apparent differences arising from such factors as training trust hardship and unemployment paul samuelson finds in smiths pluralist use of supply and demand as applied to wages rents and profit a valid and valuable anticipation of the general equilibrium modelling of walras a century later smiths allowance for wage increases in the short and intermediate term from capital accumulation and invention contrasted with malthus ricardo and karl marx in their propounding a rigid subsistence–wage theory of labour supply joseph schumpeter criticised smith for a lack of technical rigor yet he argued that this enabled smiths writings to appeal to wider audiences his very limitation made for success had he been more brilliant he would not have been taken so seriously had he dug more deeply had he unearthed more recondite truth had he used more difficult and ingenious methods he would not have been understood but he had no such ambitions in fact he disliked whatever went beyond plain common sense he never moved above the heads of even the dullest readers he led them on gently encouraging them by trivialities and homely observations making them feel comfortable all along classical economists presented competing theories of those of smith termed the labour theory of value later marxian economics descending from classical economics also use smiths labour theories in part the first volume of karl marxs major work capital was published in german in  in it marx focused on the labour theory of value and what he considered to be the exploitation of labour by capital the labour theory of value held that the value of a thing was determined by the labour that went into its production this contrasts with the modern contention of neoclassical economics that the value of a thing is determined by what one is willing to give up to obtain the thing the adam smith theatre in kirkcaldy the body of theory later termed neoclassical economics or marginalism formed from about  to  the term economics was popularised by such neoclassical economists as alfred marshall as a concise synonym for economic science and a substitute for the earlier broader term political economy used by smith this corresponded to the influence on the subject of mathematical methods used in the natural sciences neoclassical economics systematised supply and demand as joint determinants of price and quantity in market equilibrium affecting both the allocation of output and the distribution of income it dispensed with the labour theory of value of which smith was most famously identified with in classical economics in favour of a marginal utility theory of value on the demand side and a more general theory of costs on the supply side the bicentennial anniversary of the publication of the wealth of nations was celebrated in  resulting in increased interest for the theory of moral sentiments and his other works throughout academia after  smith was more likely to be represented as the author of both the wealth of nations and the theory of moral sentiments and thereby as the founder of a moral philosophy and the science of economics his homo economicus or economic man was also more often represented as a moral person additionally economists david levy and sandra peart in the secret history of the dismal science point to his opposition to hierarchy and beliefs in inequality including racial inequality and provide additional support for those who point to smiths opposition to slavery colonialism and empire they show the caricatures of smith drawn by the opponents of views on hierarchy and inequality in this online article emphasised also are smiths statements of the need for high wages for the poor and the efforts to keep wages low in the vanity of the philosopher from equality to hierarchy in postclassical economics peart and levy also cite smiths view that a common street porter was not intellectually inferior to a philosopher and point to the need for greater appreciation of the public views in discussions of science and other subjects now considered to be technical they also cite smiths opposition to the often expressed view that science is superior to common sense smith also explained the relationship between growth of private property and civil government men may live together in society with some tolerable degree of security though there is no civil magistrate to protect them from the injustice of those passions but avarice and ambition in the rich in the poor the hatred of labour and the love of present ease and enjoyment are the passions which prompt to invade property passions much more steady in their operation and much more universal in their influence wherever there is great property there is great inequality for one very rich man there must be at least five hundred poor and the affluence of the few supposes the indigence of the many the affluence of the rich excites the indignation of the poor who are often both driven by want and prompted by envy to invade his possessions it is only under the shelter of the civil magistrate that the owner of that valuable property which is acquired by the labour of many years or perhaps of many successive generations can sleep a single night in security he is at all times surrounded by unknown enemies whom though he never provoked he can never appease and from whose injustice he can be protected only by the powerful arm of the civil magistrate continually held up to chastise it the acquisition of valuable and extensive property therefore necessarily requires the establishment of civil government where there is no property or at least none that exceeds the value of two or three days labour civil government is not so necessary civil government supposes a certain subordination but as the necessity of civil government gradually grows up with the acquisition of valuable property so the principal causes which naturally introduce subordination gradually grow up with the growth of that valuable property … men of inferior wealth combine to defend those of superior wealth in the possession of their property in order that men of superior wealth may combine to defend them in the possession of theirs all the inferior shepherds and herdsmen feel that the security of their own herds and flocks depends upon the security of those of the great shepherd or herdsman that the maintenance of their lesser authority depends upon that of his greater authority and that upon their subordination to him depends his power of keeping their inferiors in subordination to them they constitute a sort of little nobility who feel themselves interested to defend the property and to support the authority of their own little sovereign in order that he may be able to defend their property and to support their authority civil government so far as it is instituted for the security of property is in reality instituted for the defence of the rich against the poor or of those who have some property against those who have none at all source the wealth of nations book  chapter  part  in british imperial debatesedit smiths chapter on colonies in turn would help shape british imperial debates from the midnineteenth century onward the wealth of nations would become an ambiguous text regarding the imperial question in his chapter on colonies smith pondered how to solve the crisis developing across the atlantic among the empires thirteen american colonies he offered two different proposals for easing tensions the first proposal called for giving the colonies their independence and by thus parting on a friendly basis britain would be able to develop and maintain a freetrade relationship with them and possibly even an informal military alliance smiths second proposal called for a theoretical imperial federation that would bring the colonies and the metropole closer together through an imperial parliamentary system and imperial free trade smiths most prominent disciple in nineteenthcentury britain peace advocate richard cobden preferred the first proposal cobden would lead the anticorn law league in overturning the corn laws in  shifting britain to a policy of free trade and empire on the cheap for decades to come this handsoff approach toward the british empire would become known as cobdenism or the manchester school by the turn of the century however advocates of smiths second proposal such as joseph shield nicholson would become ever more vocal in opposing cobdenism calling instead for imperial federation as marcwilliam palen notes on the one hand adam smith’s late nineteenth and early twentiethcentury cobdenite adherents used his theories to argue for gradual imperial devolution and empire ‘on the cheap’ on the other various proponents of imperial federation throughout the british world sought to use smith’s theories to overturn the predominant cobdenite handsoff imperial approach and instead with a firm grip bring the empire closer than ever before smiths ideas thus played an important part in subsequent debates over the british empire portraits monuments and banknotesedit a statue of smith in edinburghs high street erected through private donations organised by the adam smith institute smith has been commemorated in the uk on banknotes printed by two different banks his portrait has appeared since  on the £ notes issued by the clydesdale bank in scotland and in march  smiths image also appeared on the new series of £ notes issued by the bank of england making him the first

the moregeneral set of principles that brought conceptual clarity to the seeming chaos of market transactions greenspan continues that the wealth of nations was one of the great achievements in human

overstated herbert stein wrote that the people who wear an adam smith necktie do it to make a statement of their devotion to the idea of free markets and limited government and that this misrepresents smiths ideas stein writes that smith was not pure or doctrinaire about this idea he viewed government intervention in the market with great skepticismyet he was prepared to accept or propose qualifications to that policy in the specific cases where he judged that their net effect would be beneficial and would not undermine the basically free character of the system he did not wear the adam smith necktie in steins reading the wealth of nations could justify the food and drug administration the consumer product safety commission mandatory employer health benefits environmentalism and discriminatory taxation to deter improper or luxurious behavior similarly vivienne brown stated in the economic journal that in the th century united states reaganomics supporters the wall street journal and other similar sources have spread among the general public a partial and misleading vision of smith portraying him as an extreme dogmatic defender of laissezfaire capitalism and supplyside economics in fact the wealth of nations includes the following statement on the payment of taxes the subjects of every state ought to contribute towards the support of the government as nearly as possible in proportion to their respective abilities that is in proportion to the revenue which they respectively enjoy under the protection of the state some commentators have argued that smiths works show support for a progressive not flat income tax and that he specifically named taxes that he thought should be required by the state among them luxury goods taxes and tax on rent yet smith argued for the impossibility of taxing the people in proportion to their economic revenue by any capitation the wealth of nations viik smith argued that taxes should principally go toward protecting justice and certain publick institutions that were necessary for the benefit of all of society but that could not be provided by private enterprise the wealth of nations ivix additionally smith outlined the proper expenses of the government in the wealth of nations book v ch i included in his requirements of a government is to enforce contracts and provide justice system grant patents and copy rights provide public goods such as infrastructure provide national defence and regulate banking it was the role of the government to provide goods of such a nature that the profit could never repay the expense to any individual such as roads bridges canals and harbours he also encouraged invention and new ideas through his patent enforcement and support of infant industry monopolies he supported partial public subsidies for elementary education and he believed that competition among religious institutions would provide general benefit to the society in such cases however smith argued for local rather than centralised control even those publick works which are of such a nature that they cannot afford any revenue for maintaining themselves    are always better maintained by a local or provincial revenue under the management of a local and provincial administration than by the general revenue of the state wealth of nations vid finally he outlined how the government should support the dignity of the monarch or chief magistrate such that they are equal or above the public in fashion he even states that monarchs should be provided for in a greater fashion than magistrates of a republic because we naturally expect more splendor in the court of a king than in the mansionhouse of a doge in addition he allowed that in some specific circumstances retaliatory tariffs may be beneficial the recovery of a great foreign market will generally more than compensate the transitory inconvenience of paying dearer during a short time for some sorts of goods he added however that in general a retaliatory tariff seems a bad method of compensating the injury done to certain classes of our people to do another injury ourselves not only to those classes but to almost all the other classes of them the wealth of nations ivii economic historians such as jacob viner regard smith as a strong advocate of free markets and limited government what smith called natural liberty but not as a dogmatic supporter of laissezfaire economist daniel klein believes using the term free market economics or free market economist to identify the ideas of smith is too general and slightly misleading klein offers six characteristics central to the identity of smiths economic thought and argues that a new name is needed to give a more accurate depiction of the smithian identity economist david ricardo set straight some of the misunderstandings about smiths thoughts on free market most people still fall victim to the thinking that smith was a free market economist without exception though he was not ricardo pointed out that smith was in support of helping infant industries smith believed that the government should subsidise newly formed industry but he did fear that when the infant industry grew into adulthood it would be unwilling to surrender the government help smith also supported tariffs on imported goods to counteract an internal tax on the same good smith also fell to pressure in supporting some tariffs in support for national defence some have also claimed emma rothschild among them that smith would have supported a minimum wage although there is no direct textual evidence supporting the claim indeed smith wrote the price of labour it must be observed cannot be ascertained very accurately anywhere different prices being often paid at the same place and for the same sort of labour not only according to the different abilities of the workmen but according to the easiness or hardness of the masters where wages are not regulated by law all that we can pretend to determine is what are the most usual and experience seems to show that law can never regulate them properly though it has often pretended to do so the wealth of nations book  chapter  smith also noted a rough equality of bargaining power a landlord a farmer a master manufacturer a merchant though they did not employ a single workman could generally live a year or two upon the stocks which they have already acquired many workmen could not subsist a week few could subsist a month and scarce any a year without employment in the long run the workman may be as necessary to his master as his master is to him but the necessity is not so immediate see alsoedit organizational capital list of abolitionist forerunners list of fellows of the royal society of arts notesedit  in life of adam smith rae writes in his fourth year while on a visit to his grandfathers house at strathendry on the banks of the leven smith was stolen by a passing band of gypsies and for a time could not be found but presently a gentleman arrived who had met a gypsy woman a few miles down the road carrying a child that was crying piteously scouts were immediately dispatched in the direction indicated and they came upon the woman in leslie wood as soon as she saw them she threw her burden down and escaped and the child was brought back to his mother smith would have made i fear a poor gypsy  the  editions
