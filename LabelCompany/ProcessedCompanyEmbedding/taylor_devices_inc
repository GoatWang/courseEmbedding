structures the company manufactures and sells a single group of similar products that have a range of applications for customers the companys product categories include seismic dampers fluidicshoks crane and industrial buffers selfadjusting shock absorbers liquid die springs and vibration dampersthe companys seismic dampers are designed to ameliorate the effects of earthquake tremors on structures as of may   fluidicshoks were small extremely compact shock absorbers with up to  inchpound capacities produced in  standard sizes for primary use in the defense aerospace and commercial industry as of may   crane and industrial buffers were larger versions of the fluidicshoks with up to  inchpound capacities produced in over  standard sizes for industrial application on cranes ships container ships railroad cars truck docks ladle and ingot cars ore trolleys and car stops selfadjusting shock absorbers which include versions of fluidicshoks and crane and industrial buffers automatically adjust to different impact conditions and are designed for high cycle application primarily in heavy industry liquid die springs are used as component parts of machinery and equipment used in the manufacture of tools and dies vibration dampers are used primarily by the aerospace and defense industries to control the response of electronics and optical systems subjected to air ship

springs machined springs introduction home   machined springs taylor devices’ machined springs offer high precision lightweight tensioncompression operation linearity long life and repeatability – with a selection of metal alloys limited only by the imagination originally developed and qualified for military systems our machined springs are used today on diverse applications including the international space station newly deployed helicopters commercial aircraft engines space vehicle rocket engines aircraft cargo handling systems an abort system for a nasa rocket a classified us navy shipboard shock mitigation system and precision vibration isolation systems for airborne military optical systems among many others highly precise analytical capabilities as well as unique manufacturing processes allow taylor devices to produce machined springs to extremely stringent customer requirements benefits of machined springs include precision control of spring rate usually ± or better tuning to establish a specific load at a specified height materials including high strength steels stainless steels and various high temperature alloys designed for ultimate fatigue resistance simultaneous control of spring rate for operation in compression tension shear and torsion machinedin end fittings provide easy and rigid attachment available styles include helical double start helical and nontwisting beam types maximum corrosion resistance by using various special alloys and special coatings accurately tunable to a specific natural frequency high linearity – machined springs are inherently linear because residual stresses are eliminated and the coils never rest against each other as the spring deflects  spring rate is the same in both tension and compression damping can be added using special materials onepiece construction – mounting flanges attachment threads and other fittings can be part of the machined spring  the spring can be an integral part of the machine instead of an addon taylor devices’ machined springs are designed and manufactured for each specific application  simply provide us with your desired specifications and we will promptly
