home  akoustis technologies home mattlopane t smart selectivity solutions about us founded in  by experienced industry leaders and scientists from university of california at santa barbara ucsb and cornell university akoustis’ mission is to commercialize and manufacture its patented bulkone® acoustic wave technology to address the critical frequencyselectivity requirements in today’s mobile smartphones – improving the efficiency and signal quality of mobile wireless devices and enabling the internet of things iot the bulk acoustic wave baw filter market is rapidly expanding driven by growth in glte and the number of filters required per device baw filters have evolved as the key differentiator in the rf wireless frontend as nearly half of the rf power generated by the pa is subsequently dissipated as heat in the filter as a result the power amplifier must be overdesigned by as much as x to accommodate for this filter loss increasing the cost of the frontend negatively impacting the front end thermal management and ultimately reducing battery life furthermore such frontend losses contribute to humantissue heating when the mobile device is held against the head or attached to the body in the case of wearable rf devices akoustis® addresses this critical mobilewireless need by using single crystal piezoelectric materials to create a new class of acoustic wave filters – improving performance lowering cost and driving miniaturization akoustis’ bulk one® filters originate from materials which exhibit  better acoustic performance when compared to the incumbent

founded in  by experienced industry leaders and scientists from university of california at santa barbara ucsb and cornell university akoustis’ mission is to commercialize and manufacture its patented bulkone® acoustic wave technology to address the critical frequencyselectivity requirements in today’s mobile smartphones – improving the efficiency and signal quality of mobile wireless devices and enabling the internet of things iot the bulk acoustic wave baw filter market is rapidly expanding driven by growth in glte and the number of filters required per device baw filters have evolved as the key differentiator in the rf wireless frontend as nearly half of the rf power generated by the pa is subsequently dissipated as heat in the filter as a result the power amplifier must be overdesigned by as much as x to accommodate for this filter loss increasing the cost of the frontend negatively impacting the front end thermal management and ultimately reducing battery life furthermore such frontend losses contribute to humantissue heating when the mobile device is held against the head or attached to the body in the case of wearable rf devices akoustis® addresses this critical mobilewireless need by using single crystal piezoelectric materials to create a new class of acoustic wave filters – improving performance lowering cost and driving miniaturization akoustis’ bulk one® filters originate from materials which exhibit  better acoustic performance when compared to the incumbent thinfilm technologies deployed today” learn more managementboardmediapartnersaffiliations
