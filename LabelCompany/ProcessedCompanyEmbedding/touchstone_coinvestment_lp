financial condition of an issuer andor general economic conditions that can cause the issuer to not make timely payments of principal and interest also causing the securities to decline in value and an investor can lose principal when interest rates rise the price of debt securities generally falls longer term securities are generally more volatile the fund invests in noninvestment grade debt securities distressed securities and corporate loans which are considered speculative with respect to the issuers ability to make timely payments of interest and principal may lack liquidity and have more frequent and larger price changes than other debt securities there is a high risk that the fund could suffer losses from investments in noninvestment grade debt securities caused by the default of an issuer the fund invests in collateralized loan obligations clos that have risks that largely depend on the type of underlying collateral and risks may include illiquidity limited active market

fund may invest in derivatives futures contracts options and swap agreements for speculative purposes derivatives can be highly volatile illiquid and difficult to value subject to counterparty and leverage risks and there is risk that changes in the value of a derivative held by the fund will not correlate with the funds other investments gains or losses from speculative positions in a derivative may be much greater than the original cost and potential losses may be substantial the fund is involved in short selling which may result in additional costs associated with covering short positions and a possibility of unlimited loss the fund is nondiversified which means that it may invest a greater percentage of its assets in the securities of a limited number of issuers and may be
