indicates explosive growth in global social networking and browserbased file sharing on corporate networks with a  percent increase in active social networking eg posting applications compared with activity during the same period in the latter half of  the palo alto networks application usage and risk report provides a global view into application usage based on assessments of the raw application traffic from more than  enterprises between april  and november  whether or not employees are using social networks or sharing files at work is no longer a question this data clearly demonstrates that users are embracing and actively using such applications said rené bonvanie chief marketing officer at palo alto networks companies must determine how to safely enable these technologies on their networks so that users can maintain the levels of productivity that many of these applications can afford while at the same time ensuring that their corporate networks and users are protected against all threats the report focuses on three primary findings social media use is more active twitter has gained significant mainstream traction in the workplace since october  social networking usage patterns have become more active with bandwidth consumption for facebook apps social plugins and posting increasing from  percent october  to  percent december  when measured as a percentage of total social networking bandwidth twitter browsing at work alone grew by more than  percent yearoveryear widespread file sharing use requires a balanced response file sharing sites continue to be used on most networks appearing on the networks of  percent of the participating organizations in total  different browserbased filesharing variants were found with an average of  being used in each of the analyzed organizations the report also explores a variety of risks associated with browserbased filesharing applications which varies by application and use case however the use of evasive techniques by these applications implies that they are often operating unchecked on corporate networks the types of traffic on enterprise networks is changing web applications that use tcp port  the standard port associated with http web browsing traffic actually represent a minority of the traffic on enterprise networks for the first time ever the  applications that use only tcp port  and no other port by default represent a mere  percent of the applications and  percent of the bandwidth observed meaning that a standard web browsingfocused security model actually protects a minority of an organizations traffic this is the largest sample size of actual application traffic from enterprises worldwide that we have analyzed since we began this area of research in spring  said matt keil senior research analyst at palo alto networks the most surprising finding from this data is the one that is most counterintuitive nonwebbased traffic and application use is much more significant than most people think application and threat information information on the more than  applications that are identified by palo alto networks can be found in applipedia part of the
