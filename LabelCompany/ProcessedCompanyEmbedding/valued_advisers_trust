living trust  how to protect your assets how to protect your assets menu  mistakes to avoid when setting up a living trust what exactly is a living trusta living trust is a document that like a will specifies the desires of the estate owner known legally as a grantor except that these desires are specified while the grantor is still living a grantor may indicate through a living trust that he or she wants heir john doe to inherit a specific piece of property upon the grantor’s death for example while a living trust may not be the best solution in all cases involving estates there are some benefits to it why should you have a living trusta primary reason why many grantors choose to do this is so that their heirs can avoid the probate costs and time associated with traditional wills sometimes individuals with involved family or financial decisions can benefit by using a living trust instead of a will and if a grantor suddenly becomes ill or incapacitated during his or her lifetime then a living trust allows the grantor’s trustee to make estate decisions on his or her behalfliving trusts can be both convenient and complicateda living trust is designed to be administered by an individual other than the grantor in this type of trust’s case the individual is known as a successor trustee it is the responsibility of this trustee to see that the terms of the living trust are carried out per the grantor’s wishes upon his or her death it is possible to disperse an estate while the grantor is still living this type of living trust is known as an irrevocable living trust and can reduce estate taxes for heirs doing so means that the grantor is permanently giving away property and cannot legally reclaim it a revocable living trust allows the grantor to retain control of the estate and make changes to the trust right up until the time of his or her death in this case estates don’t have to go through probate but are taxed whatever trust type that you’re interested in be aware that it’s easy to make mistakes that can render the document invaliderrors to beware in preparing a trust you don’t legally establish that you are placing specific property in a living trustif you don’t do so then it’s not valid in other words it’s not enough to simply tell everyone you’re leaving john doe your house this is why it’s an excellent idea to hire an attorney to prepare this trust for you  your trust doesn’t state specific instructionsremember there is a reason why you are placing money or property in a trust if those reasons aren’t clearly stated you’re leaving john doe that house so that he can run it as a cat sanctuary then the trust isn’t legally binding you don’t keep the trust updatedfinances change and families both grow and shrink so it’s important to review such trusts annually preferably with the assistance of an attorney other things to keep in mindtrusts must also be “funded” something such as property or money must be officially placed in the trust before it can be binding and trusts without specifically named beneficiaries that’s you john doe generally aren’t honored by courts and make sure that you allow yourself plenty of time for the setting up of such trusts just as you would a will remember in both cases this may be your last chance to provide for and protect loved ones tweet recent posts  mistakes to avoid when setting up a
