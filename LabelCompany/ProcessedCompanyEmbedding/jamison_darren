fourth quarter and fiscal yearend  financial results ended on march   at this time all participants are in a listenonly mode later we will conduct a questionandanswer session and instructions will be given at that time operator instructions as a reminder today’s conference is being recorded i would now like to turn the call over to ms jayme brooks chief financial officer and chief accounting officer ma’am you may begin jayme brooks thank you good afternoon and thank you for joining today’s fiscal  fourth quarter and yearend conference call today capstone filed its annual report on form k with the securities and exchange commission during the call we will be referring to slides that can be found on our web site under the investor relations tab i would like to remind everyone that this conference call contains estimates and forwardlooking statements that represent the company’s views as of today june   capstone disclaims any obligation to update or revise these statements to reflect future events or circumstances you should not place undue reliance on these forwardlooking statements because they involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that are in some cases beyond our control please refer to the safe harbor provisions set forth in the slides and in today’s earnings release and in capstone’s filings with the securities and exchange commission for information concerning factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such statements i would now like to turn the call over to darren jamison president and chief executive officer darren jamison thank you jayme i’ll be starting off the call today by talking about our positive fourth quarter results and then go into more detail on what we have accomplished this fiscal year to substantially improve the business i’ll then turn the call back over to jayme who will review the specific financial results for the full fiscal year i’ll then close the call by discussing our goals for fiscal  and the overall future vision of the company let’s go and turn to slide  slide  lists some of the fourth quarter financial highlights overall i’m extremely pleased with the results in the fourth quarter as revenue increased  to  million from the third quarter which was the highest revenue in seven quarters however more importantly cash increased  in the quarter as a result of improved revenue positive changes in working capital additional borrowings on the line of credit and continued tight expense controls overall cash used in operations decreased  over the prior quarter which in turn was down from the second quarter in our current business environment i have to say that cash is king but cash flow is queen another key highlight is our accessories parts and service revenue which reached  million for the quarter against our mediumterm profitability goal of  million per quarter also very exciting was that our booktobill ratio was  to  for the fourth quarter of fiscal  and net product orders were the strongest in nine quarters at over  million however for me the most important development was the lowest loss from operations in the last  quarters the last time our loss from operations was this low we had  million in quarterly revenue which coincidently was the highest in the company’s history i think this really highlights the tectonic shift of our business that we’re experiencing as we diversify our business into the energy efficiency market and lower our dependence on the revenue from the oil and gas market the shift is driving our aftermarket longterm service contracts our fpp business as chp customers are signing fpp agreements at much higher rates than the oil and gas customers that already have trained onsite personnel to maintain sophisticated equipments such as microturbines this is what we refer to as our fpp attachment rate this shift to higher margin aftermarket service business which includes accessories parts and longterm fpp service revenue when combined with our lower operating expenses has changed our business substantially and makes us much much more stable and viable and we believe leads to a more robust longterm profitability model let’s go and turn to slide  slide  shows our past oil and gas centric business model today’s current more balanced business model and our future projections the future projection audio gap acceleration of revenue growth as a result of reaching adjusted ebitda breakeven and getting larger customers to become more comfortable with our overall viability as you see our breakeven has dropped from  million a quarter to  million a quarter and we are much less reliant on unpredictable quarterly product revenue a couple solid quarters are nice but let’s look back at the entire fiscal  and see what we’ve accomplished fiscal  proved to be a pivotal year for capstone as the company continued to make clear and distinct progress from shortterm sustainability and mediumterm profitability let’s go and turn our attention to slide  slide  looks at the threepronged plan we had for the last year the first goal management set was a goal of reducing quarterly operating expenses by  and i’m proud to report that in q fiscal  we exceeded this goal and operating expenses were down  versus the first quarter of fiscal  when we started this critical initiative operating expenses went from  million in q of fiscal  to  million in q of fiscal  and we continued these same reduced levels in the fiscal fourth quarter again just to stress this is the lowest level of operating expenses since  or approximately  years to achieve this goal during fiscal  capstone management waged war on operating expenses from the boardroom to the shop floor from hightemp steels alloys to coffee nothing was off limits as a result of these actions total operating expenses for capstone during the year dropped from  million annually to  million which is a net reduction of  million annually as impressive as these cost reductions are in  management is not finished and the war on costs rages on we are in the process of consolidating our key manufacturing operations into one single location and we’ll continue to look at creative new ways to reduce operating costs and eliminate waste from our business let’s turn to slide  slide  highlights some of the q onetime charges or onetime adjustments and more importantly the continued cost reductions not yet realized in our future operating expenses i’m proud to say the new goal for fiscal  is to drive operating expenses further down to  million per quarter or  million annually and then further down to  million or  million annually in fiscal  after we achieve our facility consolidation these new lower operating expenses and our lean business operations have lowered our breakeven levels reduced our cash usage increased our sustainability and viability in fact looking at our operating expenses compared to other clean tech companies let’s take a look at slide  if you look at slide  we are currently  lower than the average of four other similar small cap distributor generation clean tech companies in our space if you look at the most recent quarterly numbers capstone beat the average in quarterly revenue beats the average in gross margin and beats the average in ebitda and quarterly cash rate is lower than the average as well if you force rank the group capstone has the second highest quarterly revenue the lowest operating expenses by far and is the closest to reach an ebitda breakeven of anyone in this group the only areas capstone is not significantly above the group average or leading is in the cash balance and market cap our market cap we traded significant discounts to that of the other companies i believe because of our perceived heavy reliance on the oil and gas market so let’s go back to slide  the next goal we had for fiscal  was to develop a new chp product and to grow and diversify our markets into the energy efficiency space and minimize our exposure to the volatile oil and gas markets during the year capstone unveiled several innovative and new products including additions to our signature series product line that were specifically designed for chp and cchp all of capstone’s new signature series include over  system design and performance improvements that the original signature series product has some of the improvements include improved noise reduction year marine grade paint relocation of the engine exhaust stack redesigned discharge for enclosure cooling air integrated heat recovery module for chp and cchp applications twostage air filtration and the lists goes on in addition to the launch of these three new products capstone finetuned both systems that fit into smaller sturdier enclosures to further reduce installation footprint installation costs and shipping costs i’m proud to say our new signature series products are performing very well in the field and the fpp contract backlog has grown  over the last  months to an impressive  million let’s go and turn our focus to slide  slide  highlights this improvement in a market vertical diversification with a nearterm management goal of  energy efficiency or chp  oil and gas and  renewables and other as part of this goal was to increase sales in new geographic markets as well as diversifying our market verticals within those new geographies capstone partnered during the year with nine new distributors to improve our geographic diversification slide  highlights our much improved market diversification and growth within asia and australia latin america africa and the middle east our growing sales pipeline jumped  million recently to a record  billion this pipeline reflects all the identified sales opportunities that our distributors have entered into our customer relationship system which better equips us in monitoring our overall sales cycle process during fiscal  in order to improve geographic diversification as i said capstone added the following new distribution partners to our global distribution family bmtec and dv energy in russia to expand our russian marketing presence cal microturbine in the critical california market eed international in singapore inmatech ph in saudi arabia optimal south pacific in australia oseg ltd ph in israel synergy astana in kazakhstan and viridis consult in malaysia capstone also secured critical projects in high growth geographies such as africa latin america the middle east and south east asia today i’m proud to say we are much more diversified and not as susceptible to macroeconomic events in any single market as we have been in the past with our previous heavy exposure to oil and gas and the russian market now if we go back to slide  one more time the third goal for management was the development of capstone financing solution and to create a power purchase agreement or ppa business capstone formed a joint venture subsidiary capstone energy finance or cef at the end of fiscal  where capstone partnered with global independent power producer sky solar in fiscal  to provide up to  million in potential future funding for cef now let’s go and turn our attention to slide  slide  you can see we have several projects in contract negotiation and several term sheets in legal review cef recently added equipment leasing and our nearterm goal is to add limited shortterm rentals as well although i’d say we have yet to fully accomplish this goal which is nonetheless disappointing to me the cef’s project pipeline has grown and includes  million of microturbine product which is very encouraging as i would be satisfied if cef added just  to our top line revenue in fiscal  but that wasn’t all another financing activity during the year in order to better support our key distribution partners capstone tapped full service advisory firm increases to help build  million product financing program for our key distribution partners that would provide better payment terms and better cash flow for capstone as i said earlier cash is king but cash flow is queen last but not least we just announced a new banking relationship with bridge bank last week not only will this new  million revolving credit facility provide us with an increase in borrowing availability compared to our old facility but the overall total cost of capital of the facility will also be reduced all right let’s go ahead and turn to slide  this is a very important slide slide  highlights our aftermarket service business growth the growth of our aftermarket service business is key to our shortterm viability and mediumterm profitability the fiscal  combined accessories parts and service revenue increased  despite lower product shipments to a record high of  million or  of total revenue compared to  million or  in total revenue in fiscal  because our aftermarket service business is reoccurring higher margin revenue it is a critical element to our shortterm sustainability and mediumterm profitability plan the aftermarket service business continues to expand with an average gross margin of  for the fiscal year compared to our planned margins and target margins of  capstone’s revolutionary factory protection plan or fpp contract backlog increased  again despite lower product revenue to  million compared to last year’s  million and should accelerate even further as product revenue is now rebounding and we supply a greater number of microturbines into the chp and cchp energy efficiency markets which i said earlier have much higher attachment rates than our traditional oil and gas markets with that i’ll now turn the call over to jayme to go over the specific financial results jayme brooks thanks darren please turn to slide  for fiscal  pl financial results revenue for fiscal year  was  million a decrease of  or  million from fiscal year  revenue or  million product revenue for fiscal  was  million compared to  million in fiscal  a decrease of  million or  we shipped  megawatts during fiscal  compared to  megawatts in fiscal  a decrease of  megawatts or  and the average revenue per megawatt shipped was approximately  million for both fiscal  and  the decrease in product revenue and megawatt shipped in  over the prior fiscal year was primarily the result of delays with certain oil and gas projects globally resulting from the continued volatility in the oil and gas market revenue from accessories and parts increased  million or  to  million for fiscal  compared to  million for fiscal  the increase in revenue from accessories and parts was primarily because of an increase in sales of heat recovery modules during the three months ended march   we shipped  of our new roof mounted integrated chp heat recovery modules designed for our new c signature series systems service revenue increased  million or  for fiscal  to  million compared to  million in fiscal  as a percentage of revenue service revenue was  in fiscal  compared with  in fiscal  the increase in service revenue was primarily the result of our growing installed base and the higher attachment rates of our fpp offerings in the chp and cchp markets as darren mentioned earlier gross margin for fiscal  was  million or  of revenue compared to gross margin of  million or  of revenue for fiscal  the decrease in gross margin was primarily because of lower volume and a shift in product mix in fiscal  and a onetime warranty provision in q of fiscal  to retrofit proactively selected nonsignature series c microturbines with the more robust new signature series generator components to improve product performance reliability and customer satisfaction these decreases were offset by reductions in production labor and overhead expense inventory charges and a royalty expense management continued to implement initiatives to improve gross margin by reducing manufacturing overhead by consolidating manufacturing into one facility and further reducing fixed and direct material costs and improving product performance rd expenses for fiscal  decreased  million or  to  million from  million for fiscal  the overall decrease in rd expenses of approximately  million primarily resulted from decreases in salaries supplies consulting and business travel expenses these overall decreases were part of our initiatives to reduce operating expenses management expects rd expenses in fiscal  to be lower than in fiscal  as we continue our cost reduction initiatives sga expense in fiscal  decreased  million or  to  million from  million in fiscal  sga for fiscal  was lower than fiscal  as a result of decreases in salaries marketing professional services business travel facilities and consulting expenses these decreases were primarily a result of our cost reduction program to lower operating expenses throughout the organization management is continuing to lower costs as darren explained earlier and we are planning to bring down sga expenses in fiscal  compared to fiscal  as we demonstrated on slide  the operating loss for fiscal  improved to  million compared to an operating loss of  million for fiscal  the net loss for fiscal  improved to  million compared with a net loss of  million for fiscal  net loss per share was  per share for fiscal  compared with a net loss of  per share in fiscal  the adjusted ebitda for the year ended march   was a negative  million or a loss of  per share compared to adjusted ebitda or  million or a loss of  per share for the year ended march   the adjusted ebitda is a nongaap financial metric that is defined as net income before interest provision for income taxes depreciation and amortization expense stockbased compensation expense and a change in the fair value of warrant liability please refer to slide  in the appendix titled reconciliation of nongaap financial measure for more information regarding this nongaap financial metric please now turn to slide  and i will provide some comments on our balance sheet and cash flows at march   we had cash cash equivalents and restricted cash totaling  million compared to cash cash equivalents and restricted cash at  million as of march   cash used in operating activities for fiscal  was  million as compared to cash used of  million in fiscal  our accounts receivable balance as of march   net of allowances was  million compared to  million at march   our days sales outstanding or dso was  days at the end of fiscal  compared with  days at the end of fiscal  inventories decreased  million or  to  million as of march   from  million at march   inventories decreased primarily as a result of the reduction in raw materials our accounts payable and accrued expenses increased  million or  to  million as of march   and  million at march   at this point i will turn the call back to darren darren jamison thank you jayme during fiscal  capstone achieved many milestones that included the launch of the new chp focused industry’s product lines the acceleration of our key aftermarket service business and a dramatic decrease in our operating expenses these activities collectively combined a lower capstone estimated breakeven from a previous  million in annual revenue to today’s  million at a  gross margin with our early success of capstone’s signature series product in the field the recovering crude oil prices our growing aftermarket service business our geographic expansion our nine new distributors all these will be drivers for the business going forward into fiscal  in order to ensure our success this year we are driving several key initiatives in fiscal  and beyond let’s turn to slide  slide  outlines the nine critical initiatives that management is focused on executing in fiscal  while closely managing the balance sheet and minimizing cash burn as we strive for continuous improvement these initiatives are capitalizing on our capstone finance program i discussed earlier continuing our war on costs increasing our chp product sales growing fpp service business growing our spare parts business the closing out of our c reliability program all while we continue down our product development roadmap and lastly but never the least ultimately pushing forward our goal of achieving adjusted ebitda breakeven levels in fiscal  i think it’s important to note on this slide that our leadership team is extremely dedicated and has gone through the last difficult two years without any turnover and without any equity without any merit increases or additional equity in the company the leadership team will get a bonus on two consecutive adjusted ebitda positive quarters so the team is extremely focused on getting to ebitda positive as quickly as possible new chp product sales will continue to be a major area of focus and as part of this initiative we recently launched a global selltowin contest to all authorized distributors globally the program is for the new cs ichp bundle so that’s the new cs microturbine with the roof mounted integrated heat recovery module and more importantly a prepaid factory protection contract this selltowin program also includes a c ichp bundle which is the c microturbine roof mounted heat recovery module and again a prepaid fpp contract that is all highlighted on slide  this program is key because it empowers marginal projects with the best additional discounts to help move forward and drive additional chp product accessory and fpp service revenue for capstone which is so critical to our profitability in addition the prepayment of the fpp contract will improve our overall cash flow and as i said before remember cash flow is queen this slide further highlights our fiscal  factory protection plan or fpp growth initiatives beside the selltowin contest we launched a special discount program for fiscal  for all future fiveyear nineyear fpps that are also  prepaid upfront but not part of the bundle to positively impact working capital again and improve our cash flow we continue to explore new and creative methods in order to increase the fpp attachment rate thereby driving recurring cash flow on all the systems in the field that are not currently under fpp service contract we have already launched the program to sell signature series upgrade kits to older field we call them our r series product and in may we launched a new spare parts price list increase which was  domestically  internationally that is already effective today we’ll also continue to look at other spare parts special programs in the future to drive future spare parts growth let’s turn to slide  slide  highlights some of the key design improvements made over the last four years on the c development program to name a few of the key initiatives we have improved the combustion liner we have improved the air bearing coating we have improved the air bearing housing we added a new highflow impeller we improved the manufacturing and robustness of the recuperator we’ve come out with a new stator and magnet combination and an ongoing continuous product development qualification and certification program we will be aggressively rolling out the final field upgrades over the first half of fiscal  to maximize customer satisfaction during fiscal  capstone made significant progress in its product development roadmap as shown on slide  and in fiscal  we’ll continue these product development efforts and releases including new fuel capabilities new universal control boards and upgraded stateoftheart control system for all current systems capstone will also continue to innovate and develop new products despite lowering its rd spend approximately  from the previous years in addition we look to develop and leverage opportunities at the us department of energy and the argonne national laboratory to test our microturbines with hydrogen and other synthetic fuels as outlined on slide  we are also very excited to explore transient plasma technology with the us department of energy and the argonne national laboratory using capstone c product initially as shown on slide  to see if we can take our already worldclass ultralow emissions down to nondetectable levels i think an ultrareliable microturbine combustionbased technology with a total system efficiency of  to maybe  and emissions that are nondetectable could be a very interesting product offering compared to today’s fuel cells and traditional enginebased technologies that continue to get caught cheating trying to meet the strict emission regulations i now want to take a second and address a couple of slides that are in the appendix so if you go to the first slide in the appendix it’s a distributed generation megatrend slide i use this when i do my investor presentation so i wanted to speak to it briefly here on today’s call this is really just highlighting the major shift we’re seeing in the utility industry and the way people buy energy and again i think megatrend is not a term that i love it makes me think of megatron or the transformers but the reality is the way people are buying energy is changing the utility model is broken and folks want to be more smart and more proactive in how they buy their energy especially millennials and the younger generation are much more sensitive to green energy and to clean energy and they don’t want to buy power and have to buy power the way their father and their grandfathers did and so if you look at this slide it just talks about some of the annual distributed generation power additions you’re going to see by  global electricity consumption you’ve probably heard a lot about microgrids recently capstone is on several microgrids and continues to look at how to modify our product to be even more effective in microgrids that’s an area that i think we see a lot of growth going forward combining our technology with other technologies like wind and solar using battery storage that the microturbine can be base loaded and use other renewable energies that are intermittent that’s a great opportunity and great technical solution as mentioned here  billion will be invested in global distributed power by  more importantly i think you’re going to see a lot of electrification in emerging markets asia africa the middle east as you’ve noticed in our prepared remarks and recent press releases we’re putting product into north africa south africa west africa we’ve also got product going into several parts of the middle east saudi arabia qatar parts of different areas of that product is up and running so we’ve got new distributors in that area as well as penetrating those markets as well the other slide i put in there is a little bit tongue in cheek what do these companies have in common and really there’s a lot of things these companies have in common but if you look at the list amazon founder left wall street came back to my hometown of seattle starting selling books out of his garage why because he wanted to compete with barnes  noble and some of the biggest book manufacturers resellers in the world obviously that doesn’t seem like a very logical thing to do but he changed the way that people buy products online and the way they compete and the way retailing is done today so very much a small business going into a face of a very mature large competitor and changing the way things are done over the previous so again like same thing we’re trying to do in the energy space turner i selected turner because of cable news network or cnn obviously continuous news network and getting news  hours a day is something that’s very different apple we all know is a very unique company and changed the way personal computing was done and then obviously cell phones we all remember the picture of steve jobs flipping off the ibm logo well that could be capstone executive with caterpillar or ge or any utility in the world and these are not easy endeavors there were not liner growth these were very challenging i think that acts as a great example to look at the ceo of fedex they actually got down to his last  and did what any good ceo would do faced with bankruptcy he took his last  and he went to vegas he played blackjack and made  kept the trucks running long enough to get his next infusion of cash and keep the trucks running but deciding to sell to ship packages against the us post office is a pretty challenging thing to do and did an amazing job i threw in tesla here because i find tesla very interesting obviously they’re trying to change the car industry today to have tesla have the larger market cap than ford when they do  peoples a year and ford does  peoples a year and ford is profitable and tesla’s not i think says volumes it says that people believe that tesla is going to change the way people buy cars the way cars operate in the entire car industry otherwise it makes absolutely no sense why tesla’s market cap would be where it is so all these companies have tried to change industries they’ve all gone against big brands big companies that are very entrenched and have lots of money and lots of history and they’ve had to change the way people think i look at the utility business and buying power from a nameless faceless utility who doesn’t treat you as a customer and frankly you’re getting nothing for it if you buy a microturbine within fiveyear payback you bought the microturbine you own a year asset that can save you money and then lower your operating expenses buying money from the utility is not a good investment long term there is no payback it’s just how much is your spend i’ve been to probably close to  countries around the world i always ask customers no matter what vertical they’re in what is key vendor what’s key to their business who is good partners and not once knock on wood have they mentioned their local utility yet when i asked them about their utility spend and their energy spend natural gas for boilers and chillers plus their electrical consumption they scratch their head and say yes that’s probably my second third or fourth biggest spend and i said yet you don’t manage it you don’t do anything to be proactive you just write the check every month and the cost is going up every year and the service levels in most cases are going down and so a lot of folks see that as something they can’t control but capstone and other technologies are out there to change that model so i do believe as much as i don’t like the term megatrend times are changing and surviving in a new tech environment is all about paddling long enough to catch the wave and so getting our business to adjusted ebitda breakeven minimizing our cash burn improving our working capital and our cash flow allows us to paddle long enough to ride that wave that finally comes in so i do believe it will come in and people will see capstone at some point as an overnight success and that can’t be further from the truth it’s a lot of hard work by our leadership team our employees and our vendors so with that i’d like to open the call up to our analysts for questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions thank you our first question comes from the line of jeff osborne with cowen and company your line is now open jeff osborne great thanks for all the detail darren on the call a couple of questions from my point one on the prepayment that certainly is intriguing can you just put it in rough numbers if you did  million in megawatt if somebody were to prepay the service on that and what kind of cash flow that would be upfront for you darren jamison yes i don’t know if we want to give out specific competitive information but obviously a nineyear fpp more than doubles the sales price of the product so getting that paid upfront would be if it’s a full service fpp would be very significant one of the reasons we haven’t brought this program out before is getting somebody to prepay for an insurance policy from an insurance company that’s not profitable is a challenge but as we generated cash this quarter and look to get closer to ebitda breakeven in the next couple of quarters we think it’s the right time to roll this program out so as customers want better economics on their project and obviously better costs we’ll give them that opportunity by prepaying that fpp so that’s going to put cash on our balance sheet and help our cash flow we will not take revenue though until we actually do the service work on a quarterly basis so you’ll see the prepaid on our balance sheet go up as we roll this program out jeff osborne and then as it flows through would the gross margin – i know the target’s to get to  but could you maintain a ish level with the prepayment or do you have to discount that and we would see it in the gross margin line darren jamison no we can still get to a  blended gross margin if you look at our margins they’ve been heavily impacted by the reliability work we’ve had to do on the c specifically last quarter we took a  million charge but even over the last four years we’ve been making lots of design improvements and rolling them out into the field and so as we stop the engineering effort on the signature series and the product is meeting our internal reliability – very high reliability targets you’re going to see the fpp margins come up and so as quoted margins that we’ve put in our contracts are  what’s dampening them now is premature failures or higher maintenance costs than we anticipated or reengineered so the spare parts margins are already over  and we just raised them a little bit more and so accessories typically are  to  but we’re working on getting those margins up as well so i think we can be in the mids by the end of the fiscal year as far as blended margins and then by  we should be at hopefully over  or at  jeff osborne got it just two other it’s probably in the q but can you just disclose what the russian receivables outstanding are at the moment and then i wanted to touch on the facility consolidation how do we think about any potential disruption to workflow and working capital issues do you need to build inventory indiscernible any cash charges and capex implications that’s a multiple part question but those are  darren jamison yes let me make sure i got them all the first one was the russian receivable the receivable we fully reserved a couple of years ago that was over  million when we started i think it’s roughly  today  somewhere in there it’s come down about  million in the last fiscal year we’re continuing to get orders from our russian distributor bpc and they’re paying today  over on signature series and  over on other products and so that receivable should continue to be collected that will be lumpy on a quartertoquarter basis depending on shipments and payments new product obviously and spare parts though were  prepaid with the overpayment to pay down that line as it relates to the consolidation of the manufacturing we’re doing a lot of the work inhouse with our own employees we’ve got an incredible internal team of facility folks and other folks on the shop floor that are doing this in through the daytime and the spare time we have officially moved c and the c over the weekend and we’ll be producing product this week so we’ll be down for less than seven business days and moving that production line so that has all of the operational folks over in stagg facility with the exception of our power electronics that will move over probably in the next quarter and then we’ll have all of our manufacturing folks over there from manufacturing quality purchasing engineering we’ll go over next we need to do a little bit of a build out on that building we just renegotiated that stagg lease and got about  worth of tenant ph improvements out of the landlord to help pay for the renovation so from a cash standpoint we’ll probably spend a few  to do this move but it’s not going to be substantial we’ve got it built into our cash plan and more importantly my favorite kind of money is other people’s money and so we’re using the landlord’s money and some other opportunities we get cash to help pay for that so then the real key is subleasing this building if you look at our numbers there we’ve got it going down to  million that is really contingent on subleasing this current facility that we’re in we pay about  million between rent and utilities in this space so getting out of this space is going to obviously lower our quarterly burn that much more we’re not sure we’ll get the entire company into one facility we may have a small corporate center nearby but definitely we’re going to get the cost down substantially jeff osborne perfect thanks so much i appreciate it darren jamison thanks jeff operator thank you our next question comes from the line of eric stine with craighallum your line is now open eric stine hi darren hi jayme darren jamison how are you doing eric stine hi so i wanted to just touch on gross margins i know that’s an area that’s proven most challenging as you work towards your profitability goals just in the past you’ve been talking about some of the supply chain steps you’ve taken related to the signature series any meaningful steps you’ve made in the quarter and just thoughts on timing when you might start to see some noticeable improvement there back to – is  plus a realistic number for gross margin in fiscal  darren jamison yes absolutely first of all our margins have kind of rebounded back to  but our product margins are still lagging from where we want them to be we do have several signature series cost reduction efforts that are underway we’ve brought paul chase onboard not that long ago to help us on that effort as well as our engineering team we should be wrapping those up this quarter i’m pretty bullish on getting pencils down on engineering group so you should see some cost reductions flow through on the signature series product as well as we’re putting longterm purchase agreements in place i think of our top  vendors which make up  of our spend we’ve got  under lta and we’ve got another – i’ll say eight more to go that is a major task for paul and i over the next call it fiscal year to get that done so i think those ltas in combination with some little bit cheaper designs or less expensive designs will help move that margin but more importantly obviously the more we can get that service margin from the  up to  that  additional increase will help the overall gross margins as well eric stine on that service gross margin and i might have missed it that i noticed that this quarter was the lowest in a number of quarters so can you just break out kind of what the onetime items were in the quarter or give us more of a normalized service gross margin for q darren jamison yes i don’t know if we have that number  jayme brooks it’s kind of detailed in the filings darren jamison yes but as i said you should see the blended service numbers exit the year at probably low s and then by fiscal  we should be into the  range so you should see margins increase hopefully sequentially each quarter going forward as cost reductions come down more fpps get signed more units go into operation so i think it’s always hard on a quartertoquarter basis because the fpp service contract business depends on how much work we do during the quarter so if we have an engine failure or an expensive repair that can impact the quarter jayme brooks yes depending on the timing of maintenance scheduled and unscheduled darren jamison yes but i think in general if you look at it over the year you should see it growing if you look at our new cost target i think we’ve got it down about  gets us to breakeven and so again with heavy –  million in accessories parts and service being at  margin we’re not as reliant on product margins we’ve been in the past eric stine right okay maybe last one from me just related to the pipeline and the big jump that you saw in the quarter give just a little detail there is that a number of large projects or is it really more broad based as you distributor base matures darren jamison i think it’s both we’re getting looks at bigger projects we just announced a  megawatt chp project that’s one of our biggest chp projects we’ve done globally that’s with a fortune  company that’s got multiple other locations we just did some other big customers recently so i think as we get closer to adjusted ebitda breakeven getting fortune  customers to invest in our technology is going to get easier and so i think that’s really the key some of the bigger latin american projects we’ve struggled with fcpa and some other things we’ve got to make sure that we don’t do anything that isn’t appropriate so i think those are always challenging markets brazil comes to mind ecuador comes to mind very challenging place to do business that being said i think we’re going to see more multiple megawatt projects just in general as our business expands and as we get profitable eric stine okay thank you darren jamison thank you operator thank you our next question comes from the line of craig irwin with roth capital partners your line is now open craig irwin hi good evening and thank you for taking my questions darren jamison hi craig craig irwin darren in oil and gas in your prepared remarks you did reference the slowest last year the fact that some of the headwinds from commodity prices were significant for the company but with oil back up is oil and gas as a customer group making a nice contribution to the rise you’re seeing in your pipeline and the nice x booktobill that you had in the quarter and do you expect it to continue to trickle up as a contribution over the next couple of quarters darren jamison yes if you look at our pipeline i don’t think i said in my prepared remarks but yes we’re up almost flat the last couple of quarters that is the oil and gas industry coming back on line indiscernible recently we’ve got indiscernible both in california as well atlantic so we are seeing especially us oil and gas start to pick up we also have some quotes out there for some offshore platform work so definitely as oil gets around the  a barrel level activity picks up as it gets further away from  activity slows down but again i think we’re going to see it be a significant contributor we want to make sure we have proper diversification so oil being  of our business is challenging but oil being  of our business and being a nice contributor is a lot better place to be and as i said the fpp contract margins and attachment rate are much better than chp the flipside oil and gas customers are very used to buying equipment they are cheaper to get repeat orders out so i think the real answer is just a positive one but we are seeing the frontend of our pipeline increasing which is very encouraging craig irwin great and then just a quick follow up there so with oil staying somewhere close near to  how do you feel about conversion of the pipeline are there any specific items you need to see that maybe facilitate this maybe something on the regulatory front or something on the sort of macroeconomic front or are these potentially all discrete projects that move sort of at the beat of their own drum darren jamison yes they’re really discrete projects most of our oil and gas customers are repeat customers so whether it’s anadarko chesapeake pioneer wpx a lot of these customers are folks that already have some cases over  microturbines so it’s just the matter of them doing their next project as you know craig we actually lower the operating expenses of our own gas customer when they use associating gas in our microturbine so as they redeploy equipment as they build out infrastructure we hope to see that business increase craig irwin great thanks for taking my questions and congratulations on a really top quality cost out over the last couple of years very impressive darren jamison thank you operator thank you operator instructions our next question comes from the line of colin rusch with oppenheimer your line is now open colin rusch thanks so much guys can you talk a little bit about pacing of the sales cycle at this point are you seeing in any increases in that or anything that would lead us to believe that some of the pipeline may start flowing through a little bit faster than we may be anticipating darren jamison i would love to say we lowered our sales cycle from  to  months to seven months but that’s just not the case i think the challenge especially in energy efficiency it tends to be a longer sales cycle that being said we just – our sales and marketing group has done a lot of work to map the sales cycle to define it better for our distributors give them better tools to make sure that they don’t miss a step in the sales cycle so i think our goal is really when you look at  billion pipeline how to increase the close rates so anywhere from  to  close rate how do we get that number up and then where we can improve the sales cycle we will but i think a lot of these projects just have a sales cycle that is extremely hard to compress and in some cases getting the order is one thing if you look at the work we’re doing in new york we’ve had a lot of nice press releases in new york whether it’s related properties new builds or stay fresh new distribution center or new hospitals in the bronx but a lot of these projects are twoyear projects from a construction cycle standpoint so just getting the order is one thing but then delivering the equipment is another challenge so i think we’ll continue to work on it and i think we’ve got better tools for our distributors but it’s always going to be something that will be challenging especially manage efficiency space colin rusch great and i know you’ve gone through some real serious reconfigurations with your distributor channel particularly overseas but could you talk a little bit about the devaluation on that project and the results that you’re seeing from all that work that you’ve done over the last couple of years darren jamison yes i think we’ve done a better job developing distributor kpis key performance indicators we used to focus more just on revenue which didn’t always give you the true performance of a distributor they may get one big order that gives them good revenue for the year but they’re not doing all the underlying activities that make them successful so we’ve developed a very detailed model distributor program so we can go to a distributor and say okay here’s all the activities you need to do from marketing sales lobbying through working with your local gas company and here’s how you apply the product here’s how you do – you look at customers here’s how you propose the equipment and so we’ve given a very detailed business plan on how to operate their business and then we developed key kpis that we can then monitor them and say okay are you adding enough sales leads every week are you processing your fpp paperwork correctly are you doing all the different things that will make you a worldclass distributor and we’ve seen the distributors that have adopted it do very well and the ones that are fighting it are struggling and if they’re fighting it then they’re finding additional distributors in their territory or in some cases finding their territory gets smaller and in the most terrible cases we’re actually cancelling them but that’s our last resort obviously we’re close to  distributors all of them are partners we don’t want to cancel them we want to help them be successful and help us be successful colin rusch great thanks so much guys darren jamison thanks colin operator thank you i’m showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call back to darren jamison for closing remarks darren jamison great thank you operator definitely great questions folks i know we’re running a bit long today but we had a lot to go over i do want to mention a couple of housecleaning things as part of our war on costs we’re not going to be holding a formal annual meeting or full blown annual meeting we’re going to do just the minimum at our new sec counsel’s office in la so we’re not doing management presentations we’re not going to do a tour of the facility so we’re going to lower the costs there but we are going to do a facility tour open house after we get everything moved over to stagg so it will probably be q q we’ll do an analyst day and a shareholder day after we reconfigured into one plant and have something really impressive to show everyone so please note the annual meeting will just be a barebones sec minimum requirement at our lawyer’s office annual report you’ll notice the same thing not a lot of glossy pictures we’ll just have the cover very barebones again again it’s just everything we can do to lower costs and then you’ll see either probably tomorrow or the day after nasdaq listing change on the k we did get our sixmonth extension to get over  so that’s also positive news so with that i guess on behalf of capstone i would like to thank all of our stockholders employees distributors and suppliers for your continued support we look forward to reporting on the progress being made and the milestones that we achieve over the course of what looks to be an extremely exciting fiscal  and with that we’ll sign off thank you operator ladies and gentlemen thank you for participating in today’s conference this does conclude the program

darren jamisondarren jamisonthank you clarice and welcome everyone to capstones second quarter earnings call joining me today besides clarice is jayme brooks our chief financial officer and chief accounting officeras mentioned during the call we continue to use our slide deck which has been recently put up on our website under investor relations during the quarter we continue to focus and execute on our threepronged business profitability plan and progress on many fronts although the quarter is now without its challengesour threepronged business plan is outlined on slide  and consists of first reducing our breakeven from approximately  million in annual revenue at  gross margin to approximately  million in annual revenue at  gross margin the key to doing this is reducing our business expenses by  second is developing new products and services to derive renewed revenue growth opportunities and last but not least is the launch of capstone energy finance joint venture to capture lost orders because of lack of customer capital dollars for project financingso let’s start with the first initiative of the threepronged plan lowering breakeven levels by reducing business expenses  i’m proud to report we made significant progress again this quarter towards this goal as we reduced our operating expenses by  to  million over last year’s levels which improved our net loss over last year’s second quarter by  to  million despite significantly lower product revenue levels and lower gross margins compared to last year i cannot overemphasize how critical it is to lower our breakeven level by reducing our overall business expensesslide  gives you a graphic illustration of our success in reducing our overall business expenses by  or  million since the starting point of the initiative back in q fiscal  as significant as these cost reductions have been we will continue to look for new ways to further lower cost improve business efficiencies and essentially lean out our businessthe next initiative on our threepronged business strategy is developing and driving new product and service revenue growth opportunities obviously this is one of the initiatives where we did not show a lot of progress in the second quarter as product revenue for the quarter was well short of our internal expectations however disappointing as this may have been during the quarter it does not mean we’re not making progress on this initiativethe product revenue shortfall was the result of a delay in three customers in chp projects into our fiscal third quarter from our second
