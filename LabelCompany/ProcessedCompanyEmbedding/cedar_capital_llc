left and paul ingersoll met at the university of chicago this firm wants to bring private equity venture capital investing to the    masses how does an upstart investment firm that once flew high on stellar returns recover from a swift swoon privateequity and venturecapital investments are highrisk highreward bets usually reserved for millionaires and pension funds but chicagobased cedar capital is bringing these elite funds to the masses as part of a broader bid to diversify its investment product lineup after its flagship good harbor mutual fund stumbled last year this month the firm launched two mutual funds based on private equity and venture capital the new products are likely to be tempting in a lowinterestrate environment given the categories historical doubledigit returns the diversification effort which includes listing funds managed by partner firms is intended to rev up sales and pay for an operational infrastructure cedar built when it was managing  billion two years ago not the  billion it has today “when you have that kind of momentum in your assets theres always a certain amount of anxiousness” cedar chief investment officer neil peplinski says of the surge in assets before the slide “we have some exciting products and a road map were executing on to try to rebuild” founded in 0 cedar capital has unorthodox roots peplinski  cofounded the firm with nowceo paul ingersoll  not long after the pair met at the university of chicago booth school of business before heading to booth peplinski had been an electrical engineer at motorola designing equipment for cellular towers but he dabbled in investments on the side with results that led some colleagues and friends to hand him money he says after graduating from booth in 0 he got a taste of professional investing for a couple of years managing a portfolio of synthetic collateralized debt obligations at allstate insurance for his part ingersoll was coming off a failed effort to team with a california privateequity firm and buy a division of evanstonbased national equipment services an equipment rental company that he had worked for until late 0 he helped steer that company through an ipo in  with backing from chicago privateequity firm gtcr he left before it filed for bankruptcy in 0 peplinskis investment strategy which hinges on his reading of risktaking in the market relied on a mix of stock and government bond mutual funds later he turned to exchangetraded funds in 0 he delivered 0plus percent returns cedar says compared with a  percent rise in the sp  index with those numbers people threw money at the firm cedar had been taking investments for private accounts but late in  it launched its first mutual fund the good harbor tactical core us fund four more followed in the next couple of years by early  the firm had  billion under management but later that year the flagship tactical core us product stalled ultimately posting a  percent dive compared with the sp s  percent climb so money flowed out to recover cedar is introducing a variety of products including the privateequity and venturecapital funds that will be part of a new leland brand products are named for the geography of northern michigan where peplinski grew up on a dairy farm in maple city the firm also is teaming with chicagobased rivernorth capital management and others to market under other brands it aims to buy the assets of a hedge fund called fsquared investments out of bankruptcy proceedings to reincarnate that strategy under its broadmeadow capital subsidiary “we wanted our products to be diversified so that were not dependent on a single strategy” ingersoll says with its new offerings cedar is leaping into “liquid alternative investments” which are tradeable mutual funds that attempt to mimic the strategies of hedge funds privateequity funds and venturecapital funds—instruments typically roped off for more sophisticated investors in recent years everyday investors have poured money into these alternatives in search of richer results there is about 0 billion in a wide array of liquid alternatives today versus nothing 0 years ago says josh charney a chicago analyst who covers the space for morningstar “they are one of the fastestgrowing mutual fund categories” he says cedars new venturecapital and privateequity funds aim to copy the returns of those privately held asset categories but the firm is basing its strategy on two inexact thomson reuters indexes its difficult not only to get valuation data on those privately held assets but also to find publicly traded assets that mirror their prospects “unless the theory of private equity is baloney those companies are different” says erik gordon a university of michigan professor who specializes in venture capital and private equity cedar itself is privately held and partly owned by two private equity firms philadelphiabased llr partners and san franciscobased ftv management peplinski acknowledges that the two new funds are somewhat of an “experiment” even so theres likely to be demand given the retail appetite for liquid alternatives but cedar will be under pressure not to disappoint investors
