flexible and intuitive integration with our suite of clinical applications”scott breecechief information security officer chs about community health systems inc chscommunity health systems inc chs is one of the usa’s leading operators of general acute care hospitals the organization operates  hospitals in  states with approximately  licensed bedschallengein the last  years chs has undergone massive acquisitive growth adding over  new hospitals to its family having multiple applications across this many hospitals created an identity and access management challenge for the chs it team for example one of their acquired hospitals had their healthcare professionals accessing  different applications with  different logon credentials managing this for  users was very timeconsuming not to mention the time doctors were losing by having to log on to different applications up to  times a day every time they saw a new patient scott breece chief information security officer at chs was dedicated to tackling this problem “you can imagine password problems were rife and we were dealing with over  issues every week our absolute priority is our doctor’s satisfaction and supporting them in providing excellent patient care they need to move from application to application to deliver this and so we had to find a way for them to tap in and out of systems using a single signon mechanism” when chs acquired  additional hospitals the on boarding issues were starkly clear identities would need to be manually linked to a single authoritative source for instance a payroll or hr system and this could take up to  hours depending on how many tickets were managed a structured solution was neededour solutionbreece and his team analyzed which applications doctors use so that these can be included in a startup screen with a single signon facility interviews with business stakeholders followed and a full scoping document with a strategic identity and access management roadmap was produced chs manages over  users and needed to provide integration between  applications so the team needed implementation support gca a platinum netiq partner specializes in enabling and securing access to business data by managing digital identities and deployed the netiq solution for chs jim quasius president  ceo at gca comments “our team reviewed chs’ existing workflows for access approvals to identify gaps and ensure automated provisioning could be enabled we developed a fourphased project blueprint that included automated user provisioning and password selfservice functionality to meet the most pressing requirements we recommended netiq identity manager because of its scalability and performance in a high pressure environment” breece comments on the netiq choice “identity manager offered the best workflow engine and the most robust identity management capabilities more importantly for us it gave us the most flexible and intuitive integration with our suite of clinical applications” once the decision was made identity manager was soon implemented automated workflows were introduced to give users the flexibility to move between departments for example a nurse normally working on the third floor of a hospital would only have access rights there if she’s required to do a shift in the emergency department temporary access rights can now be given without it affecting her normal access all through a selfservice model with builtin authorization levels healthcare professionals performing dual roles are catered for too within the automated user provisioning system through rolebased exception workflows managing these scenarios manually would regularly take  hours whereas now they are completed within minutesresultsdoctors love the system according to breece “once our doctors saw what they could do with identity manager we couldn’t get it rolled out fast enough the word spread quickly and the productivity gain of logging in once a day and then being able to tap in and out with single signon throughout any of our hospitals is just enormous our doctor satisfaction is at an alltime high and they are just astounded that we could deliver a highly available and scalable solution to help with patient care” he concludes “through the single signon system and the selfservice in place we have halved the number of helpdesk tickets freeing up our it staff to support our increasing technology requirements as we grow user on boarding has been completely transformed and the time to provision a new user has gone from weeks to just ten minutes netiq and gca helped us support the critical drive for innovation in healthcare and have set us up for an exciting future” media view video › industry healthcaremedical location united
