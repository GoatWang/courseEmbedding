bradstreet inc  all rights reserved our promise  invest with vision  bos our promise our founders our team awards  accolades bos foundation community our storybos was formed over  years ago as bingham osborn  scarborough at a time when our founders perceived the financial services industry to be fraught with conflicts of interest at that time and even today many investment management firms remained largely structured around selling products to their clients such as stocks bonds mutual funds and limited partnerships with an eye toward generating firm revenues from commissions loads or spreads these firms pushed revenuegenerating sales rather than adhering to and honoring their commitment to fiduciary responsibility consequently their investment selection typically emphasized market timing and stock picking without consideration of the risks inherent in such strategies in this landscape our firm’s founders set out to establish a wealth management firm that emphasized the building of lasting relationships with clients where services were based on fiduciary responsibility integrity and comprehensive personalized service rather than sales commissions to accomplish their goal the founders focused on three fundamental principles – principles that were considered progressive at the time and are still fundamental to our approach todayno bias or conflict of interest rather than focusing on selling products to clients in order to generate commissions the founders strongly aligned the interests of the firm with their clients by charging a percent of assets fee to this day that fee is our only source of compensation for our servicesthe advisory relationship  integrated approach the founders of our firm believed that it was not possible to manage a client’s assets effectively without completely understanding and addressing their unique goals circumstances and concerns accordingly they developed a comprehensive advisory approach that integrated financial planning with investment management there was no name for this process at the time but today it is what we call investing with visionmodern portfolio theory  efficient markets the founders believed strongly in the theory of efficient markets and the importance of understanding and managing risk in designing portfolios accordingly instead of picking stocks or attempting to time the market they focused on maximizing the riskadjusted return of portfolios by combining noncorrelating asset classes and emphasized the understanding and control of risk by studying markets not companies these beliefs are still at the core of our investment philosophy todayour core valuesbingham osborn  scarborough conducts business and builds client relationships based on the following core values and guiding principles integritywe act with responsibility and accountability at all times – values that serve as the foundation of our culture we place our clients’ interests above our own regardless of the implications for our firm passion for client servicewe require of ourselves that we fully understand our clients’ objectives circumstances and concerns both to honor our promise of “investing with vision” and to earn the right to offer them our advice disciplinewe approach every decision we make with thoughtfulness and analytical rigor and while we hold firm to the principles that we know are important longterm we also challenge conventional wisdom – and each other – to discover new insights and new ways of providing value for our clients candorwe communicate with openness clarity honesty and thoughtfulness at all times – with ourselves with our clients and with all of our stakeholders and we tell our clients the truth whether or not it is advantageous to the firm to do so knowledgewe
