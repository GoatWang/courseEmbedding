tree generated from the exact frequencies of the text this is an example of a huffman tree the frequencies and codes of each character are below encoding the sentence with this code requires  bits as opposed to  or  bits if  characters of  or  bits were used this assumes that the code tree structure is known to the decoder and thus does not need to be counted as part of the transmitted information char freq code space   a   e   f   h   i   m   n   s   t   l   o   p   r   u   x   in computer science and information theory a huffman code is a particular type of optimal prefix code that is commonly used for lossless data compression the process of finding andor using such a code proceeds by means of huffman coding an algorithm developed by david a huffman while he was a scd student at mit and published in the  paper a method for the construction of minimumredundancy codes the output from huffmans algorithm can be viewed as a variablelength code table for encoding a source symbol such as a character in a file the algorithm derives this table from the estimated probability or frequency of occurrence weight for each possible value of the source symbol as in other entropy encoding methods more common symbols are generally represented using fewer bits than less common symbols huffmans method can be efficiently implemented finding a code in time linear to the number of input weights if these weights are sorted however although optimal among methods encoding symbols separately huffman coding is not always optimal among all compression methods contents  history

paper or a final exam the professor robert m fano assigned a term paper on the problem of finding the most efficient binary code huffman unable to prove any codes were the most efficient was about to give up and start studying for the final when he hit upon the idea of using a frequencysorted binary tree and quickly proved this method the most efficient in doing so huffman outdid fano who had worked with information theory inventor claude shannon to develop a similar code by building the tree from the bottom up instead of the top down huffman avoided the major flaw of shannonfano coding terminologyedit huffman coding uses a specific method for choosing the representation for each symbol resulting in a prefix code sometimes called prefixfree codes that is the bit string representing some particular symbol is never a prefix of the bit string representing any other symbol huffman coding is such a widespread method for creating prefix codes that the term huffman code is widely used as a synonym for prefix code even when such a code is not produced by huffmans algorithm problem definitionedit constructing a huffman tree informal descriptionedit given a set of symbols and their weights usually proportional to probabilities find a prefixfree binary code a set of codewords with minimum expected codeword length equivalently a tree with minimum weighted path length from the root formalized descriptionedit input alphabet a    applicationsedit arithmetic coding and huffman coding produce equivalent results — achieving entropy — when every symbol has a probability of the form k in other circumstances arithmetic coding can offer better compression than huffman coding because — intuitively — its code words can have effectively noninteger bit lengths whereas code words in prefix codes such as huffman codes can only have an integer number of bits therefore a code word of length k only optimally matches a symbol of probability k and other probabilities are not represented optimally whereas the code word length in arithmetic coding can be made to exactly match the true probability of the symbol this difference is especially striking for small alphabet sizes prefix codes nevertheless remain in wide use because of their simplicity high speed and lack of patent coverage they are often used as a backend to other compression methods deflate pkzips algorithm and multimedia codecs such as jpeg and mp have a frontend model and quantization followed by the use of prefix codes these are often called huffman codes even though most applications use predefined variablelength codes rather than codes designed using huffmans algorithm referencesedit wikimedia commons has media related to huffman coding  huffman d  a method for the construction of

samuel  are the two passages in scripture that describe these men in detail but these warriors are also followed through the narrative of davids reign where names like abishai and benaiah appear in numerous accounts giving us great insight into their courage and loyalty throughout a stormy reign marked by various foreign invasions court intrigues and violent insurrections the modern world needs such men men like the three mighties who brake through the host of the philistines to deliver a vessel of water to their beloved commander men like abishai who said to his uncle david when he asked for a volunteer for a perilous mission i will go down with thee men like benaiah who slew a lion in a pit in a snowy day men like eleazar who stood alone against a philistine onslaught slaying the enemies of the lord until his hand clave unto the sword men like the zebulunites who could keep rank and were expert in war and men like the issacharites who had understanding of the times this book highlights  essential character qualities of davids mighty men that are desperately needed today it is the prayer of the writer of these pages that the lord might raise up a generation of christians who will determine with all their hearts to follow the example of these stalwart warriors of the old testament product reviews▼▲ be the first to write a review write review ask a question▼▲ have a

needs to be replaced she changed my appt and didnt consult with me my husband drove me over an hr for her to say i changed the appt i still had the voice mail she left confirming that days appt to make it worse she told me the dr wasnt even there i heard him talking looked up and saw him needless to say that was my last apptjulia in cleveland tn  feb  i really like the staff everyone seems very helpful jamie is amazing i have not had to wait long at all i have received more information about my diabetes than any where else i have been james mcknight in signal mountain  feb  the waiting is

broken or missing shingles look for subtler signs such as roof tiles curling or damage around corners and chimneys inconsistent coloring could indicate moss or water damageif you really want to give your roof a thorough inspection good housekeeping advises property owners to check gutters for broken down granules or interiors for structural saggingnot doing its job your roof is supposed to protect you from environmental elements if you find water in your home after a rainstorm or feel a draft on cold days it may mean there are gaps in your roof panels or other problems a good place to check is your basement or the uppermost level of your property try turning out the lights during the day and checking for signs of sunlight breaking through your roofyou can also check your energy

always obvious but you can check your original contractor statements for when its time to reevaluate the workquestions to ask before hiring roofing contractorafter doing your research you should talk to a roofer in person and ask specific questions before hiring him or her for your projectwhat are your qualifications the first thing you need to check for is a local address its easier to trust a roofer with a history in the community that proudly displays contact information not all states require a roofing license but you should at least check to see if a company or contractor belongs to a national roofing organization or the local chamber of commerce ask about any award or certifications the company has earned in previous yearscan i have a cost report no matter how dependable a roofer may seem never depend on a verbal agreement you want to get every promise down in writing an extensive job cost report shows you exactly what work a roofer will perform and how much each service will cost yougo line by line and ask about every expense you should also check to make sure the job completely covers the necessary task so ask about additional services the contractor could perform for water protection or extended warrantywhat are your plans for emergencies roofing can be dangerous you need to make sure that the company or contractor carries liability insurance so you are not held responsible for accidents ask to see the proper paperwork and inquire about safety precautions you should also check if the roofer has contingencies for smaller emergencies such as rain delayshow will you protect my property roofing projects can lead to debris and even structural damage you should invite a roofer to inspect your property before beginning a project so you can point out landscaping or other external features they should look out for if the contractor doesnt seem to care about aesthetical concerns you shouldnt expect the finished product to help your curb appealwhats your warranty you need to inquire about how long the work should last a major factor in longevity will be the materials used you should research online about how long metal or concrete shingles should perform and make sure the businesss guaranteed warranty is in line with industry standardscan i get a reference not only should you ask to get in contact with past clients time magazine advises
