introduced to a product to enhance the body’s production of nitric oxide that theoretically causes blood vessels to be more flexible i was told that it would lower my blood pressure without the side effects of drugs for the story of how that turned out click on the video below it’s an impressive tale and it’s all true    i have been taking cardio miracle since  based on my experience i am convinced it yields greater benefit for more people – and costs less to get that benefit – than anything before it if you would rather not listen to my boring explanation you can read a condensed version stating with introducing cardio miracle below two pathways when nitric oxide was first introduced as a  product to combat high blood pressure not everyone responded the same and although most users had great results some did not actually the solution to the mystery is well known but not yet applied to a commercial productlong ago it was discovered that the body uses two chemical pathways to produce no sometimes this is depicted with a yingandyang symbol because the two paths are perceived to be a single processthe first path was utilized in the early no products it starts with the presence of an amino acid called larginine the second pathway however starts with the presence of nitrates and nitrites one of the differences is that the larginine pathway becomes less functional as a person ages this explains why some older folks did not receive maximum benefit from the original formulations introducing cardio miracle in  the people who produce cardio miracle began incorporating these discoveries into a new formulation that follows both nitricoxide pathways – and they added several highpotency antioxidants to enhance the second paththis is not a mix of patented chemicals claiming to contain “natural flavors” which often means more chemicals when you read the label shown in the faq section at the end of this review you will see that cardio miracle is dominantly composed of dried nongmo foods the powders are derived from real fruits and vegetables and prepared with the absolute minimum of processing so as to retain nutrients the remaining ingredients are not just vitamins minerals and enzymes but also include natural substances that aid the body’s production of nitric oxide at the cellular levelin  jonathan stamler a professor of medicine at case western reserve university school of medicine discovered that respiration is a threegas system involving not just oxygen and carbon dioxide but also nitric oxide which controls the ability of blood vessels to expand when needed to increase blood flow without this ability to expand blood vessels on demand such as during physical exertion or emotional stress the delivery of oxygen will be inadequate and can lead to heart failure or stroke see “molecular and functional basis established for nitric oxide joining oxygen and carbon dioxide in respiratory cycle” the daily case western reserve university

we were receiving that there are many other benefits as well – and some of them are big the following unsolicited letters from users tell the storyhigh blood pressure“since i have been using cardio miracle i have not had to take bloodpressure medications my pressure is now normal and no side effects most of the time i only take  dose and it still brings it down usually around  or so this stuff works i am a former gym rat and cardio miracle seems to tone my muscles as well i am physically stronger with little or no working out ”  charles bruce“i’m fairly young but have battled high blood pressure for over  years the medication i was on made it hard for me to do my job as a general contractor i started taking cardio miracle and started to feel better after about a week it’s been  months my doctor took me off my bloodpressure medication and i’m feeling better than i have in  years”  russell pincock“hi ed last week my blood pressure was  and i am  have been taking the cardiomiracle that you recommended for three monthsthe info in your books the creature and world without cancer is equal to a master’s degree in sane living”  joe ferguson utah“as a professional chemist i began taking several of the components of cardio miracle when i had a health scare involving my blood pressure and triglycerides taking cardio miracle has made it easy because i get every ingredient i was taking separately and more in one product i am years and now feel like i am  i see the ingredients of cardio miracle as the best of the best for my cardiovascular system and overall health”  robert dickman congestive heart failure insufficient blood flow from heart“when my congestive heart failure got so bad i couldn’t climb a flight of stairs i didn’t know what to do fortunately a friend gave me a tub of cardio miracle to try progressively i began to walk up stairs with ease and was soon able to exercise on a regular basis completely turning my health around”  kurt dowdle burley idaho stroke“i am so excited to endorse what this product has done for me in the last year i had a stroke in january  after being on an arginine product not cardio miracle for over  years i am glad that it kept me from being disabled but it only had  ingredients i found cardio miracle last april and have been taking half as much of it as the other product because it has so many other ingredients all organic i believe now that it has been healing me further we had a flood in our house in december and i have been able to help put down flooring cut boards on the saw in the garage paint baseboards and help get them in the right place i cooked for helpers on the weekend and kept up almost  hours a day when before i hadn’t had that kind of stamina i am so grateful for the blessings that have come from adding this to my daily agenda and i only have to take half as much as i was of the other product so it is cheaper too”   pat erdman neuropathy numbness usually in feet and legs“i suffered with neuropathy in my legs and feet to the point where they were turning dark and my toes were turning black i could feel nothing from my knees down after taking a nitric oxide supplement for  weeks i could feel my knees again as i continued to take the product the neuropathy continued dropping after  months my feet had gone from black to fleshy pink i’m very grateful for nitric oxide giving me my life back”  lance voss hurricane utah“i became interested in cardio miracle because it helped my wife with her neuropathy i decided i might as well take it along with her since it couldn’t do me any harm then i noticed that the white biofilm coating i had on my tongue most of my life unexplainably went away – and improved my breath freshness that made me happy since i am a dentist i’m sure it made my patients happy also  gene duffin dds see video copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease“my husband learned about nitric oxide in a miraculous encounter with two strangers waiting to board a cruise last winter they observed my husbands pale look and labored breathing and shared the science he has been taking the supplement since last april and even with advanced copd his breathing has dramatically improved his energy level is now beyond our expectations and his psa has dropped from over  to  our doctors are shocked we are grateful for cardio miracle

have been plagued with receding gums and bleeding for over  years my dentist has recommended surgery several times along with cleanings every three months i tried everything i could including packing my teeth at night with a powder to help heal the gums “nothing worked i use a water pic every day and some herbal tincture which has helped some but never stopped the receding gums“after taking cardio miracle for three weeks two scoops per day i went for my cleaning appointment and was so thrilled to hear that  of my pockets had improved one to two millimeters with less bleeding than in the past three months later i went back for another cleaning and was a little nervous fearing that the first time was just an accident much to my pleasure i had  more improvements of one to two millimeters in pocket depth needless to say my dentist dr wade was very impressed and said this was unheard of wanting to hear more about the cardio miracle”  ray potter laverkin utah“when i read ray potter’s testimonial i wondered if this could be the result of something other than cardio miracle such as a change in diet or reduction of stress when i looked to see if there was any scientific support for thinking nitric oxide might be responsible i found that researchers at state university in rio de janeiro brazil studied that very issue and said there was indeed scientific support for the theory behind it “it didn’t take long for me to schedule a dental appointment to get a current assessment of my own periodontitis to see if cardio miracle made a difference like ray potter i was uneasy that there would be no positive effect but when the results were compared to my previous exam the improvement was nothing less than spectacular“my previous exam showed  pockets that were deep enough to be classified as affected by periodontitis this time there were only  that’s an amazing improvement of  my hygienist who usually admonishes me to increase the frequency of my teeth cleaning studied the charts for a moment and said ‘well i guess this takes the steam out of my argument’“eleven months later on  april  when i returned for another cleaning the pocket count had further declined to  that’s a  improvement from what is was before taking cardio miracle this time the hygienist asked how to obtain the product”  g edward griffin los angeles “nitric oxide and oral diseases can we talk about it” researchgatenet“a few years ago my dentist advised that i have periodontal disease i directed my research efforts to find natural remedies if possible i tried many things but no calculable results then relying on mr griffin’s recommendations i purchased cardio miracle and began using it upon arrival i could not take two doses at first so only took the morning dose after about  days of only the morning dose i went to the dentist for a prescheduled cleaning the hygienist was ecstatic when after measuring those darn pockets many had gone from “” to “” “” and “” after i told her about my cardio usage another patient in the office overhearing our conversation insisted i give him the info on obtaining the product – which i did cardio is the only thing i have tried to date that delivered positive results for my periodontal disease can’t tell you how much relief that gives me”  rochelle tyler lagrange texas“cardio miracle brought down my blood pressure so i no longer need statin drugs it brought my triglyceride levels into normal range and also boosted my vitamind levels by more than  as a dentist i am particularly impressed by its ability to virtually eliminate periodontal disease i now recommend it to all my patients most of whom report marked improvement within  days” see video  tom worcester dds member of the crown council florida”severe pain in my jaw sent me to my dentist who said i was in immediate need of a root canal on an infected tooth i am skeptical about the value of root canals so i wanted to find another solution other than tooth extraction i knew that cardio miracle was helping people with gum disease so i decided to see if it would help my deeply infected tooth swishing the formula around the tooth for a minute before swallowing produced a sensation of healing after just a few days the pain was gone my tooth seems to be fine now” see video “  arlaine austin obesity for information on how cardio miracle combats obesity see the qa section at the

oxide listed on the product list of ingredients we apologize for not making this more clear on the product page but cardio miracle does not contain nitric oxide which is a gas instead it contains the substances the body uses to produce nitric oxide right inside the cellsis there a danger of cardio miracle overdose leading to fatally low blood pressure there is no evidence of that after extensive use but there is a theoretical concern for highperformance athletes see “potentially fatal new trend in performance enhancement a cautionary note on nitrite” by andrea ptroczi and decian p naughton journal of the international society of sports nutrition  how do you know that the loss of neuropathy is not merely the placebo effect it is impossible for patients to experience complete loss of advanced neuropathy based on the placebo effect an excellent reference regarding the theoretical action of nitric oxide on neurons is nitric oxide and its role in health and diabetes by thomas burke phd with special focus on parts  and is there a reliable reference for a technical description of the nitratenitrite pathway to nitric oxide there are numerous studies on this topic available online a good choice would be “the nitratenitritenitric oxide pathway in physiology and therapeutics” by jon o lundburg eddie weitzberg  mark t gladwin nature reviews drug discovery  feb if larginine is the beginning of the chemical pathway to nitric oxide why does cardio miracle include citrulline what is citrulline anyway and what’s all the fuss about the ratio between arginine and citrulline great question for those who really want to understand how this product works and what sets it apart from others citrulline isare there negative side effects from consuming sodium nitrite there have been studies showing a relationship between high levels of dietary sodium nitrite and cancer it is believed that this process is initiated by abnormal oxidative stress at low to moderate levels such as are found in cardio miracle we are not aware of any such connection it is common for food factors to be beneficial or even essential in small quantities but harmful in large quantities sodium nitrite is an important part of cardio miracle because it is a precursor to the body’s production of nitric oxide which is essential for life however to be on the side of caution the manufacturer has added substantial levels of potent antioxidants to eliminate any oxidative stress that might be present see “the effects of sodium nitrite” by jan annigan reviewed by brenda spriggs md mph mba healthline aug  does cardio miracle need to be refrigerated to keep its freshness no it should be treated like a dried food which most of it is after opening it will last for several years with no problem as long as it is stored in a cool dry location if atmospheric moisture causes clumping that will not adversely effect the product’s effectiveness in any way clumps are easily broken up and the product will quickly dissolve in water or juice as beforeare there any special discounts on this product for reality zone customers due to improved product ingredients and inflation the increased cost of cardio miracle has required that all special discounts for special groups be ended discounts may be issued in the future on special occasions but will have specific ending datesfor cardiovascular benefit why not just take viagra as it’s cheaper and probably more effective the answer to this is provided by stephen ashcraft a physiologist in nashville tennessee email protected“to understand how viagra works we must first understand what physiological response causes an erection the body releases nitric oxide no when we are sexual stimulated this no release comes from nerve endings and endothelial cells in the corpus cavernosum of the penis and clitoris an enzyme then converts guanosine triphosphate gtp into cyclic guanosine monophosphate cgmp cgmp then causes the smooth muscle of the vessels in the penis or clitoris to relax which then allows for a greater inflow of blood which then leads to an erection cgmp is then hydrolyzed back to the inactive gmp by phosphodiesteras type  also known as pde“we know that most men who suffer from erectile dysfunction do not produce enough no this is why we can say that erectile dysfunction is one of the earliest visible responses to cardio vascular disease because of low no production in these men the small amount of cgmp they produce is broken down at the same rate and therefore doesn’t have the time required to accumulate and cause a prolonged vasodilatation effect the erection“sildenafil viagra is a potent and highly selective inhibitor of pde sildenafil viagra works by inhibiting the enzyme pde phosphodiesteras this means that cgmp is not hydrolyzed as fast and this allows the vessel smooth muscle to relax  viagra does not increase no production thus one would not receive the numerous benefits to the cardiovascular system of no  viagra has numerous negative side effects  pde function is specific to the penis and clitoris  the response is short lived and not recommended for using multiple doses per day“cardio miracle provides a consistent elevation of no thus causing the vascular system to function as it is suppose to dilating and constricting according to cardiac output and increased stroke volume neither viagra nor its competitor drugs provide this response erectile dysfunction has been shown in research to diminish with greater no production”a respected alternativemedicine doctor has said in his newsletter that supplemental larginine is a poor source for increasing nitric oxide and possibly does not work at all if this is true why is it in cardio miracle again we will defer to stephen ashcraft email protected for the answer“there are several obvious issues with this article first the doctor is selling another product one he claims works better for no production than larginine rather than argue the point i would simply refer him or any other inquisitive person to the hundreds if not thousands of clinical trials proving the effectiveness of larginine as a precursor and producer of no furthermore i would remind him and others the  noble prize winner for medicine dr louis ignarro won the noble prize for discovering no dr ignarro went on in his book “no more heart disease” to explain in great detail the benefits of l arginine“second the doctor’s article is correct in that oral larginine does convert to urea it also converts to no ornithine and agmatine … many of the health benefits from larginine can be attributed to the fact that some of the larginine converts to urea urea has many health benefits it supports protein synthesis thus its importance for patients suffering from kidney failure kidney infections and for athletes who are wanting to gain greater muscle mass urea is also the best diuretic and has proven helpful with brain tumors strokes meningitis and other inflammations of the brain and spinal cord one report cites the case of a massive brain tumor reappearing  months after surgical removal of another brain tumor the patient received ml of  urea after  hours the tumor had completely disappeared urea is also very beneficial in wound healing even infected wounds burns and ulcerating tumors urea is one of the main reasons larginine converting to no is such a powerful recovery agent urea greatly reduces exercise recovery time by removing ammonia a byproduct of lactic acid which occurs from repetitive muscular contractions so while it is certainly true that some of the larginine converts to urea it is also a good thing“also it is true that larginine can be very difficult to assimilate studies have shown that our bodies utilize less than  of the larginine we consume this means that you can’t digest and use larginine efficiently it is for this reason that hospitals and many researchers use intravenous arginine injection instead of oral doses the cardio miracle solution to this problem is a different form of arginine called larginine aakg alphaketoglutarate aakg has been shown to have a  utilization rate also by adding the amino acid lcitrulline and other active no boosters you can greatly enhance the effectiveness of larginine conversion in the nos pathway furthermore the pharmaceutical grade aakg form of larginine gives the endothelium support and vasorelaxation properties of arginine plus greater arginine stability bioavailability and absorption if that’s not enough the aakg serves as a transport medium for arginine thus making it available at the cellular level for optimal synthesis aakg will also improve endogenous production of glutamine and glutamic acid both of which are important for muscle growth“another noteworthy fact of cardio miracle is the dualpathway of delivery the two primary ways our bodies generate and deliver no are  the enzymatic process that oxidizes a nitrogen atom in the amino acid arginine to nitric oxide this process is known as the argininenitric oxide pathway arginine is converted to no by the endothelium lcitrulline also used in the cardio miracle formula is another amino acid and can also be converted into no by means of the same pathway  the second pathway is a nonenzymatic process where nitrites and nitrates which are naturally occurring are converted to no either by bacteria in the intestine and mouth or by naturally occurring antioxidants some fruits and roots are converted into no via this same pathway by taking advantage of both pathways and adding additional no boosters cardio miracle extends the active life of no in the system“no can oxidize and become a free radical cardio miracle is loaded with some of the most powerful antioxidants known that lower homocysteine levels and inhibit the oxidation process another way of eliminating any concern of the free radical issue is the no loop by combining other key no precursors a loop is created thereby protecting the no from becoming a free radical and greatly extending the life of no“most no boosters on the market rely on larginine as their primary source for no a few and i mean a very few will use some lcitrulline and even fewer will use aakg as we’ve already mentioned there are a number of sources of no production nos occurs through several different pathways thus cardio miracle a product that actually works uses multiple pathways of delivery because cardio miracle contains multiple sources of no precursors and multiple pathways of delivery it contains a lower dose of larginine and also greatly enhance the health benefits of no”what are endothelial progenitor cells and what do they have to do with cardio miracleendothelial refers to a layer of cells that line the inner walls of the circulatory system everything from the heart to the smallest capillaries their function is to pass nutrients from the bloodstream into the organs ‒ and pass waste products in the opposite direction where they are carried to the liver and kidneys for disposal since all functions of life depend on that process healthy endothelial cells are essential for health and youththe bad news is that endothelial cells have a life span of only a few years even shorter when exposed to toxins from drugs processed food and contaminated air the good news is that the body is able to replace those dying endothelial cells with new ones that’s where the word progenitor comes into play it refers to a stem cell that is programmed by its dna to morph into a specialized cell that can replace an aging or damaged cell therefore endothelia progenitor cells epcs gradually become new endothelia cellsthe bad news however is that the body’s ability to produce epcs diminishes with age which is a major cause of declining health and vigor as we grow older but the final good news is that researchers recently have discovered a way not only to increase the body’s production of epcs which occurs in bone marrow but to send them to precise locations in the cardiovascular system that need them the most ‒ and it does this regardless of age see nitric oxide differentially regulates proliferation and mobilization of endothelial progenitor cells but not of hematopoietic stem cells ozüyaman b ebner p niesler u ziemann j kleinbongard p jax t gödecke a kelm m kalka httpthschattauerdeencontentsarchiveissuemanuscripthtmlcardio miracle stimulates the body to increase its own natural production of nitric oxide ‒ and that is the substance that stimulates the production of epcshow does cardio miracle combat obesity most of the benefits of cardio miracle can be understood as the result of improved circulation and oxygenation but combating obesity is related to a biological process called mitochondrial biogenesis don’t be intimidated by the words they simply mean the body’s production of a component of all cells the mitochondria that converts nutrients derived from food into energy mitochondrial biogenesis also is dependent on oxygenation but its function is related to the accumulation of body fatan efficient mitochondria readily converts nutrients derived from food into energy and only excess food consumption is left over for fat if the mitochondria are not efficient the conversion to energy will be impaired a condition called low metabolism this causes low energy levels ‒ manifested as weakness and fatigue ‒ and increased fat formationmany things can reduce the function of mitochondria everything from enzymatic dysfunction to toxins to aging therefore anything that supports the maintenance of healthy mitochondria will combat obesity ‒ especially if related to low metabolismthe effect of nitric oxide on diabetes was the topic of a  study by brian sansbury and bradford hill they found that nitric oxide does help control diabetes but it does so because of how it combats obesity● it reduces insulin resistance ● it regulates appetite ● it supports the production and efficiency of mitochondriathe researchers stated “overall the collective data suggest that larginine and by inference no nitric oxide has the capacity to reduce fat mass by increasing mitochondrial biogenesis regulating brown adipose tissue signaling and increasing the expression of genes that promote oxidation of energy substrates”in laymen’s terms that means nitric oxide which is produced by the body in response to the dietary presence of an amino acid called larginine reduces fat by decreasing appetite and increasing the body’s ability to convert food into energy “regulation of obesity and insulin resistance by nitric oxide” by brian e sansbury and bradford g hill science direct free radical biology and medicine vol  august  pp

based on it ‒ so i decided to give it a tryto my amazement great results were measurable immediately my blood pressure which was  over  on the day i started the trial began dropping by about  points

not expect these reports and at first it seemed unlikely that a single substance could have a positive effect on so many unrelated disorders the explanation however turned out to be simple the effect

prostitution the business of sex edward e cohen a pioneering study that examines the sale of sex in classical athens presents a unique focus on the business aspects of athenian prostitution explores the contradictions and inconsistencies of athens attitude toward and treatment of commercial sex athenian prostitution the business of sex edward e cohen description this is a pioneering study that examines the sale of sex in classical athens from a commercial rather than from a cultural or moral perspective following the authors earlier book on athenian banking this work analyzes erotic business at athens in the context of the athenian economy for the athenians the social acceptability and moral standing of human labor was largely determined by the conditions under which work was performed pursued in a context characteristic of servile endeavor prostitutionlike all forms of slave laborwas contemptible pursued under conditions appropriate to nonservile endeavor prostitutionlike all forms of free laborwas not violative of athenian work ethics as a mercantile activity however prostitution was not untouched by athenian antagonism toward commercial and manual pursuits as the business of sex prostitution further evoked negativity from segments of greek opinion uncomfortable with any form of carnality yet ancient sources also adumbrate another view in which the sale of sex lawful and indeed pervasive at athens is presented alluringlyin a book that will be of interest to all students of sex and gender to economic legal and social historians and to classicists the author explores the high compensation earned by female sexual entrepreneurs who often controlled prostitutional businesses that were perpetuated from generation to generation on a matrilineal basis and that benefitted from legislative restrictions on pimping the author juxtaposes the widespread practice of prostitution pursuant to written contract with legislation targeting male prostitutes functioning as governmental leaders and explores the seemingly contradictory phenomena of extensive sexual exploitation of slave prostitutes male and female coexisting with athenian societys pride in its legislative protection of slaves and minors against sexual outrage show more athenian prostitution the business of sex edward e cohen table of contents introductionchapter  aphroditês workers in

choice outstanding academic title cohens book is an excellent study with a focus on the practical aspects of prostitution and a careful weighing of the available evidence anyone with an interest in ancient sex work and with enough of a background in ancient greece will find this book extremely usefulstephanie lynn budin american historical review this book is an excellent introduction to the topic of athenian prostitution and will inevitably provide much fodder for discussion it should be read by all students and scholars interested in greek sex law and the economydeborah kamen cjonline and then theres athenian prostitution the business of sex by polymath university of pennsylvania professor edward e cohen oxford university press  a convincing picture of a trade where women were often the tightfisted classconscious and successful purveyors of companionship and sexual servicejoe distefano philadelphia inquirer every new book by edward e cohen is an event and athenian prostitution is no exception to the rule the originality of this work is to offer an unprecedented economic approach to the question of prostitution in fourthcentury bce athens among others it reveals that citizens and not slaves only could be prostitutes despite the social opprobrium attached to this activity the book thus exposes an aspect of ancient athenian society that has been completely neglected so far well written with many colorful and striking passages from beginning to end the book proves to be a fascinating readingalain bresson the university of chicago an important and

sir edward heath sex abuse inquiry all sections news police wind up sir edward heath sex abuse inquiry sir edward heath in  credit  harry toddfox photosgetty images the £  million police investigation into allegations that sir edward heath was a paedophile is being wound up amid claims it has found no evidence to justify tarnishing the former prime minister’s reputation private investigators hired by police to help conduct the inquiry have been told contracts are not being renewed according to sources the inquiry codenamed operation conifer will be closed in the coming weeks but the report on its findings will remain confidential friends of sir edward insisted that the wiltshire police inquiry had found no evidence to implicate the conservative politician  supt sean memory making his appeal for victims outside heaths home they said the nature of questions put to former members of staff and sailing friends were so lacking in detail that it suggested an absence of hard evidence the investigation began in august  when supt sean memory standing outside sir edward’s former home in salisbury launched an appeal for victims to come forward he is now on longterm sick leave a wellplaced source said investigators mostly retired detectives hired a year ago on month contracts had been told they were not being renewed “the inquiry is coming to an end the contracts are up and have not been renewed even though there was an option to do that” said the source chief constable mike veale will come under pressure to resign if his force fails to justify the investigation reports claimed he believed “ per cent” the former prime minister was guilty sir edward at his former home arundells in  credit mike lawn  rex features lord armstrong the former cabinet secretary and sir edward’s principal private secretary from  to  said “i simply don’t understand how the chief constable got himself into such a position some of the lines of inquiry they are pursuing are absolutely ludicrous “they have interviewed former staff at no   and asked them if they were ever aware of young men slipping in and out of  downing street it’s absurd you couldn’t slip in or out there was a door with a policeman on it” anthony churchill who crewed with the tory leader on his racing yacht morning cloud said “if the police chief thinks it is  per cent likely that edward heath was a paedophile then the crew of morning cloud would say it is  per cent certain he was not” chief constable mike veale reportedly claimed he believed “ per cent” the former prime minister was guilty a spokesman for wiltshire police said of the final report “our approach to public confidence is to be as open and transparent as possible and at the conclusion of the police investigation the force will take advice as to what we can legally put in to the public domain” mr veale denied having stated a view on sir edward’s guilt he said “our role is to objectively and proportionately go where the evidence takes us further those who choose to continue to comment on this case whilst not in possession of the facts ultimately may serve to unfairly damage both the reputation of sir edward heath andor those who have disclosed abuse” timeline edward heath follow telegraph news follow on facebook follow on twitter follow on instagram read more about abuse wiltshire police wiltshire police show more show comments if
