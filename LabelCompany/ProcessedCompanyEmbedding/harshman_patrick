harshman thanks blair and thank you everyone for joining the call today turning to our slide  let’s get started with an overview of our first quarter results revenue was  million down  sequentially following a strong fourth quarter but up modestly from a year ago video segment revenue performed below our expectations down  sequentially but up  yearoveryear our cable edge segment performed as expected given the major market and product transition now underway with revenue unchanged from the prior quarter down  yearoveryear combined bookings of  million reflects seasonally weak demand in the quarter exaggerated following the strong fourth quarter orders and several anticipated deals which were delayed out of the quarter a couple of which has since been closed in april the bookings also included growing mix of new cloudbased recurring revenue orders which was advantageous over the midtolong term but a headwind for nearterm revenue conversion underscoring the shift in our video business to more software recurring revenue services backlog and deferred revenue is  million remaining at a near record level nonetheless fewer new orders that converted immediately to revenue during the quarter resulted in a higher mix of support revenue and a corresponding lower gross margin to  and a disappointing eps loss of  i want to emphasize that these results stem directly from our singularly weak q video spending environment we do not believe we lost any market share during the period and following the just completed detailed business review our sales pipeline and overall demand trends we saw entering the year are still very much intact so with that brief summary lets take a closer look at the video business and turn to our slide  the first key message here is that following strong fourth quarter of video on demand first quarter customer spending dropped materially in particular our results reflect much softer than expected service provider spending in europe middle east and africa this was most pronounced in the final month of the quarter when several anticipated projects were unexpectedly delayed nothing we have seen from competitive data suggest this spending weakness was a unique harmonic challenge in fact we subsequently closed a couple of these key deals and as noted a moment ago we’ve conducted a detailed sales pipeline review which convinces us that the fullyear demand we anticipated remains intact so that said we’re seeing some faster than expected shifts in demand trends with several satellite paytv operators reducing investment in traditional video infrastructure offset by growing investments in over the top in a particular cloud and saas based overthetop solutions which brings us to the second key message about our video business which is that customer adoption of our new video cloud and software as a service solutions continues to gain encouraging momentum yeartodate cloud and saas solutions represent over  of total video segment bookings and following a busy nab show last week in las vegas it is now clear that serious customer interest in our cloud solutions is starting to gain stain underpinning this momentum is on one hand truly innovative new technology we are the st to enable premium video quality video processing as cloud native applications that can run on private clouds or public roads such as aws and on the other hand strong engagement with several tier  operators who are looking to the cloud to enable more agile and efficient operations our cloud solutions are now powering highprofile live video over the top platforms from multiple bluechip service provider and media customers in both the us and overseas we firmly believe we are creating a winning formula here marrying the industrys most advanced video compression and quality of experience technology with an innovative public and private cloudbased delivery platform that enables both broadcast and unicast services to mould devices all the way up to the widescreen in the family room and this has been a major area of investment for us and it’s good to see the successful early deployments and expanding market buzz although we must again caution that we expect the wellknown issues associated with pivoting part of a revenue stream from a capex to a consumption business model so while we are not yet forecasting dramatic growth of recurring revenue contribution this year we do expect to continue to report to you growing saas bookings and backlog throughout the balance of  so this brings me to the third key message which is that our video business outlook for the remainder of  remains healthy we have sufficient backlog deferred revenue and solid sales pipeline to deliver our profitable second quarter similarly our full backlog deferred revenue and pipeline data give us confidence that we are in a good position to deliver modest revenue growth for this year overall despite the headwind of the partial transition to the recurring revenue model that i just mentioned and as hal would address momentarily factoring and continuing programs to maximize our operating efficiencies we remain positioned to deliver on the doubledigit operating margin target weve established for the video business segment in aggregate through the balance of this year so with that let’s now turn to our cable edge business on slide  where we continue to make real progress advancing our cableos growth agenda first early revenue shipments of cableos to our first major customer are ongoing enabling the delivery of docsis broadband services to tens of thousands of paying european cable customers with further footprint expansion expected over the next several quarters second we achieved a major milestone with another key customer who initiated critical docsis  field trial activity to validate readiness for the largescale deployment and the progress to date on this trial has also been good validating not only our fully virtualized  technology but also the broader operational aspects associated with running a fully horizontally scaled virtualized cmts stack in the field third during the quarter we materially expanded new customer engagement activity in the united states europe and latin america encompassing both centralized and remote phy cmts architectures and fourth associated with this work we have started shipments of our new remote phy nodes powered by cable os to multiple customers performing endtoend converged testing now it’s really important to understand here that this story is not just about harmonic having the new cmts solution and some good customer relationships with dual disruptions of virtualizations finally coming to the cable access network and a distributed access architectures that push processing to the network edge promise massive scalability and cost advantages for cable operators worldwide new snl kagan data says that over  of cable executives polled representing  top global operators now expect to be deploying new distributed access technology by the end of  the combination of growing customer appreciation for the power of virtualization and distributed access architectures harmonic’s significant technology lead in these areas and now our growing credibility through several high profile early trials and deployments all underscore our continuing confidence in this business so turning back to the first quarter financial results for the cable edge segment were in line with our low expectations as the combination of soft legacy product revenue and heavy new product investment again indiscernible bottom line and that has been the bad news for our cable edge segment for some time and we expect it will continue to be the case in q however looking beyond q i want to assure you that our cableos outlook for the remainder of  remains positive we have been working closely with our lead customers not only on technical issues but also on volume deployment plans and associated commercial forecasts and based on this work we continue to anticipate commencing volume shipments in the second half of this year with this target firmly in mind for the next few months we are focused on scaling existing commercial deployments and trials of both centralized and distributed docsis solutions we are leveraging our deepening field experience steadily expanding market awareness and creditability and securing additional customer design win as we go forward we remain well positioned to turn the core on the second half of this year and hit the  million annualized run rate target we set for ourselves and of course looking further ahead the ultimate goal remains to become a leading player on the  billion plus ccap in distributed asset architecture market we are genuinely excited to be entering the countdown phase and successfully turning with cableos business our innovations our investments into a powerful new growth engine for the business so with that hal let me turn in over to you hal covert thank you patrick we want to thank everyone for joining our call today during my discussion i will cover three topics first our financial results for q next our financial goals for q and then our financial goals for the year of  before discussing our q financial results we would like to start with some opening comments in our february  call we mentioned that for q  we achieved financial results for both revenue and eps ahead of our financial guidance primarily due to completing certain video projects that we recorded in q  that were initially planned for q  we went on to say that this event combined with q typically being our weakest quarter from the seasonality standpoint and that was reflected on our financial guidance for q  although our financial results for q  were below our guidance we do not believe that the softness in our business experienced in the quarter is representative of prospects going forward most of the shortfall in q was related to our north american and european geographies for which we expect the timing of purchase decisions to improve taking our q financial results and q financial guidance into consideration we continue to believe that directionally our financial performance aspirations that we articulate for  are fundamentally intact with the acknowledgement that additional time is needed for achievement key aspects of our updated  financial goals include increasing nongaap video revenue on a yearoveryear basis in  pursuing doubledigit nongaap operating profit for our video operating segment starting with second half  achieving cable edge bookings that will support  million revenue one rate and doubledigit operating profit as we exit  the momentum needed to reach this goal is dependent upon achieving productions shipments for our new cableos products and services managing our cable edge operating segment so that it will not be a nongaap drag on overall eps starting in the second half of  to enhance the achievement of our operating profit goals we plan to reduce our current operating expense run rate on a sequential basis over the remainder of  we believe that we can accomplish this task without impacting the momentum of our business shortly i will provide more details about our  financial goals now turning to our financial results please note that our financial results and guidance discussed during the call are based on nongaap measurements the table reconciling gaap and nongaap measurements is included in our earnings call presentation and in our earnings press release issued earlier today bookings for q  were  million compared to  million in q  and  million in q  our bookings level for q  reflects my earlier comments about our soft quarter as well as typical seasonality nongaap revenue for q  was  million versus  million in q  and  million in q  nongaap video segment revenue for q of  was  million versus  million in q  and  million in the same quarter last year the sequential and yearoveryear comparisons reflect the soft q revenue level that we reported as well as typical seasonality nongaap cable edge segment revenue for q  was  million versus  million in q  and  million in the same quarter last year our cable edge revenue has been relatively flat since q  and is not expected to improve until the second half of  when we begin shipping a meaningful amount of our new cableos products and services in q  we did not have any  customers nongaap gross margin was  million for q   million for q  and  million for q  nongaap gross margin as a percent of revenue for q  was  versus  in q  and  in q  q  video gross margin was  million or  of revenue versus  million or  of revenue in q  and  million or  of revenue in q  the sequential decline was due to lower revenue and product mix cable edge gross margin was  million or  of revenue in q  versus  million or  of revenue in q  and  million or  of revenue in q  the current gross margin range which began in q  will not improve until the second half of  when we began shipping a meaningful amount of our new cableos products and services nongaap operating expenses for q  were  million compared to  million in q  and  million in the same quarter last year our operating expenses in q  were approximately  million higher than expected due to the timing of sales commission expense professional fees and accruals sequentially we believe that our operating expenses will be lower in each quarter of  starting with q q  operating expenses only included one month of tbn our nongaap operating loss for q  was  million compared to a profit of  million in q  and a loss of  million in q  the sequential loss reflects the lower than planned revenue level experienced in q as well as gross margin as a percent of revenue the yearoveryear increase reflects higher operating expenses partially offset by higher gross margin our nongaap eps loss for q  was  versus a profit of  in q  and a loss of  in the same quarter last year these comparisons reflect the comments just highlighted we had  million shares of nongaap common stock outstanding as of the end of q  versus  million as of the end of q  and  million as of the end of q  now turning to our balance sheet we ended q  with  million in cash and shortterm investments compared to  million at the end of q  and  million as of the end of q  the sequential and yearoveryear decline primarily reflects cash outflows related to purchase and integration of tvn going forward cash outflows related to integration activities will have a materially reduced impact over the remainder of  our days sales outstanding at the end of q  were  days versus  days at the end of q  and  days at the end of q  our days inventory on hand were  days at the end of q  compared to  at the end of q  and  at the end of q  the sequential increase in days on hand reflect the softer than planned revenue previously discussed at the end of q  we had  million of backlog and deferred revenue compared to  million as of the end of q  and a  million as of the end of q  staffing at the end of q  was  compared to  at the end of q  and  at the same time last year the sequential and yearoveryear decline is related to our tvn integration program the following are q  financial goals nongaap revenue  million to  million which includes video revenue of  million to  million and cable edge revenue of  million to  million nongaap gross margin as a percent of revenue  to  which includes video gross margin percent of  of the  and cable edge gross margin percent of  to  nongaap operating expenses  million to  million nongaap operating loss  million ranging to a profit of  million nongaap eps loss of  ranging to breakeven nongaap common shares of stock outstanding approximately  million cash and shortterm investments at quarterend  million to  million for the most part the sequential decrease in cashonhand projected at the end of q is related to the lower than planned level of accounts receivable that we ended the quarter with due to our q revenue level based on our current outlook our cash balance should improve in q  with higher accounts receivable collections and improved operating profit based on achievement of our q  financial goals nongaap effective tax rate  now the following are our  financial goals nongaap revenue  million to  million which includes video revenue of  million to  million and cable edge revenue of  million to  million nongaap gross margin as a percent of revenue  to  which includes video gross margin percent of  to  and cable edge gross margin percent of  to  nongaap operating expenses  million to  million our projected operating expense level for  reflects the favorable yearoveryear impact of our  million of synergy savings program related to the tvn which was essentially completed in  nongaap operating profit  million to  million nongaap eps  to  nongaap common shares of stock outstanding approximately  million cash and shortterm investments at yearend  million to  million nongaap effective tax rate  i will now turn the call back over to patrick patrick harshman okay thanks hal lets finish up and turn to our slide  we are very close by again emphasizing that that we have one overarching objective for the balance of  that is to leverage our expanded video market leadership and cableos software innovations to significantly improve the longterm profitability and cash flow of the business in video objective number one is to increase value by driving the level of and margin expansion catalyzed by the ongoing market transition to softwarebased platforms for internet video services supporting this is objective number two we grow market share and strengthen our financial model by advancing our leadership in cloud software as a service and forecast and objective number three delivering aggregated doubledigit operating margin in the business for the balance of the year on a standalone basis we continue to believe our video segment is a strategic market leading business with compelling upside on the cable edge side of the house we have the industrys first modern virtualized cmts on the launch pad so objective number one is to continue the momentum through the first quarter and to the second quarter to further scale commercial appointments and advance docsis  and distributed docsis architecture field trials but the same time we are growing industry buzz around the progress we are making with key customers objective number two is to leverage this to secure new design wins with additional operators and objective number three continues to be to exit the year with both  million annualized run rate and a competitive market position that will enable a compelling growth business well into the future so look well q was softer than we expected following a strong fourth quarter our business pipeline is strong our backlog deferred revenue is strong and our overarching targets for  are unchanged were pushing full speed ahead leading the charge on softwarebased video processing and virtualized cable broadband delivery leveraging our strong customer relationships this record backlog and growing innovation advantage our entire organization is laser focused on the continuing execution of our strategic video and cable edge growth initiatives and on driving a sustainable new phase of profitable growth and shareholder value creation so with that lets now open the call to your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question comes from george notter of jefferies your line is now open george notter hi there thanks very much i guess i wanted to dig into some of the q dynamics in the video business i think you said that you saw a shift out in business in the last month and at the same time i think you also said that some of the softness was a result of the strength in q and i guess i’m trying to under reconcile all this i guess i would have assumed that had you pulled a lot of business forward into q you would have seen softness right away in q and i guess i was trying to understand that and then also i want to understand how much of the video softness is really directed at satellite customers or is it more a broader mix of customers thanks hal covert yes i will start and pass it to patrick very quickly george when we set the guidance for q we actually took into consideration the projects that we closed in q that we thought were going to actually be recorded in q so we did take that into consideration i think q just we had things slip out at the end of the quarter due to the timing that we talked about earlier that we did not count on so we did anticipate the impact from the q over it so to speak but nothing more than that patrick harshman thats fair i mean the additional thing i would say is q is always a somewhat back end loaded quarter many businesses take a little while to get going at the beginning of the year so we always expect a relatively strong march month and this is was no different with several key projects and as both hal and i mentioned we saw unfortunately a couple of those anticipated and frankly committed projects from customers get delayed good news is a couple of them were subsequently then closed in april but a couple of them have drifted as i mentioned in my prepared remarks from a geographical perspective europe was  and middle east and africa is where we saw the biggest or proportionately the largest concentration of that george but it wasn’t tied specifically to any particular customer vertical it certainly included demand from satellite operators but we saw it across the board just for whatever reason and then we don’t think it is anything actually that looking at our pipeline we dont think there is anything  really it works systemic at work here but just a confluence of events that we saw a pretty weak quarter with just a number of customers for a variety of reasons pushing things out relative to what our expectations have been george notter got it and then how broad is this is this  are we talking about two customers five customers  customers i’m just curious how broad this is across the country base patrick harshman in terms of the significant deals that we anticipated in the neighborhood of five george notter got it fair enough thank you patrick harshman thanks operator thank you and our next question comes from tim savageaux of northland capital your line is now open tim savageaux hi good afternoon just following up on that really quickly so you mentioned emea is kind of a geographical area of weakness but in your slides you did call out satellite paytv softness is that meant to refer to something separate that was also an issue i know hal mentioned weakness in north america and we do know that they had an awfully tough quarter over their directv this quarter and probably changing some things around there so i wonder if we can infer anything there from that satellite remark or because if you didnt mean to call out verticals then you seem to have called out verticals so i just want to kind of clarify that patrick harshman so there is two different things the point on the slide in there is to say that it’s  we saw and we see going forward kind of a mixed shift relative to what we thought as i just mentioned biggest thing in q was simply the delay for a handful of sizable deals and frankly those were not exclusive to satellite those were kind of a cross customer verticals particularly concentrated in europe just the way it worked out that being said full transparency on the market as we sit back now and did out detailed analysis for what the rest of year looks like relative to the demand trends we saw when we put together our plan three or four months ago for the balance of the year we do see relatively less satellite spending largely compensated for and relative increase in what we had expected in over the top so that was really meant to give a little bit more color on not so much the weakness in the quarter with some of the evolving demand trend changes that we have noticed tim savageaux got it and then sort of continuing along that service provider focus that doesnt sound like you’ve seen a whole lot of change in  i dont know whether the quarter or what you expect for the year out of the us cable vertical clearly you have got a bunch of trial activity going on but just from a spending standpoint any commentary there patrick harshman cable is positive in fact one of the delayed deals we referred to was actually our us cable deal that subsequently came in in early april really a timing thing than more than anything else tim but in general as we look at the fullyear the demand trends that we anticipated on both the video side as well as the cable edge side of the house are largely intact we dont anticipate any real changes relative to our original view of the market in terms of cable and we’re fully bullish on cable for this year tim savageaux okay and then you mentioned you’d a couple of deals that were pushed close is that and as well as the overall kind of backlog and differed metrics it really didnt change much from last quarter i guess despite a pretty significant slowdown or reduction in bookings wondering if you can kind of discuss that dynamic maybe just sort of mathematically and whether  i think you discussed in the last call having traded some revenue that normally would have come in either hardware or software license that turned into cloud and that had a certain impact i wonder if you have a similar discussion there and just kind of the overall drivers of visibility so what remains a pretty steep ramp on the video side looking into q understanding that some of these deal closings and backlog situation probably contribute to that hal covert so let me start and patrick can certainly jump in whenever he wants to first of all on the bookings our bookings and revenue were fairly close for q our bookings were a little over  our revenue was  so pretty close and so we had a fairly consistent deferred revenue and backlog at the end of the quarter which is good the other thing i would say tim is that when we did a deep dive on looking at the balance of the year for video and in our plan for the balance of the year we have not put a catch up in there for q primarily because of the  some of the softness that we have seen in the marketplace we dont think that’s going to happen over the balance of the year which gets us in a position where we can actually go our video revenue on a yearoveryear basis which is our goal now we thought it would be a little bit higher but again we had a miss in the neighborhood of  million  million in q that we dont think were going to make up but again we will still be a yearoveryear positive growth roughly about  million or  million of our bookings in quarter one were related to cloudbased activity and that’s  million of  million in revenue that would have happened in the old model in q and a new model it’s a recurring stream that’s going to happen over a couple year period of time so although we didnt  we did build that into our plan we are building a recurring revenue stream as we go forward and then we have calculated that in our balance of the projection for q through q this year so were still looking for a pretty healthy video environment over the balance of the year patrick if you want to… patrick harshman i think that should help tim savageaux okay understood and one final question from me i dont know if you guided to this level of granularity before but is there any change in your margin expectations over on the cable edge side as that ramps exiting the year or is you seem to be a bit lower in q maybe that’s sort of time hal covert a couple of points tim just to follow on first of all let me start with the positive our video margin is really looking good for the full year round  to  that’s back to our historical level so we’ve compensated for the lower level we had by couple percentage points in  because of tvn on the cable edge side we expect to end the year with a margin that approaches the mids as we start shipping our cableos products the margin in quarter one and quarter two for the most part has been impacted by lower service levels so we didnt have as much we have more professional services going on in those quarters and has a lower margin associated with it so it is a little lower in the first half of the year but we expected to pick up in the back half of the year tim savageaux got it thanks very much i’ll pass it on hal covert thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from greg mesniaeff of drexel hamilton your line is now open greg mesniaeff yes thank you patrick you mentioned in your opening remarks that one of the factors affecting gross margin in the quarter was higher services and support revenues can we drill down a little deeper on that is that primarily tied to the video business in the quarter or the cableos business in some of the opportunities you are working on right now in terms of the next generation ccap products let me stop there patrick harshman yes as hal mentioned a moment ago greg that specifically it was a strong quarter from a services and support point of view and it was particularly strong on the cable side i should explain that as we as a company kind of get geared up to really be able to support docsis deployments in the field of in earnest in volume one of our initiatives is to make sure that not only do we have the right product but we have the right services capability so in fact starting a year ago we started to get our services group involved even with the thirdparty at docsis product offering services that we might not only  might not normally provide to cable operators just to make sure that our people out there are fully capable aware trained on working in a cable head environment around all of the high speed data solutions so part of that is what you are seeing there a relatively higher mix of services and support in general particularly around services for cable and of course from a mix perspective with lower product revenue in the quarter you end up with a lower blended gross margin greg mesniaeff okay and when do you think that ratio will turn more favorable for you for services versus product in the cable world thank you patrick harshman yes i just mentioned a few minutes ago greg i think that in q once we start shipping our new cableos parts of volume we should see an improvement and then we actually believe we can really start pushing close to the  hitting the  goal which is our  in total which is our longerterm target as we exit the year you may recall at our old legacy business was more in  closer to  so we are looking for a nice uptick again as we exit the year once we start shipping cableos and volume hal covert the business in aggregate they simply higher video product and software mix will drive a higher composite gross margin which is what we are anticipating for the next quarter greg mesniaeff sure and will it be fair to say that the video business is really not requiring them as much or as much at all services revenues as the cable business hal covert yes i think it fits the normal pattern that we’ve had in our video business in the past and again i think the positive thing about our video business from a gross margin percentage standpoint now is you know our target is to get back up to the  to  which we have historically experienced prior to the tvn acquisition last year patrick harshman and that includes associated service hal covert that is also indiscernible so we are in a pretty good track on the video side gross margin percent wise greg mesniaeff thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from steven frankel of dougherty your line is now open steven frankel good afternoon so the guidance for the rest of the year in terms of gross margins and we’ve been digging into that a little bit here with the cableos side but it still looked like the overall it’s a little lower than what we’ve anticipated before is that just a lower revenue run rate or are there pricing pressures going on in the video business that’s bringing gross margins hal covert i think you have to look at the two businesses so on the video side it’s primarily because of just lower revenue that we experienced in q as i said before we are not trying to catch that up from a gross margin percent wise we are right on target video wise to get between  and  and in that part we are really happy with on the cable edge side again as we mentioned earlier on we were kind of dragging in quarter one and quarter two to get a little bit better in quarter three but in quarter four we expect it to get back up to the targeted level so essentially it is driven more by revenue than anything else right now and initially on the video side we thought our video revenue would be above the  range and now we are at up  at the high end of our guidance essentially because of the miss that we had in quarter one so it is revenue driven steven frankel okay and then on the transition to cloud and saas are there any more metrics that you will be willing to share with us in terms of size of that backlog or the number of cloud and saas deals you have today hal covert patrick and i over the last and indiscernible runs a business and have been talking about that were going through a fairly strategic review of the business over the next couple of months here and now plan is in the back half of the year to start giving you a whole lot more guidance on that it’s starting to get to be a meaningful number for example we talked about  roughly about  for bookings in quarter one where we are related to our saas business and that represents roughly about  million revenue stream so we are at a point where we need to get more guidance and direction on that and transparency and we will be doing that steven frankel and do you think through the transaction in the next couple of quarters there is a lot more asp pressure in the video side or hardware sales and hardware pull through fall into low enough level that that’s not a headwind in the back half of the year patrick harshman we dont assume much change through the back half of the year i mean you can never say never but it is an interesting time what is happening competitively let me just put it on the table you know historically our largest competitor in this space ericsson is going through some reconsideration of where they are going with the media business and we see that as a positive thing yet there is others in the market applying pressures but on balance actually we think it is a relatively more benign competitive environment and looking outside of the company and inside of the company were pushing hard on the innovations and the move to software that we’ve discussed so i don’t want to take the possibility of continued price pressure off the table but we think that from a couple of different perspectives were better positioned ever than ever to withstand that and it’s one of the reasons why as hal as mentioned a couple of times we are confident about the gross margin in the video business bouncing back due to the  to  level that we’ve talked about here steven frankel okay and you speak with a lot of confidence about the cableos ramp maybe if you could tell us what gives you that confidence is that the detail of the discussions youre having with the customer is it where you are in the trials or it is just your confidence in your companys ability patrick harshman it is a confluence of a couple of different things in no particular order as i mentioned earlier take harmonic out of it this industry is actually finally waking up to the fact like much of the rest of tech has the combs that have a virtualization can be extremely powerful the concept of edge processing and the network can be extremely powerful and by powerful i mean something that can open up tremendous scalability as well as cost efficiency so that kind of a hard is hitting the industry i mean we are certainly helping it but it is not just coming from us thats extrapolation in this industry of things that have happened elsewhere so we are confident that  we are increasingly confident that cable is not going to be some kind of a isolated part of the broader tech landscape but that is immune to the power of virtualization and the power edge processing so i think that is one reason and the kagan data we cited earlier i think speaks to that look every day that goes forward and every day we move forward  we get more experienced with our own technology we’ve become more excited about it more convinced in inspiring capability that comes out of four on lab but i think just as importantly it comes out of our customer’s labs and their evaluations and then third by virtue of not just discussions but the real substantive work that we are doing with early deployments and in the field not our cmt solutions isolation but fully integrated with the broader ecosystem we are really seeing tremendous progress and the customers are working with that are actually seeing validation of some of the promise that it was alluded to earlier the benefit of virtualization the benefits of edge processing in a distributed scenario so i characterize it is more than just discussion customers are starting themselves to have a tangible aha moment saying wow this stuff works this stuff is real looks like my benefit my business is going to benefit in this way that way and this way so all of those things i mean we have still got a long way to go and i don’t want to make it sound like it is done in by any means but you look at all of those data points and yes we are feeling increasingly comfortable and confident the risk i am gathering on let me add one more thing which is what i also alluded to which is discussions are expanding now to be more customers and particularly with the earlier customers they are becoming more about what volume deployment looks like and what the forecast is going to look like so that is kind of a tangible data point a tangible discussion it certainly also gives us confidence that what were doing is real and it is something that we can with increasing confidence bake into our plan steven frankel and could you give us a rough idea of how many live field trials you have ongoing today and maybe what that looks like last quarter patrick harshman up until recently we have been focused on a number that is less than five and our strategy still becomes not to attack simultaneously  cable operators around the world but we are north of five south of  right now steven frankel okay and any update on the cfo transition patrick harshman we have a search ongoing we are pleased to be speaking seriously with a number of good candidates but there is no imminent announcement and nor have we finalized or completed the search steven frankel and is hal staying until there is somebody else on board or you will appoint somebody to take his place on an interim basis hal covert i will tell you what my plan is and then patrick can tell you his my plan is to stay fully engaged and active the business is going through a rough spot right now and i believe that we will make it through the transition and again i am fully engaged until patrick tells me to disengage patrick harshman so look it has been a pleasure and a privilege to have hal on the staff and on the team for these past whatever it has been  months and i and the rest of the team and our board are deeply appreciative of his willingness to stay with us in leadership capacity through the successful completion of the search steven frankel okay great thank you patrick harshman thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from matthew galinko of sidoti your line is now open matthew galinko hi good afternoon so its  of bookings the right level to think about for the full year in the video business in terms of how much is coming in on a saas basis hal covert you know right now matthew i would take that number and we will give you more information when we announce a set of metrics or statistics that you can follow my guess is it is going to be higher than that but for right now i think until we complete our strategic review over the next few months here i’d go with the five even at that level is first to build up a pretty interesting recurring revenue stream over the next few years but there is no doubt in anybodys mind here in the company that people are going to move to the cloud base model and it will take a few years for that to happen and again we will lay out more of a game plan within the next few months here matthew galinko sure maybe it might be helpful if you could share what your internal expectation might have been coming into the quarter and the year for that is that all possible hal covert i think right now we did have an internal expectation we are probably cracking slightly ahead of that right now and we did have that built into the plan but again i think in the next few months when we complete our detailed strategic review we will provide more information that you can actually start tracking we realize because of the transition the business is going through a positive transition by the way that we need to help with more transparency along that line and we will do that matthew galinko okay and last one from me in terms of the  million run rate you are talking about or exit rate for cable edge business does that anticipate any additional tier  wins hal covert it does anticipate tier  wins more than one and we think it will happen again in the fourth quarter and that’s the game plan and that lights the trials that patrick highlighted earlier on matthew galinko got it thank you operator thank you and the next question comes from simon leopold of raymond james your line is now open unidentified analyst thank you for taking my question this is indiscernible in for simon can you please talk about your competitive position in the next generation ccap products patrick harshman sure with the first two who announced and released a the fully virtualized solution you may recall we announced that in the cable show in philadelphia in october of last year and this completely virtualized solution all the way down to the physical layer everything but the physical layer has a tremendous potential cost flexibility of deployment and scalability advantages not really different than the way you see virtualization being leveraged in other parts of the broader tech and communications space so i think that’s first and that is a broader advantage the second thing it really leverages or enables quickly is the seamless support of both centralized as well as distributed architectures and here again many cable operators are gravitating to the ideas idea of distributing distributed architectures as a way of within the constraints of existing real estate head ends et cetera power budgets et cetera as a way of quickly scaling up a broadband capacity in the access network so full virtualization seamless within that  under that umbrella seamless incorporation of both distributed and centralized architectures tremendous cost scalability advantages and flexibility and as mentioned earlier the response from the cable operators leading cable operators who were really ahead of the rest of the pack and thinking about this and working on it has been quite positive unidentified analyst thank you and then one more from me last quarter you expressed optimism regarding the adoption of your new products in the second half of  can we get an update on your view regarding these opportunities and are you basically are you seeing incrementally more or less optimistic today then you did on your last earnings call thank you patrick harshman yes sure we summarized that earlier but i think it bears repeating we are feeling incrementally more confident simply because we’ve made good progress to the first quarter we have one scale deployment in europe and we have a couple of other significant field trials in the us and elsewhere all of which have gone quite well and that gives us more technical confidence it gives our customers confidence not only in the technology and the standalone way but the way it can be integrated into the broader operating environment and based on this positive progress our discussions with our customers have now pivoted those customers have pivoted towards forecasting and planning for volume deployment and at the same time those trials and tests are not really particularly super well kept secrets in the industry you are not hearing anything from us but nonetheless other cable operators are aware that we are doing very interesting things in the market and so our credibility  it is   of technology of our company in this area and the credibility of this kind of technological approach all that is gaining momentum and so that is giving way to more customer discussions and more customer engagements and it leaves us confidence that we will see additional design wins before the end of the year unidentified analyst okay thank you patrick harshman thank you operator thank you and that concludes our questionandanswer session for today i would like to turn the conference back over to mr harshman for any further remarks patrick harshman all right well thank you very much and just ramping up we want to emphasize that despite a slow first quarter there is so good reason to remain confident in our business on the video side of the house the sales pipeline is solid momentum behind our new cloud and saas capabilities as we just discussed is strong and we have new record backlog and deferred revenue and were continuing the necessary operating improvements to achieve doubledigit operating margin for the balance of the year in cable edge while the nearterm financial outlook remains challenging that’s no surprise and the real story here is about our increasingly successful cableos field trials and commercial deployments and our expanding customer engagements again as we have just discussed all of which keep us on track for the start of a meaningful multiyear volume ramp in the second half of the year we are undeterred by the first quarter and in fact we are encouraged by what’s happening strategically behind it and believe me we are hard at work on the second quarter and the rest of the year in that context we very much appreciate your continued support and we look forward to providing you additional updates on our second quarter

joining the call today so let’s turn to our slide  our fourth quarter revenue was  million up  sequentially and  yearoveryear our strongest revenue quarter in three years underlying this top line result is a story of two business segments different points of transformation further along is our video business which delivered revenue growth of  from last quarter and  yearoveryear well our still precableos cable edge performance was expected with revenue down  sequentially and  from a year ago and combined bookings were  million up  from the third quarter and  from a year ago driven principally by our video business as a result of greater than one booktobill for the fourth out of last five quarters backlog and deferred revenue remains at a near record level of  million up  sequentially and nearly  from the fourth quarter of  underscoring the continued shift of our video business towards software services and recurring revenue gross margin was  up over  percentage point sequentially further highlighting this ongoing software and services transitioned of our video business i’m putting it all together eps was  highlighting the earnings power of our video business as we approach full integration of thomson video networks albeit offset by the continuing shortterm loss of our cable edge segment as we invest heavily on our cableos launch so with that summary let’s take a closer look at our video business and turn to slide  the first key message here is we’re driving profitable growth on the video side of the house delivering sequential top and bottom line improvements in  and finishing in a real high note with record fourth quarter performance video segment revenue grew to  million gross margin exceeded  and segment operating margin expanded nearly  basis points to  demonstrating the viability of doubledigit operating margin target we’ve established for this business the second key message is that our video business transitions to software over the top and cloud continue to gain momentum and thanks to no small part to the addition of thomson video networks sales of our softwarebased video clients has grew over  yearoveryear and during the quarter eclipsed for the first time sales of legacy hardware based appliances and one of the key drivers of this software plans growth is increasing demand for new higher quality live over the top services in fact enabled by our innovations over the past year one ph of the top video codex and compression efficiency over the top license sales were also up over  yearoveryear as over the top format accounted for over half of the total profiles we delivered to the market in  and well most of this over the top business was down as traditional perpetual license capex the fourth quarter saw us continue to expand our new cloud based software as a service model including signing on an additional tier  account and recall that we announced our first tier  cloud customer on our previous conference call so important context for the video revenue bookings and deferred revenue numbers where reporting is modestly growing recurring revenue stream and carrying this momentum forward the third key message is that our video business outlook for  remains positive while we anticipate and exaggerate sequential first quarter decline due to both the strength of the fourth quarter and the fact that several new first quarter deals will be recurring revenue rather than traditional capex the fundamentals of our video business are healthy our innovation and service engines are strong our full year booktobill is record  our backlog and deferred revenue stands at alltime high as the business transitions to be more software and servicecentric and we’re building new recurring revenue streams leveraging the industries most advanced cloud based video processing capability all of which means we’re executing on our longterm strategy to drive sustainable video business earnings growth okay with that let now turn to our cable edge business on slide  well i’m pleased to share significant fourth quarter progress on our cableos growth agenda our first year we achieved our first ga product release of cableos meaning we now have a high performance software based cmts available for sale in the marketplace second we made our first revenue shipments of this product and saw the product deployed into live commercial environment delivering docsis broadband service to paying european cable subscribers and third we further expanded our tier  customer engagements during the quarter expanding both centralized software and distributed cmts architectures while deepening our software feature set and operational knowhow we’re demonstrating strong industry leadership here and our innovations and progress continue to garner serious tier  customer engagement now at the same time global demand for legacy edgeqam technology continues to decline and consequently our cable edge segment experienced its lowest revenue quarter on record the flipside of the cableos coin as our cable customers look ahead to all ip video services the combination of weak legacy product demand and heavy new product investment will continue to weigh on our combined financial results until cableos revenue starts to ramp later this year and on this point i want to assure you that our confidence and the ultimate success of cableos continues to grow and our corresponding outlook for  and beyond remains unchanged a multichannel news article published just today citing new market research in which over  of cable operators say they’ll be deploying virtualized ccap and or distributed docsis ph architectures by the end of  certainly bolsters our view that conditions are right for us to entering this market with that in mind through the first half of this year we’re focused on successfully executing and scaling our early commercial deployments and driving successful volume field trials of both centralized and distributed virtualized software docsis architectures with high visibility field activity and credibility expanding over the next several months our plan is to then begin ramp cableos design wins and shipments in the back half of the year setting the stage not only for return to profitability of our cable edge segment but also a leading market position in  and beyond so in summary here we believe we’re uniquely well positioned to be a leading player in the new  billion plus ccap market we’re executing this plan and remain committed to successfully turning our cableos innovations into a powerful new growth engine for our business and with that hal let me turn the call over to you hal covert thank you patrick we want to thank everyone for joining our call today during my discussion i’ll cover three topics first our financial results for q  and the full year of  next our financial goals for q  and then our financial performance aspirations for  before discussing our q financial results we would like to start with some opening comments for our q  we achieved financial results for both revenue and eps ahead of our financial guidance this was primarily due to completing certain video projects that represented approximately  million of revenue and  of associated eps that we recorded in q that were initially planned for q  this event combined with q typically being our weakest quarter from a seasonality standpoint will be reflected in our financial guidance for q  although our financial guidance for q will be below wall street expectations we think that it is reasonable to consider q  actual financial results in conjunction with our q  financial goals when this approach is taken it provides a more realistic picture while business momentum with our current momentum we remain committed to our  financial aspirations that we provided during our q earnings conference call in november of  during q  we essentially completed the integration of tvn we are now operating with fully integrated functional area such as rd sales and ga just as important our it systems are integrated with one harmonic interface for our customers from a financial standpoint we exceeded our goal to obtain  million of synergies from the harmonic plus tvn combination on annualized basis starting in  and we’re well positioned for the combination to be accretive from a nongaap operating profit standpoint plus interest expense related to our convertible notes within oneyear of closing the acquisition now turning to our financial results please note that our financial results and guidance discussed during the call based on nongaap measurements the table reconciling gaap and nongaap measurements is included in our earnings call presentation and in our earnings press release issued earlier today bookings for q  were  million compared to  million in q  and  million in q  for  bookings were  million which consisted of  million for video and  million for cable edge compared to  million in  off which video represented  million and cable edge  million the increase in yearoveryear video bookings of  represented both organic and inorganic growth the decline in cable edge bookings of  was accounted for by the drop in bookings for legacy products as we continue the transition to our new cableos products and services currently underway bookings and shipments for these new offerings are planned to ramp in the second half of  nongaap revenue for q  was  million versus  million in q  and  million in q  the sequential increase reflects the continuing improvement in our video business and certain video projects highlighted earlier in addition to the sequential improvements the yearoveryear increase includes the benefit of the tvn acquisition that was closed on february   nongaap video segment revenue for q  was  million versus  million in q  and  million in the same quarter last year nongaap cable edge segment revenue for q  was  million versus  million in q  and  million in the same quarter last year in q  we did not have any  customers for  we recorded nongaap revenue of  million compared to  million in  in  nongaap video revenue was  million compared to  million in  or an increase of  million or  this increase was mostly accounted for by the tvn acquisition nongaap cable edge revenue for  was  million compared to  million in  or decline of  million or  this decline reflects the decrease in bookings discussed earlier nongaap gross margin was  million for q   million for q  and  million for q  nongaap gross margin as a percent of revenue for q  was  versus  in q  and  in q  the sequential and yearoveryear increase in gross margin was a result of higher percentage of video revenue overall with favorable software content in  nongaap gross margin was  million compared to  million for  or an increase of  million this increase consisted of higher video nongaap gross margin with a meaningful offset accounted for by cable edge nongaap video gross margin for  was  million compared to  million in  or an increase of  million this increase was mostly due to the tvn acquisition nongaap cable edge gross margin for  was  million compared to  million in  or decline of  million this decline was mostly due to the decrease in cable edge bookings and subsequently revenue previously discussed nongaap operating expenses for q  were  million compared to  million in q  and  million in the same quarter last year the sequential increase was primarily related to higher commission expense the yearoveryear increase was related to the tvn acquisition for  our nongaap operating expenses were  million compared to  million in  the tvn acquisition was a reason for the increase our nongaap operating profit for q  was  million compared to  million in q  and  million in q  the sequential and yearoveryear increase was primarily related to higher video revenue overall with favorable software mix for  our nongaap operating profit was  million compared to a profit of  million for  this decline was due to lower cable edge revenue in gross margin nongaap eps for q  was  versus a loss of  in q  and  eps in q  this improvement was related to our video business for  our nongaap eps was a loss of  compared to eps of  in  the decrease in eps was primarily due to the decline in revenue and gross margin for our cable edge operating segment which accounted for our nongaap eps loss of approximately  in  we had  million shares of nongaap common stock outstanding as of the end of q  versus  million as of the end of q  and  million as of the end of q  now turning to our balance sheet we ended q  with  million in cash and shortterm investments compared to  million at the end of q  and  million as of the end of q  the  million included net proceeds of approximately  million for the issuance of our convertible notes in december  we issued  million of convertible notes and purchased  million of our common stock concurrently as well as paying  million in related fees in  we used approximately  million for the acquisition of tvn and incurred approximately  million of cash outflow related to tvn restructuring and integration expense to summarize we ended  with  million in cash and shortterm investments from this amount deductive  million that we paid for tvn and  million of restructuring and integration expense incurred in  this calculation nets to  million of cash as of december   we had  million in cash and shortterm investments therefore if you subtract  million from  million we generated approximately  million nongaap cash flow from operations in  our day sales outstanding at the end of q  were  days versus  days at the end of q  and  days at the end of q  our days inventory on hand were  days at the end of q  compared to  days at the end of q  and  at the end of q  at the end of q  we had  million of backlog in deferred revenue compared to  million as of the end of q  and  million as of the end of q  our backlog and deferred revenue reflects the changing nature of our business as we transition to project oriented software products and services and lower level of booking shipped ph business approximately  of our backlog is projected to be converted to revenue within the rolling oneyear period staffing at the end of q  was  compared to  at the end of q  and  the same time last year the yearoveryear increase was related to the tvn acquisition we expect staffing to decline as of the end of q  now turning to our financial goals for q  as suggested in my opening remarks we think that it is reasonable to consider q  actual financial results in conjunction with our q  financial goals the following are q  financial goals nongaap revenue  million to  million which includes video revenue of  million to  million and cable edge revenue of  million to  million nongaap gross margin as a percent of revenue  to  which includes video gross margin percent of  to  and cable edge gross margin percent of  to  nongaap operating expenses  million to  million in addition i would like to highlight two points regarding nongaap operating expenses first our peak nongaap quarterly operating expenses in  occurred in q with approximately  million of expense second we believe that our operating expenses in  will be relatively flat on a quarteroverquarter basis if you take the midpoint of our q  nongaap operating expense range into consideration nongaap operating loss of  million to  million nongaap eps loss of  to  nongaap common shares of stock outstanding approximately  million shares cash and shortterm investments at quarter end  million to  million which includes payments of approximately  million for tvn integration charges incurred in  nongaap effective tax rate  now i would like to highlight our key financial performance aspirations for  these are the same aspirations that we communicated during our q  earnings conference call first our target is increased nongaap video revenue on a yearoveryear basis this statement is based on normalizing our  nongaap video revenue our nongaap video revenue for  would have been approximately  million with a full year of tvn nongaap revenue therefore our normalized  nongaap video revenue was  million as reported plus  million or  million that is a base in which we plan to grow in  and pursuit doubledigit nongaap operating profit for our video operating segment next our goal is to achieve an annualized run rate for nongaap cable edge revenue of approximately  million in the second half of  propelled by shipments of our new cableos products and services with this revenue run rate we plan to pursue our goal of achieving doubledigit nongaap operating profit for our cable edge operating segment as we exit  based on this goal we believe that our cable edge operating segment will not be a nongaap drag on overall eps in  as it was in  we will report on our progress and related action plans as we pursue our financial aspirations during each of our earnings conference calls in  i will now turn the call back over to patrick patrick harshman okay thanks hal turning to our last slide slide  we want to close by emphasizing the transformative progress we made in  and how it sets us up well for an exciting and pivotal  specifically we have one overarching objective and that is to build on the momentum created by our video and cableos software innovations to significantly improve the longterm profitability and cash flow of the business in video objective number one is to increase value by driving continued revenue growth in margin expansion catalyzed by the ongoing conversion of the market to software based over the top platforms and objective number two will grow market share and strengthen our financial model by further advancing our leadership position in cloud software as a service offerings and k with the successful integration of thomson video networks largely behind us we’re creating improved operating leverage in the business is evidenced by our fourth quarter segment results we’re now focused on bringing it all together over the course of this year to deliver objective number three doubledigit operating margin in the business on a standalone basis our video segment is strategic market leading and profitable business with compelling upside and on the cable edge side of the house we entered the year with the industry’s first fully softwarebased cmts on the launch pad with much product development heavy lifting behind us objective number one is successfully scaling early commercial deployments and several advanced high volume field trials and here i can tell you the year is off to a good start at the same time there is growing industry buzz around what we’re doing and objective number two we have the pedal to the metal to ensure new design wins with additional tier  operators and hal just outlined objective number three continues to be to exit the year with both  million annualized run rate and a competitive market position that will enable a compelling growth business well into the future while the first quarter is looking a little softer following a strong fourth quarter we want to emphasize that our broader targets for  remain unchanged we’re moving full speed ahead leading the charge and softwarebased video processing and cable broadband delivery and we continue to see tangible new momentum in results as we share with you here today our entire organization is excited confident and we’re laser focused on the continued execution of our strategic video and cable edge growth initiatives and on driving a sustainable new phase of profitable growth and shareholder value creation so with that let’s now open up the call to your questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions and our first question comes from george notter of jefferies your line is now open george notter i guess i wanted to start up by asking some questions on the cableos side i know from prior conversations with you guys that either a still lot future developments that was going on in the cableos platform and you had a minimally viable product i think was the term that you used and you were going to continue to kind of build out the future i guess i was curious where exactly are you in that development and when do you get to threshold where you feel like it’s more broadly available and applicable to your customer set thanks patrick harshman so george thanks for the question we feel that we’ve passed that threshold you’re current in remembering that whatever it was three or four months ago we were closer to i would call the minimal arrival product phase we made tremendous progress over that time and that what has enabled us to have our first ga launch of the product and in fact being production with a major cable operator in europe today so i would call ourselves future complete with just the hesitation indiscernible that particularly in the world of virtualized cmts and software and somewhat new and there is a lot of evolving ideas about the broader ecosystem so we have a product that works well and we think delivers on the features you would expect and off the shelf cmts today that being said there is some additional feature development ongoing that’s really almost towards  functionality in the context of a virtualized system so really what we have over the next four months between now and midyear george it’s less about feature development and it really is more about sure that we’re operationalized ph that we’re ruggedized that we demonstrated the solution really at significant scale and volume and that’s the work that we’re embarked on now george notter got it okay and then if i heard you correctly you were talking about the cable edge segment is exiting this year at  million revenue run rate if i remember correctly from last quarter that was also the same commentary and so is that correct and then also the legacy platforms here are rolling off i guess that puts more weight on your cableos platform in terms of how you think about the revenue contribution and i guess i’m wondering what’s changed that makes you more positive on the cableos revenue contribution if the math is right here thanks hal covert yes to your first point george i think you’re correct on saying that this is same picture that we had during our last earnings call we think we can exit this year  again on the back half of the year with  million annualized run rate based on the information that patrick provided about the progress and the rollout that we’re pursuing right now we think that’s a pretty solid number your second point about the legacy product drop off in q again there was  million and we think in q we’re going to be roughly in the same range about  million although the mix of that’s going to start changing cableos starting to pick up again with the first shipments in q we think we’re building on that the real momentum will start into q and beyond so we think we’re in a good shape from a revenue standpoint and as we indicated in our last earnings call we believe that the cableos parts are going to have a higher software content so we feel good about the margins again the real impact being in the second half of the year but that positions us then to exit the year with the doubledigit operating profit for our cable edge business as we roll into  george notter got it okay that’s helpful and then on the  million quarterly run rate is that do you think you can achieve that run rate just with the customer that you’re shipping at or shipping to commercially right now obviously in addition to the legacy products or does that require turning on additional cable operators for ga and for revenue prior to yearend hal covert it’s not a high number of customers but it is more than one customer and we’re currently shipping to more than one customer and we expect that will continue again we’re not looking for dramatic uptick we’re looking for few solid tier  deals to happen for us in the back half of the year and then we think we have the opportunity to build on that and getting more tier  customers as well as the fast followers that we think will happen once the tier  guys really start pursuing with the new products george notter got it okay fair enough thank you very much operator thank you and our next question comes from steven frankel dougherty your line is now open steven frankel maybe we could start with just how many cableos trials are going on today and what is the pipeline look like for other companies and may trial over the next couple of quarters patrick harshman it’s not an exact number that we want to disclose but let’s call it several and there’s multiple like here in the americas and there is multiple in europe right now as hal just highlighted our focus is on quality i would say over quantity we think that there are certain large influencers in the marketplace and our strategy is really around doing a great job and proving our metal with the influencers and then capitalizing on that with what you might call i think what hal just referred to as fast followers in the market steven frankel okay and switching gears a little bit what was the organic growth in the video business in quarter in a year hal covert again we’ve seen as patrick highlighted a continuing strength in our business and if you take our core video business the organic piece of it we actually had yearoveryear growth and it’s a pickup in over the top activity as well as just our continuing shift from the hardware orientation the acis based approach that we have before to software and off to shelf hardware so just general health across all of our geographies steven frankel okay and when do you think k becomes meaningful driver to this business patrick harshman it sounds like the internal question it’s certainly creeping in and becoming more and more present our server platforms we’re supporting k and we’re seeing growing demand for that and indeed there is growing activity around the k delivery in fact there was a news item just today about a k system being delivered by scs i think frontier is the latest customer they’ve signed up and as you know from previous press releases we’re part of that ecosystem so we don’t expect it to be a huge hockey stick driver at least our guidance doesn’t contemplate that in the video business but we think it’s starting to pick up and it’s certainly something we got our eye on in terms of upside from a volume perspective we wouldn’t expect to see that before the second half steven frankel and video margins obviously step down in q because of the revenue that got pushed is there anything other volume you need to get that business to doubledigit operating margins and keep it there hal covert i think in q as i mentioned we have those projects that we actually closed in q that we initially planned for q also had a pretty good software content to them and that resulted in the step down for q but if you look over the balance of the year we believe that our software aspect of the whole mix will continue to be strong so we think we’re at a run rate now to generate a doubledigit operating profit and we just need to concentrate on the top line we have a good control over the product mix and good control over the opex related to our video business so it’s really its ramping the top line in line with our financial aspirations for  steven frankel and then one last one maybe just a brief update on where you think you’re competitively in ccap with  i saw the same article you referenced that everybody is interested in virtual ccap who else is positioned to deliver that technology today and where do you think you fit in competitive stack today patrick harshman we’ve got couple very good companies through the established players and i think that they’ve as i’ve read it in the public press that they’re acknowledging that that the market is going to pivot that way they’re talking about a transition over several years and leveraging their existing platforms to facilitate transition so just as you would expect in incumbent to say so i think relative to that we’re the  a little bit the upstart we’re not evolving from anything we’re out in the market with a completely software based more than that a completely virtualized cmts stat ph we think we’re pretty far ahead technologically and we’re starting to prove that out as i said earlier in volume in the field so it will be interesting i think to some extent it’s not that different in the virtualization trends you’ve seen parts of the telecom market from that broader perspective to some regarded little surprising it comes related to cable but we are here now and i’d say in sharp contrast to when we’ve announced this product back in october i think now the rest of the industry is acknowledging it’s not a question of if but when which is good news from our perspective and we’re running hard as the insurgents with the what we think is real leapfrog position but time will tell and we think it won’t be that much time we’re very focused as i said on proving this out greater scale over the next several months steven frankel great thank you operator thank you and your next question comes from the tim savageaux of northland your line is now open tim savageaux couple of questions and congrats on the strong q given that you’ve kind of reiterated the pro forma growth target for video in  i was interested by some of anecdotal commentary around strength in the cloud business licenses for over the top and i wonder if you can comment on the dynamics that we might expect in terms of revenue growth and gross margin as we look at video for  and i guess more specifically is it reasonable to expect maybe i guess revenue growth from the lower end and margin growth on the higher end i guess given some of these dynamics around cloud and more software based sales and maybe along those lines you can characterize kind of the size of that software business if you will or cloud business or whatever metric that might be appropriate to maybe give us the sense of those dynamics hal covert yes so let me start then patrick can chime in after that we’ve been going through two transitions in our video business the first one is going from the asic base to hardware environment that we were in the past to software and offtheshelf servers we think as patrick indicated early on we’re well into it and we absorb the impact of that and that’s embedded in our numbers now the other transition which we is just starting now and it’s going to take i think longer than the hardware transition is cloud based approach our business is picking up there as that becomes a more important part of our business just from a number standpoint we’re going to give you metrics to start measuring that we think the combination of those two will help us basically grow the top line in  as well as get our gross margin overall back in the  range that we had prior to  when we absorbed tvn so we’re making good progress there patrick talked about the initial deals that we’ve had it’s not a big number relative to our overall number but it’s going to be an important part of our numbers and it’s got the recurring revenue aspect to it so some real important characteristics and again we’ll put out more metrics as we close more deals along that track so patrick i don’t know if you want to add anything additional on that patrick harshman no i think that’s right maybe i just remind also in the earlier comments to reiterate in fact we see a modest effect even in the first quarter well the software thing is outlook on the first quarter is primarily as you outlined hal associated with traditional seasonality as well as order timing in the first quarter a third effect is the fact that we do expect to see several million dollars of cloud business close this quarter but other would have been capex that we would have recognized this quarter and instead this will be revenue that will recognize rateably over time so as hal said the good news is it’s not the whole business flipping  or greater percent so it’s not a body blow or dramatic transition but it is something that we think it’s going to build overtime and of course as that layers in quarteroverquarter we think we’ll start to see some positive benefit from the deferred revenue flowing through by the time we get to the end of the year and that’s certainly one of the reasons why we remain confident in the our full year outlook for the video business despite what maybe optically it looks like a somewhat softer first quarter hal covert and again just add kind of a final point on that i think as we indicated certainly if we run through our numbers for  we’re going to have top line growth based on our plan and again we believe that we can get our gross margin back in line so that says these two transitions that are underway are really helping us both from the top line and a gross margin standpoint tim savageaux understood and thanks if i could followup with one more question and it’s i think interesting and impressive actually that you found ph  customers in the quarter but i would like to get some color on maybe where you saw some of the strength from a bookings perspective it looks like at least service provider revenues were up pretty strong although you did have some positive comments with regard to streaming and over the top as well so i wonder if we can infer that’s your more traditional linear pay tv continuing to move into streaming type applications or perhaps if you could provide any additional color across the various categories cable satellite telco if you well or geographies from a customer perspective patrick harshman well frankly the strength in the video business was pretty broad based and that is both geographically we had a good america’s quarter but we also had a particularly good europe middle east and africa this past quarter but it was also up pretty broad based from a customer type perspective as you’ve just hypothesised indeed we had a good quarter with our service provider customers and that is telco cable as well as satellite and particular with the terrestrial guys a good amount of that was associated with new streaming platforms which is exciting for us to see that being said particularly in the us we had a good quarter also with the broadcast and media crowd but there again we see kind of convergence of technology a fair amount of that business was also streaming over the top related so fairly broad based and really that’s been part of theory of what we’ve been striving for with the video business tim savageaux okay thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from matthew galinko of sidoti your line is now open matthew galinko congrats on the strong exit  i was hoping you could provide maybe a little bit more color on the structure of those recurring deals that you talked about  are they multiyear commitments are they single year are there minimum contract values how should we think about how those deals are being put together and are they representative of how you’re intending to go forward with more of those sorts of deals hal covert yes let me start and then again patrick can chime in the deals have different flavors in general they’re multiyear deals but for the most part they’re usage based so the amount of revenue could vary again depending on the usage on quarteroverquarter basis and i think the general structure that we’re going to have going forward is try to lock in minimum periods for the deal from a timing standpoint as well as minimum commitments but again fundamentally they’re multiyear usage based deals patrick harshman yes that’s it matthew galinko great and i think you touched on this but if maybe could you just maybe just go back over your comments on more of your video sort of the profiles your video revenue this quarter relating to off top formats as oppose to traditional linear sort of expect a similar mix in  and going forward or just how you think about that patrick harshman yes so the comment was is that we saw strong growth  yearoveryear in terms of the number over the top related licenses that we sold into the market and indeed i also commented that the over the top formats or profiles actually for the first time exceeded those of the let’s say the traditional broadcast type the world is moving towards over the top and that’s both the new players as well as the traditional providers i think that’s all pretty clear so we think that this trend will continue what’s exciting from our perspective is that in many ways the over the top services are joining the big leagues i mean you may have noticed also i think published earlier today reed hastings comments from mobile world congress talking about the importance of video quality and regardless of the size of the screen that the over the top content is being viewed on in the way we look at it these over the top services are going to still serve everything from ultra high definition television set to a tablet to a smaller mobile screen regardless the consumer expectation is going to be of excellent video quality and it’s going to put tremendous pressure on the network bandwidth and so we think our leading codec technology puts us in a great position for this that convergence of particularly live tv delivery over these over the top networks matthew galinko great and maybe just one final question and relating to those which could deal are you finding them fairly competitive to get to percentage line from start to finish if you give us some idea of how long it’s taking to go patrick harshman i think it’s a question would be better served answer for your six months or now just when we got greater statistics a little bit like cableos we’re not going after every account we can’t hear we’re really targeting influential players where we see the right business model to flip from capex to cloud and so therefore and frankly as hal alluded to just a moment ago each of the situations we’ve been successful and so far had a little bit of a different flavour that being said i think that the convergence of our let’s say excellent traditional video technology now packaged up in a cloud ready format it’s unique in the market place and we’re definitely finding competitive differentiation through this combination matthew galinko great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from victor chu of raymond james your line is now open victor chu i just wanted to delve a little into your indiscernible business i think you guys touched on it earlier a little bit but are there specific factors there driving your visibility and optimism towards the  million annual run rate for the second half of the year because i guess the guidance seems to imply some pretty extra ordinary sequential growth i guess in the latter half of the year so i guess what things are driving you to be confident in keeping that guidance hal covert let me start and i’ll pass it to patrick we went through a fairly extensive planning process for  and based on that planning process which is heavily integrated to interaction with our customers we believe that based on trials that are going on right now and feedback that we’re getting from them and they’re anxious to move forward because this saves them lot of money and enhances their position with tier customers that the ramp that we talked about will occur in the back half of  again primarily based on our rd progress as well as customer feedback patrick i don’t know if you want to patrick harshman no i think that’s exactly it we’re certainly not making any projections in a vacuum ph we’re closely engaged with several customers as i said actually spanning both the americas and europe and based on the progress we’re making the feedback we’re getting we built the business plan that we have a high amount of confidence in victor chu okay and i guess i wanted to ask quick about the pullins was the pullins revenue in the fourth quarter related by any chance related to the warrant agreements that you entered into with some of your customers i guess okay i’m sorry hal covert i’m sorry i didn’t want to cut you off victor go ahead and finish you victor chu well and if it is is it possible that you could see a recurring pattern towards the end of the year again if this is a pattern that we should kind of expect to be seasonal perhaps going forward hal covert first of all i wouldn’t characterize them as pullins we didn’t intentionally pulled them in we completed a project and based on completing that project that put us in a position where we fundamentally had to recognize revenue and record it and we’re likely to have that situation continue on a quarteroverquarter basis because again as we’ve indicated our business is going more to project going more to project oriented activities and it’s hard to tie down the exact date that a project closes on so if it flips from one indiscernible to another may end up in another quarter and these projects had nothing to do with our cableos activity in fact they were in our video segment not in our cable edge segment patrick harshman and so therefore there was no connection to the warrant agreement that you hal covert yes no connection at all victor chu okay so it wasn’t really okay great thank you operator thank you and i’m showing no further questions at this time i’d like to turn the conference back over to mr harshman for closing remarks patrick harshman okay we’re good we’ll just wrap up by reiterating that we’re pleased by the growth and profitability in our video business and the underlying competitive momentum that we’re generating there particularly around our software based initiatives and for us as you’ve heard this afternoon  is all about continuing to drive this forward so in the other hand in the cable edge side of things while the shortterm financial outlook remains challenging the real story here is all about executing this cableos volume field trials and early commercial deployments to the first half of the year and of course then we’re really looking forward to the back half of the year and to start the meaningful multiyear volume ramp of this new business we appreciate very much your support your feedback and we look forward to keeping you all updated and speaking with you again soon thanks very much everyone operator thank you ladies
