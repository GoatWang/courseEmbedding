great ideas and living a life of “do” johnson cook on looking two steps further “the original idea was around this very simple problem that stuff doesn’t get into the crm so that was where we started we said ‘hey there’s a big hole here’ we were looking more at the crm less at email we said ‘email is a big thing we can add to the crm’ the clients were really asking for the very small incremental innovation it was the investor pitches over six months to about  investors where we refined our vision they looked at what we were doing ans said ‘you guys have a solid team you got a solid idea but you’ve got to find the bigger vision you’ve got to find the platform play what’s the billiondollar platform that can go disrupt something not just ‘let’s help crms be better’’ it was cool because that vision was there all along and companies would eventually come to the realization and would ask us for that but it was the investors who challenged us to look two steps further than we were looking right now” click here to listen to the interview kel landis on doing “i say that the twoletter verb ‘do’ is the most powerful word in our lives if we will live what it means it just means that the

long list of ‘want to do’s’ or ‘one day i’m going to do’s’ this book talks about ways to examine what to do and what not to do and finding the inspiration and the tools to do it and then acknowledging
