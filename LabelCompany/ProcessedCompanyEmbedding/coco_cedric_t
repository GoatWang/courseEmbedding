article talent development from employed  to engaged lowes harnesses employee engagement to drive business results and customer satisfaction by coco cedric t read preview article excerpt regardless of whether you sell home improvement supplies or compete for customers in another industry the benefits that come from an engaged workforce are a competitive differentiator and should be a critical objective the research is undeniable gallup estimates disengaged employees cost the us economy as much as  billion a year the united kingdom  billion a year and in japan  billion yearly research finds that between  percent and  percent of employees in the workforce today are actively disengaged and are dragging down key performance indicators with their poor customer interactions increased sick days and lower productivity gallup research shows that at average companies about  percent of employees are engaged lowes is not an average company at lowes more than half of our employees are classified not only as engaged but also as fans of the company this is a source of pride and a strategic objective that we diligently work to maintain establishing the link between employees and customers our mantra sounds like the mantra of so many successful corporations employees are the lifeblood pulsing through our operations yet according to the research figures above lowes has successfully tapped a level of employee engagement that seems to have eluded many others for lowes employee engagement is key for a number of reasons the holistic combination of employee engagement and customer satisfaction has a predictive effect on financial performance our research shows us that in stores where employee engagement levels increased overall sales for those stores jumped proportionally stores where employees report higher levels of engagement have improved performance even in very busy stores where higherthanaverage sales per employee would normally pull down customer satisfaction scores our research found that having highly engaged employees slows or halts this effect of course when engagement falls the opposite occurs illustration omitted measuring engagement is one of the ways we gauge the commitment of our workforce admittedly our workforce hasnt always been so engaged and now that the majority is we face the new challenge of maintaining employee engagement in the long term the retail environment today is constantly changing customer expectations and their priorities of whats important seem to shift almost weekly while price and value drive decisions one week customer service and product offerings may shape choices the next being able to anticipate and react to such shifts drives sales and customer satisfaction but true business success doesnt stop with customer satisfaction we also must understand todays workforce dynamics and figure out what values needs and desires drive our employees after all our  employees not only have the power to influence shopper experiences and purchases they also are consumers at lowes fully visualizing and understanding our workforce is more challenging than at any other time in history today members of multiple generations work side by side in our stores not only does each generation have its own expectations from lowes as an employer but within each generation exists a wide range of opinions and desires shaped by culture upbringing geography socioeconomic status and more illustration omitted on top of that the psychological contract employees have with employers has evolved as well employees no longer think about joining a company for life rather they move between employers in search of the values they hold highest at the moment such as more money career opportunities job flexibility and worklife balance applying advanced analytics for employee research building a culture of engaged employees begins with our executive team as lowes chairman and ceo robert niblock has aptly said to be successful we must win trust with our customers and that means enabling and empowering our employees to earn that trust … subscribe today subscribe to questia and enjoy full access to this article and
