forwardlooking statements forwardlooking statements speak only as of the date they are made and except as required by law we undertake no obligation to revise or publicly update any forwardlooking statement for any reason overview we are an early stage company that intends to acquire a series of businesses which specialize in compounding pharmacy activities largely direct to consumers and to doctors and veterinary professionals description of pharmaceutical compounding the vast majority of medications are massproduced by pharmaceutical drug companies they aim to treat a specific medical condition for a large segment of people problems can arise when a patient has a medical condition that cant be treated by one of these massproduced products pharmaceutical compounding done in compounding pharmacies is the creation of a particular pharmaceutical product prescribed by doctors to fit the unique needs of a patient that cant be met by commercially available drugs to do this compounding pharmacists combine or process appropriate ingredients using various tools this may be done for medically necessary reasons such as to change the form of the medication from a solid pill to a liquid to avoid a nonessential ingredient that the patient is allergic to or to obtain the exact doses needed or deemed best of particular active pharmaceutical ingredients it may also be done for more optional reasons such as adding flavors to a medication or otherwise altering taste or texture examples of compounded formulations include medications with alternative dosage strengths or unique dosage forms such as topical creams or gels suspensions or solutions with more tolerable drug delivery vehicles compounding pharmacies and pharmacists adhere to standards and regulations set by the us pharmacopeia national association of boards and state boards of pharmacy for quality assurance and accuracy the compounding pharmacy business has the potential to provide high margins and allow the pharmacy to specialize is certain solutions for specific maladies so it can target specific markets efficiently we intend to focus on the acquisition of compounders who have a a large client base in the veterinary area b a strong set of proprietary compounding solutions versus nonproprietary overthecounter otc medicine sales and we expect economies of scale from the consolidation of materials procurement offbalance sheet arrangements since our inception except for standard operating leases we have not engaged in any offbalance sheet arrangements including the use of structured finance special purpose entities or variable interest entities we have no offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to stockholders critical accounting policies in the first quarter of  there were no significant changes to our critical accounting policies and estimates from those disclosed in the section managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our  form k recently issued and adopted accounting pronouncements see note  to our consolidated financial statements included in this quarterly report results of operations the following periodtoperiod comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily indicative of results for the current period or any future period in particular our pharmacy operations activities will commence in the third quarter of  and we have spunout the prior year educational business which is presented as discontinued operations in the consolidated financial statements this change in the nature of our operations will have and is expected to continue to have a significant impact on our financial results as a result our results of operations in the periods after commencement of our pharmacy operations will include aggregate revenue and expense amounts and the apportionment of expenses among categories have changed and are expected to continue to change as we further develop these operations further as a result of our acquisitions of our compounding pharmacies and any additional pharmacy acquisitions or other such transactions we may pursue we may experience large expenditures specific to the transactions that are not incident to our operations for the three months ended march   and  there are no continuing operating sales and related cost of sales for the three months ended march   our total operating expenses for the three months period ended march   pertaining to continuing operations were  for the same periods in  the continuing operating expense was  they were comprised primarily of expenses of pertaining  compensation expense and  professional fees related to sec and audit filings services and legal expense there is  of interest expense for the three months ended march   pertaining to interest incurred for outstanding debentures that were not converted resulting from the convertible promissory notes for the three month period ended march   the company had a net loss of  for the same period in  the company had a loss of  liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations through the sale of equity securities as of march   we had a working capital deficit of  our working capital deficit is attributable to the fact that we began implementing the companys business plan of acquiring pharmaceutical compounding businesses during the three months ending march   the company had negative cashflow from operations of  this was mainly offset through the net proceeds from the sale of common stock and promissory notes combined totaling  specific details related to our financing activities are as follows  private placements during the three months ended march   we raised gross proceeds of  through the sale of  shares of common stock to a new board member at a price of  per share plan of operations during  and following the acquisition and subsequent deconsolidation of p we revised our approach to the business strategy and added the concept of incorporating a retail more traditional pharmacy business with the compounding pharmacy we had originally focused on we also decided to develop a library of intellectual properties ip including specialized formulations and compounds of pharmaceutical materials as well as potential software and systems into a dedicated subsidiary while we expect immediate financial results from the retail and compounding areas we believe the ip and technology business will require substantial time to mature into a profitable business as a result of this revised approach the company intends to create three  wholly owned subsidiaries to hold its operations the first tn retail llc will hold its retail storefront operations these storefront locations will provide both conventional pharmacy products as well as unique compounding based solutions the store will focus on healthy holistic and natural solutions along the lines of a whole foods of pharmacy like marketing approach this becomes the feeder system for sales to our planned compounding production facilities there will be a separate subsidiary for its compounding pharmacy back office production and central fill operations called tn compounding llc this will initially be focused on the acquisition of a license operations though management has envisioned a network of these facilities located regionally it may consider a b licensed operation to accommodate the ability to provide both sterile and nonsterile products including products for stocking inventory at medical offices and hospitals lastly it expects to acquire unique related technologies including a growing library of specialized formulations many of these formulations will be unique to its operations and some it expects to either license to others for mass market distribution or it may produce for stocking inventory at a b qualified facility the entity tn technologies llc will hold those intellectual property assets as well as other novel new approaches it may engage in directly or under a license granted from the holders acquisition of compounding pharmacy businesses and financing the company intends to target compounders who have a strong regulatory compliance history b a record of profitable operations c a large cash payor component vs insurance reimbursement or an ability to shift from insurance to cash for their revenue d operations that represent a geographical hub or spoke when considered in relation to other compounders and e where the combination of operations including embedded retail and online facilitates cross selling of a growing line of products we have agreements in place or in negotiation for the acquisition of three  unique business operations in total they finished  with over  million in annualized revenue and when owners compensation is backed out and going forward management and costs included should perform profitably all have long operating histories and all are currently profitable each acquisition is unique and come with different risks we always note that past performances are not indicative of future results any past success is no guarantee of future profitability the southeast group is a threeunit compounding operation who finished  at over  million in revenues up from  million in  they have large library of specialty formulations they would become the largest hub and expand their distribution through the pending retail expansion which begins with the miami group with overnight home delivery at passthrough costs the miami group is a small retail pharmacy operation who current does  in compounding they operate inside of a grocery chain renting space from the hispanic oriented chain in two  of their sixteen  units each store has over  unique client experiences and thus far the current management has done nothing to leverage that builtin traffic we believe the units where a new footprint can be established with generate around  million in annualized sales in the first  months after opening and will reach their maximum at around  million in annualized sales currently the operations are thinly staffed and do not operate even  hours a week our plans are to make this the spoke and move any significant preparation work to a hub site either at the southeast group location or in the florida group location the florida group is the business upon which the business plan was originally formed in  they have a year operating history are an all cash business no insurance reimbursement they do half their business with veterinary operations an area we would very much like to grow the finished  at over  million up from  million and they have no sales effort no marketing and no significant presence they have been size constrained by their facility size and the lack of sales and marketing though in early march they will move into a new space fully compliant with the new usp  regulations they will be the hub for most of the florida operations and their specialty formations fit the older florida market recent developments as of may   the company had two  members of the board of directors three  members of the nonexecutive advisory board and two  members of the management team we believe that true natures management team can remain small in the near term and will consist of a four person management team with experience in  public company accounting and finance  multiunit supply chain management including retail and wholesale operations  brand marketing aimed at consumer through online and traditional retail channels and  public equity finance we believe our current team addresses most of these areas and we anticipate further additions as our size and funding can allow on january
