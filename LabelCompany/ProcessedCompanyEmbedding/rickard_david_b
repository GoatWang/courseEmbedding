corporation second quarter earnings conference call operator instructions i would now like to turn the call over to nancy christal senior vice president investor relations please go ahead nancy christal thank you brandi good morning everyone and thanks for joining us today for our second quarter earnings call i am here with dave rickard executive vice president and cfo of cvs caremark dave will provide a business update a financial review of the second quarter and guidance i’m happy to inform you that we have two other key executives with us today larry merlo president of cvs pharmacy retail and howard mclure president of caremark pharmacy services both larry and howard will participate in the questionandanswer session for your information we expect to file our q by late today and it will be available through our website at investorcvscom this morning we will discuss some nongaap financial measures in talking about our company’s performance namely free cash flow ebitda and adjusted eps free cash flow is defined as earnings after taxes plus noncash charges plus changes in working capital less net capital expenditures so free cash flow excludes acquisitions dividends and discontinued operations ebitda is defined as operating profit plus depreciation plus amortization adjusted eps is defined as diluted eps from continuing operations eliminating the effect of amortization only and assuming our overall effective tax rate for the amortization as usual we will provide guidance today using adjusted eps which is the metric used in first call consensus in accordance with sec regulations you can find the reconciliation of the nongaap measures i mentioned to comparable gaap measures on the investor relations portion of our website at investorcvscom as always today’s call is being simulcast on our ir website it will also be archived there for a onemonth period following the call to make it easy for all investors to access the call following our remarks we will have a qa session and we ask that you limit yourself to one to two questions including followup so that we can get to as many analysts and investors as possible now before we continue our attorneys have asked me to read the safe harbor statement during this presentation we will make certain forwardlooking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially accordingly for these forwardlooking statements we claim the protection of the safe harbor for forwardlooking statements contained in the private securities litigation reform act of  we strongly recommend that you become familiar with the specific risks and uncertainties that are described in the risk factors section of our most recently filed annual report on form k and now i will turn this over to our cfo dave rickard david b rickard thanks nancy and good morning everyone i am always pleased to have the opportunity to talk about another great quarter for cvs caremark we posted strong second quarter results including record sales record operating profit and profit margins record net earnings and record earnings per share i’ll run through these results in detail but first i want to touch briefly on the areas of our business where we’ve recently gotten the most questions from investors they include the pbm selling season and our clients’ growing enthusiasm for our unique new product offerings the trends we are seeing in our retail pharmacy business our progress with minute clinic and our new store program so first an update on the pbm on our last call we told you that we had already renewed more than half of our business that’s up for renewal in  as mentioned previously those renewals included accounts such as att bank of america m and the state of connecticut today i can report that our scheduled renewals for  are already over  complete we are very pleased with our progress as previously reported we did lose the med d contract with coventry due in large part to price that represents approximately  billion in revenues and was largely retail oriented so it’s not significant to the bottom line in addition you may recall that it was announced back in  prior to the merger that caremark’s contract with empire would expire at the end of  this expiration is part of empire’s planned strategy to take this business inhouse as part of its merger with wellpoint the contract represents approximately  billion in revenues and similar to the coventry med d business this account is largely retail outside of these two big health plans we are experiencing one of our best selling seasons ever importantly our client retention in our employer segment is in excess of  so what about new pbm business great news there on the last call we said we had won the right to serve about  clients which in total should have first month revenues of about  billion that included the previously announced contracts to service the employee retirement system of texas the bellsouth portion of att and ge since then we won  billion in additional new business so our new contracts in total season to date are expected to have first month revenues of  billion represented by over  accounts some of these start as early as september of  so the  billion is not the increment for  and there’s still some business which has not yet been awarded so we’ll be more specific about the next expected impact on  on the third quarter call by then the selling season will be largely wrapped up and we’ll provide a specific number for total net new business for now keep in mind that the two health plan contracts that i noted will expire at the end of this year had singledigit mail penetration while the new business we won is well over  mail in fact many of them are in excess of  mail as these clients had mandatory mail or significant mail drivers with their previous pbm this is an obvious profitability driver for the business and signals the traction we are getting with our maintenance choice offering which i’ll talk more about in a moment although we are losing two large retail health plan contracts we were recently awarded the mail service business for a significant health plan customer and we have expanded our mail offering and specialty services for a large blues plan many investors have asked us about the pricing environment well it’s safe to say that it remains competitive as it always has been price will always be an important factor in every contract decision but as evidenced by our solid new business wins we believe our awardwinning service and our new model are key differentiators for cvs caremark at our analyst day on may st in new york city we told you about some of our unmatched new offerings which only a pbm and retail combination like cvs caremark can offer our new proactive pharmacy care model is increasingly resonating in the marketplace and we’re told by clients that it has been an important factor in their pbm selection process clients have expressed their enthusiasm for products like maintenance choice and proactive pharmacy care at retail because they understand that we can lower their overall cost while improving access convenience and health outcomes for their members as i said we are beginning to see maintenance choice create a real market differential this offering lets the patient choose where they receive their day maintenance medication while maintaining the same economics to the payer and the patient the concept of preserving the economics of mail service while expanding consumer choice and access has resonated in the marketplace and led to several key wins in the  selling season proactive pharmacy care at retail is well underway our retail pharmacists are speaking with caremark members who have gaps in care and we are already beginning to deliver incremental scripts as we aim to improve adherence rates to prescribed drug regimens that will keep  both keep people healthier and lower overall healthcare costs our extra care health card provides a discount on cvs brand flexible spending account otc products to caremark members who elect to participate especially given the current economic climate clients are viewing it as an exciting new benefit they can offer their employees at no incremental cost we are still on target for reaching about  million members by early next year the offering is resonating with clients as a unique way to provide savings to members and we continue to roll out new cards each month and finally our first specialty pickup at retail client is scheduled to go live on september nd and all systems and processes are in place for a broader rollout next year overall our new offerings are making steady headway in the marketplace and are clearly being recognized as a differentiator for cvs caremark our momentum in this pbm selling season is excellent so we are feeling very good about our competitive position now let me touch on the retail pharmacy side of our business we had another solid quarter with pharmacy samestore sales growing  sales of new generics negatively impacted this number by  basis points so if adjusted for the impact of new generics pharmacy comps would have been  the generic dispensing rate in our retail segment was  in the second quarter up about  basis points from last year and up about  basis points sequentially although there are some headwinds impacting pharmacy growth across the industry such as rx to otc switches and a weak brand drug pipeline cvs continues to grow and gain market share our script growth in the second quarter and yeartodate is nicely ahead of all other chain stores and we continue to gain on independence as well in fact if you adjust for calendar differences our pharmacy samestore sales have led the industry every month for the past six months many have asked if the economy is having an impact on script trends it’s difficult to know for sure but we see no hard evidence of it in fact we did an analysis of both retail and mail we looked at the number of days between refills of maintenance medications if people were doing more pill splitting the number of days between fills would go up the study found absolutely no increase in days as for the frontend comps increased  in the second quarter adjusting for the negative impact of the easter shift frontend comps increased  we’re seeing a pickup in price increases from suppliers which we’ve been able to pass through but it has had a minimal impact on comps through june as many are effective in the second half of the year our average frontstore ticket continues to increase it was up notably versus the second quarter of last year we believe that’s a testament to the strength of our extra care loyalty card program which encourages our customers to aggregate their purchases at cvs in fact more than  of frontend sales across the store base use the extra care card so despite the economy we continue to grow and take a greater share of wallet with the help of our highly successful loyalty program i’ll also note that our frontstore margins continued to improve significantly one important driver of improved margins is the use of the extra care loyalty program to drive more profitable sales in contrast with some competitors we have not had to become more promotional this year what we have seen is increased vendor participation in extra care offers to our customers given the success of our previous targeted offers additionally our frontstore margins are benefiting from a notable increase in private label sales private label made up  of frontend sales up  basis points from last year that’s the largest increase in organic private label sales that we’ve seen in memory we think it reflects not only our continued efforts to grow private label but also more people trading down due to the economy and how does all this stack up relative to the competition well i’m pleased to report that we continued to grow share in the key frontstore categories that make up the vast majority of our sales  overthecounter beauty private label and digital photo in fact we experienced share gains versus food drug and mass competitors in categories representing  of our frontstore sales volume now let’s move on to an update on our minute clinic business minute clinic continues to evolve as the nation’s largest and most geographically diverse retail healthcare clinic system we currently operate  clinics more than all of our competitors combined and we continue to build our lead in the markets in which we operate we also expect to open minute clinics in a few key new markets in the second half of this year consistent with comments made on our last call we expect to end the year with between  and  clinics resulting in the addition of approximately  clinics in  that equates to about  growth in the number of clinics still a very healthy pace of growth on our last earnings call we told you that we were slowing growth in order to better focus our efforts on expanding services contracting with additional thirdparty vendors and working with pbm clients to offer new products and services let me briefly touch on our progress in these areas new products continued to play an important role in minute clinic’s strategic future recent new product offerings include camp physicals tuberculosis screening and an integrated behavioral modification and pharmacy based smoking cessation program additionally minute clinic initiated enrolment of patients into google’s personal health record product and is uploading records at our patients’ request we’re pleased with the increasing designation of minute clinic as an innetwork provider by health plans yeartodate  health plans have added minute clinic to their networks impacting  million americans we expect this trend will continue as we further leverage our pbm relationships and convenient cvs pharmacy locations we believe minute clinic will pay an increasingly important role in providing consumer easier access to high quality lower cost healthcare we are wellpositioned for longterm growth as our clients and consumers continue to realize the value of our minute clinic offering before i move on to the financial review i want to give you a brief update on our real estate program in the second quarter we opened  stores including  new and  relocations we closed eight others so we added  net new cvs pharmacy stores in the quarter for  our plan remains to open  to  stores about  to  will be new and the rest will be relocations and we expect to achieve approximately  retail square footage growth many of you have asked if we plan to change our store growth strategy and the simple answer is no we have been on a successful path of controlled appropriate growth and intend to continue on that path now let me turn to the details of our financial performance in the fine quarter we reported today after that i’ll provide guidance for the third quarter as well as the remainder of the year so let’s turn to our second quarter income statement total revenues on a consolidated basis increased  to  billion this figure is net of intersegment eliminations of  billion in our retail drugstore segment revenues increased  to  billion samestore sales for the quarter were up  i spoke earlier about the comp trends in both the front and the pharmacy and the drivers behind them so i won’t repeat that discussion here and how about the pbm segment  net revenues of  billion increased  over the  second quarter adjusting that growth rate for the impact of generics net revenues would have grown  for the pbm the impact of the change in pharmacare’s revenue recognition method on the second quarter was the addition of  million in reported revenues before intercompany eliminations or  million after eliminations so what drove the growth of pbm revenues total retail network revenues were  billion rising  from  levels setting aside the increase from pharmacare’s revenue recognition change retail network revenue was essentially flat to last year due to the significant increase in generics the pbm’s retail generic dispensing rate increased to  compared to  in the second quarter of  at the same time retail network claims grew  this was primarily driven by new business including the growth spurt in our pdp and addon lives as expected mail claims decreased for the quarter by  as with the first quarter the impact of new clients was more than offset by wellknown terminations during  namely the fep mail business state of new york and ohio state teachers retirement system total mail revenues declined  to  billion and within total mail revenues pbm mail was down  compared to the second quarter of  while our specialty mail revenues increased  if you exclude the fep business from last year’s data total mail revenues increased  and specialty revenues grew  in the second quarter the mail generic dispensing rate rose to  from  a year ago or  basis points our overall mail penetration rate decreased approximately five percentage points from  second quarter to  again this was largely a result of the absence of the fep mail business moving on to gross profit margin for the total company the overall business expanded by  basis points over the second quarter of  to  and we had great results in both segments within the retail segment gross profit margins were up  basis points improving to  the primary drivers of this were these  first the increase in the retail generic dispensing rate second the merger related purchasing synergies third improved shrink fourth increased private label penetration and finally the benefits from the extra care card that result in a lower percent of products sold on promotion gross profit margins in the pbm segment came in at  that’s down  basis points versus the  comparable second quarter however excluding the  basis points drag from the conversion of pharmacare’s contracts the gross margin in the pbm would have been up  basis points the pbm pharmacy margin benefited from some of the same factors that helped the retail business namely an increase in the use of generic drugs and the purchasing synergies derived from the merger and what about expenses overall operating expenses as a percent of sales improved by approximately  basis points due to solid expense control in both segments of the business in the retail segment operating expenses decreased as a percent of sales from  to  this was driven by disciplined expense control and improved expense leverage in the saveon and osco stores we acquired back in  that was somewhat offset by the significant growth in generics which pressure sales dollars while improving profitability in the pbm segment comparable operating expenses as a percentage of revenues improved by  basis points to  this was largely driven by the absence this year of integration and other merger related expenses that we saw in last year’s second quarter all things considered we saw a significant expansion of our operating margins specifically in the retail segment the operating profit margin in the retail segment grew by  basis points to over  that is over the  level to a record  the pbm segment’s operating profit margin was flat with ’s comparable results at  caremark’s industry leading ebitda per adjusted claim increased to  in the second quarter or  over last year’s comparable  excluding the fep mail business we again would have had doubledigit growth in ebitda per adjusted claim so the underlying growth of the business remains robust moving on to the rest of the income statement we saw quarterly net interest expense on the consolidated income statement increase slightly to  million that was virtually flat as a percentage of revenues year over year sequentially however this represented a reduction of approximately  million reflecting a decrease in our shortterm debt levels during the second quarter our tax rate was  in the quarter in line with expectations and our diluted share count was  billion shares that’s down considerably from last year’s second quarter due to our  billion share buyback program last year that subsequently completed earlier this year during the second quarter  we repurchased  shares that was the beginning of our most recently announced  billion share buyback program that represents roughly  million worth of stock as i said in our analyst day we intend to repurchase shares during the remainder of this year and complete the buyback during  before i move on to earnings per share i want to discuss a new line item on the income statement namely discontinued operations during our analyst day in may i highlighted the recent developments at linens and things which was a subsidiary of melville corporation the former parent company of cvs as many of you know linens and things recently filed for bankruptcy at the time of the melville restructuring cvs corporation assumed a contingent liability for leases of several former melville businesses including linens these businesses have been classified as discontinued operations for accounting purposes linens has informed us that they intend to close a number of locations several of which have leases guaranteed by us there are also some other net expenses associated with the leases our real estate team has researched the sites’ market values and assessed the expected cost of satisfying these lease guarantees the loss from discontinued operations of  million you see on our income statement represents our determination of the impact of these closings net of income tax benefits that’s the state of knowledge as we have it now we have fully provided for all obligations as best they can be determined however like any bankruptcy which has not worked its way through to reemergence or a winddown this situation is fluid and there could be more news to come but even in a worse case scenario this is simply not big enough to throw cvs caremark off track it’s inconvenient and there is some cash impact but that’s it going forward keep in mind that our guidance excludes any possible impact from linens and things so if we put the discontinued operations aside what did all of this mean for eps adjusted eps from continuing operations rose  to  up from  in  gaap diluted eps from continuing operations rose  to  for the quarter compared to  in the second quarter of  turning to the other financial statements we generated  million in free cash flow in the quarter and  million yeartodate our strong free cash flow combined with the use of  million in cash on hand allowed us to reduce our total debt by more than  million during the second quarter so we continued to strengthen our balance sheet and improve upon our credit ratios net capital expenditures were  million in the quarter which reflected proceeds from sale leaseback transactions of  million netted against the gross capital spend now let me turn to guidance for the third quarter and full year  i’ll start by saying that given the continued strength across our businesses we remain optimistic about our growth for the full year while a couple of the elements within our expectations have changed a little we are maintaining our previous annual guidance of  to  for adjusted eps from continuing operations let me walk you through the elements of our current guidance i’ll start by providing initial guidance for the third quarter we expect third quarter revenue growth for the total company to be  to  we expect pbm revenues to be down slightly in the third quarter and we expect retail revenues to be up  to  we anticipate third quarter adjusted eps from continuing operations of between  and  per diluted share up from last year’s  per share that equates to adjusted eps growth of  to  gaap eps from continuing operations is expected to be in the range of  to  per diluted share up from last year’s  per share now let’s look at the full year we still expect revenue growth for the total company of about  to  for the full year after intercompany eliminations of somewhat over  billion per quarter for the pbm segment on a comparable basis we still expect revenues to be about flat with  and we expect reported revenue growth of well over  for the year since the merger closed in late march of  for the retail segment we still expect full year revenue growth to be  to  samestore sales are expected to be in the range of  to  for the retail segment for the year that’s a slightly narrower range than before we’ve gotten a lot of questions from investors about our revenue expectations for the retail business in the second half we still expect revenue growth to be stronger than in the first half that’s largely due to somewhat easier yearoveryear comparisons as well as the incremental revenues we expect from our new offerings these include the proactive pharmacy care at retail extra care health and specialty at retail and despite the economy we are seeing very solid performance on the retail side of our business as we continue to gain share from weaker competitors i feel very good about the retail business and i think these revenue growth projections are realistic by the way in the month of july our comps accelerated to  overall pharmacy comps in july increased to  and that’s with an even higher new generic impact than we had in the second quarter and frontstore comps increased to  so we’re off to a good start in the third quarter now let’s turn to margins for the total company gross profit margins are still expected to be down modestly due to the mix impact as we average in a full  months of caremark however the gross margin performance of our two business segments will be somewhat different than our previous guidance the pbm segment will be a bit lighter than we thought this will be offset by betterthanexpected performance in our retail segment let me walk you through that the change in our margin expectation for the pbm relates to two key areas first our mail penetration rate is running a little softer than we thought that’s primarily due to downsizing in large employer clients for example in the auto industry there’s also been an impact on utilization from the rx to otc switch in the allergy category similar to what we’ve seen in the retail side of the business as you know mail order scripts are the most profitable scripts for the pbm so our gross margin will be affected by the change in mix in addition while we still expect profitability from the med d business and the pbm to be better in the second half than it was in the first half we now expect slightly lower margins in the med d business due to utilization and mix so while we had previously thought that gross margin for the pbm would increase for the year we now expect pbm gross margin to be marginally down from last year’s rate in contrast gross profit margins on the retail side of our business are now expected to improve even more than we originally forecast so the news there is quite good we now expect gross margins for the retail segment to increase by at least  to  basis points this improvement is driven by terrific performance in several areas these include betterthanexpected margins in both the pharmacy as well as the frontstore driven by improved gdr increased private label sales and reduced shrink i am delighted by the strength in our retail business across the board as we’ve said in the past our gross margin will be helped by purchasing synergies and there’s no change there we still expect more than  million in total cost synergies in  the great majority of which is from purchasing that’s up from cost synergies of about  million in  as for expenses we still expect total company operating expenses as a percent of revenues to improve that’s largely due to mix total operating expenses as a percent of sales for the pbm segment on a comparable basis is still expected to be in the neighborhood of last year’s numbers as a reduction of integration expenses and good expense discipline should be directionally offset by the  startup costs of the new business howard and the team have been bringing in the retail segment has no such headwind and also continues to exercise disciplined expense control so we still expect it to show moderate improvement we expect total consolidated amortization for  to be approximately  million and depreciation of about  million all of that will lead to solid improvement in operating profit margins for the total company i said on the last call that we could nicely exceed  for the total company our current operating margin high watermark which we achieved back in  that’s still very much in prospect we forecast net interest of about  million to  million and a tax rate approaching  net capital expenditures are still expected to be in the range of  billion to  billion for  and free cash flow is still expected to be around  billion as you can see despite a few tweaks in the details of our guidance our business is very strong and we remain optimistic about  and beyond so in summary we reported very solid second quarter results across the board and we’re wellpositioned for the future we delivered healthy sales growth and recordbreaking margin expansion in the second quarter resulting in  adjusted eps growth our retail business is outperforming the industry and gaining market share our momentum in this pbm selling season is excellent and we’re winning significant new business as clients embrace our proactive pharmacy care model payers increasingly understand that we can improve access convenience and health outcomes for the members while lowering their overall healthcare costs our minute clinic business is evolving its offerings to maximize longterm growth as more clients and consumers are recognizing the value of our offering and our guidance confirms our continued confidence in the remainder of the year with that i’ll now open it up to questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions your first question comes from the line of scott mushkin with jefferies  company scott mushkin  jefferies  company a couple of questions here maintenance choice you hit on dave in your  i guess going over the quarter and selling season what percentage of the caremark member base will be exposed or accounts will be exposed in  to this program and i guess with  does texas have it david b rickard well the program is being offered to people with mandatory mail and incentive structures that promote a large percentage of mail participation i don’t know what percentage that will represent in  obviously we’re still selling but it’s gotten good uptake and there are a couple of contracts that we’ve won primarily because of it so it clearly is gaining good initial acceptance scott mushkin  jefferies  company and i noticed you didn’t mention it as a driver for retail and it seems when we look at it it could be a pretty significant driver for retail was there any reason you excluded it david b rickard i think you’re right i think it will be a good driver for retail we don’t have much data yet so it’s a little bit early to be talking about that but we will report on that ultimately scott mushkin  jefferies  company and i guess one last i’m sure people are going to ask this question too  the gross margins on the pbm other pbms have been seeing upside you guys really aren’t i know there’s some extenuating circumstances do you have any other insights on why the gross profit may be a little bit more subdued with you guys versus your other pbm competitors david b rickard i can’t report on the competitors but obviously our gross margins are affected by the loss of the fep mail that was a very large contract and it was mail order in nature and we talked about some med d higher utilization numbers affecting our margins to an extent versus original expectation so i guess i would point to those as two operational things and then of course in addition the pharmacare grossup has a meaningful impact on the percentage margins that we report scott mushkin  jefferies  company you gave basis points on pharmacare do you have any numbers on fep david b rickard not that we’re disclosing scott mushkin  jefferies  company thanks i’ll turn over thanks very much operator your next question comes from the line of lisa gill with jp morgan lisa gill  jp morgan good morning just following up on the part d aspect of things dave as we now look at the back half of the year my expectation was that these members got into the donut hole that there would be a nice ramp for medicare part d can you maybe just explain why the tempered outlook on the gross margin and then secondly when we look at the new clients that are brought on the additional  billion can you maybe just give us some indication around specialty pharmacy and some of the other services that you are selling are you selling through minute clinic i think you had talked about the entire new book of business having very good mail utilization trends but i’m just curious as to some of the other things that you are selling them david b rickard i’m going to turn this one over to howard howard a mclure on the part d component of this some of this is really just utilization in mix you know we added a number of new lives in the part d business and we’re just seeing some increased utilization and some increased mix like others have seen in this business we will see some pickup in the back half lisa gill  jp morgan so howard then your initial expectations for what you thought you underwrote the business for is it coming out to be less than that so therefore when you get to the donut hole there’s not going to be as much of a positive impact because of all the utilization you are seeing right now howard a mclure no it’s coming in largely the way we underwrote it we’ll see that moving the way we thought it would it’s not  it’s a little heavier than we thought it was in the first half because of the accounting that you go through with that but you’ll see some  you’ll see some people moving into the donut hole and some of that lift in the third and fourth quarters from that the way we have in the past david b rickard we’re still looking at a very nice improvement second half versus first half howard a mclure as it relates to new clients we are bringing specialty into those new clients we see that as coming in most accounts that we are we as dave mentioned a couple of them made their decision because of maintenance choice so that’s a new product that we will be selling into those accounts and we were talking to a number of them about adding that we still see the sellthrough of the clinical program and good uptake on a lot of these things as well as the interest in the proactive pharmacy care solution that we talked about at the investor day lisa gill  jp morgan and then can you just lastly just remind us of where you are with specialty in your book of business as far as how penetrated it is  you know percentage of clients or percentage of  howard a mclure we’re about  penetrated throughout the book of business about  of the specialty revenues come from inaudible lisa gill  jp morgan okay great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of eric bosshard with cleveland research eric bosshard  cleveland research good morning on the retail side the optimism for progress in the second half of the year on the revenue line and the gross margin line i know you ticked off some of the factors leading to that but in this softer retail environment can you just give us a little more insight into your conviction into why the margin and especially the sales progress is going to continue or even improve david b rickard well i think what i said in the opening remarks on the sales trends is really pretty much the story that is we were up against tougher comparisons in the first half they get easier in the second half but importantly our new products from the combined entity are insignificant in the first half of the year and will become more so in the second half of the year in addition to that we have underlying strength of the extra care program and share gains pretty much across the board that’s been evident in the first half it’s going to  it’s my expectation that that’s going to continue in the second half the gross margin trends are driven by again a number of factors and i should also include in that the leverage of osco saveon we’re seeing better and better shrink results better and better sales results and so at the margin that can be influential in both of those comparisons sales and gross margin eric bosshard  cleveland research and within the new products what is the most significant and these are programs i know you’ve rolled out in the last  days or so  which are having the most material impact on revenues so quickly that you have this confidence in david b rickard well proactive care i guess is the most important thing in the very very shortterm here because it can have an effect the first day that we put it in place  that is ensuring adherence among consumers if we get them restarted on their meds we get an extra script that day secondly we’re just taking share and taking share builds business eric bosshard  cleveland research very good thank you dave operator your next question comes from the line of tom gallucci with merrill lynch thomas gallucci  merrill lynch just a couple of quick questions here i guess on the part d first just to confirm  that will still be net profitable for the year it’s just a matter of the accounting swing throughout the year or  david b rickard absolutely right it will be net profitable thomas gallucci  merrill lynch okay is it possible to get some sort of magnitude of the swing that you are seeing in terms of the profits first half drag versus second half up or  david b rickard we don’t break that out but i can tell you that there is a meaningful upswing second half versus first thomas gallucci  merrill lynch okay and something else just trying to get some perspective on the numbers i guess you mentioned the synergies in your prepared remarks some idea of the relative percent of the benefit going toward the retail side versus the pbm side would be helpful david b rickard again we haven’t broken that out it is meaningful on both sides of the business but we haven’t attempted to break that out thomas gallucci  merrill lynch okay i guess last one as sort of a followup on some other questions that we’ve seen here but i know you mentioned maintenance choice and some other things howard that newer clients are signing up for do you have an idea out of the  or so new clients that you’ve won starting i guess in september and into next year how many have signed up for just a new product as a result of the combined company howard a mclure i would say right off the top of my head at least three that come to mind two maintenance choice they say was instrumental in their decision very important one was a specialty customer who signed up for the instore delivery of specialty products that’s just right off the top of my head tom i can think of three instances david b rickard howard that’s three that had as a primary reason for signing up the fact that we had these new products i think what he was trying to get at was how many of the  have signed up for a new product whether it was a primary driver in their decision or not howard a mclure okay so if people are coming  look this is resonating very well with people the new offer here and people are coming in whether they are signing up first year for a new product they are seeing the potential here and they understand the ability that this entity this combined entity is going to be able to bring and the tools they are going to be able to bring to bear to help them control their pharmacy trends and i think people are really excited about it i mean the sales force is very excited about it and getting a lot of interest in not only maintenance choice but the proactive pharmacy care program an ability to use minute clinics to help serve their members not only for ongoing care but also for purposes of helping training for specialty injection services those types of things this is just a significant amount of buzz around all of these products and all these things that we can do so of the  i would say probably  i don’t know i’d say probably more than half had signed up for new products david b rickard that’s my sense as well and i also know of situations where people have said we’re interested in that new product we’d like to see some experience with somebody else before we actually sign up for it but if we can take it in year two we’d be interested in doing that so i think that number will grow thomas gallucci  merrill lynch great thanks operator your next question comes from the line of john heinbockel with goldman sachs john heinbockel  goldman sachs dave a couple of things given what’s happened your experience with the pdp business this year does that have any  what do you differently next year in terms of the bid process are the numbers different enough where you would change your approach or not really david b rickard no we’re talking finetuning here and this certainly doesn’t affect the approach it affects perhaps the way we forecast a bit john heinbockel  goldman sachs okay secondly if you look at that upswing second half versus first half on pdp if you look at fep and that impacts similarly how does that look second half versus first same or do you think the impact mitigates a little bit david b rickard you know it will have a similar seasonality i guess to what the overall business has but i see no reason why it would mitigate john heinbockel  goldman sachs if you guys look at adjusting for fep and pdp and sort of back into a caremark growth rate in ebit is there any sense of what that looks like because obviously the reported numbers don’t look as strong as i guess they are on an underlying basis what’s the sense of  are we looking at kind of midteens ebit growth ex these factors or what howard a mclure well without getting into ebit growth take a look at probably one of the more important things inaudible script and if you look at inaudible script from q to q it’s up  so that kind of gets out of the  year over year has an fep impact which dave said would be doubledigits without that but looking at that growth that sequential growth there you still see the strength in this company and the strength and the ability to drive generics the strength and ability to do things that are going to help people inaudible so that’s i think  if we look at that sequentially you’ll see the strength john heinbockel  goldman sachs okay and then finally where do we stand with synergies what kind of runrate are we running toward at this point david b rickard  million plus cost synergies john heinbockel  goldman sachs likely to be a lot plus or  david b rickard it’s like to be north of  and i’m not going to give you a new number john heinbockel  goldman sachs okay thanks operator your next question comes from the line of matthew perry with wachovia capital markets matthew perry  wachovia if i look at the second half guidance you’ve given for better samestore sales on the retail side better retail revenue growth in total how much of that is due to the synergies from the new offerings and i guess what i’m maybe really asking is are you still thinking about  million in revenue synergies for the year and how much of that will occur in the second half david b rickard yes i think the  is still intact it may be a bit better than that based on pbm results but we were gearing for a little over  million on the retail side and that still looks like a good call and almost all of that is in the second half matthew perry  wachovia okay david b rickard larry do you want to add to that larry j merlo well i think it’s that combined with some of the programs that dave alluded to earlier you know the strength that we’re seeing from the osco saveon acquisitions as well as the fact that there is evidence that we are picking up market share from some of the weakened competitors david b rickard and we expect that will continue matthew perry  wachovia and if i think about the  to  samestore sales does any part of that or anything within that range predicated on an improvement in the economy david b rickard no our assumption on the economy is it’s not going to get any better and it’s not going to get a lot worse so that’s the range we’re in matthew perry  wachovia and then last question maybe for howard if we listened to comments from the two independent pbms they keep talking about the positive reaction their customers and their potential customers have to the independent model and i just wonder if you have an update on the feedback you are getting from your customers and your potential customers on the vertical model  any change in the last three months or just any update there howard a mclure well i think we’ve signed  billion in new business this year and it’s not  there’s no large mega accounts in there this is  i think the best statement of that matt that we are signing business in front of a lot of business and people are not bothered by this fact people are looking at  they are making decisions on price but they are also making decisions on service and they are looking at the service that we are able to bring to bear things like bridge supplies  no one else can do that and they see that they see the benefit of that i’ve gotten letters from individuals saying this is great this is a fantastic thing that you can do for me thank you for helping so i don’t think that people are  the independent model is there the competitors are good competitors they’re good companies they do a good job we believe that we will be able to bring to bear service price and trends and that we’ll be unmatched in the industry once we get these programs fully in place matthew perry  wachovia and just lastly for me if you think of the  account wins is there any place that share  specific place that share is coming from you know the big independent pbms smaller pbms hmo owned pbms howard a mclure it’s coming from across the board matthew perry  wachovia okay thank you operator your next question comes from the line of david magee with suntrust robinson humphrey david magee  suntrust robinson humphrey a couple of things please one do you care to give any thought or prediction as to when you might have a better tailwind for the pharmacy side of the business as we lap some of the factors that you mentioned do you think we will see better trends later this year as far as the industry is concerned david b rickard well i think the  are you talking retail pharmacy or are you talking pbm pharmacy david magee  suntrust robinson humphrey retail pharmacy just the sector weakness that we’ve seen out there the last say six months david b rickard i guess you have to look at the pieces of that and think about how they affect it but for example we’ll be cycling the zyrtec effect going otc in the first quarter of ’ the absence of positive life from med d will certainly be baked in by then so i guess absent any significant new products being introduced by the pharma manufacturers i would say first quarter of ’ is probably the first time we get a meaningful change in that trend larry would you agree with that larry j merlo yeah i would david b rickard okay david magee  suntrust robinson humphrey thanks and then secondly with regard to the script growth that you are showing and the fact that you are gaining share at this point are we seeing a meaningful deviation between the older core cvs stores and those that you’ve acquired in the last five years david b rickard well yes i mean as is almost always the case following acquisition we spruce them up and advertise and get them moving a little bit better than they were and that is certainly the case continues to be the case in the southern assets of eckerd and also very much so in the saveon and osco businesses they are both growing faster than core cvs david magee  suntrust robinson humphrey and then just lastly and maybe for howard thinking about the longer term growth rate of caremark what would you  i don’t know whether you could put a number on ebit growth over time what you would expect but i’m curious what you think about the relative contributions of top line versus profit margin further expansion in the profit margins there howard a mclure well as generics continue to get introduced that reduces the revenue that also enhances the profitability so as you move forward you can look historically back at the  what the growth rates would have been had not generics been in place and see how that does impact revenue i don’t remember the number off the top of my head the impact of it this time but i believe dave gave it in his speech  revenue would have been  i believe david b rickard yeah  howard a mclure so those factors generics the increase in generics and particularly i guess when  some additional generics come out there is a lot of  there is drag on the revenue lift on the profitability david magee  suntrust robinson humphrey so in terms of the next year or two we should expect the same type of breakdown in terms of the relative drivers david b rickard howard are you  howard a mclure i’m sorry could you repeat that please david b rickard david could you repeat the question i’m sorry i’m afraid we dropped it i think we dropped david nancy christal okay next question operator your next question comes from the line of david fill with morgan stanley david fill  morgan stanley good morning thank you it’s been a big couple of months on the legislative front i wonder if you could give us your perspective on a couple of things maybe the impact of prompt pay and med d on both side of the business and also what the opportunity around eprescribing might look like in ’ david b rickard well the impact of prompt pay on med d will depend on regulations which have not yet been promulgated if we look at the legislative intent or the apparent legislative intent it obviously has different effects on the pbm side of the business and the retail side of the business net net it  again subject to final regulations  it looks like it might be very modestly positive on an overall basis for cvs caremark in terms of eprescribing that will be helped by the legislation that has been passed but it also is helped by the many initiatives that we and others are doing you are familiar with our iscribe product and the effect that that has in accelerating the growth of eprescribing you know that we have about a  share of retail pharmacy right now and we do about  of all eprescribed transactions so we are very much at the forefront of this and very much in favor of it it helps accuracy helps healthcare and is far more efficient than the old fashioned handwritten prescription process david fill  morgan stanley and just to followup on that one of your  medco in particular said that it may save eprescribing could save as much as  per new prescription is that in the right zip code for you folks do you think david b rickard we would say that’s in the right zip code yes david fill  morgan stanley great thank you operator your next question comes from the line of deborah weinswig with citigroup deborah weinswig  citigroup at the analyst meeting i was very intrigued with the new pharmacy system rx connect can you talk about if it’s still on track to be implemented by the end of the year and also stores where it has been implemented how are the pharmacists reacting to the new system and have you seen an increase in adherence and customer satisfaction as a result of kind of freeing up pharmacists’ time to interact with customers david b rickard i’ll turn this over to larry larry j merlo we are  we completed our beta we’re now in our pilot phase and everything has been extremely positive pharmacists absolutely love the system so we will begin the rollout in another few weeks and we are on track for the schedule that we reviewed at our analyst day so we’ll be completed early in ’ deborah weinswig  citigroup and any differences you are seeing in stores that have the system versus stores that don’t larry j merlo our service metrics have improved slightly and i will tell you that the satisfaction level of our pharmacists has been outstanding operator your next question comes from the line of john ransom with raymond james john ransom  raymond james looking at the third quarter and your guidance and thinking about what you just posted in the second quarter other than seasonality and the pickup you are going to get from the part d accounting is there anything that’s going to be happening in the third quarter that wasn’t happening in the second quarter we ought to be thinking about david b rickard well we’ll start to get a measurable amount of top line synergy volume on the retail side of the business other than that i can’t think of anything offhand john ransom  raymond james okay and i guess the sequential  if you’re saying  to  and you just did  just the sequential downtick is just seasonality then david b rickard well i’d say that’s a pretty consistent number as opposed to characterizing it as a downtick i mean the range covers exactly the number we just reported second quarter to third quarter  to a range of  to  yeah john ransom  raymond james and is there anything on the cost synergy side that will be accelerating in the third quarter or the back half of the year versus the first half of the year because i assume you are continuing to move through your  million plus opportunity david b rickard we are and again most of that the great majority is purchasing synergy and almost all of that was in place as we exited ’ so there isn’t a great deal of seasonality to it other than any swing in volume that takes place john ransom  raymond james and then my other question would you hazard a guess  there’s some controversy with some of the data sources ndc and ims about pharmacy script trends do you think we’re still on a positive script environment and i guess we’ll just talk retail i know you’re taking share but if you ex all the factors out do you think we’re in a positive or kind of a flat script environment as we speak david b rickard well we are in a positive script environment certainly we’re seeing growth i know the controversy that you are referring to on the data sources and that makes it hard for everybody to understand kind of what all is going on but our business is growing and i believe the overall industry is growing all right we’ll take two more questions brandi operator your next question comes from the line of meredith adler with lehman brothers meredith adler  lehman brothers a couple of questions first can you answer let us know what’s happening with generic volumes in the second half of the year versus the first half do you think the impact will be as great on sales as it was in the first half david b rickard yes as a matter of fact when we gave initial guidance for the year six months ago and then again i think in the last call our expectation is that the third quarter was going to be the biggest quarter for generic conversions in this year and that remains our view meredith adler  lehman brothers okay great and then maybe can you talk about the impact that specialty has on earnings i think others have talked about how much it contributes i don’t know if you guys will ever talk about that david b rickard well we don’t break it out it obviously is the highest priced set of things that we sell and it carries with it representative margins so the absolute dollar contribution is significant meredith adler  lehman brothers great i was wondering if you could also comment about medicaid and the outlook for reimbursement cuts i know that in california a court has put a stay on the cuts that they had proposed or actually had implemented but what are your views about what could happen in other states and do you think that the law will prevent much in the way of cuts david b rickard well i think as in other parts of our business there is continual rate pressure in medicaid reimbursement and that has certainly been the case over the past  months i think it was made more of a focus by the fact of the controversy over amp and so forth and i think states have accelerated their rate pressure on us  on us as an industry not us as a company so we have seen rate erosion there and not more than we expected but certainly significant meredith adler  lehman brothers and you don’t think that gets worse because the states’ budgets are in such bad shape david b rickard well you know there are things the states can do other than hacking away at our rates that can improve their healthcare costs and we would recommend to them programs that stimulate the use of generics and so forth tighter defined formularies so there are a number of things that they can do other than hack away at our reimbursement but that seems to also have been on the table okay brandi i’m going to take one more question operator your final question comes from the line of robert willoughby with banc of america robert willoughby  banc of america assuming that you will have net membership in the pbm business that will actually be up with the revenues that you have but correct me if i’m wrong there and i guess is there any change to you stance on the adjudication systems will you continue to maintain the separate systems or will there be a move to consolidate them david b rickard howard do you want to answer the first part of that howard a mclure well we will see increases in membership as we move through we will see some organic growth in some of our existing accounts and we will probably expect next year to have more members than we do this year david b rickard and in terms of adjudication systems as we laid out in our analyst day the strategy there is to maintain the availability of preferred frontend on each of our adjudication platforms while combining the underlying feeder systems that has the advantage that our customers aren’t disrupted and yet we get the economics essentially of a single adjudication platform robert willoughby  banc of america and do you have a sense when that process will be completed david b rickard i don’t have a specific date i can give you i will say that it will go on over the next several quarters you know maybe as much as two or three years robert willoughby  banc of america okay thank you david b rickard okay thank you all very much operator this concludes today’s cvs caremark corporation second quarter earnings conference
