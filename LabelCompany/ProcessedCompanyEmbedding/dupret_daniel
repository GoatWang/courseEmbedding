invention relates to a method of obtaining in vitro recombinant polynucleotide sequences by oriented ligation the invention aims in particular at creating then selecting polynucleotide sequences able to offer one or several advantageous properties compared to corresponding properties of reference sequences and thus able to provide an improved phenotype andor to produce improved proteins  reference sequence is understood as a sequence having properties close to those being sought  in vitro is understood as any event reaction or process that does not take place in a living organism  ligation is understood as a process that allows the creation of a phosphodiester bond between two nucleic acid fragments  oriented ligation is understood as any process of ligation that makes it possible to assemble nucleic acid molecules in a set order notably by hybridization of said nucleic acid molecules on at least one nucleotide matrix  polynucleotide sequence is understood as any single or doublestranded nucleic acid molecule  various techniques have been developed to promote in vitro recombination among different polynucleotide sequences among them can be cited in particular dna shuffling and step both based on the use of pcr  dna shuffling comprises two steps the random fragmentation of polynucleotide sequences by dnaase i and amplification by pcr in which the previously created fragments act as initiators at each hybridization step the change of matrix causes recombinations at regions having homologous sequences step consists in mixing various polynucleotide sequences containing various mutations in the presence of a pair of initiators this mixture is subjected to a pcr reaction in which the hybridization and polymerization steps are consolidated into a single very brief step these conditions make it possible to hybridize the initiators but reduce the polymerization speed so that the fragments that are partially synthesized hybridize randomly on the polynucleotide sequences carrying the various mutations thus making the recombination possible in each of these two methods the polymerization step is indispensable to the recombination process thus depending on the polymerases selected this polymerization step can produce undesired supplementary mutations further after a certain number of cycles dna shuffling and step are based on the principle of hybridization of a “megainitiator” on a matrix which probably causes difficulties in implementation for polynucleotide sequences whose size is greater than  kpb finally these two techniques do not allow the rate of recombinations to be controlled since the latter occur randomly during the successive stages of polymerization  this invention aims specifically at reducing the above drawbacks by offering a simple preparation method for at least one recombinant polynucleotide sequence by using a process of oriented ligation of fragments obtained from a bank of polynucleotide sequences  bank of polynucleotide sequences is understood as a group of polynucleotide sequences containing at least two heterologous polynucleotide sequences  in one embodiment of the invention this object is achieved thanks to a process comprising the following steps  a fragmentation of a bank of polynucleotide sequences  b denaturation of the fragments thus obtained  c hybridization of fragments obtained in step b with one or several assembly matrix matrices  d oriented ligation of said fragments to obtain at least one recombinant polynucleotide sequence  when the assembly matrix is doublestranded it is first denatured before step c such as for example during step b  the process of the invention makes it possible randomly to recombine various fragments within a polynucleotide sequence during steps b c and d this process thus reproduces in vitro the recombination phenomena that can occur in vivo by promoting them the process of the invention is thus most particularly useful for recombining polynucleotide sequences among themselves to be able to create new polynucleotide sequences  these recombinant polynucleotide sequences are able to offer advantageous properties compared to corresponding properties of references sequences and are thus able to provide an improved phenotype andor to produce improved proteins  this object is achieved thanks to a process comprising the following steps  a fragmentation of a bank of polynucleotide sequences  b denaturation of the fragments  c hybridization of fragments obtained in step b with one or several assembly matrix matrices  d oriented ligation of said fragments to obtain at least one recombinant polynucleotide sequence  e selection of recombinant polynucleotide sequences offering advantageous properties compared to corresponding properties of one or several references sequences  the assembly matrix matrices can be single or doublestranded if one of these matrices is doublestranded it is first denatured to be added in a singlestranded form to step c for example during step b  the process of the invention can comprise at the end of step e the repetition of steps a b c and d in this case the bank of polynucleotide sequences contains at least one recombinant polynucleotide sequence that was selected in e  the process of the invention can also comprise at the end of step d and before step e the repetition of steps b c and d or of steps a b c and d  this last embodiment is particularly useful if at the end of step e all the fragments are not ligated in that case the process of the invention also comprises at the end of step d and before step e one or several of the following reaction cycles  denaturation of ligated and nonligated fragments from step d optionally in the presence of one or several assembly matrix matrices  hybridization of said fragments with one or several assembly matrix matrices if the latter is are not present during the denaturation  ligation of said fragments  these reactions of denaturation hybridization and ligation are equivalent to steps b c and d but are performed not with fragments of step a but with ligated and nonligated fragments from step d  according to a particular embodiment of the process the polynucleotide sequences of the bank are singlestranded the use of singlestranded dna fragments is particularly adapted to the recombination of gene families for which a given singlestranded matrix or a mix of various singlestranded matrices will be hybridized with singlestranded fragments coming from a bank of homologous genes since there are no strictly complementary sequences among them in the fragment population the hybridization will not be biased toward wild sequences among the fragments or among matrix fragments the hybridization temperature can thus be adjusted depending on how homologous the sequences are thus producing recombinant molecules with the greatest possible degree of recombination banks of recombinant molecules are thus created with higher value in terms of diversity considerably increasing the chances of finding the good mutant at the end of the minimum recombination cycles  to obtain singlestranded dna molecules a bluescript phagemide or a vector of the family of filamentous phages such as mmp can be used another method consists in creating doublestranded molecules by pcr by using an initiator phosphorylated at ′ and the other nonphosphorylated the digestion of the lambda phage by the exonuclease will destroy the strands of dna phosphorylated at  leaving the nonphosphorylated strands intact another method of creating singlestranded molecules consists in making an amplification by asymmetric pcr starting from a methylated dna matrix  digestion by dpn i will destroy the methylated strands leaving intact the amplification products that will then be able to be purified after denaturation  the process of the invention can further comprise one or several of the following steps  separation of recombinant polynucleotide sequences from the assembly matrix matrices before step e  amplification of recombinant polynucleotide sequences before step e  cloning of recombinant polynucleotide sequences optionally after separation of the recombinant strands from the matrix matrices  in one advantageous embodiment of the method the ends of the fragments created at step a are such that there can be adjacent hybridization of these ends at least with one assembly matrix in step c and ligation of these fragments with one another at step d the polynucleotide sequences of the bank on which the process of the invention is performed must be such that the fragments obtained during the process have ends like those described above these fragments can be obtained notably during step a or during step d by ligation of the fragments  on advantageous embodiment of the process of the invention consists in simultaneously performing steps c and d as a socalled rlr reaction in the english expression “recombining ligation reaction” besides the previously indicated advantages the process of the invention is remarkable in that it promotes and accelerates the random in vitro recombination of polynucleotide sequences these polynucleotide sequences being able to be genes gene is understood to be a fragment or a dna sequence associated with a biological function a gene can be obtained in different ways among them chemical synthesis synthesis by polymerization or extraction of said gene from a nucleic acid source  the in vitro recombination of polynucleotide sequences from the initial bank by the process of the invention thus makes it possible to obtain a new bank containing sequences having acquired one or several characteristics of the sequences of the preceding bank the process of the invention thus constitutes a technique for in vitro evolution  the process of the invention constitutes an alternative to recombinant pcr such as the use of the techniques of dna shuffling or step since it does not require the in vitro polymerization step to achieve recombination on the contrary the key step in the process of the invention is step d of ligation on an assembly matrix or oriented ligation which guarantees a very high degree of fidelity during the recombination events  the process of the invention is remarkable in that it makes it possible considerably to increase the efficiency of reassembling the fragments to be ligated by using oriented ligation in fact in the case of a sequence cut into n fragments there are very numerous possibilities of reassociation of the fragments using a conventional ligation process without using a reassembly matrix that orients the ligation among which only one form is useful in the process according to the invention the ligation is oriented by the assembly matrix which makes it possible to obtain the only useful form directly  the fragmentation of these polynucleotide sequences in step a can be performed in a controlled manner or in a random manner  if fragmentation is performed in a controlled manner the fragmentation makes it possible precisely to control the degree of recombination desired and the position of the recombination points according to a preferred embodiment of the process of the invention step a consists in subjecting the polynucleotide sequences of the bank to hydrolysis by the action of one or several restriction enzymes thus in a particular embodiment of the process of the invention the degree of recombination and the position of the recombination points of the recombinant polynucleotide sequences are determined by the fragmentation of step a  thus the greater the number of fragments produced per sequence the greater the number of fragments necessary to recompose a sequence which causes an increased rate of recombination further the nature and the position of the ends of the fragments produced in the embodiment of the process of the invention can be known and controlled which makes it possible to  precisely control the zones in which the recombination takes place or  to induce recombination among polynucleotide sequences for example genes if the ends of the fragments are created in zones that are homologous among these sequences or in homologous zones between these sequences and the assembly matrices  if the fragmentation is random any enzymatic or mechanical means known to one skilled in the art and able randomly to cut the dna can be used such as for example digestion by dnaase i or ultrasonication  the process of the invention makes it possible considerably to increase the efficiency of reassembling the fragments to be ligated it can thus be applied to the orientation of multimolecular ligation for flush ends in this application single or doublestranded oligonucleotides that are exactly complementary to end ′ of a fragment and ′ of the adjacent fragment are used as the assembly matrix for steps b or c which makes possible the adjacent hybridization of these two ends on the same matrix after the denaturation step once hybridized the ends of the fragments can be ligated among themselves so as to orient the ligation direction of the fragments at flush ends the same approach can be envisaged for the orientation of the ligation of fragments at cohesive ends  a rather preferred embodiment of the process of the invention consists in adding enzymes to step c andor to step d that are able to recognize and degrade andor cut in a specific way the nonhybridized ends of fragments when the latter cover other hybridized fragments on the same matrix a preferred example of this type of enzyme is the enzyme flap endonuclease  a particular embodiment of the process of the invention thus consists in using enzymes of the flap endonuclease type when the fragments produced in step a can be covered during hybridization on the assembly matrix at step c  thus during the hybridization of dna fragments on a matrix these enzymes are characterized by the ability to recognize and to cut in a specific way the nonhybridized ends of these fragments when the latter cover other hybridized fragments on the same matrix  when the fragments used during the process of the invention are doublestranded a particular embodiment of the invention consists in using specific singlestranded enzymes of the exonuclease type these enzymes will be characterized by being able to recognize and to degrade in a specific way the singlestranded nonhybridized ends of these fragments when the latter cover other hybridized fragments on the same matrix  during step c hybridization the use of this type of enzyme notably flap or a singlestranded specific exonuclease thus makes it possible to increase the number of adjacent ends able to be ligated in step d which is particularly significant if the fragments are obtained by random cutting because these fragments have zones where they cover one another when they are hybridized on the assembly matrix  in a particular embodiment of the process of the invention using an active preferably thermostable ligase at high temperature at step d the enzymes able to recognize andor to cut in a specific way the nonhybridized ends of the fragments added at step c andor at step d will have the same characteristics of thermoresistance and hightemperature activity as said ligase  the bank of polynucleotide sequences on which the process of the invention is performed can be produced by any method known to one skilled in the art for example starting from a wildtype gene by successively managed stages of mutagenesis by “error prone” pcr  by random chemical mutagenesis by random mutagenesis in vivo or by combining genes of close or distinct families within the same species or different species so as to make available in said bank a variety of polynucleotide sequences  among these techniques the invention envisions most particularly a process in which the bank of polynucleotide sequences is obtained by a chain polymerization reaction performed under conditions that make it possible to create random localized mutations  the initial bank of polynucleotide sequences can consist of synthetic sequences that will be fragmented at step a or that can constitute the fragments of step a  according to a preferred embodiment of the process of the invention step a consists in subjecting the polynucleotide sequences of the bank to hydrolysis by the action of one or several restriction enzymes  to increase the degree of recombination produced by the process of the invention it suffices to increase the number of restriction fragments by using restriction enzymes having a large number of cutting sites on the polynucleotide sequences of the bank or by combining several restriction enzymes if a thermostable and thermoactive ligase is used the size of the smallest fragment thus produced will advantageously be greater than or equal to  b or  pb so as to maintain a hybridization temperature compatible with that of ligation step d which is generally on the order of ° c  step a can further be done by producing a fragment bank by random enzymatic or mechanical treatment in particular step a can consist of a random treatment with dnaase i of a bank of polynucleotide sequences if random enzymatic or mechanical fragmentation is used at step a this embodiment of the process of the invention is characterized in that it makes it possible to use fragments produced by this treatment as matrices for one another for hybridization during step c or during the rlr reaction of steps c and d simultaneously  step b can be performed by combining at least two banks of distinct fragments produced separately in step a starting from the same initial bank by different treatments such as eg with different restriction enzymes if such banks are used the fragments obtained at step a are used as matrices for one another for hybridization during step c or during the rlr reaction of steps c and d simultaneously  the fragments of step a of the process of the invention can also be produced by amplification reactions such as pcr performed on the polynucleotide sequences of the bank two solutions in particular can be envisaged in a first case the initiated oligonucleotides can be designed so as to produce fragments whose ends are adjacent all along the assembly sequence in a second case the initiated oligonucleotides are designed so as to produce fragments having sequences in common these fragments being able to act as an assembly matrix for one another at step b or at step c  the recombination efficiency of the process of the invention depends on the number of fragments produced per polynucleotide sequences at step a as a result the process of the invention will use polynucleotide sequences that have been fragmented into n fragments n advantageously being greater than or equal to   the assembly matrix of step b or c is for example a polynucleotide sequence produced from the initial bank or a sequence contained in said bank single or doublestranded if the assembly matrix matrices is are incorporated directly at step c of the invention this matrix must be in the singlestranded form  according to a variant of the process of the invention the assembly matrices of step b or c consist of single or doublestranded oligonucleotides  according to a particular form of the embodiment of the process of the invention single or doublestranded oligonucleotides of variable length are added at step b or c in addition to the matrix these oligonucleotides are designed to be able to substitute for some of the fragments at step c in fact their sequence is such that  if they are perfectly homologous with the sequence of the fragment they are replacing they promote certain combinations or  if they are partially heterologous with the sequence of the fragment they are replacing they introduce one or more supplementary direct mutations  heterologous sequences are understood as two sequences whose base composition differs by at least one base  before step e of the invention it is possible to separate the recombinant polynucleotide sequences from the assembly matrix thanks to a marker present on the assembly matrix or on the recombinant polynucleotide sequences it is in fact possible to mark each strand of the matrix according to techniques known to one skilled in the art for example the marker of the assembly matrix can be a hapten and the recombinant polynucleotide sequences are separated from the assembly matrix by techniques known to one skilled in the art such as for example an antihapten antibody fixed on a carrier or a biotinstreptavidin reaction if the hapten is a biotin marker  other techniques can be used to separate the recombinant polynucleotide sequences from the assembly matrix the assembly matrix can also be prepared specifically so as to facilitate its elimination at the end of the process of the invention it can thus be synthesized by pcr amplification using methylated datp which makes it possible to degrade it by the restriction endonuclease dpn i in this case the recombinant polynucleotide sequences must not contain methylated datp the matrix can also have been prepared by pcr amplification by using some dutp which makes it possible to degrade it by treatment with a uracildnaglycosylase conversely it is possible to protect the recombinant polynucleotide sequences by amplifying them by selective pcr with oligonucleotides carrying phosphorothioated groups at ′ a treatment with an exonuclease thus makes it possible specifically to degrade the assembly matrix  the process of the invention can comprise before the optional cloning at step e a step to amplify the recombinant polynucleotide sequences any amplification technique is acceptable notably pcr amplification one of the simplest consists in performing a pcr which makes it possible to amplify specifically the recombinant polynucleotide sequences thanks to initiators that cannot be hybridized except at the ends of recombined sequences the pcr products are then cloned to be characterized and the polynucleotide sequences with advantageous characteristics compared to corresponding characteristics of reference sequences are selected  the object of the invention is to produce polynucleotide sequences able to offer advantageous characteristics compared to corresponding characteristics of reference sequences the recombinant polynucleotide sequences obtained at step d and optionally cloned are screened by any appropriate means to select the recombinant polynucleotide sequences or clones having advantageous characteristics compared with corresponding characteristics of reference sequences advantageous characteristics for example are understood to be thermostability of an enzyme or its ability to be able to function under ph or temperature conditions or saline concentrations better adapted to an enzymatic process than the reference proteins usually used for said process by way of example of such a process an industrial process of desizing textile fibers or bleaching of paper pulps or the production of flavors in the dairy industry processes of biocatalysis to enzymatically synthesize new therapeutic molecules etc can be mentioned  according to an advantageous embodiment of the process of the invention the polynucleotide sequence bank can thus result from a screening having made it possible to select by any appropriate means the polynucleotide sequences offering advantageous characteristics compared to the reference sequences the sequences thus selected constitute a restricted bank  but it is also possible to start from a nonrestricted bank so as to maintain the representative nature of the characteristics the bank contains  the sequences coding for the proteins having one or more advantageous characteristics compared to reference proteins are thus selected by in vivo or in vitro screens and can be used to form a new bank for an optional repeat of the process of the invention an advantageous embodiment of the process of the invention thus consists in using as a bank several polynucleotide sequences selected after a first running of the process of the invention optionally mixed with other polynucleotide sequences among the screening techniques that can be applied to each clone of step e screening techniques by in vitro expression using notably in vitro transcription of recombinant polynucleotide sequences then in vitro translation of the mrnas obtained offer the advantage of eliminating cellular physiological problems and all the drawbacks connected with in vivo expression cloning further this type of screening is easily automated which makes it possible to screen a high number of recombinant polynucleotide sequences  the invention also relates to a recombinant polynucleotide sequence obtained by a process according to the invention as well as a vector containing such a recombinant polynucleotide sequence a cellular host transformed by a recombinant polynucleotide sequence or a vector of the invention as well as a protein coded by this recombinant polynucleotide sequence the invention also comprises the corresponding banks of recombinant polynucleotide sequences vectors cellular hosts or proteinsexample  the object of this example is to produce recombinant polynucleotide sequences from the resistance gene to kanamycin by using oriented ligation of singlestranded fragments  first the resistance gene to kanamycin  kb of pacyc is cloned in the polylinker of m mp so that the singlestranded phagemide contains the noncoding strand of the gene  in parallel this gene is amplified by pcr mutagenesis error prone pcr with two initiators that are complementary to vector sequence m mp on each side of the gene sequence the initiator for the noncoding strand is phosphorylated while the initiator for the coding strand is not the product of the pcr mutagenesis is digested by the lambda exonuclease which produces a bank of coding strands for mutants of the resistance gene to kanamycin  this bank of singlestranded molecules is digested by a mixture of restriction enzymes notably hae iii hinf i and taq i  this bank of singlestranded fragments thus obtained is then hybridized with the singlestranded phagemide and ligated with a thermostable ligase this step is repeated several times until the small fragments can no longer be observed during deposition on an agarose gel while the band corresponding to the single strand of the complete gene of resistance to kanamycin becomes a major component of the “smear” of singlestranded molecules visible on the gel  the band corresponding to the size of the gene is then cut from the gel and purified it is then hybridized with two complementary oligonucleotides  mer of the m mp sequences on each side of the gene and this partial duplex is digested by eco ri and sph i then ligated in an m mp vector digested by the same enzymes  the cells transformed with the ligation product are screened for increased resistance to kanamycin  the cloning of singlestranded recombinant molecules can optionally be performed by pcr with two initiators of the complete gene and cloning of the doublestranded product of this amplification to avoid undesirable mutations this amplification will be performed with polymerase of the pfu type and with a limited number of cycles  the plasmids of the clones that are significantly more resistant to kanamycin than the initial stock are purified and used as matrices for pcr with the polymerase pfu under high fidelity conditions with the phosphorylatednonphosphorylated initiator couple as previously defined this produces the second generation of singlestranded fragments after a treatment with lambda exonuclease and fragmentation with restriction enzymes the enzymes used for this step can comprise a different mixture bst ni taq i and mnl i  the recombination and selection steps are repeated several times until a substantial increase in resistance to kanamycin is obtained   previous

application no  us application ser no  filed nov   pct application no pctfr filed dec   french patent application no fr filed dec   the us application filed by applicant on apr   and the pct application filed by applicant on apr   the foregoing applications are herein incorporated by reference in their entiretiesbackground of the invention  the present invention relates broadly to genetic recombination and to the field known variously as directed evolution molecular breeding or dna shuffling the invention aims particularly at generating novel sequences with improved characteristics compared to those of a reference sequence when performed outside a living organism the process comprises a technique for in vitro evolution the invention further relates to the sequences generated by the method libraries of such sequences hosts and vectors containing such sequences proteins translated therefrom to arrays that simulate the method of the invention and to arrays in which the method can be performed the invention further relates to intermediate products of the method to reaction mixtures of certain types of polynucleotide fragments and assembly templates and to compositions of certain assembly templates and recombinant polynucleotides produced therewith  various techniques are known to facilitate in vitro recombination of polynucleotide sequences the most wellknown conventional techniques are dna shuffling with sexual pcr multiple cycles with no added primer and staggered extension step which both rely on polymerization  typically in dna shuffling with sexual pcr dnase i randomly cuts polynucleotide sequences to form oligonucleotide fragments the fragments initiate polymerization or pcr extension and the recombined polynucleotides are amplified at each hybridization step crossovers occur at homologous regions among the sequences “strand switching” a schematic representation of this method appears in fig a  step consists of mixing various polynucleotide sequences containing various mutations in the presence of a pair of initiators hybridization of the initiators and polymerization is consolidated into a single very brief step these conditions make it possible to hybridize the initiators but also slow the polymerization so that the initiators have time to synthesize only fragments which after denaturation rehybridize randomly to the various polynucleotide sequences a schematic representation of this method appears in fig b  relying heavily on polymerization has drawbacks such methods do not confer control over the rate or location of recombination which occurs randomly during the successive stages of polymerization depending on the conditions and polymerase used the polymerization can also produce either undesired supplemental mutations or insufficient numbers of mutations the latter occurs when long gaps are filled with residues that are fully complementary to the opposite strand further after enough cycles the fragments grow very long and become what are known as “megainitiators”  megainitiators can cause various problems particularly when the starting polynucleotides exceed about  kb advantages of the invention  the invention need not rely on polymerization size fractionation isolation of fragments by size or amplification of the polynucleotides or fragments further applicant believes though not wishing except where stated otherwise to be limited thereto in any way that the invention and embodiments confer broad advantages  first the invention provides some control over the locations of recombination hybridization on a template especially without polymerization enables precise control of the locations where recombination occurs for example if a target protein contains an active site that one desires to leave unchanged the invention is capable of limiting recombination to regions other than the active site furthermore the invention can achieve high recombination between closely neighboring sequence segments rather than treating closelying sequences as “linked” and moving them in chunks the invention can separate the closelying sequences therefore in a sense the invention also achieves high resolution fidelity and quality of genetic diversity indeed the embodiment of the invention that employs nonrandom fragmenting can use fragments as short as about  residues  the invention may also generate more recombination and incorporation of fragments per reaction cycle particularly in embodiments other than ligationonly embodiments defined below in other words it achieves a high quantity of genetic diversity high quantity is achieved directly by stimulating more total recombination events it is achieved indirectly by increasing overall efficiency overall efficiency is increased by using inter alia oriented ligation without oriented ligation a sequence cut into “n” fragments will reassociate into an enormous variety of possible forms even if only one or a few forms are useful the present invention on the other hand facilitates direct achievement of the desired form indeed in some embodiments of the invention it is possible to obtain a recombinant polynucleotide after only a single reaction cycle  typically the invention further increases efficiency by generating relatively few unshuffled parental clones and duplicate chimeras avoiding these unwanted byproducts provides room for more novel chimeras the conventional methods may produce screening libraries that consist of  to  parental dna in all methods of directed evolution molecular breeding or gene shuffling a screening library of recombinant dna molecules is produced and these molecules are expressed and screened screening is the most expensive and timeconsuming part of the process since the libraries may contain  to several million recombinant molecules eliminating parental dna from the screening libraries mitigates this problem the elimination of parental dna is enhanced when the template is transient as in more preferred embodiments of the invention because the final population is composed of only the new variant polynucleotides  preferred embodiments of the method particularly those that employ solitarystranded or nonidentical templates or fragments also facilitate lowhomology shuffling eg of distantlyrelated members of gene families the terms “solitarystranded” and “nonidentical” are used herein to describe a population of particular singlestranded sequences that do not complement each other because they are all from the same strand either the sense or antisense strand of one polynucleotide or multiple homologous polynucleotides since onidentical fragments for example are not complementary or at least not strictly complementary to another fragment in the reaction mixture hybridization is not biased toward the “wild type” sequences that would be formed by complementary fragments hybridization temperatures can be adjusted to the degree of homology among the sequences thereby maximizing diversity and greatly increasing the chances of finding the right mutant in the shortest number of recombination cycles note that the invention may still comprise achieving a desired bias eg by using higher amounts of one parental polynucleotide  in addition the invention demands little preparation of the starting dna library the invention allows immediate use of complex or genomic dna which may include introns some other methods require timeconsuming isolation of mrna and recreation of the cdna sequence in order to generate fragments for shuffling or reassembly  additional advantages of the invention or its embodiments are further described herein summary of the invention  although the present invention relates broadly to genetic recombination “recombination” is somewhat of a misnomer with regard to the invention insofar as the term implies that two strands disassociate and then recombine with each other to form a recombinant sequence in other words the invention does not rely on strand switching or crossovers nevertheless “recombination” and related terms are retained herein subject to this caveat  in one embodiment the invention includes a templatemediated method for shuffling polynucleotides comprising hybridizing fragments of at least two homologous polynucleotides to one or more assembly templates to form at least one recombinant polynucleotide wherein the fragments are shorter than all or substantially all of the assembly templates  in a preferred embodiment the assembly template is not fragmented in a more preferred embodiment no polymerization or extension is used to create a sequence complementary to the template or to fill in long gaps similarly in a preferred embodiment the fragments are noninitiating fragments that do not act as extension primers in yet another preferred embodiment the formation of the recombinant polynucleotide entails i ligating nicks and ii where necessary any one of or any combination of the following gap filling techniques  filling in gaps by further hybridizing said fragments to said templates to increase the number of fragments that are adjacently hybridized  filling in short gaps by trimming any overhanging flaps of any partially hybridized fragments and  filling in short gaps via polymerization  in a yet a more preferred embodiment no polymerization is used except to optionally amplify the final recombinant polynucleotides in a still more preferred embodiment no polymerization is used at all most preferably the method uses only a ligase andor flap endonuclease to form the hybridized fragments into a recombinant polynucleotide  preferably any of the steps or substeps may be repeated as necessary in another embodiment the method of the invention generates a recombinant polynucleotide after only one round cycle or single operation of each step of the invention in a preferred embodiment the method further comprises step d selecting at least one of said recombinant polynucleotides that has a desired property more preferably the steps occur in vitro outside a living organism in some preferred embodiments the method employs inter alia nonrandom fragmentation transient templates and nonidentical templates or fragments in a more preferred embodiment the assembly template is devised  in an alternative embodiment at least two of the fragments adjacently hybridize to the template more preferably all of the fragments adjacently hybridize  in another alternative embodiment the invention comprises a templatemediated method for nonrandom lowhomology shuffling of gene families in vitro whether homology is considered low differs in different contexts but homology that ranges below  eg  or  would typically be considered low in another alternative embodiment the parental polynucleotides vary in length by more than two residues  in yet another alternative embodiment the invention comprises a templatemediated method for in vitro nonrandom shuffling of mutationcontaining zones of polynucleotide alleles this embodiment further comprises locating restriction sites for mutationcontaining zones among the alleles and obtaining fragments corresponding to those restriction sites  the invention further includes sequences created by the method libraries of same hosts and vectors containing same and proteins translated therefrom it also includes a logical array such as a computer algorithm that simulates the inventive method or a physical array such as a biochip in which the inventive method may be performed the invention further relates to intermediate products of the method to reaction mixtures of polynucleotide fragments and assembly templates that can be used to carry out some or all

donor fragments preferably do not initiate polymerase extension ie they are not primers  “nonrandom” and “controlled” as used herein refer broadly to the control or predictability eg over the rate or location of recombination achieved via the template andor ligationorientation of the invention nonrandom and controlled may also refer more specifically to techniques of fragmenting polynucleotides that enable some control or predictability over the size or sequence of the resulting fragments for example using restriction enzymes to cut the polynucleotides provides some control over the characteristics of the fragments note that the invention may still be considered nonrandom when it employs random fragmentation typically by dnase i digestion in such cases the assembly template and other features of the invention still provide a degree of control in preferred embodiments however the fragmentation is nonrandom or controlled  “assembly template” and “template” refer to a polynucleotide used as a scaffold or matrix upon which fragments may anneal or hybridize to form a partially or fully doublestranded polynucleotide the templates of the invention are to be distinguished from various sequences in the art that have been referred to as “templates” for example the templates of the present invention do not include overlapping donor fragments that facilitate the extension of complementary donor fragments hybridized thereto as such the template is distinct from the donor fragments at some point in the process the templates of the present invention also do not include those sequences used in processes that rely heavily on polymerase extension to generate all or most of the opposing strand in other words the invention relies on hybridization of donor fragments to form the brunt of the recombinant strand preferably the template strand of the recombinant polynucleotide formed by the process although it may itself be recombinant does not undergo recombination during the process in other words preferably no donor fragments are incorporated into the template strand during a cycle of the process the template may be synthetic result from shuffling or other artificial processes or it may exist in nature “transient template” refers to a template that is not itself incorporated into the final recombinant polynucleotides this transience is caused by separation or disintegration of the template strand of the nonfinal recombinant polynucleotide generated during the method the template may derive from the reference sequence the initial library the screening library or elsewhere although the template may comprise or derive from a parental polynucleotide of the initial library in a preferred embodiment the template is “devised” and a polynucleotide does not qualify as a devised template if it enters the shuffling process accidentally eg by somehow slipping into the hybridization step without being fragmented in other words a devised template is not entirely random or accidental rather at least to some extent a devised template is directly or indirectly obtained for use as a template by a human being or a computer operated thereby via purposeful planning conception formulation creation derivation andor selection of either a specific desired polynucleotide sequences or a sequences from a sources that is likely to contain a desired sequences finally note that the word “template” is unnecessary a polynucleotide often a singlestranded polynucleotide that acts like the template of the invention is indeed the template of the invention whether or not it is referred to as a template “matrix” or “scaffold” are also synonyms of template similarly embodiments of the method are “templatemediated” whether or not they are expressly described as such for example the “ligationoriented” and “exonucleasemediated” embodiments of the invention use the template of the invention “solitarystranded” or “nonidentical” is used to describe a population of singlestranded sequences that do not complement each other because they are all from the same strand either sense or antisense of one polynucleotide or multiple homologous polynucleotides in other words sequences from the opposing complementary strands are absent so the population contains no sequences that are complementary to each other for example the population of nonidentical fragments may consist of fragments of the top strands of the parental polynucleotides whereas the population of nonidentical templates may consist of bottom strands of one or more of the parental polynucleotides  “ligation” refers to creation of a phosphodiester bond between two residues  “nick” refers to the absence of a phosphodiester bond between two residues that are hybridized to the same strand of a polynucleotide nick includes the absence of phosphodiester bonds caused by dnases or other enzymes as well as the absences of bonds between adjacently hybridized fragments that have simply not been ligated as used herein nick does not encompass residue gaps  “gap” and “residue gap” as used herein refer to the absence of one or more residues on a strand of a partially doublestranded polynucleotide in some embodiments of the invention short gaps less than approximately  residues are filled in by polymerases andor flap trimming long gaps are conventionally filled in by polymerases  “hybridization” has its common meaning except that it may encompass any necessary cycles of denaturing and rehybridization  “adjacent fragments” refer to hybridized fragments whose ends are flush against each other and separated only by nicks not by gaps  “ligationonly” refers to embodiments of the invention that do not utilize or require any gap filling polymerase extension or flap trimming in ligationonly embodiments all of the fragments hybridize adjacently note that embodiments that are not ligationonly embodiments still use ligation  as used herein “ligationoriented” “oriented ligation” and “ligationcompatible” generally represent or refer to a templatemediated process that enables ligation of fragments or residues in a relatively set or relatively predictable order in “ligationonly” embodiments the method employs no gap filling techniques and instead relies on ligation of adjacent fragments often achieved after multiple hybridization events  as used herein “exonucleasemediated” generally refers to a templatemediated process that employs flap trimming to enable ligation of fragments or residues in a relatively set or relatively predictable orderbrief

using increased quantities of fragmentsdetailed description of preferred embodiments of the invention  one embodiment of the invention comprises a templatemediated method for shuffling polynucleotides comprising hybridizing fragments of at least two homologous polynucleotides to one or more assembly templates to form at least one recombinant polynucleotide wherein the fragments are shorter than all or substantially all of the assembly templates  preferably once the partially doublestranded polynucleotides become adequately doublestranded they are selected for advantageous properties compared to those of one or several reference sequences advantageous characteristics may include for example thermostability of an enzyme or its activity under certain ph or salinity conditions among many other possible uses such enzymes may be used for desizing textile fibers bleaching paper pulps producing flavors in dairy products or biocatalyzing synthesis of new therapeutic molecules  the process may also comprise disintegrating the template strand or separating it from the recombinant strand before or after the selection it may further comprise amplifying the recombinant sequences before selection or cloning of recombinant polynucleotide sequences after separation of the recombinant strand from the template any amplification technique is acceptable due to initiators that can hybridize only to the ends of recombinant sequences pcr enables selective amplification of the recombinant sequences however unlike shuffling with sexual pcr the invention does not require amplification during the recombination reactions  a preferred screening technique entails in vitro expression via in vitro transcription of recombinant polynucleotides followed by in vitro translation of the mrnas this technique eliminates cellular physiological problems and the drawbacks connected with in vivo expression cloning further this technique is easily automated which enables screening of a high number of recombinant sequences  although embodiments of the invention may not in fact need to cycle through any steps more than once “noniterative” the invention also encompasses repetition of any of its steps or substeps for instance the process may or may not entail multiple hybridization events the hybridization may encompass any necessary cycles of denaturing and rehybridizing if necessary repeated hybridization may be performed in part or in whole on ligated andor nonligated fragments produced during the process rather than only on the initial donor fragments produced the ligationonly embodiments typically require multiple iterations in addition to encompassing repetition of steps the invention includes embodiments that allow simultaneous operation of those steps that are known in the art as capable of simultaneous operation  in a preferred embodiment the initial library is itself produced by the present invention either in vivo or in vitro screens can be used to form this library for repeating the process of the invention the recombinant sequences selected after a first running of the process can be optionally mixed with other sequences  the initial library can also be produced by any method known to one skilled in the art for example by starting from a wildtype gene by successive managed stages of mutagenesis by “errorprone” pcr  by random chemical mutagenesis by random mutagenesis in vivo or by combining genes of close or relatively distant families within the same or different species preferably the initial library results from chain polymerization reactions under conditions that create random localized mutations the invention may also comprise synthetic sequences assembly templates  the assembly template is for example a polynucleotide from the initial library or a polynucleotide produced therefrom the template may be synthetic result from shuffling or other artificial processes or it may exist in nature the template can be single or doublestranded if doublestranded it must be denatured before actual hybridization can occur  preferred embodiments use a nonidentical template more preferred embodiments use as a nonidentical template the bottomstrand from one parent polynucleotide and use as fragments topstrand fragments from other homologous parents this prevents reannealing of sequences to their own complementary strands to obtain nonidentical dna molecules a bluescript phagemide or a vector of the family of filamentous phages such as mmp can be used another method consists in creating doublestranded molecules by pcr by using an initiator phosphorylated at ′ and the other nonphosphorylated the digestion of the lambda phage by the exonuclease will destroy the strands of dna phosphorylated at  leaving the nonphosphorylated strands intact another method of creating nonidentical molecules consists in making an amplification by asymmetric pcr starting from a methylated dna template digestion by dpn i will destroy the methylated strands leaving intact the amplification products that will then be able to be purified after denaturation  preferred embodiments also use transient templates that are not incorporated within the final recombined polynucleotide eg not part of the polynucleotide that is transferred to the screening library one technique of conferring transience employs markers on either the recombinant strand or the template for example the template may be marked by a hapten and separated by for example fixing an antihapten antibody on a carrier or by initiating a biotinstreptavidin reaction another technique comprises synthesizing a transient template by pcr amplification using methylated datp which enables degradation of the template by restriction endonuclease dpn i in this case the recombinant strand must not contain methylated datp a transient template can also by prepared by pcr amplification with dutp which enables degradation with uracildnaglycosylase conversely it is possible to protect the recombinant strand by amplifying it with selective pcr with oligonucleotides carrying phosphorothioated groups at ′ a treatment with an exonuclease thus enables exclusive degradation of the template in most preferred embodiments transience is conferred by using a uracilcontaining template such as mrna mrna has a higher affinity of binding and can be removed by mrnaspecific enzymes such an mrna template can be prepared in vivo or in vitro in more preferred embodiments use of an mrna template entails including in the process at least three primers linked with a ligase  in yet another preferred embodiment the template enables orientation of multimolecular ligation of flush ends in this embodiment the template comprises a single or doublestranded polynucleotide that is exactly complementary to the ′ end of a first fragment and to the ′ end of a second fragment that is adjacent to the first fragment in the parental polynucleotide this facilitates adjacent hybridization of these two ends on the template  further embodiments include any or all of the following the template and donor fragments are from different sources the template is separately added to the reaction mixture andor the template is modified in specific ways to increase chimeragenesis donor fragments  fragments can be recruited from homologous polynucleotides related genes or from other genes the parental dna need not be characterized at all but can be extracted from cells clinical samples or the environment as used herein “hybridizing fragments” encompasses not only using prefragmented single or doublestranded fragments from an initial fragmentcontaining library but also the substep of fragmenting single or doublestranded parental polynucleotides from an initial library to obtain the fragments which are then hybridized he fragments may comprise fragments produced by combining distinct libraries of fragments fragmenting parental polynucleotides from distinct starting libraries or fragmenting parental polynucleotides from the same library in different ways such as with different restriction enzymes furthermore the invention may comprise employing more fragments from one parental polynucleotide than another for example an experimenter using the process may bias the results by using more fragments of or parts of polynucleotide x than fragments of or parts of polynucleotide y  in one embodiment supplemental single or doublestranded fragments of variable length are added to the reaction mixture these supplemental fragments may substitute for some of the donor fragments particularly if their sequences are homologous to the donor fragments such supplemental fragments may for example introduce one or more direct mutations donor or supplemental fragments may also comprise synthetic fragments  fragmenting may occur before or after denaturing of the sequences that are fragmented fragmentation can be controlled or random if random any enzymatic or mechanical means known to those skilled in the art can be used to randomly cut the dna for example digestion by dnase i or ultrasonication if the fragmentation is controlled it facilitates management over the degree rate efficiency andor location of recombination a preferred embodiment comprises hydrolyzing the parental polynucleotides with restriction enzymes to create restriction donor fragments restriction enzymes provide control over the degree rate and efficiency of recombination by controlling the number of fragments produced per sequence for example the number may be increased by using restriction enzymes with many cutting sites or by using several different restriction enzymes the greater the number of fragments produced per sequence the greater the number n of fragments that must be recomposed to form a recombinant sequence preferably n is  or more  by controlling the nature and position of the fragment ends restriction enzymes further provide control over not only degree and rate but also the location where recombination occurs for example the fragmenting can be designed so that the cuts occur in zones of the parent sequences that are homologous to zones in a reference sequence or an assembly template  fragments are preferably about  residues in length when fragmentation is performed nonrandomly the fragments are advantageously at least  residues in length and more preferably about  residues in length the phrase “at least  residues” means between about  residues and the length of the longest polynucleotide used less one residue when fragmentation is performed randomly they are more preferably about  residues in length  preferably the ends of at least two of the fragments are capable of being adjacently hybridized and ligated in a preferred embodiment the invention employs flap trimming enzymes to make ligatable ends that would otherwise result in unproductive fragments these enzymes recognize and degrade or cut in a specific way the nonhybridized ends of fragments when they cover other hybridized fragments on the same template  a preferred enzyme is flap endonuclease when the fragments are initially doublestranded an embodiment of the invention comprises using specific exonucleases that recognize and degrade singlestranded sequences like the nonhybridized ends of the fragments such singlestrand exonucleases or flap endonucleases are preferably at a concentration eg about  μgml of flap endonuclease that avoids their more general exonuclease activity which could for example degrade the templates or recombinant sequences these enzymes increase the number of fragment ends that can be ligated which is particularly useful for randomly cut fragments because they tend to result in many overhanging flaps use of such enzymes with low hybridization temperatures andor high hybridization times eg two minutes also facilitates recombination between lowhomology polynucleotides for example a preferred embodiment that employs random fragmenting includes use of a flap endonuclease and a wide range of hybridization temperature eg from  to ° c that can be disconnected from ligation with regard to temperature particularly when the hybridization temperature is lower than the high ligation temperature eg about ° c most preferably the flap endonuclease concentration is about  μgml the hybridization temperature is about ° c and the ligation temperature is about ° c when such trimming enzymes are employed they are preferably thermoresistant thermostable and active at high temperatures like the ligase alternative embodiments and optional features of the invention  unlike conventional shuffling methods various embodiments of the invention do not require thermocycling eg the repeated heating and cooling necessary for sexual pcr in various embodiments the process may be used to create genelength polynucleotides or short polynucleotides in various embodiments hybridization may occur under conditions of low stringency in various embodiments the ratio between templates and chimeric polynucleotides produced is about  in various embodiments no dnases are employed in various embodiments the initial library comprises variants of a single gene in various embodiments the initial library may comprise polynucleotides having artificially induced point mutations in various embodiments the invention may be used for whole genome shuffling in various embodiments the steps may occur in vivo rather than in vitro further when amplifying fragments by pcr for example the initiated sequences can be designed to produce fragments whose ends are adjacent all along the assembly template  additional alternative embodiments of the

a desirable species that has a desirable property example i  the object of example i is to produce recombinant polynucleotides from the kanamycin resistance gene using nonidentical fragments  first the resistance gene  kb of pacyci is cloned in the polylinker of mmp so that the nonidentical phagemide contains the noncoding strand of the gene  in parallel this gene is amplified by pcr mutagenesis errorprone pcr with two initiators that are complementary to vector sequence mmp on each side of the gene sequence the initiator for the noncoding strand is phosphorylated while the initiator for the coding strand is not the product of the pcr mutagenesis is digested by the lambda exonuclease which produces a library of coding strands for mutants of the kanamycin resistance gene  this library of nonidentical sequences is digested by a mixture of restriction enzymes notably hae iii hinf i and taq i the resulting nonidentical fragments are then hybridized with the nonidentical phagemide and ligated with a thermostable ligase this step is repeated several times until the small fragments can no longer be observed during deposition on an agarose gel meanwhile the band corresponding to the nonidentical of the complete resistance gene becomes a major component of the “smear” visible on the gel  the band corresponding to the size of the gene is cut from the gel and purified it is then hybridized with two complementary oligonucleotides  mer of the mmp sequences on each side of the gene and this partial duplex is digested by eco ri and sph i then ligated in an m mp vector digested by the same enzymes  the cells transformed with the ligation product are screened for increased resistance to kanamycin  the cloning of nonidentical recombinant molecules can optionally be performed by pcr with two initiators of the complete gene and cloning of the doublestranded product of this amplification to avoid undesirable mutations this amplification should be performed with polymerase of the pfu type and with a limited number of cycles  the plasmids of the clones that are significantly more resistant to kanamycin than the initial stock are purified and used for pcr with the polymerase pfu under high fidelity conditions with the phosphorylatednonphosphorylated initiator couple as previously defined this produces the second generation of nonidentical fragments after a treatment with lambda exonuclease and fragmentation with restriction enzymes the enzymes used for this step can comprise a different mixture eg bst ni taq i and mnl i  the recombination and selection steps are repeated several times until a substantial increase in resistance to kanamycin is obtained example ii i summary  the starting library included  gene mutants of ponb coding for the pbpb of e coli  the sequence of each mutant differed from that of the native gene by a nonhomologous zone  bases in length resulting from the substitution of five initial codons by five alanine codons according to the technique described by lefèvre et al and incorporated herein   the substitution represented a unique site of the restriction enzyme pvu ii surrounded by two pst i enzyme sites which permitted the mutants to be distinguished from each other by their digestion profile fig  represents the positions of the ten zones of mutations pvu ii and pst i carried by each mutant  after pcr amplification of the mutants the pcr products were purified and mixed in equimolar quantity in order to form the library the polynucleotide sequences of this library were digested with the restriction enzymes hinf i and bsa i in such a way as to generate libraries of restriction fragments the restriction fragments were then incubated with various amounts of the wildtype template at different quantities in the presence of a thermostable ligase after several denaturationhybridizationligation cycles a fraction of the reaction mixture was used to carry out a pcr amplification with a couple of primers specific to the ′ and ′ ends of the mutant genes and nonspecific to the ′ and ′ ends of the wildtype template the amplification product was cloned and the clones were analyzed for their digestion profile with the pvu ii or pst i restriction endonucleases the obtained profiles indicated which fragments of the mutants were able to be recombined with the others to form an entire gene ii materials and methods

oligonucleotides introduce respectively the restriction sites nco i and eco ri permitting the cloning of the products obtained with these two sites  each pcr reaction was prepared by adding  ng of the plasmid carrying the mutant gene to a mixture containing  μl of polymerization buffer  μl of dntps  mm  pmol of each oligonucleotide n and e and u of taq dna polymerase in a final volume of  μl this

final volume of  μl  μl of that digestion reaction were loaded on a tbe  agarose gel after migration and staining with ethidium bromide the gel was exposed to ultraviolet the visualization of the restriction fragments permitted confirmation of the specificity of the genetic amplification of each mutant gene  in parallel  μl of each pcr reaction were loaded on a tbe  agarose gel  after

each of the ten pcr were mixed and loaded on a  tbe agarose gel after migration and staining with ethidium bromide the band at  bp corresponding to the amplification product of the genes of the ten mutants was cut out with a scalpel and purified with the quiaquick system qiagen allthe dna thus purified was eluted in  μl of buffer t the concentration of this dna was approximately  ngμl according

to the following program ° c  min−° c  sec−° c  sec−° c  min× cycles−° c  min this pcr reaction per specific amplification of the ligation products formed in the course of the rlr reaction without amplifying the template since the oligonucleotides a and a are not able to hybridize with the template it as shown in fig    μl of each rlr reaction and  μl of each of the previous pcr reactions were loaded on a  tbe agarose gel after staining with ethidium bromide the gel was exposed to ultraviolet light as shown in fig   the analysis of this gel reveals that only the reaction of rlr contains as the negative control restriction fragments still visible tracks  and   the absence of pcr product for the negative control track  reveals not only that the pcr reaction is specific no amplification of the complete template but also that the restriction fragments present in the mixture cannot be substituted for the primers to generate a contaminant pcr product under the chosen conditions in parallel the presence of a unique band at about  bp in tracks   and  demonstrates that an rlr product was able to be amplified by pcr for the rlr  and  reactions these three rlr reactions therefore permitted the regeneration of one or more of the complete genes starting from six libraries of restriction fragments vi analysis of the amplification products a cloning  the pcr amplification products of the

screening by pcr  a first screening of the clones obtained after transformation of the ligations with the vector paraponb was carried out by pcr  colonies  from each ligation lpar lpar and lpar were

of the restriction enzyme pvu ii in a final volume of  μl of each of these digestions were loaded on a tbe  agarose gel in parallel with    μl of each nondigested pcr thus avoiding possible confusion of nonspecific bands of the pcr with a fragment obtained by restriction digestion after migration and staining of this gel with ethidium bromide the bands resulting from the digestion by the enzyme pvu ii were analyzed in order to determine which fragments of initial mutants waswere associated with the others in order to reconstruct an entire gene this screening reveals the presence of  genes

and  genes no longer carrying a mutation d statistical analysis of the recombinations  in view of the position of each mutation with regard to the cutting sites of the enzymes hinf i and bsa i see fig  it is possible to calculate the probability of obtaining through rlr a gene carrying     or  of the mutations of the initial genes  assuming that the rlr reaction is totally random the probabilities

to these statistical predictions as reported in table vi below thus indicating that the rlr reaction is quasirandom a slightly higher proportion of genes carrying one mutation to the detriment of the genes carrying zero mutation is observed this phenomenon could be attributed to a weak toxicity of the ponb gene already observed and to the slight of expression leakage of vectors paraponb and petb
