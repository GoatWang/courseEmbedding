developed a more complete stock valuation model than standard industry models our investment strategy starts with recognition of the fact that as our economy has transitioned from the industrial era to the information era during the last  years the most valuable assets of many companies are no longer physical assets and therefore are not recorded on the balance sheet for example coke’s most valuable asset is its brand equity ebay’s is its firstmover advantage pfizer’s are its patents and rd etc traditional accounting standards do not capture the value inherent in these intangible assets which according to research studies now account for a significant portion of the value of us companies high pointe recognized these important shifts many years ago and developed a competitiveness index to measure and incorporate intangible assets into a disciplined stock selection process the investment process features a fivefactor models based on • competitiveness score • historical valuation • expected revenue growth • expected earnings growth • size the model identifies stocks that are highly undervalued given their quality and growth characteristics high pointe then conducts fundamental analysis on these stocks to create “best ideas” portfolios for each product diversified across a minimum of  industries   high pointe capital management llc all rights reserved use of this
