gadsby chapman by december  crockett was writing to friends about moving to texas if jacksons chosen successor martin van buren was elected president the next year he discussed with his friend benjamin mcculloch raising a company of volunteers to take to texas in the expectation that a revolution was imminent after the election results became known in august his departure to texas was delayed by a court appearance in the last week of october as coexecutor of his deceased fatherinlaws estate and he finally left his home near rutherford in west tennessee on nov   with three other men to explore texas his youngest child matilda later wrote that she distinctly remembered the last time she saw her father he was dressed in his hunting suit wearing a coonskin cap and carried a fine rifle presented to him by friends in philadelphia  he seemed very confident the morning he went away that he would soon have us all to join him in texas from his home crockett traveled to jackson arriving there with  wellarmed men where he gave a speech from the steps of the madison county courthouse and then rode southwest to bolivar where he spent the night at residence of dr calvin jones

continued his journey on horseback through arkansas on november   crockett and his entourage arrived in little rock arkansas the local newspapers reported that hundreds of people swarmed into town to

 crockett and about five other men rode into san antonio de bexar and camped just outside the town they were later greeted by james bowie and antonio menchaca and taken to the home of don erasmo seguincitation needed the fall of the alamo by robert jenkins onderdonk depicts davy crockett swinging his rifle at mexican troops who have breached the south gate of the mission crockett arrived at the alamo on february  on february  to the surprise of the men garrisoned in the alamo a mexican army led by general antonio lopez de santa anna arrived the mexican soldiers immediately initiated a siege santa anna ordered his artillery to keep up a nearconstant bombardment the guns were moved closer to the alamo each day increasing their effectiveness on february  – mexican soldiers crossed the san antonio river and took cover in abandoned shacks approximately  to  yards  to  m from the alamo wallsthe soldiers intended to use the huts as cover to establish another artillery position although many texians assumed that they actually were launching an assault on the fort several men volunteered to burn the huts to provide cover the alamo cannons fired grapeshot at the mexican soldiers and crockett and his men fired rifles while other defenders reloaded extra weapons for them to use in maintaining a steady fire within  minutes the battle was over and the mexican soldiers retreated inside the alamo the stores of powder and shot were limited on february  alamo commander william barret travis ordered the artillery to stop returning fire so as to conserve precious ammunition crockett and his men were encouraged to keep shooting as they were unusually effective a knife purportedly used by davy crockett during the battle of the alamo as the siege progressed travis sent many messages asking for reinforcements several messengers were sent to james fannin who commanded the only other official group of texian soldiers fannin and several hundred texians occupied presidio la bahia at goliad although fannin ultimately decided it was too risky to attempt to reinforce the alamo historian thomas ricks lindley concludes that up to  of fannins men left his command to go to bexar these men would have reached cibolo creek  miles  km from the alamo on the afternoon of march  there they joined another group of men who also planned to join the garrison that same night outside the alamo there was a skirmish between mexican and texian troops several historians including walter lord speculated that the texians were creating a diversion to allow their last courier john smith to evade mexican pickets however in  alamo survivor susannah dickinson said that travis sent three men out shortly after dark on march  probably a response to the arrival of mexican reinforcements the three men who included crockett were sent to find fannin lindley stated that just before midnight crockett and one of the other men found the force of texians waiting along cibolo creek who had advanced to within  miles  km of the alamo just before daylight on march  part of the texian force managed to break through the mexican lines and enter the alamo a second group was driven across the prairie by mexican cavalry the siege ended on march  when the mexican army attacked just before dawn while the defenders were sleeping the daily bombardment by artillery had been suspended perhaps a ploy to encourage the natural human reaction to a cessation of constant strain but the garrison awakened and the final fight began most of the noncombatants gathered in the church sacristy for safety according to dickinson before running to his post crockett paused briefly in the chapel to say a prayer when the mexican soldiers breached the north outer walls of the alamo complex most of the texians fell back to the barracks and the chapel as previously planned crockett and his men were too far from the barracks to take shelter and were the last remaining group in the mission to be in the open the men defended the low wall in front of the church using their rifles as clubs and relying on knives as the action was too furious to allow reloading after a volley and a charge with bayonets mexican soldiers pushed the few remaining defenders back toward the church the battle of the alamo lasted almost  minutes a coffin in the san fernando cathedral purports to hold the ashes of the alamo defenders however historians believe it more probable that the ashes were buried near the alamo once all of the defenders had been killed santa anna ordered his men to take the bodies to a nearby stand of trees where they were stacked together and wood piled on top that evening a fire was lit and the bodies of the defenders were burned to ashes the ashes were left undisturbed until february  when juan seguin and his cavalry returned to bexar to examine the remains a local carpenter created a simple coffin and ashes from the funeral pyres were placed inside the names of travis crockett and bowie were inscribed on the lid the coffin is thought to have been buried in a peach tree grove but the spot was not marked and can no longer be identified death the david crockett spring in crockett in houston county in east texas all that is certain about the fate of david crockett is that he died fighting at the alamo on the morning of march   at age  according to many accounts of the battle between five and seven texans surrendered during the battle possibly to general castrillon incensed that his orders to take no prisoners had been ignored santa anna demanded the immediate execution of the survivors although castrillon and several other officers refused to do so staff officers who had not participated in the fighting drew their swords and killed the unarmed texians controversy weeks after the battle stories began to circulate that crockett was among those who surrendered and were executed however ben a former american slave who acted as cook for one of santa annas officers maintained that crocketts body was found in the barracks surrounded by no less than sixteen mexican corpses with crocketts knife buried in one of them historians disagree on which story is accurate according to petite every account of the crockett surrenderexecution story comes from an avowed antagonist either on political or military grounds of santa annas it is believed that many stories such as the surrender and execution of crockett were created and spread in order to discredit santa anna and add to his role as villain in  jesús sánchez garza selfpublished a book called la rebelión de texas—manuscrito inédito de  por un ofical de santa anna purporting to be memoirs of josé enrique de la peña a mexican officer present at the battle of the alamo in  the texas am university press published an english translation of the book called with santa anna in texas a personal narrative of the revolution the english publication caused a scandal within the united states as it asserted that crockett did not die in battle historians disagree on whether any or all of the book has been falsified because the original book was selfpublished no editor or publisher ever vetted its authenticity sánchez garza never explained how he gained custody of the documents or where they were stored after de la peñas death some historians including bill groneman found it suspicious that sánchez garzas compilation was published in  at the height of interest in crockett and the alamo caused by walt disneys television miniseries about crocketts life davy crockett groneman also points out that the journals are made up of several different types of paper from several different paper manufacturers all cut down to fit historian joseph musso also questions the validity likewise basing his suspicions on the timing of the diaries releasecitation needed the documents most energetic defender has been historian james crisp who found an  pamphlet by de la peña in which the mexican said he was preparing his diary for publication  proof that if nothing else the sanchez garza text had a historical basis finally in  archivist david gracy published a detailed analysis of the manuscript including lab results he found among other things that the paper and ink were of a type used by the mexican army in the s and the handwriting matched that on other documents in the mexican military archives that were written or signed by de la peña furthermore catherine williamson manuscript cataloguer at butterfield  butterfield said de la peñas memoir was written on a high rag content paper typical of the early th century the watermarks tell us the paper was produced in lisbon between  and  if something had indicated to us the paper was made after that period or was from the th century and clearly a fake we would not be offering it for sale were satisfied that it is what it is butterfield officials believe the eyewitness journal could fetch between  and  in de la peñas narrative he adds a footnote which may align both versions he states that all of the enemy perished there remaining alive only an elderly lady and a negro slave whom the soldiers spared out of mercy and because we had established that only force had kept them in danger perry  this implies that the summary execution of the survivors may have occurred prior to the releasing of dickinson and joe so that they observed crockett as dead lending credence to their testimony de la peña describes the disposal of the dead and wounded as an ongoing process that took some timecitation needed first no other accounts of crocketts surviving the alamo have surfaced besides de la peñas diary no documentation in the archives of the mexican government nor any of the personal records of others present at the battle of the alamo give any hint of survivors amongst the defenders much less any claiming crockett as a survivor secondly there is some speculation that de la peñas account may have been a deliberate fabrication with the intention of presenting santa anna in a far more diabolical light than american and especially texan historians have given him since the fall of the alamocitation needed david crockett clipper ship card the written account by de la peña even if a legitimate writing has also been questioned in that many doubt his abilities to identify any of the alamo defenders by name it is a popular belief by many historians that de la peña may have witnessed or been told about executions of some alamo survivors but in fact neither he nor his comrades would have known who these men were part of the reason that de la peñas memoirs are questioned comes from his detailed account of col william travis death in with santa anna in texas in that account he describes with detail how travis was heroic in his final moments turning straight into the mexican soldiers and facing his death with honor the problem with this how would de la peña have been able to distinguish travis from any of the other defenders of the alamo the freed former slave to travis joe claimed travis died early on in the battle on the north wall in addition to this the mexican army had not breached the walls of the alamo when travis was killed therefore they would have been seeing him from an area below the walls while being fired down upon by the defenders to add to this travis was killed before daybreak meaning it was still dark therefore it is believed that de la peña either created the scenario of travis death or he saw another of the defenders after breaching the walls and took him to be travis legacy one of crocketts sayings which were published in almanacs between  and  along with those of daniel boone and kit carson was always be sure you are right then go ahead

and about five other men rode into san antonio de bexar and camped just outside the town they were later greeted by james bowie and antonio menchaca and taken to the home of don erasmo seguincitation needed the fall of the alamo by robert jenkins onderdonk depicts davy crockett swinging his rifle at mexican troops who have breached the south gate of the mission crockett arrived at the alamo on february  on february  to the surprise of the men garrisoned in the alamo a mexican army led by general antonio lopez de santa anna arrived the mexican soldiers immediately initiated a siege santa anna ordered his artillery to keep up a nearconstant bombardment the guns were moved closer to the alamo each day increasing their effectiveness on february  – mexican soldiers crossed the san antonio river and took cover in abandoned shacks approximately  to  yards  to  m from the alamo wallsthe soldiers intended to use the huts as cover to establish another artillery position although many texians assumed that they actually were launching an assault on the fort several men volunteered to burn the huts to provide cover the alamo cannons fired grapeshot at the mexican soldiers and crockett and his men fired rifles while other defenders reloaded extra weapons for them to use in maintaining a steady fire within  minutes the battle was over and the mexican soldiers retreated inside the alamo the stores of powder and shot were limited on february  alamo commander william barret travis ordered the artillery to stop returning fire so as to conserve precious ammunition crockett and his men were encouraged to keep shooting as they were unusually effective a knife purportedly used by davy crockett during the battle of the alamo as the siege progressed travis sent many messages asking for reinforcements several messengers were sent to james fannin who commanded the only other official group of texian soldiers fannin and several hundred texians occupied presidio la bahia at goliad although fannin ultimately decided it was too risky to attempt to reinforce the alamo historian thomas ricks lindley concludes that up to  of fannins men left his command to go to bexar these men would have reached cibolo creek  miles  km from the alamo on the afternoon of march  there they joined another group of men who also planned to join the garrison that same night outside the alamo there was a skirmish between mexican and texian troops several historians including walter lord speculated that the texians were creating a diversion to allow their last courier john smith to evade mexican pickets however in  alamo survivor susannah dickinson said that travis sent three men out shortly after dark on march  probably a response to the arrival of mexican reinforcements the three men who included crockett were sent to find fannin lindley stated that just before midnight crockett and one of the other men found the force of texians waiting along cibolo creek who had advanced to within  miles  km of the alamo just before daylight on march  part of the texian force managed to break through the mexican lines and enter the alamo a second group was driven across the prairie by mexican cavalry the siege ended on march  when the mexican army attacked just before dawn while the defenders were sleeping the daily bombardment by artillery had been suspended perhaps a ploy to encourage the natural human reaction to a cessation of constant strain but the garrison awakened and the final fight began most of the noncombatants gathered in the church sacristy for safety according to dickinson before running to his post crockett paused briefly in the chapel to say a prayer when the mexican soldiers breached the north outer walls of the alamo complex most of the texians fell back to the barracks and the chapel as previously planned crockett and his men were too far from the barracks to take shelter and were the last remaining group in the mission to be in the open the men defended the low wall in front of the church using their rifles as clubs and relying on knives as the action was too furious to allow reloading after a volley and a charge with bayonets mexican soldiers pushed the few remaining defenders back toward the church the battle of the alamo lasted almost  minutes a coffin in the san fernando cathedral purports to hold the ashes of the alamo defenders however historians believe it more probable that the ashes were buried near the alamo once all of the defenders had been killed santa anna ordered his men to take the bodies to a nearby stand of trees where they were stacked together and wood piled on top that evening a fire was lit and the bodies of the defenders were burned to ashes the ashes were left undisturbed until february  when juan seguin and his cavalry returned to bexar to examine the remains a local carpenter created a simple coffin and ashes from the funeral pyres were placed inside the names of travis crockett and bowie were inscribed on the lid the coffin is thought to have been buried in a peach tree grove but the spot was not marked and can no longer be identified death the david crockett spring in crockett in houston county in east texas all that is certain about the fate of david crockett is that he died fighting at the alamo on the morning of march   at age  according to many accounts of the battle between five and seven texans surrendered during the battle possibly to general castrillon incensed that his orders to take no prisoners had been ignored santa anna demanded the immediate execution of the survivors although castrillon and several other officers refused to do so staff officers who had not participated in the fighting drew their swords and killed the unarmed texians controversy weeks after the battle stories began to circulate that crockett was among those who surrendered and were executed however ben a former american slave who acted as cook for one of santa annas officers maintained that crocketts body was found in the barracks surrounded by no less than sixteen mexican corpses with crocketts knife buried in one of them historians disagree on which story is accurate according to petite every account of the crockett surrenderexecution story comes from an avowed antagonist either on political or military grounds of santa annas it is believed that many stories such as the surrender and execution of crockett were created and spread in order to discredit santa anna and add to his role as villain in  jesús sánchez garza selfpublished a book called la rebelión de texas—manuscrito inédito de  por un ofical de santa anna purporting to be memoirs of josé enrique de la peña a mexican officer present at the battle of the alamo in  the texas am university press published an english translation of the book called with santa anna in texas a personal narrative of the revolution the english publication caused a scandal within the united states as it asserted that crockett did not die in battle historians disagree on whether any or all of the book has been falsified because the original book was selfpublished no editor or publisher ever vetted its authenticity sánchez garza never explained how he gained custody of the documents or where they were stored after de la peñas death some historians including bill groneman found it suspicious that sánchez garzas compilation was published in  at the height of interest in crockett and the alamo caused by walt disneys television miniseries about crocketts life davy crockett groneman also points out that the journals are made up of several different types of paper from several different paper manufacturers all cut down to fit historian joseph musso also questions the validity likewise basing his suspicions on the timing of the diaries releasecitation needed the documents most energetic defender has been historian james crisp who found an  pamphlet by de la peña in which the mexican said he was preparing his diary for publication  proof that if nothing else the sanchez garza text had a historical basis finally in  archivist david gracy published a detailed analysis of the manuscript including lab results he found among other things that the paper and ink were of a type used by the mexican army in the s and the handwriting matched that on other documents in the mexican military archives that were written or signed by de la peña furthermore catherine williamson manuscript cataloguer at butterfield  butterfield said de la peñas memoir was written on a high rag content paper typical of the early th century the watermarks tell us the paper was produced in lisbon between  and  if something had indicated to us the paper was made after that period or was from the th century and clearly a fake we would not be offering it for sale were satisfied that it is what it is butterfield officials believe the eyewitness journal could fetch between  and  in de la peñas narrative he adds a footnote which may align both versions he states that all of the enemy perished there remaining alive only an elderly lady and a negro slave whom the soldiers spared out of mercy and because we had established that only force had kept them in danger perry  this implies that the summary execution of the survivors may have occurred prior to the releasing of dickinson and joe so that they observed crockett as dead lending credence to their testimony de la peña describes the disposal of the dead and wounded as an ongoing process that took some timecitation needed first no other accounts of crocketts surviving the alamo have surfaced besides de la peñas diary no documentation in the archives of the mexican government nor any of the personal records of others present at the battle of the alamo give any hint of survivors amongst the defenders much less any claiming crockett as a survivor secondly there is some speculation that de la peñas account may have been a deliberate fabrication with the intention of presenting santa anna in a far more diabolical light than american and especially texan historians have given him since the fall of the alamocitation needed david crockett clipper ship card the written account by de la peña even if a legitimate writing has also been questioned in that many doubt his abilities to identify any of the alamo defenders by name it is a popular belief by many historians that de la peña may have witnessed or been told about executions of some alamo survivors but in fact neither he nor his comrades would have known who these men were part of the reason that de la peñas memoirs are questioned comes from his detailed account of col william travis death in with santa anna in texas in that account he describes with detail how travis was heroic in his final moments turning straight into the mexican soldiers and facing his death with honor the problem with this how would de la peña have been able to distinguish travis from any of the other defenders of the alamo the freed former slave to travis joe claimed travis died early on in the battle on the north wall in addition to this the mexican army had not breached the walls of the alamo when travis was killed therefore they would have been seeing him from an area below the walls while being fired down upon by the defenders to add to this travis was killed before daybreak meaning it was still dark therefore it is believed that de la peña either created the scenario of travis death or he saw another of the defenders after breaching the walls and took him to be travis legacy one of crocketts sayings which were published in almanacs between  and  along with those of daniel boone and kit carson was always be sure you are right then go ahead

december  crockett was writing to friends about moving to texas if jacksons chosen successor martin van buren was elected president the next year he discussed with his friend benjamin mcculloch raising a company of volunteers to take to texas in the expectation that a revolution was imminent after the election results became known in august his departure to texas was delayed by a court appearance in the last week of october as coexecutor of his deceased fatherinlaws estate and he finally left his home near rutherford in west tennessee on nov   with three other men to explore texas his youngest child matilda later wrote that she distinctly remembered the last time she saw her father he was dressed in his hunting suit wearing a coonskin cap and carried a fine rifle presented to him by friends in philadelphia  he seemed very confident the morning he went away that he would soon have us all to join him in texas from his home crockett traveled to jackson arriving there with  wellarmed men where he gave a speech from the steps of the madison county courthouse and then rode southwest to bolivar where he spent the night at residence of dr calvin jones once again drawing

and about five other men rode into san antonio de bexar and camped just outside the town they were later greeted by james bowie and antonio menchaca and taken to the home of don erasmo seguincitation needed the fall of the alamo by robert jenkins onderdonk depicts davy crockett swinging his rifle at mexican troops who have breached the south gate of the mission crockett arrived at the alamo on february  on february  to the surprise of the men garrisoned in the alamo a mexican army led by general antonio lopez de santa anna arrived the mexican soldiers immediately initiated a siege santa anna ordered his artillery to keep up a nearconstant bombardment the guns were moved closer to the alamo each day increasing their effectiveness on february  – mexican soldiers crossed the san antonio river and took cover in abandoned shacks approximately  to  yards  to  m from the alamo wallsthe soldiers intended to use the huts as cover to establish another artillery position although many texians assumed that they actually were launching an assault on the fort several men volunteered to burn the huts to provide cover the alamo cannons fired grapeshot at the mexican soldiers and crockett and his men fired rifles while other defenders reloaded extra weapons for them to use in maintaining a steady fire within  minutes the battle was over and the mexican soldiers retreated inside the alamo the stores of powder and shot were limited on february  alamo commander william barret travis ordered the artillery to stop returning fire so as to conserve precious ammunition crockett and his men were encouraged to keep shooting as they were unusually effective a knife purportedly used by davy crockett during the battle of the alamo as the siege progressed travis sent many messages asking for reinforcements several messengers were sent to james fannin who commanded the only other official group of texian soldiers fannin and several hundred texians occupied presidio la bahia at goliad although fannin ultimately decided it was too risky to attempt to reinforce the alamo historian thomas ricks lindley concludes that up to  of fannins men left his command to go to bexar these men would have reached cibolo creek  miles  km from the alamo on the afternoon of march  there they joined another group of men who also planned to join the garrison that same night outside the alamo there was a skirmish between mexican and texian troops several historians including walter lord speculated that the texians were creating a diversion to allow their last courier john smith to evade mexican pickets however in  alamo survivor susannah dickinson said that travis sent three men out shortly after dark on march  probably a response to the arrival of mexican reinforcements the three men who included crockett were sent to find fannin lindley stated that just before midnight crockett and one of the other men found the force of texians waiting along cibolo creek who had advanced to within  miles  km of the alamo just before daylight on march  part of the texian force managed to break through the mexican lines and enter the alamo a second group was driven across the prairie by mexican cavalry the siege ended on march  when the mexican army attacked just before dawn while the defenders were sleeping the daily bombardment by artillery had been suspended perhaps a ploy to encourage the natural human reaction to a cessation of constant strain but the garrison awakened and the final fight began most of the noncombatants gathered in the church sacristy for safety according to dickinson before running to his post crockett paused briefly in the chapel to say a prayer when the mexican soldiers breached the north outer walls of the alamo complex most of the texians fell back to the barracks and the chapel as previously planned crockett and his men were too far from the barracks to take shelter and were the last remaining group in the mission to be in the open the men defended the low wall in front of the church using their rifles as clubs and relying on knives as the action was too furious to allow reloading after a volley and a charge with bayonets mexican soldiers pushed the few remaining defenders back toward the church the battle of the alamo lasted almost  minutes a coffin in the san fernando cathedral purports to hold the ashes of the alamo defenders however historians believe it more probable that the ashes were buried near the alamo once all of the defenders had been killed santa anna ordered his men to take the bodies to a nearby stand of trees where they were stacked together and wood piled on top that evening a fire was lit and the bodies of the defenders were burned to ashes the ashes were left undisturbed until february  when juan seguin and his cavalry returned to bexar to examine the remains a local carpenter created a simple coffin and ashes from the funeral pyres were placed inside the names of travis crockett and bowie were inscribed on the lid the coffin is thought to have been buried in a peach tree grove but the spot was not marked and can no longer be identified death the david crockett spring in crockett in houston county in east texas all that is certain about the fate of david crockett is that he died fighting at the alamo on the morning of march   at age  according to many accounts of the battle between five and seven texans surrendered during the battle possibly to general castrillon incensed that his orders to take no prisoners had been ignored santa anna demanded the immediate execution of the survivors although castrillon and several other officers refused to do so staff officers who had not participated in the fighting drew their swords and killed the unarmed texians controversy weeks after the battle stories began to circulate that crockett was among those who surrendered and were executed however ben a former american slave who acted as cook for one of santa annas officers maintained that crocketts body was found in the barracks surrounded by no less than sixteen mexican corpses with crocketts knife buried in one of them historians disagree on which story is accurate according to petite every account of the crockett surrenderexecution story comes from an avowed antagonist either on political or military grounds of santa annas it is believed that many stories such as the surrender and execution of crockett were created and spread in order to discredit santa anna and add to his role as villain in  jesús sánchez garza selfpublished a book called la rebelión de texas—manuscrito inédito de  por un ofical de santa anna purporting to be memoirs of josé enrique de la peña a mexican officer present at the battle of the alamo in  the texas am university press published an english translation of the book called with santa anna in texas a personal narrative of the revolution the english publication caused a scandal within the united states as it asserted that crockett did not die in battle historians disagree on whether any or all of the book has been falsified because the original book was selfpublished no editor or publisher ever vetted its authenticity sánchez garza never explained how he gained custody of the documents or where they were stored after de la peñas death some historians including bill groneman found it suspicious that sánchez garzas compilation was published in  at the height of interest in crockett and the alamo caused by walt disneys television miniseries about crocketts life davy crockett groneman also points out that the journals are made up of several different types of paper from several different paper manufacturers all cut down to fit historian joseph musso also questions the validity likewise basing his suspicions on the timing of the diaries releasecitation needed the documents most energetic defender has been historian james crisp who found an  pamphlet by de la peña in which the mexican said he was preparing his diary for publication  proof that if nothing else the sanchez garza text had a historical basis finally in  archivist david gracy published a detailed analysis of the manuscript including lab results he found among other things that the paper and ink were of a type used by the mexican army in the s and the handwriting matched that on other documents in the mexican military archives that were written or signed by de la peña furthermore catherine williamson manuscript cataloguer at butterfield  butterfield said de la peñas memoir was written on a high rag content paper typical of the early th century the watermarks tell us the paper was produced in lisbon between  and  if something had indicated to us the paper was made after that period or was from the th century and clearly a fake we would not be offering it for sale were satisfied that it is what it is butterfield officials believe the eyewitness journal could fetch between  and  in de la peñas narrative he adds a footnote which may align both versions he states that all of the enemy perished there remaining alive only an elderly lady and a negro slave whom the soldiers spared out of mercy and because we had established that only force had kept them in danger perry  this implies that the summary execution of the survivors may have occurred prior to the releasing of dickinson and joe so that they observed crockett as dead lending credence to their testimony de la peña describes the disposal of the dead and wounded as an ongoing process that took some timecitation needed first no other accounts of crocketts surviving the alamo have surfaced besides de la peñas diary no documentation in the archives of the mexican government nor any of the personal records of others present at the battle of the alamo give any hint of survivors amongst the defenders much less any claiming crockett as a survivor secondly there is some speculation that de la peñas account may have been a deliberate fabrication with the intention of presenting santa anna in a far more diabolical light than american and especially texan historians have given him since the fall of the alamocitation needed david crockett clipper ship card the written account by de la peña even if a legitimate writing has also been questioned in that many doubt his abilities to identify any of the alamo defenders by name it is a popular belief by many historians that de la peña may have witnessed or been told about executions of some alamo survivors but in fact neither he nor his comrades would have known who these men were part of the reason that de la peñas memoirs are questioned comes from his detailed account of col william travis death in with santa anna in texas in that account he describes with detail how travis was heroic in his final moments turning straight into the mexican soldiers and facing his death with honor the problem with this how would de la peña have been able to distinguish travis from any of the other defenders of the alamo the freed former slave to travis joe claimed travis died early on in the battle on the north wall in addition to this the mexican army had not breached the walls of the alamo when travis was killed therefore they would have been seeing him from an area below the walls while being fired down upon by the defenders to add to this travis was killed before daybreak meaning it was still dark therefore it is believed that de la peña either created the scenario of travis death or he saw another of the defenders after breaching the walls and took him to be travis legacy one of crocketts sayings which were published in almanacs between  and  along with those of daniel boone and kit carson was always be sure you are right then go ahead

and about five other men rode into san antonio de bexar and camped just outside the town they were later greeted by james bowie and antonio menchaca and taken to the home of don erasmo seguincitation needed the fall of the alamo by robert jenkins onderdonk depicts davy crockett swinging his rifle at mexican troops who have breached the south gate of the mission crockett arrived at the alamo on february  on february  to the surprise of the men garrisoned in the alamo a mexican army led by general antonio lopez de santa anna arrived the mexican soldiers immediately initiated a siege santa anna ordered his artillery to keep up a nearconstant bombardment the guns were moved closer to the alamo each day increasing their effectiveness on february  – mexican soldiers crossed the san antonio river and took cover in abandoned shacks approximately  to  yards  to  m from the alamo wallsthe soldiers intended to use the huts as cover to establish another artillery position although many texians assumed that they actually were launching an assault on the fort several men volunteered to burn the huts to provide cover the alamo cannons fired grapeshot at the mexican soldiers and crockett and his men fired rifles while other defenders reloaded extra weapons for them to use in maintaining a steady fire within  minutes the battle was over and the mexican soldiers retreated inside the alamo the stores of powder and shot were limited on february  alamo commander william barret travis ordered the artillery to stop returning fire so as to conserve precious ammunition crockett and his men were encouraged to keep shooting as they were unusually effective a knife purportedly used by davy crockett during the battle of the alamo as the siege progressed travis sent many messages asking for reinforcements several messengers were sent to james fannin who commanded the only other official group of texian soldiers fannin and several hundred texians occupied presidio la bahia at goliad although fannin ultimately decided it was too risky to attempt to reinforce the alamo historian thomas ricks lindley concludes that up to  of fannins men left his command to go to bexar these men would have reached cibolo creek  miles  km from the alamo on the afternoon of march  there they joined another group of men who also planned to join the garrison that same night outside the alamo there was a skirmish between mexican and texian troops several historians including walter lord speculated that the texians were creating a diversion to allow their last courier john smith to evade mexican pickets however in  alamo survivor susannah dickinson said that travis sent three men out shortly after dark on march  probably a response to the arrival of mexican reinforcements the three men who included crockett were sent to find fannin lindley stated that just before midnight crockett and one of the other men found the force of texians waiting along cibolo creek who had advanced to within  miles  km of the alamo just before daylight on march  part of the texian force managed to break through the mexican lines and enter the alamo a second group was driven across the prairie by mexican cavalry the siege ended on march  when the mexican army attacked just before dawn while the defenders were sleeping the daily bombardment by artillery had been suspended perhaps a ploy to encourage the natural human reaction to a cessation of constant strain but the garrison awakened and the final fight began most of the noncombatants gathered in the church sacristy for safety according to dickinson before running to his post crockett paused briefly in the chapel to say a prayer when the mexican soldiers breached the north outer walls of the alamo complex most of the texians fell back to the barracks and the chapel as previously planned crockett and his men were too far from the barracks to take shelter and were the last remaining group in the mission to be in the open the men defended the low wall in front of the church using their rifles as clubs and relying on knives as the action was too furious to allow reloading after a volley and a charge with bayonets mexican soldiers pushed the few remaining defenders back toward the church the battle of the alamo lasted almost  minutes a coffin in the san fernando cathedral purports to hold the ashes of the alamo defenders however historians believe it more probable that the ashes were buried near the alamo once all of the defenders had been killed santa anna ordered his men to take the bodies to a nearby stand of trees where they were stacked together and wood piled on top that evening a fire was lit and the bodies of the defenders were burned to ashes the ashes were left undisturbed until february  when juan seguin and his cavalry returned to bexar to examine the remains a local carpenter created a simple coffin and ashes from the funeral pyres were placed inside the names of travis crockett and bowie were inscribed on the lid the coffin is thought to have been buried in a peach tree grove but the spot was not marked and can no longer be identified death the david crockett spring in crockett in houston county in east texas all that is certain about the fate of david crockett is that he died fighting at the alamo on the morning of march   at age  according to many accounts of the battle between five and seven texans surrendered during the battle possibly to general castrillon incensed that his orders to take no prisoners had been ignored santa anna demanded the immediate execution of the survivors although castrillon and several other officers refused to do so staff officers who had not participated in the fighting drew their swords and killed the unarmed texians controversy weeks after the battle stories began to circulate that crockett was among those who surrendered and were executed however ben a former american slave who acted as cook for one of santa annas officers maintained that crocketts body was found in the barracks surrounded by no less than sixteen mexican corpses with crocketts knife buried in one of them historians disagree on which story is accurate according to petite every account of the crockett surrenderexecution story comes from an avowed antagonist either on political or military grounds of santa annas it is believed that many stories such as the surrender and execution of crockett were created and spread in order to discredit santa anna and add to his role as villain in  jesús sánchez garza selfpublished a book called la rebelión de texas—manuscrito inédito de  por un ofical de santa anna purporting to be memoirs of josé enrique de la peña a mexican officer present at the battle of the alamo in  the texas am university press published an english translation of the book called with santa anna in texas a personal narrative of the revolution the english publication caused a scandal within the united states as it asserted that crockett did not die in battle historians disagree on whether any or all of the book has been falsified because the original book was selfpublished no editor or publisher ever vetted its authenticity sánchez garza never explained how he gained custody of the documents or where they were stored after de la peñas death some historians including bill groneman found it suspicious that sánchez garzas compilation was published in  at the height of interest in crockett and the alamo caused by walt disneys television miniseries about crocketts life davy crockett groneman also points out that the journals are made up of several different types of paper from several different paper manufacturers all cut down to fit historian joseph musso also questions the validity likewise basing his suspicions on the timing of the diaries releasecitation needed the documents most energetic defender has been historian james crisp who found an  pamphlet by de la peña in which the mexican said he was preparing his diary for publication  proof that if nothing else the sanchez garza text had a historical basis finally in  archivist david gracy published a detailed analysis of the manuscript including lab results he found among other things that the paper and ink were of a type used by the mexican army in the s and the handwriting matched that on other documents in the mexican military archives that were written or signed by de la peña furthermore catherine williamson manuscript cataloguer at butterfield  butterfield said de la peñas memoir was written on a high rag content paper typical of the early th century the watermarks tell us the paper was produced in lisbon between  and  if something had indicated to us the paper was made after that period or was from the th century and clearly a fake we would not be offering it for sale were satisfied that it is what it is butterfield officials believe the eyewitness journal could fetch between  and  in de la peñas narrative he adds a footnote which may align both versions he states that all of the enemy perished there remaining alive only an elderly lady and a negro slave whom the soldiers spared out of mercy and because we had established that only force had kept them in danger perry  this implies that the summary execution of the survivors may have occurred prior to the releasing of dickinson and joe so that they observed crockett as dead lending credence to their testimony de la peña describes the disposal of the dead and wounded as an ongoing process that took some timecitation needed first no other accounts of crocketts surviving the alamo have surfaced besides de la peñas diary no documentation in the archives of the mexican government nor any of the personal records of others present at the battle of the alamo give any hint of survivors amongst the defenders much less any claiming crockett as a survivor secondly there is some speculation that de la peñas account may have been a deliberate fabrication with the intention of presenting santa anna in a far more diabolical light than american and especially texan historians have given him since the fall of the alamocitation needed david crockett clipper ship card the written account by de la peña even if a legitimate writing has also been questioned in that many doubt his abilities to identify any of the alamo defenders by name it is a popular belief by many historians that de la peña may have witnessed or been told about executions of some alamo survivors but in fact neither he nor his comrades would have known who these men were part of the reason that de la peñas memoirs are questioned comes from his detailed account of col william travis death in with santa anna in texas in that account he describes with detail how travis was heroic in his final moments turning straight into the mexican soldiers and facing his death with honor the problem with this how would de la peña have been able to distinguish travis from any of the other defenders of the alamo the freed former slave to travis joe claimed travis died early on in the battle on the north wall in addition to this the mexican army had not breached the walls of the alamo when travis was killed therefore they would have been seeing him from an area below the walls while being fired down upon by the defenders to add to this travis was killed before daybreak meaning it was still dark therefore it is believed that de la peña either created the scenario of travis death or he saw another of the defenders after breaching the walls and took him to be travis legacy one of crocketts sayings which were published in almanacs between  and  along with those of daniel boone and kit carson was always be sure you are right then go ahead

december  crockett was writing to friends about moving to texas if jacksons chosen successor martin van buren was elected president the next year he discussed with his friend benjamin mcculloch raising a company of volunteers to take to texas in the expectation that a revolution was imminent after the election results became known in august his departure to texas was delayed by a court appearance in the last week of october as coexecutor of his deceased fatherinlaws estate and he finally left his home near rutherford in west tennessee on nov   with three other men to explore texas his youngest child matilda later wrote that she distinctly remembered the last time she saw her father he was dressed in his hunting suit wearing a coonskin cap and carried a fine rifle presented to him by friends in philadelphia  he seemed very confident the morning he went away that he would soon have us all to join him in texas from his home crockett traveled to jackson arriving there with  wellarmed men where he gave a speech from the steps of the madison county courthouse and then rode southwest to bolivar where he spent the night at residence of dr calvin jones once again drawing

and about five other men rode into san antonio de bexar and camped just outside the town they were later greeted by james bowie and antonio menchaca and taken to the home of don erasmo seguincitation needed the fall of the alamo by robert jenkins onderdonk depicts davy crockett swinging his rifle at mexican troops who have breached the south gate of the mission crockett arrived at the alamo on february  on february  to the surprise of the men garrisoned in the alamo a mexican army led by general antonio lopez de santa anna arrived the mexican soldiers immediately initiated a siege santa anna ordered his artillery to keep up a nearconstant bombardment the guns were moved closer to the alamo each day increasing their effectiveness on february  – mexican soldiers crossed the san antonio river and took cover in abandoned shacks approximately  to  yards  to  m from the alamo wallsthe soldiers intended to use the huts as cover to establish another artillery position although many texians assumed that they actually were launching an assault on the fort several men volunteered to burn the huts to provide cover the alamo cannons fired grapeshot at the mexican soldiers and crockett and his men fired rifles while other defenders reloaded extra weapons for them to use in maintaining a steady fire within  minutes the battle was over and the mexican soldiers retreated inside the alamo the stores of powder and shot were limited on february  alamo commander william barret travis ordered the artillery to stop returning fire so as to conserve precious ammunition crockett and his men were encouraged to keep shooting as they were unusually effective a knife purportedly used by davy crockett during the battle of the alamo as the siege progressed travis sent many messages asking for reinforcements several messengers were sent to james fannin who commanded the only other official group of texian soldiers fannin and several hundred texians occupied presidio la bahia at goliad although fannin ultimately decided it was too risky to attempt to reinforce the alamo historian thomas ricks lindley concludes that up to  of fannins men left his command to go to bexar these men would have reached cibolo creek  miles  km from the alamo on the afternoon of march  there they joined another group of men who also planned to join the garrison that same night outside the alamo there was a skirmish between mexican and texian troops several historians including walter lord speculated that the texians were creating a diversion to allow their last courier john smith to evade mexican pickets however in  alamo survivor susannah dickinson said that travis sent three men out shortly after dark on march  probably a response to the arrival of mexican reinforcements the three men who included crockett were sent to find fannin lindley stated that just before midnight crockett and one of the other men found the force of texians waiting along cibolo creek who had advanced to within  miles  km of the alamo just before daylight on march  part of the texian force managed to break through the mexican lines and enter the alamo a second group was driven across the prairie by mexican cavalry the siege ended on march  when the mexican army attacked just before dawn while the defenders were sleeping the daily bombardment by artillery had been suspended perhaps a ploy to encourage the natural human reaction to a cessation of constant strain but the garrison awakened and the final fight began most of the noncombatants gathered in the church sacristy for safety according to dickinson before running to his post crockett paused briefly in the chapel to say a prayer when the mexican soldiers breached the north outer walls of the alamo complex most of the texians fell back to the barracks and the chapel as previously planned crockett and his men were too far from the barracks to take shelter and were the last remaining group in the mission to be in the open the men defended the low wall in front of the church using their rifles as clubs and relying on knives as the action was too furious to allow reloading after a volley and a charge with bayonets mexican soldiers pushed the few remaining defenders back toward the church the battle of the alamo lasted almost  minutes a coffin in the san fernando cathedral purports to hold the ashes of the alamo defenders however historians believe it more probable that the ashes were buried near the alamo once all of the defenders had been killed santa anna ordered his men to take the bodies to a nearby stand of trees where they were stacked together and wood piled on top that evening a fire was lit and the bodies of the defenders were burned to ashes the ashes were left undisturbed until february  when juan seguin and his cavalry returned to bexar to examine the remains a local carpenter created a simple coffin and ashes from the funeral pyres were placed inside the names of travis crockett and bowie were inscribed on the lid the coffin is thought to have been buried in a peach tree grove but the spot was not marked and can no longer be identified death the david crockett spring in crockett in houston county in east texas all that is certain about the fate of david crockett is that he died fighting at the alamo on the morning of march   at age  according to many accounts of the battle between five and seven texans surrendered during the battle possibly to general castrillon incensed that his orders to take no prisoners had been ignored santa anna demanded the immediate execution of the survivors although castrillon and several other officers refused to do so staff officers who had not participated in the fighting drew their swords and killed the unarmed texians controversy weeks after the battle stories began to circulate that crockett was among those who surrendered and were executed however ben a former american slave who acted as cook for one of santa annas officers maintained that crocketts body was found in the barracks surrounded by no less than sixteen mexican corpses with crocketts knife buried in one of them historians disagree on which story is accurate according to petite every account of the crockett surrenderexecution story comes from an avowed antagonist either on political or military grounds of santa annas it is believed that many stories such as the surrender and execution of crockett were created and spread in order to discredit santa anna and add to his role as villain in  jesús sánchez garza selfpublished a book called la rebelión de texas—manuscrito inédito de  por un ofical de santa anna purporting to be memoirs of josé enrique de la peña a mexican officer present at the battle of the alamo in  the texas am university press published an english translation of the book called with santa anna in texas a personal narrative of the revolution the english publication caused a scandal within the united states as it asserted that crockett did not die in battle historians disagree on whether any or all of the book has been falsified because the original book was selfpublished no editor or publisher ever vetted its authenticity sánchez garza never explained how he gained custody of the documents or where they were stored after de la peñas death some historians including bill groneman found it suspicious that sánchez garzas compilation was published in  at the height of interest in crockett and the alamo caused by walt disneys television miniseries about crocketts life davy crockett groneman also points out that the journals are made up of several different types of paper from several different paper manufacturers all cut down to fit historian joseph musso also questions the validity likewise basing his suspicions on the timing of the diaries releasecitation needed the documents most energetic defender has been historian james crisp who found an  pamphlet by de la peña in which the mexican said he was preparing his diary for publication  proof that if nothing else the sanchez garza text had a historical basis finally in  archivist david gracy published a detailed analysis of the manuscript including lab results he found among other things that the paper and ink were of a type used by the mexican army in the s and the handwriting matched that on other documents in the mexican military archives that were written or signed by de la peña furthermore catherine williamson manuscript cataloguer at butterfield  butterfield said de la peñas memoir was written on a high rag content paper typical of the early th century the watermarks tell us the paper was produced in lisbon between  and  if something had indicated to us the paper was made after that period or was from the th century and clearly a fake we would not be offering it for sale were satisfied that it is what it is butterfield officials believe the eyewitness journal could fetch between  and  in de la peñas narrative he adds a footnote which may align both versions he states that all of the enemy perished there remaining alive only an elderly lady and a negro slave whom the soldiers spared out of mercy and because we had established that only force had kept them in danger perry  this implies that the summary execution of the survivors may have occurred prior to the releasing of dickinson and joe so that they observed crockett as dead lending credence to their testimony de la peña describes the disposal of the dead and wounded as an ongoing process that took some timecitation needed first no other accounts of crocketts surviving the alamo have surfaced besides de la peñas diary no documentation in the archives of the mexican government nor any of the personal records of others present at the battle of the alamo give any hint of survivors amongst the defenders much less any claiming crockett as a survivor secondly there is some speculation that de la peñas account may have been a deliberate fabrication with the intention of presenting santa anna in a far more diabolical light than american and especially texan historians have given him since the fall of the alamocitation needed david crockett clipper ship card the written account by de la peña even if a legitimate writing has also been questioned in that many doubt his abilities to identify any of the alamo defenders by name it is a popular belief by many historians that de la peña may have witnessed or been told about executions of some alamo survivors but in fact neither he nor his comrades would have known who these men were part of the reason that de la peñas memoirs are questioned comes from his detailed account of col william travis death in with santa anna in texas in that account he describes with detail how travis was heroic in his final moments turning straight into the mexican soldiers and facing his death with honor the problem with this how would de la peña have been able to distinguish travis from any of the other defenders of the alamo the freed former slave to travis joe claimed travis died early on in the battle on the north wall in addition to this the mexican army had not breached the walls of the alamo when travis was killed therefore they would have been seeing him from an area below the walls while being fired down upon by the defenders to add to this travis was killed before daybreak meaning it was still dark therefore it is believed that de la peña either created the scenario of travis death or he saw another of the defenders after breaching the walls and took him to be travis legacy one of crocketts sayings which were published in almanacs between  and  along with those of daniel boone and kit carson was always be sure you are right then go ahead

east image available on the internet and included in accordance with title  usc section  building in part upon his growing notoriety crockett defeated the incumbent fitzgerald in  to return to congress the following year he published his autobiography written with the help of thomas chilton a narrative of the life of david crockett of the state of tennessee the only work that he actually authored it was intended to correct the portrayal given by mathew st clair clarke in sketches and eccentricities and to deny crocketts authorship of that account which did not bear clarkes name the narrative was also a campaign biography of sorts for whig politicians were touting crockett as an antijackson candidate for the presidency in  on april   he began a threeweek triumphal tour of the eastern states and his campaign swing was recorded in the first of two whig books published the next year under his name an account of colonel crocketts tour to the north and down east the second a negative life of martin van buren was issued less than three months later political cartoon depicting davy crockett protecting thenpresident andrew jackson from an attempted assassination in  image available on the internet and included in accordance with title  usc section  crockett apparently thought himself a serious candidate but he was likely only a convenient political tool to the whigs an independent frontiersman with a national reputation perhaps the equal of jacksons who opposed jackson on key political issues the point became academic however when crockett lost his  congressional campaign to adam huntsman a peglegged lawyer supported by jackson and by governor carroll of tennessee by  votes disenchanted with the political process and his former constituents crockett decided to do what he had threatened to doto explore texas and to move his family there if the prospects were pleasing on november   with william patton abner burgin and lindsey k tinkle he set out to the west

some friends congregated in the bar of the union hotel for a farewell drinking party crockett offered his now famous remark since you have chosen to elect a man with a timber toe to succeed me you may all go to hell and i will go to texas they set off the next day their route was down the mississippi river to the arkansas and then up that river to little rock overland to fulton arkansas and up the red river along the northern boundary of texas across the red river through clarksville to nacogdoches and san augustine and on to san antonio at san augustine the party evidently divided burgin and tinkle went home crockett and patton signed the oath of allegiance but only after crockett insisted upon the insertion of the word republican in the document they thus swore their allegiance to the provisional government of texas or any future republican government that may be hereafter declared crockett had balked at the possibility that he would be obliged to support some future government that might prove despotic in early february crockett arrived at san antonio de béxar antonio lópez de santa anna arrived on february  on the one hand crockett was still fighting jackson the americans in texas were split into two political factions that divided roughly into those supporting a conservative whig philosophy and those supporting the administration crockett chose to join col william b travis who had deliberately disregarded sam houstons orders to withdraw from the alamo rather than support houston a jackson sympathizer what was more he saw the future of an independent texas as his future and he loved a good fight painting fall of the alamo circa  by robert j onderdonk which hangs in the texas governors mansion in austin and shows davy crockett swinging his rifle against mexican troops image available on the internet and included in accordance with title  usc section  susanna wilkerson dickinson courtesy of the texas state library and archives commission image available on the internet and included in accordance with title  usc section  crockett died in battle of the alamo on march   the manner of his death was uncertain however until the publication in  of the diary of lt josé enrique de la peña susanna dickinson wife of almeron dickinson an officer at the alamo said crockett died on the outside one of the earliest to fall joe traviss slave and the only male texan to survive the battle reported seeing crockett lying dead with slain mexicans around him and stated that only one man named warner surrendered to the mexicans warner was taken to santa anna and promptly shot when peñas eyewitness account was placed together with other corroborating documents crocketts central part in the defense became clear travis had previously written that during the first bombardment crockett was everywhere in the alamo animating the men to do their duty other reports told of the deadly fire of his rifle that killed five mexican gunners in succession as they each attempted to fire a cannon bearing on the fort and that he may have just missed santa anna who thought himself out of range of all the defenders rifles crockett and five or six others were captured when the mexican troops took the alamo at about six oclock that morning even though santa anna had ordered that no prisoners be taken the general infuriated when some of his officers brought the americans before him to try to intercede for their lives ordered them executed immediately they were killed with bayonets and swords crocketts reputation and that of the other survivors was not as some have suggested sullied by their capture their dignity and bravery was in fact further underscored by peñas recounting that these unfortunates died withouthumiliating themselves before their

holds the ashes of those killed at the alamo including davy crockett although its authenticity has been doubted image available on the internet and included in accordance with title  usc section   coincidentally a work mostly of fiction masquerading as fact had put the truth of crocketts death before the american public in the summer of  despite its many falsifications and plagiarisms richard penn smiths col crocketts exploits and adventures in texaswritten by himself had a reasonably accurate account of crocketts capture and execution many thought the legendary davy deserved better and they provided it from thrilling tales of his clubbing mexicans with his empty rifle and holding his section of the wall of the alamo until cut down by bullets and bayonets to his survival as a slave in a mexican salt mine in the final analysis however no matter how fascinating or outrageous the fabrications were that gathered around him the historical david crockett proved a formidable hero in his own right and succeeded daniel boone as the roughhewn representative of frontier independence and virtue in this regard the motto he adopted and made famous epitomized his spirit be always sure
