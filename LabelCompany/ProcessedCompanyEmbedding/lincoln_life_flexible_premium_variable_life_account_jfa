premium requirement partial withdrawals may be subject to a pro rata surrender charge and a partial withdrawal charge a surrender or partial withdrawal may have tax consequences  loan risks taking a loan from your policy may increase the risk that your policy will terminate it will have a permanent effect on the policys surrender value because the accumulation value held as security for the loan does not participate in the performance of the divisions in addition if you do not pay loan interest when it comes due the accrued interest will be added to the amount of the loan and will reduce the

also choose between the two death benefit qualification tests the cash value accumulation test and the guideline premium test once you have made your choice the death benefit qualification test cannot be changed the guideline premium test limits the amount of premium payable for an insured of a particular age and sex it also applies a prescribed corridor percentage to determine a minimum ratio of

prevent the accumulation value as defined in section  of the code from ever exceeding the net single premium required to fund the future benefits under the policy if the accumulation value is ever greater than the net single premium at the insureds age and sex for the proposed death benefit the death benefit will be automatically increased by multiplying the accumulation value by a corridor percentage that is defined as  divided by the net single premium the tests differ as follows  the guideline premium test limits the amount of premium that you can pay into your policy the cash value accumulation test does not  the factors that determine the minimum death benefit relative to the policys accumulation value are different required increases in the minimum death benefit due to growth in accumulation value will generally be greater under the cash value accumulation test  if you wish to pay more premium than is permitted under the guideline premium test for example to target a funding objective you should consider the cash value accumulation test because it generally permits higher premium payments however the higher corridor percentage might cause you to pay higher cost of insurance charges payment of higher premiums could also cause your policy to be deemed a mec  if your primary objective is to maximize the potential for growth in accumulation value or to conserve accumulation value generally the guideline premium test will better serve this objective since the corridor percentages are lower the smaller required death benefit generally results in lower cost of insurance charges you should consult with a qualified tax adviser before choosing the death benefit qualification test the following example demonstrates the death benefits under options i ii and iii

switching between investment divisions available under the policy dollar cost averaging requires regular investments regardless of fluctuating price levels and does not guarantee profits or prevent

plan the us supreme court held in a  decision that under title vii optional annuity benefits under a deferred compensation plan could not vary on the basis of sex tax matters  general following is a discussion of the federal income tax considerations relating to the policy this discussion is based on our understanding of federal income tax laws as they now exist and are currently interpreted by the internal revenue service these laws are complex and tax results may vary among individuals anyone contemplating the purchase of or the exercise of elections under the policy should seek competent tax advice  federal tax status of the company we are taxed as a life insurance company in accordance with the internal revenue code of  as amended code for federal income tax purposes the operations of each separate account form a part of our total operations and are not taxed separately although operations of each separate account are treated separately for accounting and financial statement purposes both investment income and realized capital gains of the separate account are reinvested without tax since the code does not impose a tax on the separate account for these amounts however we reserve the right to make a deduction for such tax should it be imposed in the future  life insurance qualification the policy contains provisions not found in traditional life insurance policies however we believe that it should qualify under the code as a life insurance contract for federal income tax purposes with the result that all death benefits paid under the policy will generally be excludable from the gross income of the policys beneficiary section  of the code includes a definition of life insurance for tax purposes the definition provides limitations on the relationship between the death benefit and the account value if necessary we will increase your death benefit to maintain compliance with section  the policy is intended to qualify as life insurance under the code the death benefit provided by the policy is intended to qualify for the federal income tax exclusion if at any time you pay a premium that would exceed the amount allowable for such qualification we will either refund the excess premium to you or if the excess premium exceeds  offer you the alternative of instructing us to hold the excess premium in a premium deposit fund and apply it to the policy later in accordance woth your instructions we will credit interest at an annual rate that we may declare from time to time on advance premium deposit funds if the excess premium had been applied to your policy before we notify you we will adjust your policy value as though the excess premium had not been applied to your policy and offer to refund the excess premium plus interest credited at a rate equal to the annual rate credited to the advance premium deposit fund if you instruct us to hold that amount we will apply it to a premium deposit fund and thereafter credit interest as described above pnth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th we will pay any refund no later than  days after the end of the relevant policy year in accordance with the requirements of the code we also reserve the right to refuse to make any change in the specified amount or the death benefit option of any other change if such change would cause the policy to fail to qualify as life insurance under the code a modified endowment contract is a life insurance policy which fails to meet a sevenpay test in general a policy will fail the sevenpay test if the cumulative amount of premiums paid under the policy at any time during the first seven policy years exceeds a calculated premium level the calculated sevenpay premium level is based on a hypothetical policy issued on the same insured and for the same initial death benefit which under specified conditions which include the absence of expense and administrative charges would be fully paid for after seven years your policy will be treated as a modified endowment contract unless the cumulative premiums paid under your policy at all times during the first seven policy years are less than or equal to the cumulative sevenpay premiums which would have been paid under the hypothetical policy on or before such times the policy will be allowed to become a mec under the code only with your consent if you pay a premium that would cause your policy to be deemed a mec and you do not consent to mec status for your policy we will either refund the excess premium to you or if the excess premium exceeds  offer you the alternative of instructing us to hold the excess premium in a premium deposit fund and apply it to the policy later in accordance with your instructions we will credit interest at an annual rate that we may declare from time to time on advance premium deposit funds if the excess premium had been applied to your policy before we notify you we will adjust your policy value as though the excess premium had not been applied to your policy and offer to refund the excess premium plus interest credited at a rate equal to the annual rate credited to the advance premium deposit fund if you instruct us to hold that amount we will apply it to a premium deposit fund and thereafter credit interest as described above we will pay any refund no later than  days after the end of the relevent policy year in accordance with the requirements of the code we may also notify you of other options available to you to keep the policy in compliance whenever there is a material change under a policy it will generally be treated as a new contract for purposes of determining whether the policy is a modified endowment contract and subject to a new sevenpay premium period and a new sevenpay limit the new sevenpay limit would be determined taking into account under a prospective adjustment formula the policy account value of the policy at the time of such change a materially changed policy would be considered a modified endowment contract if it failed to satisfy the new sevenpay limit a material change could occur as a result of a change in the death benefit option the selection of additional benefits the restoration of a terminated policy and certain other changes if the benefits under your policy are reduced for example by requesting a decrease in specified amount or in some cases by making partial withdrawals terminating additional benefits under a rider changing the death benefit option or as a result of policy termination the calculated sevenpay premium level will be redetermined based on the reduced level of benefits and applied retroactively for purposes of the sevenpay test if the premiums previously paid are greater than the recalculated sevenpay premium level limit the policy will become a modified endowment contract unless you request a refund of the excess premium as outlined above we also may offer you the choice of moving the excess premium to an advance premium deposit fund account as outlined above generally a life insurance policy which is received in exchange for a modified endowment contract or a modified endowment contract which terminates and is restored will also be considered a modified endowment contract if a policy is deemed to be a modified endowment contract any distribution from the policy will be taxed in a manner comparable to distributions from annuities ie on an income first basis distributions for this purpose include a loan pledge assignment or partial withdrawal any such distributions will be considered taxable income to the extent accumulation value under the policy exceeds investment in the policy a  penalty tax will also apply to the taxable portion of such a distribution no penalty will apply to distributions i to taxpayers   years of age or older ii in the case of a disability which can be expected to result in death or to be of indefinite duration or iii received as part of a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the life or life expectancy of the taxpayer or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the taxpayer and his beneficiary to the extent a policy becomes a modified endowment contract any distribution as defined above which occurs in the policy year it becomes a modified endowment contract and in any year thereafter will be taxable income to you also any distributions within two years before a policy becomes a modified endowment contract will also be income taxable to you to the extent that accumulation value exceeds investment in the policy as described above the secretary of the treasury has been authorized to prescribe rules which would similarly treat other distributions made in anticipation of a policy becoming a modified endowment contract for purposes of determining the amount of any distribution includible in income all modified endowment contracts which are issued by the same insurer or its affiliates to the same policyowner during any calendar year are treated as one contract we believe the policy will continue to qualify as life insurance under the code however there is some uncertainty regarding this treatment it is possible therefore that you would be viewed as constructively receiving the surrender value in the year in which the insured attains age  and would realize taxable income at that time even if the policy proceeds were not distributed at that time the foregoing summary does not purport to be complete or to cover all situations and as always there is some degree of uncertainty with respect to the application of the current tax laws in addition to the provisions discussed above congress may consider other legislation which if enacted could adversely affect the tax treatment of life insurance policies also the treasury department may amend current regulations or adopt new regulations with respect to this and other code provisions therefore you are advised to pnth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th consult a tax adviser for more complete tax information specifically regarding the applicability of the code provisions to your situation under normal circumstances if the policy is not a modified endowment contract loans received under the policy will be construed as your indebtedness you are advised to consult a tax adviser or attorney regarding the deduction of interest paid on loans even if the policy is not a modified endowment contract a partial withdrawal together with a reduction in death benefits during the first  policy years may create taxable income for you the amount of that taxable income is determined under a complex formula and it may be equal to part or all of but not greater than the income on the contract a partial withdrawal made after the first  policy years will be taxed on a recovery of premiumfirst basis and will only be subject to federal income tax to the extent such proceeds exceed the total amount of premiums you have paid that have not been previously withdrawn if you make a partial withdrawal surrender loan or exchange of the policy we may be required to withhold federal income tax from the portion of the money you receive that is includible in your federal gross income a policyowner who is not a corporation may elect not to have such tax withheld however such election must be made before we make the payment in addition if you fail to provide us with a correct taxpayer identification number usually a social security number or if the treasury notifies us that the taxpayer identification number which has been provided is not correct the election not to have such taxes withheld will not be effective in any case you are liable for payment of the federal income tax on the taxable portion of money received whether or not an election to have federal income tax withheld is made if you elect not to have federal income tax withheld or if the amount withheld is insufficient then you may be responsible for payment of estimated tax you may also incur penalties under the estimated tax rules if the withholding and estimated tax payments are insufficient we suggest that you consult with a tax adviser as to the tax implications of these matters in the event that a policy is owned by the trustee under a pension or profit sharing plan or similar deferred compensation arrangement tax consequences of ownership or receipt of proceeds under the policy could differ from those stated herein however if ownership of such a policy is transferred from the plan to a plan participant upon termination of employment for example the policy will be subject to all of the federal tax rules described above a policy owned by a trustee under such a plan may be subject to restrictions under erisa and a tax adviser should be consulted regarding any applicable erisa requirements the internal revenue service imposes limitations on the amount of life insurance that can be owned by a retirement plan clients should consult their tax advisors about the tax consequences associated with the sale or distribution of the policy from the qualified plan and the potential effect of irs notice  the policy may also be used in various arrangements including nonqualified deferred compensation or salary continuation plans split dollar insurance plans executive bonus plans and others where the tax consequences may vary depending on the particular facts and circumstances of each individual arrangement a tax adviser should be consulted regarding the tax attributes of any particular arrangement where the value of it depends in part on its tax consequences federal estate and local estate inheritance and other tax consequences of ownership or receipt of policy proceeds depend upon the circumstances of each policyowner and beneficiary current treasury regulations set standards for diversification of the investments underlying variable life insurance policies in order for such policies to be treated as life insurance we believe we presently are and intend to remain in compliance with the diversification requirements as set forth in the regulations if the diversification requirements are not satisfied the policy would not be treated as a life insurance contract as a consequence to you income earned on a policy would be taxable to you in the calendar quarter in which the diversification requirements were not satisfied and for all subsequent calendar quarters the secretary of the treasury may issue a regulation or a ruling which will prescribe the circumstances in which a policyowners control of the investments of a segregated account may cause the policyowner rather than the insurance company to be treated as the owner of the assets of the account the regulation or ruling could impose requirements that are not reflected in the policy relating for example to such elements of policyowner control as premium allocation investment selection transfer privileges and investment in a division focusing on a particular investment sector failure to comply with any such regulation or ruling presumably would cause earnings on a policyowners interest in separate account a to be includible in the policyowners gross income in the year earned however we have reserved certain rights to alter the policy and investment alternatives so as to comply with such regulation or ruling we believe that any such regulation or ruling would apply prospectively since the regulation or ruling has not been issued there can be no assurance as to the content of such regulation or ruling or even whether application of the regulation or ruling will be prospective for these reasons policyowners are urged to consult with their own tax advisers the foregoing summary does not purport to be complete or to cover all situations including the possible tax consequences of changes in ownership counsel and other competent advisers should be consulted for more complete information  charges for jp financial income taxes we are presently taxed as a life insurance company under the provisions of the code the code specifically provides for adjustments in reserves for variable policies and we will include flexible premium life insurance operations in our tax return in accordance with these rules currently no charge is made against the separate account for our federal income taxes or provisions for such taxes that may be attributable to the separate account we may charge each division for its portion of any income tax charged to us on the division or its assets under present laws we may incur state and local taxes in addition to premium taxes in several states at present these taxes pnth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th are not significant however if they increase we may decide to make charges for such taxes or provisions for such taxes against the separate account we would retain any investment earnings on any tax charges

underwriting risk classification the accumulation values cash values and death benefits would be different from those shown if the returns averaged   and  over a period of years but fluctuated above and below those averages for individual policy years the amount of the accumulation value exceeds the cash value during the first ten policy years due to the surrender charge for policy years eleven

accumulation values and cash values reflect the fact that the net investment return of the divisions is lower than the gross return on the assets in the divisions as a result of expenses paid by the portfolios and charges levied against the divisions the policy values shown take into account a daily investment advisory fee equivalent to the maximum annual rate of  of the aggregate arithmetic average daily net assets of the portfolios plus a charge of  of the aggregate arithmetic average daily net assets to cover expenses incurred by the portfolios for the twelve months ended december   the investment advisory fee is an arithmetic average of the individual investment advisory fees of the thirtytwo portfolios the  expense figure is an arithmetic average of the annual expenses of the

the hypothetical values shown in the tables do not reflect any charges for federal income taxes or other taxes against separate account a since jp financial is not currently making such charges however if in the future such charges are made the gross annual investment rate of return would have to exceed the stated investment rates by a sufficient amount to cover the tax charges in order to produce the accumulation values cash values and death benefits illustrated the tables illustrate the policy values that would result based on hypothetical investment rates of return if premiums are paid in full at the beginning of each year if all net premiums are allocated to separate account a and if no policy loans have been made the values would vary from those shown if the assumed annual premium payments were paid in installments during a year the values would also vary if the policyowner varied the amount or frequency of premium payments the tables also assume that the policyowner

facts will amaze you  hilariously insightful foreign words top  unbelievable historical concurrencies flexible premium adjustable life insurance is a type of whole life insurance policy that offers individuals the greatest amount of flexibility in terms of their investment choice and monthly premiums it provides both a death benefit and an investment vehicle many individuals opt for such a policy because it provides a form of forced savings for retirement while also protecting dependents in the event of premature death the first key to understanding this type of insurance is understanding whole life insurance policies whole life policies are distinct from term life because the death benefit on a whole life policy is paid no matter when the insured dies with term policies the death benefit is paid only during a set period for example for his beneficiaries to collect the death benefit on a year term the insured would have to die within the year period that the policy was active with a whole life policy premium payments continue for life and the death benefit is paid no matter when the insured dies premiums for this type of policy are generally more expensive than those for a term policy they are also more expensive because the insured pays another fee over and above the cost of insurance which is invested in various types of investment vehicles ad the payments are invested in one of two ways the investor may have control over the investments and receive a variable rate of return or he may have no control over the investment and receive a fixed rate of return in other words an investor with a variable policy pays extra premiums that are invested and then gets to direct the course of that investment ideally growing his policy and the amount he is eventually paid an investor with a fixed rate policy on the other hand pays extra premiums in and earns a fixed rate of return while the insurance company invests those premiums a flexible premium adjustable life insurance policy is an alternative fixed rate policy that gives investors greater freedom instead of paying the same premiums every month the insured can choose to pay within a range the amount he pays in ultimately affects how much income he will earn from the life insurance policy he also has discretion to direct the investment of his money within the terms of the policy the money eventually paid out to him in the form of withdrawals or dividends fluctuates based both on how much he paid on a monthly basis and based on how well his investments perform some policies may contain a guaranteed minimum rate of return when a policy is purchased as long as a minimum amount of premiums are paid ad you might also like recommended related wisegeek articles what is the value

this article anon post  make sure the financial strength rating is high according to am best they rate the best insurance companies only  percent out of the  insurances companies in the us have an a superior rating so find one of those because legally life insurance companies can wait six months to pay out a death benefit and the average one waits  months also make sure that you are getting what you want out of the program lump sum or monthly installments income replacement or final expenses all good things to consider i would recommend a straight whole life policy that gets locked in at a young age to take care of final expenses and some term with a high face amount to cover your liabilities anon post  i had an ordinary whole life level premium plan for k my agent passed away and in the fourth year his replacement called to say they had a new and better deal for me it was called flexible premium adjustable life insurance the only description he provided was that it provided a surplus or reserve premium to be invested in a variety of capital gain and income producing vehicles i told him to leave my original policy untouched but he could write an additional policy to reach total  million instead he rewrote entire policy for the better policy and collected a k commission i did not know these details until  years later because the new policy was mailed to the trustee of the family trust who was named the beneficiary the trustee received the policy and simply placed it in our trust file it was uncovered only  years later when we were told premiums had reached a level twice what we had been paying kyear in the course of our subsequent communication with the insurer they admitted a significant error in calculation of the premiums from  years ago they are now recalculating and you can imagine things are a bit tense around here i guess i should have had the decency to die younger but at  i am now in something of a bind i cant pay current k out of social security view entire post anon post  when shopping for life insurance its basically the same thing as shopping around for any product or service  you compare rates and coverage from different life insurance companieswhen we had our first child i started getting life insurance quotes online to see what was available one site was a good resource it gave me rates companies and coverage options and by getting a few quotes from three or four companies i began to learn generally what a good price for certain coverage was they also have tons of articles but lets face it you cant get specific prices without picking what specific coverage you wantgood luck alchemy hope this helps a bit in your search alchemy post  how do i tell if i am paying a good price for life insurance if buying life insurance is anything like buying automobile insurance then prices can vary widely i am getting married soon and i want to buy a motorcycle the only way my fiancée will let me have a motorcycle is if i buy some type of life insurance riding bikes can be dangerous in arizona and we have a twoyearold daughter so i can agree with her point of view my only problem is i don’t know where to start shopping does anyone have any good advice for a relatively young person shopping for life insurance anon post  are premiums for a charitable gift of life insurance tax deducible payable in a lumpsum
