unanticipated events nongaap financial measures in addition to evaluating the companys financial performance in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap management routinely supplements their evaluation with an analysis of certain nongaap financial measures such as core net income the efficiency ratio and tangible book value per share a reconciliation to the most directly comparable gaap financial measure net income in the case of core net income and the efficiency ratio and stockholders equity in the case of tangible book value per share appears in the accompanying reconciliation of nongaap financial measures table we believe that providing certain nongaap financial measures provides investors with information useful in understanding our financial performance our performance trends and financial position specifically we provide measures based on what we believe are our operating earnings on a consistent basis and exclude noncore operating items which affect the gaap reporting of results of operations the company believes that core net income is useful for both investors and management to understand the effects of items that are nonrecurring and infrequent in nature the company believes that the efficiency ratio which measures the costs expended to generate a dollar of revenue is useful in the assessment of financial performance including noninterest expense control the company believes that tangible book value per share is useful to evaluate the relative strength of the companys capital position the company does not have goodwill and intangible assets for any of the periods presented as such tangible book value per common share is equal to book value per common share we utilize these measures for internal planning and forecasting purposes these nongaap financial measures should not be considered a substitute for gaap basis measures and results and we strongly encourage investors to review our consolidated financial statements

information request email notification faq rss feeds farmington bank institutional ownership ownership   × ownership   list of possible reasons behind the infrequent cases where we have total institutional ownership that exceeds  of the common shares outstanding for a specific company   doublecounting  on the f filing each institutional holder must report all securities over which they exercise sole or shared investment discretion in cases where investment discretion is shared by more than one institution care is generally taken to prevent doublecounting but there is always the exception another cause of doublecounting is a company name change for the f filer where the holdings are accounted for under both filer names   short interest  a large short interest amount affects the institutional ownership amount considerably because all shares that have been sold short appear as holdings in two separate portfolios one institution has lent its shares to a short seller while the same shares have been purchased by another reporting institution consequently the institutional ownership percentage reflected in the f filings is overstated as a percentage of total shares outstanding   a gap between as of dates  in the case where gaps between the as of dates of the holdings and the shares outstanding arise the percentage owned could be skewed due to a sharp increasedecrease in shares out again this case doesn’t come up very often but the results are unavoidable   other possible reasons a an overlap occurs amongst reporting institutions b the f filing includes holdings other than common stock issues c mutual fund money is coadvised and incorrectly reported by multiple institutions ownership information shares outstanding  short interest shares
