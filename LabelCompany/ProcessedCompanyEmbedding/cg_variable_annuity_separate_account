your annuity account value held in any variable subaccount equals the number of subaccount units allocated to a contract multiplied by the subaccount accumulation unit value as described below variable accumulation unit value and variable accumulation value when we receive a premium payment we will credit that portion of the premium payment to be allocated to the variable subaccounts to the variable account in the form of variable accumulation units we determine how many variable accumulation units to credit by dividing the dollar amount allocated to a particular subaccount by the variable accumulation unit value for that particular subaccount during the valuation period that we receive the premium payment for the initial premium payment we use the valuation period during which we accept the premium payment the variable accumulation unit value for each variable subaccount was established at  for the first valuation period of the particular variable subaccount we determine the variable accumulation unit value for the particular variable subaccount for any subsequent valuation period by multiplying the variable accumulation unit value for the particular variable subaccount for the immediately preceding valuation period by the net investment factor for the particular variable subaccount for such subsequent valuation period the variable accumulation unit value for each variable subaaccount for any valuation period is the value determined as of the end of the particular valuation period and may increase decrease or remain constant from valuation period to valuation period the variable accumulation value of the annuity account if any for any valuation period is equal to the sum of the value of all variable accumulation units of each variable subaccount credited to the variable account for such valuation period the variable accumulation value of each variable subaccount is determined by multiplying the number of variable accumulation units if any credited to each variable subaccount by the variable accumulation unit value of the particular variable subaccount for such valuation period net investment factor the net investment factor is an index applied to measure the investment performance of a variable subaccount from one valuation period to the next the net investment factor may be greater or less than or equal to  therefore the value of a valuable accumulation unit may increase decrease or remain the same the net investment factor for any variable subaccount for any valuation period is determined by dividing a by b and then subtracting c from the result where a is the net result of  the net asset value of a fund portfolio share held in the variable subaccount determined as of the end of the valuation period plus  the per share amount of any dividend or other distribution declared on the fund portfolio shares held in the variable subaccount if the exdividend date occurs during the valuation period plus or minus  a per share credit or charge with respect to any taxes that we pay or reserve for during the valuation period which we determine to be attributable to the operation of the variable account subaccount b is the net asset value of the fund portfolio shares held in the variable subaccount determined as of the end of the preceding valuation period and c is the total of charges for mortality and expense risks and the administrative expense fee during the valuation period sample calculations and tables variable account calculations variable accumulation unit value calculation assume the net asset value of a fund portfolio share at the end of the current valuation period is  and its value at the end of the immediately preceding valuation period was  the valuation period is one day and no dividends or distributions caused fund shares to go exdividend during the current valuation period  divided by  is  subtracting the one day risk factor for mortality and expense risks and the administrative expense charge of  the daily equivalent of the current total charge of  on an annual basis gives a net investment factor of  if the value of the variable accumulation unit for the immediately preceding valuation period had been  the value for the current valuation period would be   x  variable annuity unit value calculation the assumptions in the above example exist also assume that the value of an annuity unit for the immediately preceding valuation period had been  if the first variable annuity payment is determined by using an assumed interest rate of  per year the value of the annuity unit for the current valuation period would be   x  the net investment factor x   is the factor for a one day valuation period that neutralizes the assumed interest rate of four percent  per year used to establish the annuity payment rates found in the contract variable annuity payment calculation assume that a participants variable annuity account is credited with  variable accumulation units of a particular variable subaccount that the variable accumulation unit value and the annuity unit value for the particular variable subaccount for the valuation period which ends immediately preceding the annuity date are  and  respectively that the annuity payment rate for the age and option elected is  per  and that the annuity unit value on the day prior to the second variable annuity

variable accounts contractual obligations pay charges relative to the variable account or make adjustments for annuity reserves held in the variable account we hold the variable subaccounts assets separate and apart from the assets of any of our other segregated asset accounts and separate and apart from our general account assets we maintain records of all purchases and redemptions of shares

officers and employees its policy limit as of may   is  historical performance data money market variable subaccount yield we may disclose the current annualized yield of the money market variable subaccount which invests in the money market portfolio for a day period in a manner which does not take into consideration any realized or unrealized gains or losses on shares of the money market fund or on its portfolio securities we compute this current annualized yield by determining the net change exclusive of realized gains and losses on the sale of securities unrealized appreciation and depreciation and income other than investment income at the end of the day period in the value of a hypothetical account having a balance of one unit of the money market variable subaccount at the beginning of the day period dividing such net change in account value by the value of the account at the beginning of the period to determine the base period return and annualizing this quotient on a day basis the net change in account value reflects i net income from the money market portfolio attributable to the hypothetical account and ii charges and deductions imposed under a contract that are attributable to the hypothetical account we may also disclose the effective yield of the money market variable subaccount for the same day period determined on a compounded basis we calculate the effective yield by compounding the unannualized base period return by adding one to the base period return raising the sum to a power equal to  divided by  and subtracting one from the result we calculate the effective yield by compounding the unannualized base period return according to the following formula effective yield  base period return  to the power of    the yield on amounts held in the money market variable subaccount normally will fluctuate on a daily basis therefore the disclosed yield for any given past period is not an indication or representation of future yields or rates of return the money market variable subaccounts actual yield is affected by changes in interest rates on money market securities average portfolio maturity of the money market portfolio the types and quality of portfolio securities held by the money market portfolio and its operating expenses the yield figures do not reflect withdrawal charges or premium taxes other variable subaccount yields we may advertise or disclose the current annualized yield of one or more of the variable subaccounts of the variable account except the money market variable subaccount for day periods the annualized yield of a variable subaccount refers to income that the variable subaccount generates over a specific day period because the yield is annualized the yield generated by a variable subaccount during the day period is assumed to be generated each day period over a month period we compute the yield by dividing the net investment income per accumulation unit earned during the period by the maximum offering price per unit on the last day of the period according to the following formula yield   a  b     cd where a  net investment income earned during the period by the particular portfolio attributable to shares owned by the variable subaccount b  expenses accrued for the period c  the average daily number of accumulation units outstanding during the period d  the maximum offering price per accumulation unit on the last day of the period because the variable account imposes charges and deductions a variable subaccounts yield will be lower than the yield for its corresponding fund the yield calculations do not reflect the effect of any premium taxes or withdrawal charges that may apply to a particular contract withdrawal charges range from  to  of the amount withdrawn on total premium payments paid less prior partial surrenders depending on the contract year of surrender the yield on amounts held in the variable subaccounts normally fluctuates over time therefore the disclosed yield for any given past period does not indicate or represent future yields or rates of return the types and quality of the funds investments and its operating expenses affect a variable subaccounts actual yield standard variable subaccount total returns we may advertise or disclose annual average total returns for one or more of the variable subaccounts for various periods of time when a variable subaccount has been in operation for   and  years respectively we will provide the total return for these periods we may also disclose total returns for other periods of time total returns represent the average annual compounded rates of return that would equate the initial amount invested to the redemption value of that investment on the last day of each of the periods we calculate total returns using variable subaccount unit values that we calculate on each valuation period we base variable subaccount unit values on the performance of the subaccounts underlying portfolio reduced by the mortality and expense risk charge the administrative expense charge and the annuity account fee the annuity account fee is reflected by dividing the total amount of such charges collected during the year that are attributable to the variable account by the total average net assets of all the variable subaccounts we deduct the resulting percentage from the return in calculating the ending redeemable value these figures do not reflect any premium taxes charges or credits for market value adjustments total return calculations reflect the effect of withdrawal charges that may apply to a particular period we will then calculate the total return according to the following formula pl  tto the power of n  erv where p  a hypothetical initial premium payment of  t  average annual total return n  number of years in the period erv  ending redeemable value of a hypothetical  payment made at the beginning of the one five or tenyear period at the end of the one

format described above the nonstandard format will be identical to the standard format except that we assume that the withdrawal charge percentage is  we may also disclose cumulative total returns in conjunction with the standard format described above we calculate the cumulative returns by using the following formula and assuming that the withdrawal charge percentage is  ctr  ervp   where ctr  the cumulative total return net of variable subaccount recurring charges for the period erv  the ending redeemable value of the hypothetical investment made at the beginning of the one five or tenyear period at the end of the one five or tenyear period or fractional portion thereof p  a hypothetical initial payment of  nonstandard performance data will only be advertised if standard performance data is also disclosed adjusted historical portfolio performance we may also disclose yield and total return for the funds portfolios including for periods before the date that the variable account began operations for periods prior to the date the variable account commenced operations adjusted historical portfolio performance information will be calculated based on the performance of the portfolios and the assumption that the variable subaccounts were in existence for the same periods as those of the portfolios with some or all of the charges equal to those currently assessed against

separate account provides the variable investment options and along with the general account provides the foundation of a variable annuity the investment fund options often dozens of mutual funds are referred to as subaccounts in contrast to the general account the separate account is not guaranteed by the insurance company the returns of the subaccounts are variable rather than fixed so the contract holder rather than the insurance company assumes market risk the separate account is “separate” from the general assets of the insurance company so there is no credit risk in the event that

variable annuity is an annuity contract that allows the policy owner to allocate contributions into various subaccounts of a separate account based upon the risk appetite of the annuitant the contributions can be invested in stocks bonds or other investments income payments in the annuitization phase can be fixed or fluctuate with the investment performance of the underlying subaccounts of the separate account in contrast to fixed annuities policyholders assume all of the investment risk with variable annuities because they are separate account products that are valued at market every day additionally variable annuities are registered as securities with the securities and exchange commission sec overview insurers began marketing variable deferred annuities in the late s in response to rising interest rates and equity markets unlike the fixed deferred annuities insurers mostly sold up until this time variable annuities offered investors the ability to hedge against this rising inflation because variable annuities are backed by assets held in an insurers separate accounts their income benefits fluctuate with the investment performance of the underlying separate account investments originally variable annuities underlying investment funds primarily consisted of corporate common stock but as time went on insurers expanded their fund offerings to include bonds indices mutual funds and other securities this enabled policyholders to move funds between various subaccounts to achieve a certain investment strategy to boost sales insurers began offering variable annuity products with guarantees about a decade ago since then there have been a plethora of guarantees introduced to the market with most insurers now offering various minimum guarantees these guarantees can ensure the policyholder receives minimum death benefits guaranteed living benefits accumulation benefits minimum credited interest rates and income benefit or withdrawal benefit amounts variable annuities with guarantees provide an important differentiation to other alternative investments such as mutual funds which is their biggest competitor sales of both group and individual variable annuities rose in the s demand for annuities in general increased significantly after the tax reform act of  reduced the tax advantages of qualified retirement plans individual variable annuities became particularly popular a cipr study on the state of the life insurance industry notes that by the mids growth in individual annuities had resulted in insurers overall product mix becoming almost evenly distributed between annuity considerations and traditional insurance products by the end of the century annuity products led by variable annuity sales had become so popular their sales volumes outpaced those of traditional life insurance the result would be an historic shift in life insurers overall product mix toward annuities however low interest rates and equity market volatility of the past decade have placed pressure on the returns for variable annuity products it has also hurt insurers ability to support variable annuities many of which were issued with minimum guarantees insurers have responded by reducing their guarantees and crediting rates to accommodate the new environment despite these economic pressures variable annuities continue to be in demand particularly as aging consumers seek savings vehicles designed to help them manage their longterm needs as such sales of variable annuities will remain an important source of revenue for insurers in the future status state insurance regulators monitor the solvency of insurance companies offering annuities and have strict rules in place some of which are derived from naic model laws and regulations the naic encourages states to adopt model laws and regulations designed to inform and protect annuity consumers the naic annuity disclosure model regulation establishes standards for the disclosure of certain information

with a crossreference to the page in this prospectus where the purchaser may find a more complete description  expense table page   the objective of the contract which may or may not be realized is to accumulate accumulation units sufficient to provide the annuitant with a variable annuity which will furnish relatively level annuity payments during periods when the economy is relatively stable and to provide increased annuity payments during inflationary and growth periods see general description of the group variable annuity contract page   the contract provides that in the event of death of the annuitant before annuity payments begin cg life will pay death proceeds to a named beneficiary see death benefits page   the contract provides that a participant may surrender redeem his value in the contract in whole or in part for cash before the annuity commencement date unless restricted by the retirement plan subject to a sales charge in no event will this sales charge exceed  see redemptions page  and sales charge page   an additional income tax may be assessed under the internal revenue code in the event of certain early withdrawals see federal tax status page   the contract

provides for transfer of contract values among other group annuity contracts issued by cg life see redemptions page   the contract includes a limited right of cancellation see redemptions page  the objective of the contract which may or may not be realized is to accumulate accumulation units sufficient to provide the annuitant with a variable annuity which will furnish relatively level annuity payments during periods when the economy is relatively stable and to provide increased annuity payments during inflationary and growth periods cg life seeks to accomplish this objective by investing net payments made under the contract in shares of the fund there is no assurance that this objective will be attained historically the value of a diversified portfolio of common stocks held for an extended period of time has tended to rise during periods of inflation there has however been no exact correlation and for some periods the values of securities have declined while the costofliving was rising the values under the contract both before and after the commencement of annuity payments will increase or decrease to reflect the current value of such equity securities thus the investment risk under a contract is borne by the contractholder and participant all net payments received on behalf of a participant under a contract are credited to vaaii a separate account established by cg life under the laws of the state of connecticut and registered on june   as a unit investment trust under the investment company act of  as amended  act such registration does not involve supervision of the investments or investment policies of vaaii amounts credited to vaaii are used to purchase shares of the fund at the net asset value of such shares the fund is treated as a diversified openend investment company under the  act the principal objective of the fund is longterm growth of capital and it is intended that the assets of the fund will consist principally of a portfolio of common stocks the fund will seek to fulfill this objective by attempting to replicate the composition and total return reduced by fund expenses of the standard  poors  composite stock price index the value of the investments held in the fund will fluctuate daily and is subject to market risk  ie the possibility that common stock prices will decline over short or even extended periods the us stock market

contract which is not described in this prospectus see redemptions the charge is effected by canceling the number of accumulation units equal in value to the charge the amount of this expense charge is set forth in each contract and is based upon cg lifes appraisal of the cost involved in administering the contract if the participant is enrolled under an associated fixeddollar contract as well as the contract the combined expense charge under both contracts will not exceed  annually and will be equitably allocated between the two contracts in a manner determined by cg life if the participant is enrolled only under a contract the expense charge will not exceed  annually and will normally be somewhat lower if during any  month period immediately preceding a december  no payments have been

annuity payments will reflect the investment performance of the fund they will not be affected by adverse mortality experience or by any excess in the actual sales and administration expenses over the expense deductions provided for in the contract cg life i assumes the risk that annuity payments will continue for a longer period than anticipated because the annuitant lives longer than expected and ii assumes the risk that the sales charge and administration charge may be insufficient to cover the actual costs of these items for assuming these mortality risks and expense charges cg life in determining the accumulation unit value and annuity unit value makes a deduction at the end of each valuation period from the then current market value of each participant and annuitant the amount of this deduction for each valuation period is the rate for the number of calendar days in such period which is equivalent to an annual rate of   for mortality risks and  for expense charge under a contract having  or more participants on whose behalf payments are being made or which is equivalent to an annual rate of   for mortality risks and  for expense charge under a contract having less than  participants on whose behalf payments are being made if under a contract having an effective mortality and expense charge of  annually the number of participants for whom payments are being made falls below  for a period of  consecutive months commencing on december  the effective rate of such charge may be increased to  annually at the expiration of such period if on any december  under a contract having an effective annual mortality and expense charge of annually  the number of participants for whom payments are made is  or more such charge will be reduced to  on such december  any such change in the mortality and expense charge under the contract will not apply in determining annuity unit values applicable to variable annuities effected prior to the date of such change after the fifth anniversary of the effective date of the contract cg life may change the mortality and expense charges see changes in the contract the contract is nonparticipating and does not share in the surplus of cg life however the contract provides for experience rating under which the actual costs each year are compared with the sales charges and expense charges made during the year if such costs exceed actual costs cg life may allocate all or a portion of the excess as an experience rating credit but is not obligated to do so application of any credit will be made within the contract year immediately following the period with respect to which the credit was declared in one of three ways a by a reduction in either the sales charge or the annual administration charge or both or b by the crediting without deduction for the sales charge of a number of additional accumulation units or annuity units as applicable equal in value to the amount of the credit less any applicable premium

accumulation units will not change because of a subsequent change in the value of the unit but the dollar value of an accumulation unit will vary to reflect the investment experience of the class of fund shares underlying the division value of an accumulation unit the value of an accumulation unit was established at  as of the date the fund shares were first purchased the value of accumulation units subsequently is determined by multiplying the value of an accumulation unit for the immediately preceding valuation date by a net investment factor for the valuation period ending on such date a

taxed as a life insurance company under the code the operations of vaaii are part of the total operations of cg life and are not taxed separately although the operations of vaaii are treated separately for accounting and financial statement purposes and must be considered separately in computing cg lifes tax liability investment gains of the fund credited to vaaii are not taxable to a contractholder or a participant whoever is applicable until received in the form of a cash redemption from an accumulation account or in the form of annuity payments cash redemptions will generally be taxed as ordinary income in the year received and may be subject to an additional tax under certain circumstances annuity payments are taxed as ordinary income in accordance with section  of the code this section also provides that to the extent of the participants nondeductible investment in the contract if any a portion of each payment is excluded from gross income as a result of the investment in the contract as a general rule however a participant who receives annuity payments at the time of retirement may be taxed at a lower rate due to reduced income and a larger exemption the contract has been designed so as to qualify as a variable annuity contract for federal income tax purposes thus the contract permits the participant to defer federal income taxation on increases in the value of a contract until such time that amounts are withdrawn from the contract received in the form of annuity payments or paid as a death benefit under the current provisions of the code variable annuity contracts  other than contracts issued under retirement plans which qualify for federal tax benefits under sections a a b  or  of the code or under government retirement plans whether or not so qualified  will not be treated as annuity contracts for federal income tax purposes for any period for which the investments of the segregated asset account on which the contract is based are not adequately diversified this adequately diversified requirement may be met if the underlying investments satisfy either a statutory safe harbor test or diversification requirements set forth in regulations issued by the secretary of the treasury the secretary of the treasury has issued regulations pertaining to such diversification requirements cg life believes that the current structure of the separate account satisfies the requirements of the regulations and it intends that the separate account as well as the underlying fund will operate so as to continue to meet such requirements

tax qualified retirement plans a nontax qualified contract may also be a contract issued to a retirement plan or plan of deferred compensation which is a nontax qualified plan the tax status of the annuitant or participant is determined by provisions of such plan andor provisions of the code applicable to the contract under the provisions of the tax reform act of  a nontax qualified contract which is held by a person who is not a natural person eg a corporation or a trust is not a natural person is not treated as an annuity contract for federal income tax purposes and the income on the contract received or accrued by the contractholder during the taxable year will be treated as ordinary income certain exceptions apply to nontax qualified contracts held by an employer on the termination of a plan described in section a or a of the code or purchased as immediate annuities as defined in the code thus ownership of a nontax qualified contract by nonnatural persons who do not qualify for the statutory exceptions results in denial of tax deferral on increases in the value of the contract taxation of payments under annuity contracts is governed by code section  under the current provisions of the code amounts received under a nontax qualified contract made upon the death of the annuitant or as nonperiodic payments after the annuity commencement date are generally first attributable to any investment gains credited to the contract over the taxpayers basis if any in the contract such amounts will be treated as income subject to federal income taxation an additional  tax on such amounts subject to income tax will be imposed if the withdrawal is made prior to age  however this penalty tax will not be imposed irrespective of age if the amount received is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments not less frequently than annually made for the life or life expectancy of the payee the requirement that the amount be paid out as one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments is met when the number of units withdrawn to make each distribution is substantially the same also the additional tax will not be imposed if the withdrawal follows the death of the annuitant or is attributable to the total disability as defined in the code of the annuitant where the contractholder is an individual who is other than the annuitant the code provides that the penalty tax is applicable to the taxable portion of payments required to be made under the contract following the death of the annuitant if the contractholder transfers assigns the contract to another individual as a gift the code provides that the contractholder will incur taxable income at the time of the transfer the amount of such taxable income is equal to the excess if any of the cash surrender value of the contract over the contractholders cost basis at the time of the gift an exception is provided for certain transfers between spouses annuity payments made after the annuity commencement date are generally taxed to the recipient only as received a part of the payment received is a return of investment in the contract if any and is nontaxable a portion is a return of income and is subject to ordinary income tax an exclusion ratio is used to determine the nontaxable and taxable portion of each payment such exclusion ratio continues until such time that the taxpayer recovers his basis in the contract thereafter all payments received are treated as taxable income taxation of the separate account under the current provisions of the internal revenue code cg life pays no taxes on the investment income and capital gains of the assets of the separate account where used to determine the value of contract accordingly cg life currently makes no adjustments for federal income taxes or benefits in connection with vaaii cg life retains the right to make adjustments for federal income taxes to separate account assets

different categories and carried at fair value if they are not classified as heldtomaturity during the fourth quarter of  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued a guide to implementation of sfas no  which permitted a onetime opportunity to reclassify securities subject to sfas no  consequently the company reclassified all heldtomaturity securities to availableforsale as of december

fair values for financial instruments are estimates that in many cases may differ significantly from the amounts that could be realized upon immediate liquidation in cases where market prices are not available estimates of fair value are based on discounted cash flow analyses which utilize current interest rates for similar financial instruments with comparable terms and credit quality the fair value of liabilities for contractholder deposit funds was estimated using the amount payable on demand and for those not payable on demand discounted cash flow analyses d investments investments in fixed maturities which are classified as availableforsale include bonds assetbacked securities including collateralized mortgage obligations cmos and redeemable preferred stocks fixed maturities are

mortgage loans the companys policy is to rehabilitate release and sell foreclosed properties which generally takes two to four years at the time of foreclosure properties are valued at fair value less estimated costs to sell and reclassified from mortgage loans to real estate held for sale subsequent to foreclosure these investments are carried at the lower of cost or current fair value less estimated costs to sell adjustments to the carrying value as a result of changes in fair value subsequent to foreclosure are recorded as valuation reserves and reported in realized investment gains and losses the company considers several methods in determining fair value for real estate with emphasis placed on the use of discounted cash flow analyses and in some cases the use of thirdparty appraisals effective with the implementation of sfas no  real estate held for sale is no longer depreciated equity securities which include common and nonredeemable preferred stocks are carried at

and will not have a material adverse effect on its liquidity note   contingencies a financial guarantees the company is contingently liable for financial guarantees provided in the ordinary course of business on the repayment of principal and interest on certain industrial revenue bonds the contractual amounts of financial guarantees reflect the companys maximum exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance to limit the companys exposure in the event of default of any guaranteed obligation various programs are in place to ascertain the creditworthiness of guaranteed parties and to monitor this status on a periodic basis the industrial revenue bonds guaranteed directly by the company have remaining maturities of up to  years the guarantees provide for payment of debt service only as it becomes due consequently an event of default would not cause an acceleration of scheduled principal and interest payments the principal amount of the bonds guaranteed by the company at december   and  was  million and  million respectively revenues in connection with industrial revenue bond guarantees are derived principally from equity participations in the related projects and are included in net investment income as earned loss reserves for financial guarantees are established when a default has occurred or when the company believes that a loss has been incurred during  losses for industrial revenue bonds were  million there were no such losses in  and  the company also guarantees a minimum level of benefits for certain separate account contracts and in the event that

accounts and are recognized in income as earned although the ultimate outcome of any loss contingencies arising from the companys financial guarantees may adversely affect results of operations in future periods they are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys liquidity or financial condition b regulatory and industry developments the companys businesses are subject to a changing social economic legal legislative and regulatory environment that could affect them some of the changes include initiatives to change certain federal corporate tax laws restrict insurance pricing and the application of underwriting standards reform health care and expand regulation some of the more significant issues are discussed below in august  congress passed legislation that phases out over a threeyear period the tax deductibility of policy loan interest for most leveraged corporateowned life insurance coli products for   of revenues and  of operating income for the individual financial services segment were from leveraged coli products that are affected by this legislation the effect of the legislation on this segments income is not expected to be material through  beginning in  the effect of the legislation is uncertain however it could have a material adverse effect on the segments income the company does not expect this legislation to have a material effect on its consolidated results of operations liquidity or financial condition the company expects proposals for federal and state legislation seeking some health care insurance reforms due to uncertainties associated with the timing and content of any health care legislation the effect on the companys future results of operations liquidity or financial condition cannot be reasonably estimated at this time the national association of insurance commissioners is currently developing standardized statutory accounting principles which are scheduled to take effect in  the effect on the companys statutory net income surplus and liquidity cannot be reasonably estimated at this time in recent years the number of insurance companies that are impaired or insolvent has increased this is expected to result in an increase in mandatory assessments by state guaranty funds of or voluntary payments by solvent insurance companies to cover losses to policyholders of insolvent or rehabilitated companies mandatory assessments which are subject to statutory limits can be partially recovered through a reduction in future premium taxes in some states the company recorded pretax charges of  million  million and  million for   and  respectively for guaranty fund assessments that can be reasonably estimated before giving effect to future premium tax recoveries although future assessments and payments may adversely affect results of operations in future periods such amounts are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the companys liquidity or financial condition the eventual effect on the company of the changing environment in which it operates remains uncertain c litigation the company is routinely engaged in litigation incidental to its business while the outcome of all litigation involving the company including insurancerelated litigation cannot be determined litigation is not expected to result in losses that differ from recorded reserves by amounts

americans before you buy a variable annuity you should know some of the basics – and be prepared to ask your insurance agent broker financial planner or other financial professional lots of questions about whether a variable annuity is right for you this is a general description of variable annuities – what they are how they work and the charges you will pay before buying any variable annuity however you should find out about the particular annuity you are considering request a prospectus from the insurance company or from your financial professional and read it carefully the prospectus contains important information about the annuity contract including fees and charges investment options death benefits and annuity payout options you should compare the benefits and costs of the annuity to other variable annuities and to other types of investments such as mutual funds contents     what is a variable annuity     how variable annuities work     the death benefit and other features     variable annuity charges     taxfree  exchanges     bonus credits     ask questions before you invest     for more information what is a variable annuity  a variable annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company under which the insurer agrees to make periodic payments to you beginning either immediately or at some future date you purchase a variable annuity contract by making either a single purchase payment or a series of purchase payments a variable annuity offers a range of investment options the value of your investment as a variable annuity owner will vary depending on the performance of the investment options you choose the investment options for a variable annuity are typically mutual funds that invest in stocks bonds money market instruments or some combination of the three although variable annuities are typically invested in mutual funds variable annuities differ from mutual funds in several important ways first variable annuities let you receive periodic payments for the rest of your life or the life of your spouse or any other person you designate this feature offers protection against the possibility that after you retire you will outlive your assets second variable annuities have a death benefit if you die before the insurer has started making payments to you your beneficiary is guaranteed to receive a specified amount – typically at least the amount of your purchase payments your beneficiary will get a benefit from this feature if at the time of your death your account value is less than the guaranteed amount third variable annuities are taxdeferred that means you pay no taxes on the income and investment gains from your annuity until you withdraw your money you may also transfer your money from one investment option to another within a variable annuity without paying tax at the time of the transfer when you take your money out of a variable annuity however you will be taxed on the earnings at ordinary income tax rates rather than lower capital gains rates in general the benefits of tax deferral will outweigh the costs of a variable annuity only if you hold it as a longterm investment to meet retirement and other longrange goals caution other investment vehicles such as iras and employersponsored k plans also may provide you with taxdeferred growth and other tax advantages for most investors it will be advantageous to make the maximum allowable contributions to iras and k plans before investing in a variable annuity in addition if you are investing in a variable annuity through a taxadvantaged retirement plan such as a k plan or ira you will get no additional tax advantage from the variable annuity under these circumstances consider buying a variable annuity only if it makes sense because of the annuitys other features such as lifetime income payments and death benefit protection the tax rules that apply to variable annuities can be complicated – before investing you may want to consult a tax adviser about the tax consequences to you of investing in a variable annuity remember  variable annuities are designed to be longterm investments to meet retirement and other longrange goals variable annuities are not suitable for meeting shortterm goals because substantial taxes and insurance company charges may apply if you withdraw your money early variable annuities also involve investment risks just as mutual funds do how variable annuities work  a variable annuity has two phases an accumulation phase and a payout phase during the accumulation phase you make purchase payments which you can allocate to a number of investment options for example you could designate  of your purchase payments to a bond fund  to a us stock fund and  to an international stock fund the money you have allocated to each mutual fund investment option will increase or decrease over time depending on the funds performance in addition variable annuities often allow you to allocate part of your purchase payments to a fixed account a fixed account unlike a mutual fund pays a fixed rate of interest the insurance company may reset this interest rate periodically but it will usually provide a guaranteed minimum eg  per year example  you purchase a variable annuity with an initial purchase payment of  you allocate  of that purchase payment  to a bond fund and   to a stock fund over the following year the stock fund has a  return and the bond fund has a  return at the end of the year your account has a value of   in the stock fund and  in the bond fund minus fees and charges discussed below your most important source of information about a variable annuitys investment options is the prospectus request the prospectuses for the mutual fund investment options read them carefully before you allocate your purchase payments among the investment options offered you should consider a variety of factors with respect to each fund option including the funds investment objectives and policies management fees and other expenses that the fund charges the risks and volatility of the fund and whether the fund contributes to the diversification of your overall investment portfolio the secs online publication mutual fund investing look at more than a funds past performance provides information about these factors another sec online publication mutual funds and etfs – a guide for investors provides general information about the types of mutual funds and the expenses they charge during the accumulation phase you can typically transfer your money from one investment option to another without paying tax on your investment income and gains although you may be charged by the insurance company for transfers however if you withdraw money from your account during the early years of the accumulation phase you may have to pay surrender charges which are discussed below in addition you may have to pay a  federal tax penalty if you withdraw money before the age of ½ at the beginning of the payout phase you may receive your purchase payments plus investment income and gains if any as a lumpsum payment or you may choose to receive them as a stream of payments at regular intervals generally monthly if you choose to receive a stream of payments you may have a number of choices of how long the payments will last under most annuity contracts you can choose to have your annuity payments last for a period that you set such as  years or for an indefinite period such as your lifetime or the lifetime of you and your spouse or other beneficiary during the payout phase your annuity contract may permit you to choose between receiving payments that are fixed in amount or payments that vary based on the performance of mutual fund investment options the amount of each periodic payment will depend in part on the time period that you select for receiving payments be aware that some annuities do not allow you to withdraw money from your account once you have started receiving regular annuity payments in addition some annuity contracts are structured as immediate annuities which means that there is no accumulation phase and you will start receiving annuity payments right after you purchase the annuity   the death benefit and other features  a common feature of variable annuities is the death benefit if you die a person you select as a beneficiary such as your spouse or child will receive the greater of i all the money in your account or ii some guaranteed minimum such as all purchase payments minus prior withdrawals example you own a variable annuity that offers a death benefit equal to the greater of account value or total purchase payments minus withdrawals you have made purchase payments totaling  in addition you have withdrawn  from your account because of these withdrawals and investment losses your account value is currently  if you die your designated beneficiary will receive  the  in purchase payments you put in minus  in withdrawals some variable annuities allow you to choose a  steppedup death benefit under this feature your guaranteed minimum death benefit may be based on a greater amount than purchase payments minus withdrawals for example the guaranteed minimum might be your account value as of a specified date which may be greater than purchase payments minus withdrawals if the underlying investment options have performed well the purpose of a steppedup death benefit is to lock in your investment performance and prevent a later decline in the value of your account from eroding the amount that you expect to leave to your heirs this feature carries a charge however which will reduce your account value variable annuities sometimes offer other optional features which also have extra charges one common feature the  guaranteed minimum income benefit guarantees a particular minimum level of annuity payments even if you do not have enough money in your account perhaps because of investment losses to support that level of payments  other features may include longterm care insurance which pays for home health care or nursing home care if you become seriously ill you may want to consider the financial strength of the insurance company that sponsors any variable annuity you are considering buying this can affect the companys ability to pay any benefits that are greater than the value of your account in mutual fund investment options such as a death benefit guaranteed minimum income benefit longterm care benefit or amounts you have allocated to a fixed account investment option caution you will pay for each benefit provided by your variable annuity be sure you understand the charges carefully consider whether you need the benefit if you do consider whether you can buy the benefit more cheaply as part of the variable annuity or separately eg through a longterm care insurance policy variable annuity charges  you will pay several charges when you invest in a variable annuity be sure you understand all the charges before you invest these charges will reduce the value of your account and the return on your investment often they will include the following surrender charges – if you withdraw money from a variable annuity within a certain period after a purchase payment typically within six to eight years but sometimes as long as ten years the insurance company usually will assess a surrender charge which is a type of sales charge this charge is used to pay your financial professional a commission for selling the variable annuity to you generally the surrender charge is a percentage of the amount withdrawn and declines gradually over a period of several years known as the surrender period for example a  charge might apply in the first year after a purchase payment  in the second year  in the third year and so on until the eighth year when the surrender charge no longer applies often contracts will allow you to withdraw part of your account value each year –  or  of your account value for example – without paying a surrender charge example you purchase a variable annuity contract with a  purchase payment the contract has a schedule of surrender charges beginning with a  charge in the first year and declining by  each year in addition you are allowed to withdraw  of your contract value each year free of surrender charges in the first year you decide to withdraw  or onehalf of your contract value of  assuming that your contract value has not increased or decreased because of investment performance in this case you could withdraw   of contract value free of surrender charges but you would pay a surrender charge of  or  on the other  withdrawn mortality and expense risk charge – this charge is equal to a certain percentage of your account value typically in the range of  per year this charge compensates the insurance company for insurance risks it assumes under the annuity contract profit from the mortality and expense risk charge is sometimes used to pay the insurers costs of selling the variable annuity such as a commission paid to your financial professional for selling the variable annuity to you example your variable annuity has a mortality and expense risk charge at an annual rate of  of account value your average account value during the year is  so you will pay  in mortality and expense risk charges that year administrative fees – the insurer may deduct charges to cover recordkeeping and other administrative expenses this may be charged as a flat account maintenance fee perhaps  or  per year or as a percentage of your account value typically in the range of  per year example your variable annuity charges administrative fees at an annual rate of  of account value your average account value during the year is  you will pay  in administrative fees underlying fund expenses – you will also indirectly pay the fees and expenses imposed by the mutual funds that are the underlying investment options for your variable annuity fees and charges for other features – special features offered by some variable annuities such as a steppedup death benefit a guaranteed minimum income benefit or longterm care insurance often carry additional fees and charges other charges such as initial sales loads or fees for transferring part of your account from one investment option to another may also apply you should ask your financial professional to explain to you all charges that may apply you can also find a description of the charges in the prospectus for any variable annuity that you are considering taxfree “” exchanges  section  of the us tax code allows you to exchange an existing variable annuity contract for a new annuity contract without paying any tax on the income and investment gains in your current variable annuity account these taxfree exchanges known as  exchanges can be useful if another annuity has features that you prefer such as a larger death benefit different annuity payout options or a wider selection of investment choices you may however be required to pay surrender charges on the old annuity if you are still in the surrender charge period in addition a new surrender charge period generally begins when you exchange into the new annuity this means that for a significant number of years as many as  years you typically will have to pay a surrender charge which can be as high as  of your purchase payments if you withdraw funds from the new annuity further the new annuity may have higher annual fees and charges than the old annuity which will reduce your returns caution if you are thinking about a  exchange you should compare both annuities carefully unless you plan to hold the new annuity for a significant amount of time you may be better off keeping the old annuity because the new annuity typically will impose a new surrender charge period also if you decide to do a  exchange you should talk to your financial professional or tax adviser to make sure the exchange will be taxfree if you surrender the old annuity for cash and then buy a new annuity you will have to pay tax on the surrender bonus credits  some insurance companies are now offering variable annuity contracts with bonus credit features these contracts promise to add a bonus to your contract value based on a specified percentage typically ranging from  to  of purchase payments example  you purchase a variable annuity contract that offers a bonus credit of  on each purchase payment you make a purchase payment of  the insurance company issuing the contract adds a bonus of  to your account caution variable annuities with bonus credits may carry a downside however – higher expenses that can outweigh the benefit of the bonus credit offered frequently insurers will charge you for bonus credits in one or more of the following ways higher surrender charges – surrender charges may be higher for a variable annuity that pays you a bonus credit than for a similar contract with no bonus credit longer surrender periods – your purchase payments may be subject to surrender charges for a longer period than they would be under a similar contract with no bonus credit higher mortality and expense risk charges and other charges – higher annual mortality and expense risk charges may be deducted for a variable annuity that pays you a bonus credit although the difference may seem small over time it can add up in addition some contracts may impose a separate fee specifically to pay for the bonus credit before purchasing a variable annuity with a bonus credit ask yourself – and the financial professional who is trying to sell you the contract – whether the bonus is worth more to you than any increased charges you will pay for the bonus this may depend on a variety of factors including the amount of the bonus credit and the increased charges how long you hold your annuity contract and the return on the underlying investments you also need to consider the other features of the annuity to determine whether it is a good investment for you example  you make purchase payments of  in annuity a and  in annuity b annuity a offers a bonus credit of  on your purchase payment and deducts annual charges totaling  annuity b has no bonus credit and deducts annual charges totaling  lets assume that both annuities have an annual rate of return prior to expenses of  by the tenth year your account value in annuity a will have grown to  but your account value in annuity b will have grown more to  because annuity b deducts lower annual charges even though it does not offer a bonus you should also note that a bonus may only apply to your initial premium payment or to premium payments you make within the first year of the annuity contract further under some annuity contracts the insurer will take back all bonus payments made to you within the prior year or some other specified period if you make a withdrawal if a death benefit is paid to your beneficiaries upon your death or in other circumstances caution if you already own a variable annuity and are thinking of exchanging it for a different annuity with a bonus feature you should be careful even if the surrender period on your current annuity contract has expired a new surrender period generally will begin when you exchange that contract for a new one this means that by exchanging your contract you will forfeit your ability to withdraw money from your account without incurring substantial surrender charges and as described above the schedule of surrender charges and other fees may be higher on the variable annuity with the bonus credit than they were on the annuity that you exchanged example  you currently hold a variable annuity with an account value of  which is no longer subject to surrender charges you exchange that annuity for a new variable annuity which pays a  bonus credit and has a surrender charge period of eight years with surrender charges beginning at  of purchase payments in the first year your account value in this new variable annuity is now  during the first year you hold the new annuity you decide to withdraw all of your account value because of an emergency situation assuming that your account value has not increased or decreased because of investment performance you will receive  minus  of your  purchase payment or  this is  less than you would have received if you had stayed in the original variable annuity where you were no longer subject to surrender charges in short   take a hard look at bonus credits in some cases the bonus may not be in your best interest ask questions before you invest  financial professionals who sell variable annuities have a duty to advise you as to whether the product they are trying to sell is suitable to your particular investment needs dont be afraid to ask them questions and write down their answers so there wont be any confusion later as to what was said variable annuity contracts typically have a free look period of ten or more days during which you can terminate the contract without paying any surrender charges and get back your purchase payments which may be adjusted to reflect charges and the performance of your investment you can continue to ask questions in this period to make sure you understand your variable annuity before the free look period ends before you decide to buy a variable annuity consider the following questions   will you use the variable annuity primarily to save for retirement or a similar longterm goal   are you investing in the variable annuity through a retirement plan or ira which would mean that you are not receiving any additional taxdeferral benefit from the variable annuity   are you willing to take the risk that your account value may decrease if the underlying mutual fund investment options perform badly   do you understand the features of the variable annuity   do you understand all of the fees and expenses that the variable annuity charges   do you intend to remain in the variable annuity long enough to avoid paying any surrender charges if you have to withdraw money   if a variable annuity offers a bonus credit will the bonus outweigh any higher fees and charges that the product may charge   are there features of the variable annuity such as longterm care insurance that you could purchase more cheaply separately   have you consulted with a tax adviser and considered all the tax consequences of purchasing an annuity including the effect of annuity payments on your tax status in retirement   if you are exchanging one annuity for another one do the benefits of the exchange outweigh the costs such as any surrender charges you will have to pay if you withdraw your money before the end of the surrender charge period for the new annuity remember   before purchasing a variable annuity you owe it to yourself to learn as much as possible about how they work the benefits they provide and the charges you will pay for more information  other sec online publications   mutual funds and etfs – a guide for investors – basic information about investing in mutual
