a multibillion dollar nyselisted operator devon has drilled over  wells in the region and recently announced that the region contains multiple layers of oil and gas bearing rock the region is now called the “stack play” and is one of the most active regions in the us with  working drilling rigscompany management said “the successful fullcycle of resource royalty fund llc is a clear example of our acquisition philosophy where we target the most active oil regions of the country under the best operators the dramatic increase in wells on the properties offset the big decline in commodity prices”the property portfolio had a diversified commodity mix receiving income from oil natural gas and natural gas liquids at the time the properties were sold the properties were receiving royalty income from  wells—a significant increase from the six producing wells when they were purchased in considering that the oil price was bbl when acquired and  when sold fund results are impressive one of the keys to the success of the fund is proper portfolio diversification and astute diligence on choosing locations where additional wells would be drilled“our properties have current income and significant growth potential this helps ensure capital preservation and appreciation for our limited partners and works to combat the variable nature of commodity prices and production levels we have built nine funds using this solid principle” said managementthe general partner resource royalty llc utilizes decades of oil and gas experience to create highly strategic and diversified royalty and

sell song rights listings investors raise money about blog sign in get started music royalties guide overview the music industry relies on royalties generated by the licensing of copyrighted songs and recordings as a primary form of payment for musicians intellectual property law and licensing systems have gone through significant adjustments over recent years as a result of the rise of digital music but much of the industrys historic legal framework remains to start thinking about music in legal terms its important to realize that there are two types of musicians songwriters and performing artists these hold two distinct copyrights songwriters hold the rights to the lyrics and melody of a piece of music while performing artists hold the rights to a particular recording of a song which is called a master recording songwriters may only seek copyright for a full song and cannot divide lyrics and melody into separate rights both songwriters and recording artists typically assign their rights to a third party for management instead of attempting to track a song’s use and seek payment independently song copyrights are typically assigned to music publishers while master recording copyrights are typically assigned to a record label how royalty exchange helps investors generate incomehow royalty exchange helps artists raise money performance royalties the fees music users pay

pros in the us that’s bmi ascap and sesac collect songwriting performance royalties from music users and then pay songwriters and rights holders publishers like bmi and ascap soundexchange collects recording performance royalties for recording artists and labels whenever a music is performed publicly — but only for digital performances that’s because copyright regulation as it stands means terrestrial broadcasters amfm radio pay performance royalties to songwriters but not the recording artists digital performances for example pandora pay a recording digital performance royalty to soundexchange and a songwriting digital performance royalty to the pros but on the flipside bmi and ascap are governed by consent decrees which means an arm of the us judicial branch called a “ratecourt” can set the rates per radio play per stream etc bmi and ascap collect for songwriting performance royalties in exchange for the right to collect on behalf of songwriters across america they are limited in their ability to negotiate by this rate court soundexchange isn’t governed by a consent decree which means they can negotiate on the free market this is where things get complicated recording artists get paid nothing when their music is played on amfm radio because there’s no performance right for recordings on terrestrial radio but they are typically paid at least  times more than songwriters when music is performed digitally like on pandora that’s because of soundexchange’s negotiation power and bmiascap’s limitations amfm broadcasters do pay songwriters but
