teamwork sparking innovation and being a driving force in what was once considered a man’s industry by lydia dishman minute readnancy lee gioia’s been with ford motor company since  when she was hired as a graduate trainee in the electronics division in the  years that followed she’s held a variety of positions in electronics architecture manufacturing and engineering in different divisionsadvertisementnow as the company’s director of global electrification gioia drives strategy and planning for the next generation of ford’s global electric vehicle portfolio touching all aspects of electrified transportation including product planning supplier partnerships and collaboration with the energy industry and the government though planning for the future keeps gioia busy she recently sat down with fast company to share tactics of a different kind here are her leadership strategies to apply at the helm of any industrypay it forwardyou never forget your first job for gioia that meant delivering newspapers in fifth grade just like the mail carrier gioia was out there every day in all kinds of weather lugging a sackful of papers on her bike but she earned more than mad money and tips for her toil gioia says she learned some valuable lessons that she still uses in her career today “you have a responsibility and a set number of things to accomplish every time in the most efficient and best manner that you can” gioia told fast company “i took extra care to deliver papers to the door not just throw them on the driveway i was a chubby kid and i wanted to get fit so i would run to the door because it really didn’t take any more time and that customer focus helped earn me bigger tips it also reflected pride in my neighborhood i carry that forward because everything we do can touch our broader goals to be successful you can’t depend on others you have to bring your own energy and expectationsget a mentor–and an advocateadvertisementthere’s a big difference between the two says gioia but both are necessary for anyone who wants to achieve senior role a mentor will guide you and provide an experienced point of view and advocates will go to bat for you when decisions are made about new positions roles or assessments “there tends to be an overemphasis on mentors but advocates–especially for women–are even more important advocates see you are growing your capability and talent and adding to the organization as well as your own skill set” she says “i have mentors at all levels of the organization outside the company and the industry i have actively pursued meeting and learning from them the best mentors are the best students you can’t lead unless you have knowledge and understanding when i mentor i always start with ‘don’t tell me what you want to be tell me what really inspires you’ so that the whole day goes by and you don’t even notice the more time you spend in that zone the greater your contribution to the group and the resultslet your leadership style evolvea year career in the same company while holding in a variety of different roles including a stint as a manufacturing and quality engineer at the engine control electronics facility in lansdale pa management for the launch of ford’s facility in cadiz spain and chief program engineer for the  ford thunderbird has taught gioia how important it is for leaders to evolve as they take on new responsibilities your style–how much you contribute individually vs shaping a strategy for the larger organization–changes depending on your role she says early on in her career this meant she was very hands on so she could develop the expertise necessary to deliver results advertisement“now my role is to set strategy for the next five to  years all the way up to  for where are we going and how we will evolve our customer focus talent attributes resources spending and commitment” gioia said “the more you need to deliver strategy the more collaborative your style needs to be this is not just for large corporations but also for startups getting big things done requires you to bring everyone along the style i have now is clarifying the questions using a process of logic to take disparate information for a group and drive for consensus–without everyone getting paralysis of analysis “a big part of leadership is recognizing what level of detail you need to be engaged in versus becoming an expert my job is to enable to right discussion support the team and push them beyond where they think we can go”make it a woman’s worldgioia’s thoughts on being a woman in the malecentric world of auto manufacturing and engineering has evolved over time as well from avoiding the issue early on to embracing it as a role model to recruit more girl power to the rank and file of auto manufacturers gioia says one thing remains constant “you don’t have to be a car geek to love the auto industry i am not a gear head however i love working on products that make a difference in people’s lives”as she rose through the ranks she saw her role as doing a good job being accepted by peers and contributing and learning but she avoided taking on what she though of as “women’s issues” because she didn’t want to be perceived as selfserving or represent unwanted stereotypes “now i realize i have an important role i have an opportunity to talk to people inside and outside the company and see how many people look at me as a role model as a senior leader you are a role model in a maledominated industry you are even more so seen as someone who stands out recognizing that i thought how do i want to contribute to excitement and interest for women in automotive” she said  advertisement“i’ve done so much in my career–how many industries give you those opportunities it is global in nature–what a cool opportunity if we can change the car we can change the world” encourage innovation without killing ideasit is possible says gioia to support the development of innovative products among teams of scientists and engineers who are by necessity focused on minutia it all starts with questions–namely what problems is a product trying to solve and what are the issues that need to be understood “you keep thinking about that and somewhere in there is a kernel that may result in the next big idea” she says “you have to be able to explain where we have to take a decision in the next five years in the meantime show when you can implement an idea and bring it forward in a bigger way nothing is ever cast in concrete though i have a little trick i keep a journal and when i have ‘aha’ moment i make a little picture of a light bulb i keep them all and i think later ‘you know this one is not ready but i keep putting things back on the plate”the ideas that are ready come forward she says and the others–while unused for the time being–are not dead they’re just waiting for their timeeveryday wisdomadvertisementgioia is an avid equestrian and for the past  years has been riding dressage regularly with her daughter though she admits that her colleagues will probably be eyerolling at the prospect of “another manure story” gioia maintains that some profound learning all comes back to horses “it’s been a revelation that no matter how long you work at something you can always do it better and have more fun the peak is higher the challenge is further out and the journey can be enjoyable or it can be work so make it enjoyable while you work”image flickr user adcuzadvertisementrelated storiesleadershipthe one question i ask to
