robinson director of new product development – murad blog primary menu open sidebar skip to content murad blog meet the expert kristen robinson director of new product development meet by murad contributorjuly  october   kristen robinson is our director of new product development and has been with us here at murad for seven years we love her story about how she found her way to murad it’s all about solving a problem combined with an extraordinary passion and kristen’s skincare regimen tips are absolutely priceless how did you become interested in product development i was motivated by my struggles with acne during my teen and young adulthood seeking and trying new treatments countless trips and money spent on dermatologist visits and prescriptions and observing what worked and didn’t work for my skin this led me to a passion for all things skincare discouraged by my lack of progress at getting clear despite the frequent dermatology visits i began a quest to solve my own acne issues in a less traditional way i placed a call to murad customer care over  years ago and found immediate refuge i was hooked watch kristen’s personal acne story video i graduated with a bs in biochemistry and after deciding not to pursue medical school i sought a career where i could contribute to the field of dermatology without being a dermatologist coming from a small town i had no idea a career in skincare product development existed and i ended up pursuing a handful of careers skin toxicology marketing for a healthcare company and even corporate event planning before finally pursuing my true passion a longtime customer and fan of murad i decided to move to la and contribute to the success of this company product development specifically at murad allows me the opportunity to be immersed in and advance the skincare industry i love approaching and solving skincare concerns not only topically but internally and emotionally with dr murad’s inclusive health philosophy at the helm of everything we create it’s truly a career i’m incredibly passionate about… that i’m excited to dive into every day product development affords me the opportunity for constant learning researching collaboration and is never boring what is your favoritemusthave murad product and why this is a very tough question acne treatment concealer in medium – amazing coverage and it treats acne bumps with a dose of salicylic acid while concealing i use it when a pimple or two creeps up and i love the fact that it glides on without looking cakey clarifying mask sops up oil and grime and makes my skin tone immediately brighter and refined i’m also a huge fan of our professional enzyme treatment when having a facial it’s my alltime favorite to keep my skin clear and fresh looking how do you embrace the murad vision look live and feel better every day how do you look better i look forward to my morning and evening skincare rituals and never skip the opportunity to cleanse treat and moisturize my skin with my favorite murad formulas or latest prototypes to test i enjoy professional peels and facials from time to time too… to keep my skin glowing and in check with the expertise of an esthetician how do you live better one of the biggest advantages of living in california is the access to amazing fresh produce year round and the propensity for people to live young here the weather inspires and encourages healthful activities swimming hiking volleyball biking and more… all feed my drive to be outside among friends and to stay mobile also camping is amazing in california—there are hardly any bugs my husband and i also like to garden and entertain friends and family in our backyard how do you feel better aside from staying active outside i regularly attend workout classes at yogaworks that help my body feel better whether sculpting classes barre pilates or yoga i find at least an hour a day to escape work and daily demands with a good sweat i also adore my family they are warm loving and genuine people with wonderful traditions and values i speak to my parents brothers nieces aunts uncles and cousins almost every day they are all east coast based but i find time to get back home at least three times a year for a solid dose of tlc what is your favorite dr murad insight be imperfect live longer if you weren’t at work what would you be doing traveling europe or traveling anywhere without a doubt taking in the history culture food excitement and adventure discovering learning meeting new people and expanding my imagination travel is always a stimulating breath of fresh air for me opens new perspective and gets new neurons firing next to skincare it is my biggest passion have you experienced transformation whether personal or career while working at murad yes i’ve experienced great growth both professionally and personally while working at murad i’ve learned better balance in my approach to work staying strategic and calculated yet being less rigid and square to take chances and be more open to creativity and risk taking and that things cannot always be black and white a bit of grey is ok sometimes also many key milestones have occurred for me while here at murad marriage home ownership and now motherhood with a baby on the way this october can you share a few tips to help our readers protect their skin during the summer months i encourage readers to transform their approach to skincare make it an enjoyable beautifying ritual not a chore or a bore take in the refreshing aroma while cleansing take a few extra
