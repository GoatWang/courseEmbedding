the moment that are driving the pharmaceutical sector you are working in how does your company respond to those trends essentially industry consolidation is triggering interest in larger outsourcing partners with more services and more products we are entering a new growth era as outsourcing trends increase as our pharmaceutical customers grow and merge they are looking to consolidate their vendors and work with larger cmos and they also desire to work with fewer cmos that they will need to visit maintain relationships with and perform quality audits on the global pharmaceutical industry us simplifying to core competencies and this means that they are reducing their internal resources and reducing fixed cost structures  what are the top challenges faced by the pharmaceutical sector you represent at this moment how does your company deal with these challenges and how do you anticipate in your role we understand customer needs within the pharmaceutical sector as we build a preeminent crocdmo for complex science amri offers a powerful global network of that has the necessary capacity and breadth of innovative services that our customers deserve for their projects across the entire drug pathway continuum – from target discovery through to ndaanda development and approval  what is the main highlight of the productservice you are introducing within exhibitor showcase who is your presentation aimed at building a premier supplier of contract research development and manufacturing services organization requires an understanding of the marketplace a longterm strategy for inorganic and organic growth and the ability to effectively integrate acquisitions amri’s july  acquisition of prime european therapeuticals spa also known as “euticals” positions amri as one of the largest independent developers and suppliers of api to the pharmaceutical industry and provides the company with an established custom synthesis presence in key european markets as amri celebrates its th anniversary this year this transaction is a timely achievement that positions amri for success over many years to come euticals is a privatelyheld company headquartered in lodi italy
