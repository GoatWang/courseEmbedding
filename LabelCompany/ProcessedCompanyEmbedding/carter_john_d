appointment promptness friendly staff fair and accurate diagnosis bedside manner spends time with patients appropriate followup i cant say enough positive things about this doctor he has great bedside manner he is extremely knowledgeable he has the confidence to say i dont know which rarely happens i always recommend him to friends the downside is that he is so good that its difficult to get an appointment was this review helpful yes no report abuse  of  april th  thorough and nice wait time  minutes easy appointment promptness friendly staff fair and accurate diagnosis bedside manner spends time with patients appropriate followup i originally saw dr carter over twelve years ago and started seeing him again about  years ago recently i wanted to discuss a possible diagnosis and he said i dont think that fits and i reminded him that he had given me that diagnosis more than  years ago so he checked his computer and was surprised that he had given me the diagnosis and i wanted to ask if he had also done a specific blood test for it which he advised is not a real predictor but again we were both surprised he had ran the blood test which was negative the gave me a sense of security that he had even in his younger years done a thorough investigation of my symptoms even though the diagnosis was no longer valid at the time it was probably right and may still prove to be right because most of the illnesses he heals with can and do cohabitat unfortunately even when i feel bad he always has a sunny disposition that is contagious making me leave the office happier than when entered even when the prognosis is not good was this review helpful yes no report abuse  of  october th  best and most caring doctor ive ever seen wait time  minutes easy appointment promptness friendly staff fair and accurate diagnosis bedside manner spends time with patients appropriate followup i never feel as though he is being rushed or causing him any imposition like most doctors he

just a dollar sign he also has a great sense of humor and never fails to make me laugh especially when im hurting was this review helpful yes no report abuse  of  june th  dr carters arrogance stands in his way wait time  minutes easy appointment promptness friendly staff fair and accurate diagnosis bedside manner spends time with patients appropriate followup if dr carter spent less time entertaining his underlings with rude and unfounded jokes comments etc he might be able to help his patients i found him to totally demeaning to me as a patient i personally think he should be relieved of his position i understand they had to remodel his department so as to allowing his head through the doors was this review helpful yes no report abuse  of  june th  great doctor that really cares wait time  minutes easy appointment promptness friendly staff fair and accurate diagnosis bedside manner spends time with patients appropriate followup i would highly recommend dr carter as a doctor that always puts the patient needs first and does all that he can to find the best treatment for each person and even looks for ways to make it work financially by helping to find studies that we might be able to fit into this has helped me and my life is once again some what normal and im able to attend family outings again thank you so much dr carter was this review helpful
