said businessman david warnock who plans to run for mayor of baltimore im the one guy that’s been in the business of creating jobs over the last  or  years i really think that can distinguish me said businessman david warnock who plans to run for mayor of baltimore lloyd fox  baltimore sun luke broadwatercontact reporterthe baltimore sun warnock baltimore likes winners ive made a lot of money its time for me to make a lot of change david l warnock the baltimore venture capitalist and philanthropist is entering the mayors race — arguing that his business background and political inexperience are positives for a city in desperate need of job growth and a fresh startwe are going to have another uprising if we cant figure out how to create jobs and economic opportunity for the people who are the least fortunate among us said warnock a partner in one of baltimores largest private equity firms whose charitable work includes helping exoffendersim the one guy thats been in the business of creating jobs over the last  or  years i really think that can distinguish mewarnock  said in an interview with the baltimore sun that he plans to formally file to run for mayor as a democrat tuesday he will join a crowded field seeking to replace mayor stephanie rawlingsblake who is not seeking reelection with his wealth and business connections warnocks entrance could put pressure on the field to ramp up fundraising efforts he also represents an outsider among politiciansother announced candidates include former mayor sheila dixon state sen catherine pugh and city councilmen nick j mosby and carl stokes all democrats dan rodricks david warnock the latest democrat to enter the baltimore mayor’s race says the  primary is one of the most important elections in the city’s history he tells dan why he’s running and how he hopes to revive part of the scrapped red line and attract new businesses and jobs to the city thirtyfive david warnock the latest democrat to enter the baltimore mayor’s race says the  primary is one of the most important elections in the city’s history he tells dan why he’s running and how he hopes to revive part of the scrapped red line and attract new businesses and jobs to the city thirtyfive dan rodricks the democratic primary which has decided who becomes baltimores mayor in recent elections because of the partys to advantage over republicans in the number of registered voters is scheduled for april thats about one year after the unrest that gripped baltimore following the death of freddie gray who suffered a severe spinal cord injury in police custody warnock said his experience in the city has given him insight into the citys social ills he is the founder of a west baltimore charter school green street academy and the warnock foundation which funds efforts to improve education create jobs and other initiatives several candidates have filed to run for mayor in  or have announced their intentions to run including politicians a bar owner and a crime victim others have said they are considering entering the race nina therese kasniunas a political science associate professor at goucher college said warnock has low name recognition in baltimore but could increase that through advertising and campaigninghe is someone who has significant fundraising potential she said we know about his own deep pockets and his connections to the foundation world and the business worldshe also said race could play a role in the election because warnock a white man is running in a city where a majority of residents are africanamerican she noted the other highprofile candidates are all black which could play to warnocks advantageas most baltimoreans probably realize race matters even if we dont want to admit that she said you have several strong africanamerican candidates who could split the votecatalina byrd a baltimore political consultant who worked for attorney general douglas f ganslers gubernatorial campaign pointed out that former mayor martin omalley was able to win as a white man in a majority black city but she said omalley was helped by the endorsement of del howard pete rawlings — father of the current mayorwho would be his black ambassador byrd asked of warnock im not sure he has oneeven so rawlingsblakes departure from the field creates a void that everyone is running to try to fill she said its anybodys racewarnock said he believed voters would judge him by his qualifications not his skin colori would rather be looked at as the most qualified candidate he saidwarnock who has three children lived in baltimore in the s and s before moving to baltimore county he returned to downtown in december buying a  million condominium at the ritzcarlton residenceswhile the median income in baltimore is far below the national average warnock said he does not believe city voters will hold his personal wealth against himi think baltimore likes winners warnock said ive made a lot of money its time for me to make a lot of changesince  warnock has been a trustee and board chairman for the center for urban families which has helped thousands of exoffenders find jobs he also is chairman of the board of the probusiness greater baltimore committee warnock said he is stepping down from those positions to run for mayorkevin shird a baltimorebased youth advocate said he met warnock in  when he was feeding exoffenders recently released from prisoni said to myself why is this white guy in west baltimore feeding guys who are just out of prison and their families shird recalls i can definitely support him because ive seen him in actiona native of grand rapids mich warnock holds a bachelors degree from the university of delaware and a masters from the university of wisconsinwarnock says he drove to baltimore in  in a chevy pickup saddled with an array of student loans to work for t rowe price the baltimorebased money management companythe student loans are paid off but i still have the pickup truck he saidhe began mentoring a young man in east baltimore who ended up going to prison after a fatal shooting that experience shook him he said and he began exploring ways to have a bigger impact in the citywarnock helped found the green street academy in  and it now serves about  students many of them face challenges such as learning disabilities or impoverished upbringings the school — where students raise tilapia and chickens and grow vegetables in a greenhouse — is in high demand warnock saidwere one of the highestchosen middle schools in
