available letters and manuscripts to interpret classic poems examines what yeatss muses thought about their role in the creation of the poetry wb yeats and the muses joseph m hassett description wb yeats and the muses explores how nine fascinating women inspired much of wb yeatss poetry these women are particularly important because yeats perceived them in terms of beliefs about poetic inspiration akin to the greek notion that a great poet is inspired and possessed by the feminine voices of the muses influenced by the preraphaelite idea of woman as romantic and mysterious still the priestess of her shrine yeats found his muses in living women his extraordinarily long and fruitful poetic career was fuelled by passionate relationships with women to and about whom he wrote some of his most compelling poetry the book summarizes the different muse traditions that were congenial to yeats and shows how his perception of these women as muses underlies his poetry newly available letters and manuscripts are used to explore the creative process and interpret the poemsbecause yeats believed that lyric poetry is no rootless flower but the speech of a man exploring the relationship between poem and muse brings new coherence to the poetry illuminates the process of its creation and unlocks the second beauty to which yeats referred when he claimed that works of lyric genius when the circumstances of their origin is known gain a second a beauty passing as it were out of literature and becoming life as life emerges from the literature the muses are shown to be vibrant multifaceted personalities who shatter the idea of the muse as a passive stereotype and take their proper place as begetters of timeless poetry show more wb yeats and the muses joseph m

written and lectured extensively on yeats and other irish writers he lives and practices law in washington dc he and his wife carol melton have two children matthew and meredith wb yeats and the muses joseph m hassett reviews and awards a subtle suggestive study of inspiration based on penetrating readings of the poems and a close exploration of the texture of the poets biography it weaves life love and work together in a quintessentially yeatsian manner full of insight roy foster carroll professor of irish history hertford college oxford hassetts elegant book manages to give a summary and compelling account of the extraordinary sequence of distinguished women that yeats was inspired by throughout his life tracing fully all the eccentricities of those connections this is one of those books which leaves you marveling that the world left room for it to be written a delight from start to finish bernard odonoghue fellow in english wadham college oxford joseph hassetts wb yeats and the muses is a valuable addition to both the critical and biographical literature on yeats equipped with shrewdly evaluated often new biographical material his scrupulous engagement with the relevant poems provides convincing critical illuminations original slants and fresh ways of seeing since this work brings the classical as well as the romantic notion of the muse to modern discourse in a responsible way its hard to imagine the poems being read in the future without reference to hassetts extended insights into one of the most fruitful and provoking zones in all of yeatss work eamon grennan emeritus professor of english vassar college a brilliant and magisterial work of scholarshipa magnificent achievement what hassett demonstrates with clarity discretion and profound insight is that yeats is a consummate poet of love through his careful analysis of how the love and sexual passion of a great artist can infuse his creative life with inspiration and power hassett has made a major contribution not only to yeats studies but also to a more enlightened understanding of how ordinary human beings can live more productively engaged and fulfilled liveslike his subject hassetts book is a work of great intellectual and human significance that will stand the test of time professor james flannery irish america a deeply informed and fascinating bookan exceptionally lucid work of criticism michael dirda the weekly standard joseph hassetts beautifully written study follows a strong yet subtle argument through widely researched and scrupulously detailed individual chapters the yeats who emerges from it is clearly driven by the needs of his work as a poet to that end all others are subservient dublin review of books even to the sophisticated reader of yeats these explorations of yeatss personal life and the symbiosis of his muses confirm a second beauty and new coherence to yeatss poems these insights are the result of joseph m hassetts able scholarship
