defendantappellee calcasieu parish sales and use tax department louisiana department of revenue and taxation  the appellant in these consolidated cases boyd racing llc appeals a judgment of the trial court finding that delta downs race track  casino is not exempt from sales taxes for purchases made in connection with its expenditures related to its slot machine casino and hotel projectsstatement of the caseboyd racing operates delta downs race track  casino in vinton louisiana   in  the legislature passed the parimutual live racing facility economic redevelopment and gaming act the act  lars  et seq   this legislation allowed delta downs to operate a slot machine casino on the premises of the horse racing track with the approval of the voters of calcasieu parish   following voter approval delta downs opened its slot machine casino in february on november   boyd racing filed a lawsuit in calcasieu parish to recover sales and use taxes assessed by the calcasieu parish sales and use tax department calcasieu parish and paid by boyd racing under protest docket number    boyd racing claimed it was not required to pay sales and use taxes on the materials it purchased in conjunction with the renovation of its premises and construction and furnishing of the slots casino restaurants stores and hotel   calcasieu parish alleged these taxes were due on purchases made from january   through july     boyd racing argued that lars  excluded these purchases from the sales and use taxes imposed by the statelouisiana revised statutes  appears in chapter  of title  which governs horse racing in this state   it statesthe license fees commissions and taxes imposed in this part are in lieu of all other such licenses sales excise and occupational taxes to  the state or to any parish city town or other political subdivision thereofon december   the louisiana department of revenue and taxation ldr through its secretary cynthia bridges filed a suit in calcasieu parish to recover the general state sales tax for similar purchases made by boyd racing between july   and august   as well as interest and attorney fees docket number    on april   the trial court consolidated the two suitson december   boyd racing had filed suit against ldr in east baton rouge parish seeking to recover the general state sales tax and interest thereon that boyd racing paid under protest following an administrative determination that the taxes were in fact owed   ldr assessed these sales taxes for the period june   through june     on may   the case was transferred to calcasieu parish docket number    on june   the trial court consolidated this suit with the first twoboyd racing calcasieu parish and ldr all filed motions for summary judgment in the first two suits   the trial court heard the motions in open court on june     on june   the trial court found that lars  did not apply to the purchases made for the slot machine casino in open court and signed a judgment granting partial summary judgment to calcasieu parish and ldr on october  on september   after the trial court ruled on the motions for summary judgment and before the judgment was signed boyd racing filed a petition seeking to recover sales and use taxes interest and penalties assessed by calcasieu parish and paid under protest for the period between january   and august    docket number    this suit was consolidated with the other three   in its answer to the suit calcasieu parish sought attorney feeson december   the trial court held a hearing to determine if calcasieu parish could assess penalties in the fourth matter and whether an award of ten percent in attorney fees to calcasieu parish and ldr was excessive   the trial court found in favor of calcasieu parish and ldr on both issues   the trial court signed a judgment in conformity with its decision on january     the trial court also made clear that its ruling granting partial summary judgment applied to all four cases   the judgment included an allocation method for taxable and nontaxable transactions which was agreed upon by the partiesboyd racing now appeals the judgment of the trial courtassignments of errorthe appellant boyd racing asserts four assignments of error  the trial court failed to correctly interpret lars  by failing to conclude that the statute relieves delta downs racetrack and casino from paying state and parish usesales tax on all purchases the trial court erred by failing to determine the ten percent attorney fees on each consolidated case were excessive the trial court erred by failing to determine that the attorney fees imposed for legal work done on behalf of calcasieu parish were in contravention of rule a of the rules of professional conduct the trial court erred in failing to determine that the penalties assessed by calcasieu parish for the second audit were unreasonable and unlawfuldiscussionapplication of louisiana revised statute an appellate court reviews judgments granting a motion for summary judgment using a de novo standard of review  gray v am nat prop  cas co  la  sod    likewise the proper interpretation of a statute is a question of law which is reviewed on appeal de novo  cleco evangeline v louisiana tax comn  la  sod louisiana revised statutes  appears in chapter  part i of title  this part titled “horse racing” creates and empowers the state racing commission to govern horse racing and sets licensing and wagering requirements and rules   the statute also sets licensing fees payable to the state and the parish for those involved in the conduct of the races and for the holding of races a per person attendance tax and taxes on the wagering pools   louisiana revised statutes  statesthe license fees commissions and taxes imposed in this part are in lieu of all other such licenses sales excise and occupational taxes to the state or to any parish city town or other political subdivision thereof boyd racing argues that as the operator of a horse racing facility it is excused from paying state and parish sales and use taxes even on the construction and operation of a slot machine casino   calcasieu parish argues that the slot machine casino and hotel which were authorized under title  of the revised statutes are distinct from the horse racing facility and that boyd racing is required to pay the sales and use taxes for purchases madeby its own terms lars  creates a tradeoff for horse racing facilities   in exchange for the payment of the taxes and fees imposed for its horse racing activities the facilities do not have to pay state and local use taxes   in this respect we find the language of the statute determinative of the issue before us   the statute specifically says that the fees “imposed in this part are in lieu of” state and local sales and use taxes the statute allowing the horse racing facilities to operate slot machine casinos appears in title    in furtherance of the legislations stated goals of furthering the horse breeding industry the statute does provide for significant contributions to the purses for horse races and to horsemens groups from the net proceeds of the slot machine casino   but title  contains no tradeoff provision similar to lars    the act did not create any new burdens for boyd racing under title  chapter  part i as such we find that lars  does not apply to excuse boyd racing from paying sales and use taxes associated with the operation of a slot machine casino authorized under revised statutes title boyd racing argues that the same rationale for allowing the taxes paid under the horse racing laws to offset the sales and use taxes normally paid to state and local governments exists in the statute allowing a slot machine casino at a race track   boyd racing points out that the taxes imposed on its slot machine casino are significantly higher than those paid by other casinos in the state and that eighteen percent of its net proceeds from the casino are required to be paid in some way to the horse racing industry   these higher taxes it argues should be offset by excusing them from the payment of state and local sales and use taxes   we disagreefinally boyd racing argues that the horse racing facility and the slot machine casino at delta downs should not be considered two separate entities   instead it argues that the slot machine casino can only operate at delta downs because it is a horse racing facility   thus it argues lars  should be read to offset all purchases made by boyd racing whether they are racing related or not because without the racing facility there would be no nonracing purchases   again we disagree   we find that the act allowed delta downs to operate a slot machine casino  at the situs of its racetrack but enacted an entirely new set of regulations for operating the slot machine casino specifically with regard to the taxes and fees which had to be paid for the operation of the slot machines   in defining those taxes and fees the legislature did not create an offset similar to lars  and we will not create oneattorney fees boyd racing argues in its second and third assignments of error that the attorney fees awarded in this case are excessive   first it argues that the attorney fees are excessive because the final amount awarded does not take into account the fact that calcasieu parish and ldr had the same attorneys   the statute allowing the award of attorney fees to the state is lars  which statesthe collector is authorized to employ private counsel to assist in the collection of any taxes penalties or interest due under this subtitle or to represent him in any proceeding under this subtitle   if any taxes penalties or interest due under this title are referred to an attorney at law for collection an additional charge for attorney fees in the amount of ten per centum  of the taxes penalties and interest due shall be paid by the tax debtorsimilarly calcasieu parish tax ordinance section  statesdelinquent interest and penalties   if the amount of tax due by the dealer is not paid on or before the twentieth th day of the month next following the month for which the tax is due there shall be collected with said tax interest upon said unpaid amount at the rate of one and onequarter   percent per month or fractional part thereof   in addition there shall be collected a penalty equivalent to five  percent per month or fraction thereof not to exceed twentyfive  in aggregate of the tax due when such tax is not paid on or before the twentieth th day of the month next following the month for which the tax is due   both interest and penalty will be computed from the first day of the month next following the month for which the tax is due   in the event of suit attorneys fees will be charged the dealer at the rate of ten  percent of the aggregate of tax interest and penalty   all interest and penalties due for subsequent months will be assessed and due as of the first day of each succeeding month   the district attorney is authorized to employ private counsel to assist in the  collection of any sales and use taxes penalties or interest due under this ordinance or to represent him in any proceeding under this ordinancethe ten percent fee imposed by the court is statutory but the supreme court has held that the fee must be reasonable  city of baton rouge v stauffer chemical co  sod  la  “a trial court has much discretion in fixing attorney fees and its award will not be modified on appeal absent an abuse of discretion”  j ray mcdermott inc v morrison  p  laapp  cir   sod   writs denied   la  sod the trial court heard evidence about the contingency nature of the attorney fees awarded to the state and the amount of work done in the case   the trial court also heard evidence from an expert in commercial litigation regarding the reasonableness of the fee   this evidence supports the findings of the trial court   we find no abuse of discretion on the part of the trial court boyd racing also argues that calcasieu parish was charged on an hourly basis by its attorneys for a total of about  according to the transcript and if it is allowed to collect the full ten percent of the taxes interest and penalties about  calcasieu parish will receive a windfall   it also argues that calcasieu parish cannot share attorney fees with the attorney as such an arrangement would be a violation of rule a of the rules of professional conduct   we have found no abuse of discretion in the trial courts award of attorney fees and these arguments do not change our determination   the language of the statute allows calcasieu parish to recover attorney fees of ten percent of the taxes interest and penalties regardless of the actual compensation for the attorney as long as such an amount is reasonable  “liability for these attorneys fees does not depend upon whether the fees have been incurred in a collection case or in defense of a taxpayers suit for a refund”  lake  charles memorial hosp v parish of calcasieu  p  laapp  cir   sod   writ denied  la  sod    the attorney fee in such a case is awarded to the parish directly for the purpose of hiring an attorney   we will not comment on whether rule a is implicated in this case since this court lacks the authority to determine whether there has been a violation of the rules of professional conductpenalties finally boyd racing argues that it should not be required to pay penalties in lower court docket number  asserting a good faith defense   this court has repeatedly held that a good faith defense is not available in tax delinquency cases given the supreme courts decision in st john the baptist parish school board v marburypattillo construction co inc  la   sod     see mercury cellular tel co v calcasieu parish  laapp  cir   sod  writ denied  la  sod   lake charles memorial hosp  sod    we find that the narrow exception to this rule articulated in bp oil co v plaquemines parish government  la  sod  is inapplicable in the instant caseconclusionthe judgment of the trial court is affirmed   costs of this appeal are taxed against boyd racing llcaffirmedpickett judge
