founded in  in rochester as the haloid photographic company which originally manufactured photographic paper and equipment in  chester carlson a physicist working independently invented a process for printing images using an electrically charged photoconductorcoated metal plate and dry powder toner however it would take more than  years of refinement before the first automated machine to make copies was commercialized using a document feeder scanning light and a rotating drum joseph c wilson credited as the founder of xerox took over haloid from his father he saw the promise of carlsons invention and in  signed an agreement to develop it as a commercial product wilson remained as presidentceo of xerox until  and served as chairman until his death in  looking for a term to differentiate its new system haloid coined the term xerography from two greek roots meaning dry writing haloid subsequently changed its name to haloid xerox in  and then xerox corporation in  before releasing the  xerox tested the market by introducing a developed version of the prototype handoperated equipment known as the flatplate  the  was not actually a viable copier because of its speed of operation as a consequence it was sold as a platemaker to the offset lithography market perhaps most notably as a platemaker for the addressographmultigraph multilith  and related sheetfed offset printing presses it was little more than a high quality commercially available plate camera mounted as a horizontal rostrum camera complete with photoflood lighting and timer the glass filmplate had been replaced with a seleniumcoated aluminum plate clever electrics turned this into a quick developing and reusable substitute for film a skilled user could produce fast paper and metal printing plates of a higher quality than almost any other method having started as a supplier to the offset lithography duplicating industry xerox now set its sights on capturing some of offsets market share the  was followed by the first automatic xerographic printer the copyflo in  the copyflo was a large microfilm printer which could produce positive prints on roll paper from any type of microfilm negative following the copyflo the process was scaled down to produce the  microfilm printer at about half the size and weight this still sizable machine printed onto handfed cutsheet paper which was pulled through the process by one of two gripper bars a scaleddown version of this gripper feed system was to become the basis for the  desktop copier the xerox edit main article xerox  the company came to prominence in  with the introduction of the xerox  the most successful single product of all time the  the first plain paper photocopier was developed by carlson and john h dessauer it was so popular that by the end of  xerox had almost  million in revenue the product was sold by an innovative ad campaign showing that even monkeys could make copies at the touch of a button  simplicity would become the foundation of future xerox products and user interfaces revenues leaped to over  million by  sedit the company expanded substantially throughout the s making millionaires of some longsuffering investors who had nursed the company through the slow research and development phase of the product in  a xerography research facility called the wilson center for research and technology was opened in webster new york in  the company changed its name to xerox corporation xerox common stock xrx was listed on the new york stock exchange in  and on the chicago stock exchange

based on the  followed the  itself was gradually sped up to become the  and  the  was similarly developed into the  and  products and eventually also the  desktop microfiche printer xeroxs first foray into duplicating as distinct from copying was with the xerox  introduced in  the model number denoted the number of prints produced in an hour although not as fast as offset printing this machine introduced the industrys first automatic document feeder paper slitter and perforator and collator sorter this product was soon sped up by fifty percent to become the xerox  duplicator meanwhile a small lab team was borrowing  copiers and modifying them the lab was developing what it called long distance xerography ldx to connect two copiers using the public telephone network so that a document scanned on one machine would print out on the other the ldx system was introduced in  many years later this work came to fruition in the xerox telecopiers seminal to todays fax machines the fax operation in todays multifunction copiers is true to carlsons original vision for these devices in  c peter mccolough a longtime executive of haloid and xerox became xeroxs ceo the same year the

was followed by the  which did autoduplexing and then by the  which was which added variable zoom reduction and electronic lightnessdarkness controlcitation needed in a  super bowl commercial for the  xerox debuted an advertising campaign featuring brother dominic a monk who used the  system to save decades of manual copying before it was aired there was some concern that the commercial would be denounced as blasphemous however when the commercial was screened for the archbishop of new york he found it amusing and gave it his blessing dominic portrayed by jack eagle became the face of xerox into the scitation needed following these years of record profits in  xerox resolved an antitrust suit with the united states federal trade commission ftc which at the time was under the direction of frederic m scherer the xerox consent decree resulted in the forced licensing of the companys entire patent portfolio mainly to japanese competitors within four years of the consent decree xeroxs share of the us copier market dropped from nearly  to less than  in  xerox purchased western union international wui as the basis for its proposed xerox telecommunications network xten for localloop

scanners soon additional features such as network printing and faxing were added to many models known as multi function machines or just mfms which were able to be attached to computer networks xerox worked to turn its product into a service providing a complete document service to companies including supply maintenance configuration and user support in  xerox moved its european research center in inovallée near grenoble to reinforce this image in  the company introduced a corporate signature the document company above its main logo and introduced a red digital x the digital x symbolized the transition of documents between the paper and digital worlds in the mids la county superior court turned to xerox for help in replacing nearly  aging copiers throughout la county but xerox refused to consider leasing the county instead went to konica xerox was shut out of the county for the next two years in april  allaire was succeeded by richard thoman who had been brought in from ibm in  as

which became the  would negatively impact their copier business so the innovation sat in limbo until ibm launched the  laser printer in  the first commercial nonimpact printer was the xerox  introduced in  based on the  copier it had an optical character generator designed by optical engineer phil chen in  following ibms laser printer introduction the xerox  was introduced laser printing eventually became a multibilliondollar business for xerox in the late s xerox introduced the xerox  color slide system this product allowed the customer to create digital word and graphic mm slides many of the concepts used in todays photo shop programs were pioneered with this technology in  xerox announced the forward looking  laser printing system a much smaller version of their  but with revolutionary touch screen capabilities and multiple media input word processing disks ibm magcards etc and printer finishing options this product was allegedly never intended to make the commercial markets due to its development cost but rather to show the innovation of xerox it did take off with many customers but was soon replaced with its still smaller and lower cost  distributed electronic printer offering in  palo alto research centeredit main article xerox parc the xerox alto workstation was developed at xerox parc in  under company president c peter mccolough xerox opened the xerox palo alto research center known as xerox parc the facility developed many modern computing technologies such as the graphical user interface gui laser printing wysiwyg text editors and ethernet from these inventions xerox parc created the xerox alto in  a small minicomputer similar to a modern workstation or personal computer this machine can be considered the first true personal computer given its versatile combination of a cathoderaytype screen mousetype pointing device and a qwertytype alphanumeric keyboard but the alto was never commercially sold as xerox itself could not see the sales potential of it it was however installed in xeroxs own offices worldwide and those of the us government and military who could see the potential within these sites the individual workstations were connected together by xeroxs own unique lan the ethernet data was sent around this system of heavy yellow low loss coaxial cable using the packet data system in addition parc also developed one of the earliest internetworking protocol suites the parc universal packet pup in  steve jobs made a deal with xeroxs venture capital division he would let them invest  million in exchange for a look at the technology they were working on jobs and the others saw the commercial potential of the wimp window icon menu and pointing device system and redirected development of the apple lisa to incorporate these technologies jobs is quoted as saying they just had no idea what they had in  jobs invited several key parc researchers to join his company so that they could fully develop and implement their ideas in  xerox released a system similar to the alto the xerox star it was the first commercial system to incorporate technologies that have subsequently become commonplace in personal computers such as a bitmapped display windowbased gui mouse ethernet networking file servers print servers and email the xerox star and its successor the xerox daybreak despite their technological breakthroughs did not sell well due to its high price costing  per unit a typical xerox starbased office complete with network and printers would have cost  in the mids apple considered buying xerox however a deal was never reachedcitation needed apple instead bought rights to the alto gui and adapted it into to a more affordable personal computer aimed towards the business and education markets the apple macintosh

had certified xeroxs financial statements for the three years ended december   and the financials included some restatements on march   xerox restated its financials which reflected the reallocation of equipment sales revenue of more than  billion on april   the us securities and exchange commission filed a complaint against xerox the complaint alleged xerox deceived the public between  and  by employing several accounting maneuvers the most significant of which was a change in which xerox recorded revenue from copy machine leases – recognizing a sale when a lease contract was signed instead of recognizing revenue over the entire length of the contract at issue was when the revenue was recognized not the validity of the revenue xeroxs restatement only changed what year the revenue was recognized on december   xerox corporation reported that it had discovered an error in the calculation of its noncash interest expense related to a debt instrument and associated interest rate swap agreements resulted in aftertax understatement of interest expense of approximately  million to  million or less than  cent per share in each of the four quarters of  and for the first three quarters

the company received approval to settle the securities lawsuit in  on january   the sec filed a complaint against xeroxs auditors kpmg alleging four partners in the big five accounting firm permitted xerox to cook the books to fill a  billion gap in revenue and  billion gap in pretax earnings in april  kpmg settled with the sec by paying a us million fine meanwhile xerox paid a civil penalty of  million as part of the settlement kpmg neither admits nor denies wrongdoings during settlement with the securities and exchange commission xerox began to revamp itself once more as a symbol of this transformation the relative size of the word xerox was increased in proportion to the document company on the corporate signature and the latter was dropped altogether in september along with the digital x however the digital x and the document company were still used by fuji xerox until april character substitution bugedit in  german computer scientist david kriesel discovered an error in a xerox workcentre  copier the device would substitute number digits in scanned documents even when ocr was turned off for instance a cost table in a scanned document had an entry of  instead of the original sum of  after unsuccessfully trying to resolve this issue with xeroxs customer support he publicised his findings on his blog providing examples pages that lead to the bug occurrence it was confirmed that this bug was reproducible on a wide variety of xerox workcentre and other highend xerox copiers the source of the error was a bug in the jbig implementation which is an image compression standard that makes use of pattern matching to encode identical characters only once while this provides a high level of compression it is susceptible to errors in identifying similar characters a possible workaround was published by kriesel which involved setting the image quality from normal to higher or high shortly afterwards it was found that the same fix had been suggested in the printer manual which mentioned the occurrence of character substitutions in normal mode indicating that xerox was aware of the software error in xeroxs initial response to a growing interest by the media the error was described as occurring rarely and only when factory settings had been changed after kriesel provided evidence that the error was also occurring in all three image quality modes normal higher and high including the factory defaults xerox corrected their statement and released a software patch to eliminate the problem despite the problem being present in some instances also in higher quality mode xerox advises users that they can use this mode as an alternative to applying the patch trademarkedit the word xerox is used as a synonym for photocopy both as a noun and a verb in many areas for examplei xeroxed the document and placed it on your desk or please make a xeroxed copy of the articles and hand them out a week before the exam though both are common the company does not condone such uses of its trademark and is particularly concerned about the ongoing use of xerox as a verb as this places the trademark in danger of being declared a generic word by the courts the company is engaged in an ongoing advertising and media campaign to convince the public that xerox should not be used as a verb to this end the company has written to publications that have used xerox as a verb and has also purchased print advertisements declaring that you cannot xerox a document but you can copy it on a xerox brand copying machine xerox corporation continues to protect its trademark in most if not all trademark categoriescitation needed despite their efforts many dictionaries continue to include the use of xerox as a verb including the oxford english dictionary in  the intellectual property appellate board ipab of india declared xerox a nongeneric term after almost  years – of continued existence on the register without challenge and with proof of almost  years of use evident  but as of  most indians still use it as a synonym for photocopying see alsoedit connecticut portal new york portal companies portal notesedit  a b professional digital printing equipment

carlson a physicist working independently invented a process for printing images using an electrically charged photoconductorcoated metal plate and dry powder toner however it would take more than  years of refinement before the first automated machine to make copies was commercialized using a document feeder scanning light and a rotating drum joseph c wilson credited as the founder of xerox took over haloid from his father he saw the promise of carlsons invention and in  signed an agreement to develop it as a commercial product wilson remained as presidentceo of xerox until  and served as chairman until his death in  looking for a term to differentiate its new system haloid coined the term xerography from two greek roots meaning dry writing haloid subsequently changed its name to haloid xerox in  and then xerox corporation in  before releasing the  xerox tested the market by introducing a developed version of the prototype handoperated equipment known as the flatplate  the  was not actually a viable copier because of its speed of operation as a consequence it was sold as a platemaker to the offset lithography market perhaps most notably as a platemaker for the addressographmultigraph multilith  and related sheetfed offset printing presses it was little more than a high quality commercially available plate camera mounted as a horizontal rostrum camera complete with photoflood lighting and timer the glass filmplate had been replaced with a seleniumcoated aluminum plate clever electrics turned this into a quick developing and reusable substitute for film a skilled user could produce fast paper and metal printing plates of a higher quality than almost any other method having started as a supplier to the offset lithography duplicating industry xerox now set its sights on capturing some of offsets market share the  was followed by the first automatic xerographic printer the copyflo in  the copyflo was a large microfilm printer which could produce positive prints on roll paper from any type of microfilm negative following the copyflo the process was scaled down to produce the  microfilm printer at about half the size and weight this still sizable machine printed onto handfed cutsheet paper which was pulled through the process by one of two gripper bars a scaleddown version of this gripper feed system was to become the basis for the  desktop copier the xerox edit main article xerox  the company came to prominence in  with the introduction of the xerox  the most successful single product of all time the  the first plain paper photocopier was developed by carlson and john h dessauer it was so popular that by the end of  xerox had almost  million in revenue the product was sold by an innovative ad campaign showing that even monkeys could make copies at the touch of a button  simplicity would become the foundation of future xerox products and user interfaces revenues leaped to over  million by  sedit the company expanded substantially throughout the s making millionaires of some longsuffering investors who had nursed the company through the slow research and development phase of the product in  a xerography research

the  desktop microfiche printer xeroxs first foray into duplicating as distinct from copying was with the xerox  introduced in  the model number denoted the number of prints produced in an hour although not as fast as offset printing this machine introduced the industrys first automatic document feeder paper slitter and perforator and collator sorter this product was soon sped up by fifty percent to become the xerox  duplicator meanwhile a small lab team was borrowing  copiers and modifying them the lab was developing what it called long distance xerography ldx to connect two copiers using the public telephone network so that a document scanned on one machine would print out on the other the ldx system was introduced in  many years later this work came to fruition in the xerox telecopiers seminal to todays fax machines the fax operation in todays multifunction copiers is true to carlsons original vision for these devices in  c peter mccolough a longtime executive of haloid

under company president c peter mccolough xerox opened the xerox palo alto research center known as xerox parc the facility developed many modern computing technologies such as the graphical user interface gui laser printing wysiwyg text editors and ethernet from these inventions xerox parc created the xerox alto in  a small minicomputer similar to a modern workstation or personal computer this machine can be considered the first true personal computer given its versatile combination of a cathoderaytype screen mousetype pointing device and a qwertytype alphanumeric keyboard but the alto was never commercially sold as xerox itself could not see the sales potential of it it was however installed in xeroxs own offices worldwide and those of the us government and military who could see the potential within these sites the individual workstations were connected together by xeroxs own unique lan the ethernet data was sent around this system of heavy yellow low loss coaxial cable using the packet data system in addition parc also developed one of the earliest internetworking protocol suites the parc universal packet pup in  steve jobs made a deal with xeroxs venture capital division he would let them invest  million in exchange for a look at the technology they were working on jobs and the others saw the commercial potential of the wimp window icon menu and pointing device system and redirected development of the apple lisa to incorporate these technologies jobs is quoted as saying they just had no idea what they had in  jobs invited several key parc researchers to join his company so that they could fully develop and implement their ideas in  xerox released a system similar to the alto the xerox star it was the first commercial system to incorporate technologies that have subsequently become commonplace in personal computers such as a bitmapped display windowbased gui mouse ethernet networking file servers print servers and email the xerox star and its successor the xerox daybreak despite their technological breakthroughs did not sell well due to its high price costing  per unit a typical xerox starbased office complete with network and printers would have

irregularitiesedit on may   xerox corporation announced that its auditors kpmg llp had certified xeroxs financial statements for the three years ended december   and the financials included some restatements on march   xerox restated its financials which reflected the reallocation of equipment sales revenue of more than  billion on april   the us securities and exchange commission filed a complaint against xerox the complaint alleged xerox deceived the public between  and  by employing several accounting maneuvers the most significant of which was a change in which xerox recorded revenue from copy machine leases – recognizing a sale when a lease contract was signed instead of recognizing revenue over the entire length of the contract at issue was when the revenue was recognized not the validity of the revenue xeroxs restatement only changed what year the revenue was recognized on december   xerox corporation reported that it had discovered an error in the calculation of its noncash interest expense related to a debt instrument and associated interest rate swap agreements resulted in aftertax understatement of interest expense of approximately  million to  million or less than  cent per share in each of the four quarters of  and for the first three quarters of  in response to the secs complaint xerox corporation neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing it agreed to pay a  million penalty and to restate its financial results for the years  through  on june   six xerox senior executives accused of securities fraud settled their issues with

during settlement with the securities and exchange commission xerox began to revamp itself once more as a symbol of this transformation the relative size of the word xerox was increased in proportion to the document company on the corporate signature and the latter was dropped altogether in september along with the digital x however the digital x and the document company were still used by fuji xerox until april character substitution bugedit in  german computer scientist david kriesel discovered an error in a xerox workcentre  copier the device would substitute number digits in scanned documents even when ocr was turned off for instance a cost table in a scanned document had an entry of  instead of the original sum of  after unsuccessfully trying to resolve this issue with xeroxs customer support he publicised his findings on his blog providing examples pages that lead to the bug occurrence it was confirmed that this bug was reproducible on a wide variety of xerox workcentre and other highend xerox copiers the source of the error was a bug in the jbig implementation which is an image compression standard that makes use of pattern matching to encode identical characters only once while this provides a high level of compression it is susceptible to errors in identifying similar characters a possible workaround was published by kriesel which involved setting the image quality from normal to higher or high shortly afterwards it was found that the same fix had been suggested in the printer manual which mentioned the occurrence of character substitutions in normal mode indicating that xerox was aware of the software error in xeroxs initial response to a growing interest by the media the error was described as occurring rarely and only when factory settings had been changed after kriesel provided evidence that the error was also occurring in all three image quality modes normal higher and high including the factory defaults xerox corrected their statement and released a software patch to eliminate the problem despite the problem being present in some instances also in higher quality mode xerox advises users that they can use this mode as an alternative to applying the patch trademarkedit the word xerox is used as a synonym for photocopy both as a noun and a verb in many areas for examplei xeroxed the document and placed it on your desk or please make a xeroxed copy of the articles and hand them out a week before the exam though both are common the company does not condone such uses of its trademark and is particularly concerned about the ongoing use of xerox as a verb as this places the trademark in danger of being declared a generic word by the courts the company is engaged in an ongoing advertising and media campaign to convince the public that xerox should not be used as a verb to this end the company has written to publications that have used xerox as a verb and has also purchased print advertisements declaring that you cannot xerox a document but you can copy it on a xerox brand copying machine xerox corporation continues to protect its trademark in most if not all trademark categoriescitation needed despite their efforts many dictionaries continue to include the use of xerox as a verb including the oxford english dictionary in  the intellectual property appellate board ipab of india declared xerox a nongeneric term after almost  years – of continued existence on the register without challenge and with proof of almost  years of use evident  but as of  most indians still use it as a synonym for photocopying see

company which originally manufactured photographic paper and equipment in  chester carlson a physicist working independently invented a process for printing images using an electrically charged photoconductorcoated metal plate and dry powder toner however it would take more than  years of refinement before the first automated machine to make copies was commercialized using a document feeder scanning light and a rotating drum joseph c wilson credited as the founder of xerox took over haloid from his father he saw the promise of carlsons invention and in  signed an agreement to develop it as a commercial product wilson remained as presidentceo of xerox until  and served as chairman until his death in  looking for a term to differentiate its new system haloid coined the term xerography from two greek roots meaning dry writing haloid subsequently changed its name to haloid xerox in  and then xerox corporation in  before releasing the  xerox tested the market by introducing a developed version of the prototype handoperated equipment known as the flatplate  the  was not actually a viable copier because of its speed of operation as a consequence it was sold as a platemaker to the offset lithography market perhaps most notably as a platemaker for the addressographmultigraph multilith  and related sheetfed offset printing presses it was little more than a high quality commercially available plate camera mounted as a horizontal rostrum camera complete with photoflood lighting and timer the glass filmplate had been replaced with a seleniumcoated aluminum plate clever electrics turned this into a quick developing and reusable substitute for film a skilled user could produce fast paper and metal printing plates of a higher quality than almost any other method having started as a supplier to the offset lithography duplicating industry xerox now set its sights on capturing some of offsets market share the  was followed by the first automatic xerographic printer the copyflo in  the copyflo was a large microfilm printer which could produce positive prints on roll paper from any type of microfilm negative following the copyflo the process was scaled down to produce the  microfilm printer at about half the size and weight this still sizable machine printed onto handfed cutsheet paper which was pulled through the process by one of two gripper bars a scaleddown version of this gripper feed system was to become the basis for the  desktop copier the xerox edit main article xerox  the company came to prominence in  with the introduction of the xerox  the most successful single product of all time the  the first plain paper photocopier was developed by carlson and john h dessauer it was so popular that by the end of  xerox had almost  million in revenue the product was sold by an innovative ad campaign showing that even monkeys could make copies at the touch of a button  simplicity would become the foundation of future xerox products and user interfaces revenues leaped to over  million by  sedit the company expanded substantially throughout the s making millionaires of some longsuffering investors who had nursed the company through the slow research

model number denoted the number of prints produced in an hour although not as fast as offset printing this machine introduced the industrys first automatic document feeder paper slitter and perforator and collator sorter this product was soon sped up by fifty percent to become the xerox  duplicator meanwhile a small lab team was borrowing  copiers and modifying them the lab was developing what it called long distance xerography ldx to connect two copiers using the public telephone network so that a document scanned on one machine would print out on the other the ldx system was introduced in  many years later this work came to fruition in the xerox telecopiers seminal to todays fax machines the fax operation in todays multifunction copiers is true to carlsons original vision for these devices in  c peter mccolough a longtime executive of haloid and xerox became xeroxs ceo the same year the company consolidated its headquarters at xerox square in downtown rochester new york with its

developed at xerox parc in  under company president c peter mccolough xerox opened the xerox palo alto research center known as xerox parc the facility developed many modern computing technologies such as the graphical user interface gui laser printing wysiwyg text editors and ethernet from these inventions xerox parc created the xerox alto in  a small minicomputer similar to a modern workstation or personal computer this machine can be considered the first true personal computer given its versatile combination of a cathoderaytype screen mousetype pointing device and a qwertytype alphanumeric keyboard but the alto was never commercially sold as xerox itself could not see the sales potential of it it was however installed in xeroxs own offices worldwide and those of the us government and military who could see the potential within these sites the individual workstations were connected together by xeroxs own unique lan the ethernet data was sent around this system of heavy yellow low loss coaxial cable using the packet data system in addition parc also developed one of the earliest internetworking protocol suites the parc universal packet pup in  steve jobs made a deal with xeroxs venture capital division he would let them invest  million in exchange for a look at the technology they were working on jobs and the others saw the commercial potential of the wimp window icon menu and pointing device system and redirected development of the apple lisa to incorporate these technologies jobs is quoted as saying they just had no idea what they had in  jobs invited several key parc researchers to join his company so that they could fully develop and implement their ideas in  xerox released a system similar to the alto the xerox star it was the first commercial system to incorporate technologies that have subsequently become commonplace in personal computers such as a bitmapped display windowbased gui mouse ethernet networking file servers print servers and email the xerox star and its successor the xerox daybreak despite their technological breakthroughs did not sell well due to its high price costing  per unit a typical xerox starbased office complete with network and printers would have cost  in the mids apple considered buying xerox however a deal was never reachedcitation needed apple instead bought rights to the alto gui and adapted it into to a more affordable personal computer aimed towards the business and education markets the apple macintosh was released in  and was the first personal computer to popularize the gui and mouse among the

included some restatements on march   xerox restated its financials which reflected the reallocation of equipment sales revenue of more than  billion on april   the us securities and exchange commission filed a complaint against xerox the complaint alleged xerox deceived the public between  and  by employing several accounting maneuvers the most significant of which was a change in which xerox recorded revenue from copy machine leases – recognizing a sale when a lease contract was signed instead of recognizing revenue over the entire length of the contract at issue was when the revenue was recognized not the validity of the revenue xeroxs restatement only changed what year the revenue was recognized on december   xerox corporation reported that it had discovered an error in the calculation of its noncash interest expense related to a debt instrument and associated interest rate swap agreements resulted in aftertax understatement of interest expense of approximately  million to  million or less than  cent per share in each of the four quarters of  and for the first three quarters of  in response to the secs complaint xerox corporation neither admitted nor denied

during settlement with the securities and exchange commission xerox began to revamp itself once more as a symbol of this transformation the relative size of the word xerox was increased in proportion to the document company on the corporate signature and the latter was dropped altogether in september along with the digital x however the digital x and the document company were still used by fuji xerox until april character substitution bugedit in  german computer scientist david kriesel discovered an error in a xerox workcentre  copier the device would substitute number digits in scanned documents even when ocr was turned off for instance a cost table in a scanned document had an entry of  instead of the original sum of  after unsuccessfully trying to resolve this issue with xeroxs customer support he publicised his findings on his blog providing examples pages that lead to the bug occurrence it was confirmed that this bug was reproducible on a wide variety of xerox workcentre and other highend xerox copiers the source of the error was a bug in the jbig implementation which is an image compression standard that makes use of pattern matching to encode identical characters only once while this provides a high level of compression it is susceptible to errors in identifying similar characters a possible workaround was published by kriesel which involved setting the image quality from normal to higher or high shortly afterwards it was found that the same fix had been suggested in the printer manual which mentioned the occurrence of character substitutions in normal mode indicating that xerox was aware of the software error in xeroxs initial response to a growing interest by the media the error was described as occurring rarely and only when factory settings had been changed after kriesel provided evidence that the error was also occurring in all three image quality modes normal higher and high including the factory defaults xerox corrected their statement and released a software patch to eliminate the problem despite the problem being present in some instances also in higher quality mode xerox advises users that they can use this mode as an alternative to applying the patch trademarkedit the word xerox is used as a synonym for photocopy both as a noun and a verb in many areas for examplei xeroxed the document and placed it on your desk or please make a xeroxed copy of the articles and hand them out a week before the exam though both are common the company does not condone such uses of its trademark and is particularly concerned about the ongoing use of xerox as a verb as this places the trademark in danger of being declared a generic word by the courts the company is engaged in an ongoing advertising and media campaign to convince the

company which originally manufactured photographic paper and equipment in  chester carlson a physicist working independently invented a process for printing images using an electrically charged photoconductorcoated metal plate and dry powder toner however it would take more than  years of refinement before the first automated machine to make copies was commercialized using a document feeder scanning light and a rotating drum joseph c wilson credited as the founder of xerox took over haloid from his father he saw the promise of carlsons invention and in  signed an agreement to develop it as a commercial product wilson remained as presidentceo of xerox until  and served as chairman until his death in  looking for a term to differentiate its new system haloid coined the term xerography from two greek roots meaning dry writing haloid subsequently changed its name to haloid xerox in  and then xerox corporation in  before releasing the  xerox tested the market by introducing a developed version of the prototype handoperated equipment known as the flatplate  the  was not actually a viable copier because of its speed of operation as a consequence it was sold as a platemaker to the offset lithography market perhaps most notably as a platemaker for the addressographmultigraph multilith  and related sheetfed offset printing presses it was little more than a high quality commercially available plate camera mounted as a horizontal rostrum camera complete with photoflood lighting and timer the glass filmplate had been replaced with a seleniumcoated aluminum plate clever electrics turned this into a quick developing and reusable substitute for film a skilled user could produce fast paper and metal printing plates of a higher quality than almost any other method having started as a supplier to the offset lithography duplicating industry xerox now set its sights on capturing some of offsets market share the  was followed by the first automatic xerographic printer the copyflo in  the copyflo was a large microfilm printer which could produce positive prints on roll paper from any type of microfilm negative following the copyflo the process was scaled down to produce the  microfilm printer at about half the size and weight this still sizable machine printed onto handfed cutsheet paper which was pulled through the process by one of two gripper bars a scaleddown version of this gripper feed system was to become the basis for the  desktop copier the xerox edit main article xerox  the company came to prominence in  with the introduction of the xerox  the most

and collator sorter this product was soon sped up by fifty percent to become the xerox  duplicator meanwhile a small lab team was borrowing  copiers and modifying them the lab was developing what it called long distance xerography ldx to connect two copiers using the public telephone network so that a document scanned on one machine would print out on the other the ldx system was introduced in

developed at xerox parc in  under company president c peter mccolough xerox opened the xerox palo alto research center known as xerox parc the facility developed many modern computing technologies such as the graphical user interface gui laser printing wysiwyg text editors and ethernet from these inventions xerox parc created the xerox alto in  a small minicomputer similar to a modern workstation or personal computer this machine can be considered the first true personal computer given its versatile combination of a cathoderaytype screen mousetype pointing device and a qwertytype alphanumeric keyboard but the alto was never commercially sold as xerox itself could not see the sales potential of it it was however installed in xeroxs own offices worldwide and those of the us government and military who could see the potential within these sites the individual workstations were connected together by xeroxs own unique lan the ethernet data was sent around this system of heavy yellow low loss coaxial cable using the packet data system in addition parc also developed one of the earliest internetworking protocol suites the parc universal packet pup in  steve jobs made a deal with xeroxs venture capital division he would let them invest  million in exchange for a look at the technology they were working on jobs and the others saw the commercial potential of the wimp window icon menu and pointing device system and redirected development of the apple lisa to incorporate these technologies jobs is quoted as saying they just had no idea what they had in  jobs invited several key parc researchers to join his company so that they could fully develop and implement their ideas in  xerox released a system similar to the alto the xerox star it was the first commercial system to incorporate technologies that have subsequently become commonplace in personal computers such as a bitmapped display windowbased gui mouse ethernet networking file servers print servers and email the xerox star and its successor the xerox daybreak despite their technological breakthroughs did not sell well due to its high price costing  per unit a typical xerox starbased office complete with network and printers would have cost  in the mids apple considered buying xerox however a deal was never reachedcitation needed apple instead bought rights to the alto gui and adapted it into to a more affordable personal computer aimed towards the business and education markets the apple macintosh was released in  and was the first personal computer to popularize the gui and mouse among the

and other highend xerox copiers the source of the error was a bug in the jbig implementation which is an image compression standard that makes use of pattern matching to encode identical characters only once while this provides a high level of compression it is susceptible to errors in identifying similar characters a possible workaround was published by kriesel which involved setting the image quality from normal to higher or high shortly afterwards it was found that the same fix had been suggested in the printer manual which mentioned the occurrence of character substitutions in normal mode indicating that xerox was aware of the software error in xeroxs initial response to a growing interest by the media the error was described as occurring rarely and only when factory settings had been changed after kriesel provided evidence that the error was also occurring in all three image quality modes normal higher and high including the factory defaults xerox corrected their statement and released a software patch to eliminate the problem despite the problem being present in some instances also in higher quality mode xerox advises users that they can use this mode as an alternative to applying the patch trademarkedit the word xerox is used as a synonym for photocopy both as a noun and a verb in many areas for examplei xeroxed the document and placed it on your desk or please make a xeroxed copy of the articles and hand them out a week before the exam though both are common the company does not condone such uses of its trademark and is particularly concerned about the ongoing use of xerox as a verb as this places the trademark in danger of being declared a generic word by the courts the company is engaged in an ongoing advertising and media campaign to convince the public that xerox should not be used as a verb to this end the company has written to publications that have used xerox as a verb and has also purchased print advertisements declaring that you cannot

scanning light and a rotating drum joseph c wilson credited as the founder of xerox took over haloid from his father he saw the promise of carlsons invention and in  signed an agreement to develop it as a commercial product wilson remained as presidentceo of xerox until  and served as chairman until his death in  looking for a term to differentiate its new system haloid coined the term xerography from two greek roots meaning dry writing haloid subsequently changed its name to haloid xerox in  and then xerox corporation in  before releasing the  xerox tested the market by introducing a developed version of the prototype handoperated equipment known as the flatplate  the  was not actually a viable copier because of its speed of operation as a consequence it was sold as a platemaker to the offset lithography market perhaps most notably as a platemaker for the addressographmultigraph multilith  and related sheetfed offset printing presses it was little more than a high quality commercially available plate camera mounted as a horizontal rostrum camera complete with photoflood lighting and timer the glass filmplate had been replaced with a seleniumcoated aluminum plate clever electrics turned this into a quick developing and reusable substitute for film a skilled user could produce fast paper and metal printing plates of a higher quality than almost any other method having started as a supplier to the offset lithography duplicating industry xerox now set its sights on capturing some of offsets market share the  was followed by the first automatic xerographic printer the copyflo in  the copyflo was a large microfilm printer which could produce positive prints on roll paper from any type of microfilm negative following the copyflo the process was scaled down to produce

called long distance xerography ldx to connect two copiers using the public telephone network so that a document scanned on one machine would print out on the other the ldx system was introduced in

developed at xerox parc in  under company president c peter mccolough xerox opened the xerox palo alto research center known as xerox parc the facility developed many modern computing technologies such as the graphical user interface gui laser printing wysiwyg text editors and ethernet from these inventions xerox parc created the xerox alto in  a small minicomputer similar to a modern workstation or personal computer this machine can be considered the first true personal computer given its versatile combination of a cathoderaytype screen mousetype pointing device and a qwertytype alphanumeric keyboard but the alto was never commercially sold as xerox itself could not see the sales potential of it it was however installed in xeroxs own offices worldwide and those of the us government and military who could see the potential within these sites the individual workstations were connected together by xeroxs own unique lan the ethernet data was sent around this system of heavy yellow low loss coaxial cable using the packet data system in addition parc also developed one of the earliest internetworking protocol suites the parc universal packet pup in  steve jobs made a deal with xeroxs venture capital division he would let them invest  million in exchange for a look at the technology they were working on jobs and the others saw the commercial potential of the wimp

several key parc researchers to join his company so that they could fully develop and implement their ideas in  xerox released a system similar to the alto the xerox star it was the first commercial system to incorporate technologies that have subsequently become commonplace in personal computers such as a bitmapped display windowbased gui mouse ethernet networking file servers print servers and

during settlement with the securities and exchange commission xerox began to revamp itself once more as a symbol of this transformation the relative size of the word xerox was increased in proportion to the document company on the corporate signature and the latter was dropped altogether in september along with the digital x however the digital x and the document company were still used by fuji xerox until april character substitution bugedit in  german computer scientist david kriesel discovered an error in a xerox workcentre  copier the device would substitute number digits in scanned documents even when ocr was turned off for instance a cost table in a scanned document had an entry of  instead of the original sum of  after unsuccessfully trying to resolve this issue with xeroxs customer support he publicised his findings on his blog providing examples pages that lead to the bug occurrence it was confirmed that this bug was reproducible on a wide variety of xerox workcentre and other highend xerox copiers the source of the error was a bug in the jbig implementation which is an image compression standard that makes use of pattern matching to encode identical characters only once while this provides a high level of compression it is susceptible to errors in identifying similar characters a possible workaround was published by kriesel which involved setting the image quality from normal to higher or high shortly afterwards it was found that the same fix had been suggested in the printer manual which mentioned the occurrence of character substitutions in normal mode indicating that xerox was aware of the software error in xeroxs initial response to a growing interest by the media the error was described as occurring rarely and only when factory settings had been changed after kriesel provided evidence that the error was also occurring in all three image quality modes normal higher and high including the factory defaults xerox corrected their statement and released a software patch to eliminate the problem despite the problem being present in some instances also in higher quality mode xerox advises users that they can use this mode as an alternative to applying the patch trademarkedit the word xerox is used as a synonym for photocopy both as a noun and a verb in many areas for examplei xeroxed the document and placed it on your desk or please make a xeroxed copy of the articles and hand them out a week before the exam though both are common the company does not condone such uses of its trademark and is particularly concerned about the ongoing use of xerox as a verb as this places the trademark in danger of being declared a generic word by the courts the company is engaged in an ongoing advertising and media campaign to convince the public that xerox should not be used as a verb to this end the company has written to publications that have used xerox as a verb and has also purchased print advertisements declaring that you cannot xerox a document but you can copy it on a xerox brand copying machine xerox corporation continues to protect its trademark in most if not all trademark categoriescitation needed despite their efforts many dictionaries continue to include the use of xerox as a verb including the oxford english dictionary in  the intellectual property appellate board ipab of india declared xerox a nongeneric term after almost  years – of continued existence on the register without challenge and with proof of almost  years of use evident  but as of  most indians still use it as a synonym for photocopying see

palo alto research center known as xerox parc the facility developed many modern computing technologies such as the graphical user interface gui laser printing wysiwyg text editors and ethernet from these inventions xerox parc created the xerox alto in  a small minicomputer similar to a modern workstation or personal computer this machine can be considered the first true personal computer given its versatile combination of a cathoderaytype screen mousetype pointing device and a qwertytype alphanumeric keyboard but the alto was never commercially sold as xerox itself could not see the sales potential of it it was however installed in xeroxs own offices worldwide and those of the us government and military who could see the potential within these sites the individual workstations were connected together by xeroxs own unique lan the ethernet data was sent around this system of heavy yellow low loss coaxial cable using the packet data system in addition parc also developed one of the earliest internetworking protocol suites the parc universal packet pup in  steve jobs made a deal with xeroxs venture capital division he would let them invest  million in exchange for a look at the

ideas in  xerox released a system similar to the alto the xerox star it was the first commercial system to incorporate technologies that have subsequently become commonplace in personal computers such as a bitmapped display windowbased gui mouse ethernet networking file servers print servers and email the xerox star and its successor the xerox daybreak despite their technological breakthroughs did not sell well due to its high price costing  per unit a typical xerox starbased office complete with network and printers would have cost  in the mids apple considered buying xerox however a deal was

of equipment sales revenue of more than  billion on april   the us securities and exchange commission filed a complaint against xerox the complaint alleged xerox deceived the public between  and  by employing several accounting maneuvers the most significant of which was a change in which xerox recorded revenue from copy machine leases – recognizing a sale when a lease contract was signed instead of recognizing revenue over the entire length of the contract at issue was when the revenue was recognized not the validity of the revenue xeroxs restatement only changed what year the revenue was recognized on december   xerox corporation reported that it had discovered an error in the calculation of its noncash interest expense related to a debt instrument and associated interest rate swap agreements resulted in aftertax understatement of interest expense of approximately  million to  million or less than  cent per share in each of the four quarters of  and for the first three quarters

transformation the relative size of the word xerox was increased in proportion to the document company on the corporate signature and the latter was dropped altogether in september along with the digital x however the digital x and the document company were still used by fuji xerox until april character substitution bugedit in  german computer scientist david kriesel discovered an error in a xerox workcentre  copier the device would substitute number digits in scanned documents even when ocr was turned off for instance a cost table in a scanned document had an entry of  instead of the original sum of  after unsuccessfully trying to resolve this issue with xeroxs customer support he publicised his findings on his blog providing examples pages that lead to the bug occurrence it was confirmed that this bug was reproducible on a wide variety of xerox workcentre and other highend xerox copiers the source of the error was a bug in the jbig implementation which is an image compression standard that makes use of pattern matching to encode identical characters only once while this provides a high level of compression it is susceptible to errors in identifying similar characters a possible workaround was published by kriesel which involved setting the image quality from normal to higher or high shortly afterwards it was found that the same fix had been suggested in the printer manual which mentioned the occurrence of character substitutions in normal mode indicating that xerox was aware of the software error in xeroxs initial response to a growing interest by the media the error was described as occurring rarely and only when factory settings had been changed after kriesel provided evidence that the error was also occurring in all three image quality modes normal higher and high including the factory defaults xerox corrected their statement and released a software patch to eliminate the problem despite the problem being present in some instances also in higher quality mode xerox advises users that they can use this mode as an alternative to applying the patch trademarkedit the word xerox is used as a synonym for photocopy both as a noun and a verb in many areas for examplei xeroxed the document and placed it on your desk or please make a xeroxed copy of the articles and hand them out a week before the exam though both are common the company does not condone such uses of its trademark and is particularly concerned about the ongoing use of xerox as a verb as this places the trademark in danger of being declared a generic word by the courts the company is engaged in an ongoing advertising and media campaign to convince the public that xerox should not be used as a verb to this end the company has written to publications that have used xerox as a verb and has also purchased print advertisements declaring that you cannot xerox a document but you can copy it on a xerox brand copying machine xerox corporation continues to protect its trademark in most if not all trademark categoriescitation needed despite their efforts many dictionaries continue to include the use of xerox as a verb including the oxford english dictionary in  the intellectual property appellate board ipab of india declared xerox a nongeneric term after almost  years – of continued existence on the register without challenge and with proof of almost  years of

paper and equipment in  chester carlson a physicist working independently invented a process for printing images using an electrically charged photoconductorcoated metal plate and dry powder toner however it would take more than  years of refinement before the first automated machine to make copies was commercialized using a document feeder scanning light and a rotating drum joseph c wilson credited as the founder of xerox took over haloid from his father he saw the promise of carlsons invention and in  signed an agreement to develop it as a commercial product wilson remained as presidentceo of xerox until  and served as chairman until his death in  looking for a term to differentiate its new system haloid coined the term xerography from two greek roots meaning dry writing haloid subsequently changed its name to haloid xerox in  and then xerox corporation in  before releasing the  xerox tested the market by introducing a developed version of the prototype handoperated equipment known as the flatplate  the  was not actually a viable copier because of its speed of operation as a consequence it was sold as a platemaker to the offset lithography market perhaps most notably as a platemaker for the addressographmultigraph multilith  and related sheetfed offset printing presses it was little more than a high quality commercially available plate camera mounted as a horizontal rostrum camera complete with photoflood lighting and timer the glass filmplate had been replaced with a seleniumcoated aluminum plate clever electrics turned this into a quick developing and reusable substitute for film a skilled user could produce fast paper and metal printing plates of a higher quality than almost any other method having started as a supplier to the offset lithography duplicating industry xerox now set its sights on capturing some of offsets market share the  was followed by the first automatic xerographic printer the copyflo in  the copyflo was a large microfilm printer which could produce positive prints on roll paper from any type of microfilm negative following the copyflo the process was scaled down to produce the  microfilm printer at about half the size and weight this still sizable machine printed onto handfed cutsheet paper which was pulled through the process by one of two gripper bars a scaleddown version of this gripper feed system was to become the basis for the  desktop copier the xerox edit main article xerox  the company came to prominence in  with the introduction of the xerox  the most successful single product of all time the  the first plain paper photocopier was developed by carlson and john h dessauer it was so popular that by the end of  xerox had almost  million in revenue the product was sold by an innovative ad campaign showing that even monkeys could make copies at the touch of a button  simplicity would become the foundation of future xerox products and user interfaces revenues leaped to over  million by  sedit the company expanded substantially throughout the s making millionaires of some longsuffering investors who had nursed the company through the slow research and development phase of the product

products and eventually also the  desktop microfiche printer xeroxs first foray into duplicating as distinct from copying was with the xerox  introduced in  the model number denoted the number of prints produced in an hour although not as fast as offset printing this machine introduced the industrys first automatic document feeder paper slitter and perforator and collator sorter this product was soon sped up by fifty percent to become the xerox  duplicator meanwhile a small lab team was borrowing  copiers and modifying them the lab was developing what it called long distance xerography ldx to connect two copiers using the public telephone network so that a document scanned on one machine would print out on the other the ldx system was introduced in  many years later this work came to fruition in the xerox telecopiers seminal to todays fax machines the fax operation in todays multifunction copiers is true to carlsons original vision for these devices in  c peter mccolough a longtime executive of haloid and xerox became xeroxs ceo the same year the company consolidated its headquarters at xerox square in downtown rochester new york with its story xerox tower xerox

lightnessdarkness controlcitation needed in a  super bowl commercial for the  xerox debuted an advertising campaign featuring brother dominic a monk who used the  system to save decades of manual copying before it was aired there was some concern that the commercial would be denounced as blasphemous however when the commercial was screened for the archbishop of new york he found it amusing and gave it his blessing dominic portrayed by jack eagle became the face of xerox into the scitation needed following these years of record profits in  xerox resolved an antitrust suit with the united states federal trade commission ftc which at the time was under the direction of frederic m scherer the xerox consent decree resulted in the forced licensing of the companys entire patent portfolio

supply maintenance configuration and user support in  xerox moved its european research center in inovallée near grenoble to reinforce this image in  the company introduced a corporate signature the document company above its main logo and introduced a red digital x the digital x symbolized the transition of documents between the paper and digital worlds in the mids la county superior court turned to xerox for help in replacing nearly  aging copiers throughout la county but xerox refused to consider leasing the county instead went to konica xerox was shut out of the county for the next

modifying a xerox  copier xerox management was afraid the product version of starkweathers invention which became the  would negatively impact their copier business so the innovation sat in limbo until ibm launched the  laser printer in  the first commercial nonimpact printer was the xerox  introduced in  based on the  copier it had an optical character generator designed by optical engineer phil chen in  following ibms laser printer introduction the xerox  was introduced laser printing eventually became a multibilliondollar business for xerox in the late s xerox introduced the xerox  color slide system this product allowed the customer to create digital word and graphic mm slides many of the concepts used in todays photo shop programs were pioneered with this technology in  xerox announced the forward looking  laser printing system a much smaller version of their  but with revolutionary touch screen capabilities and multiple media input word processing disks ibm magcards etc and printer finishing options this product was allegedly never intended to make the commercial markets due to its development cost but rather to show the innovation of xerox it did take off with many customers but was soon replaced with its still smaller and lower cost  distributed electronic printer offering in  palo alto research centeredit main article xerox parc the xerox alto workstation was developed at xerox parc in  under company president c peter mccolough xerox opened the xerox palo alto research center known as xerox parc the facility developed many modern computing technologies such as the graphical user interface gui laser printing wysiwyg text editors and ethernet from these inventions xerox parc created the xerox alto in  a small minicomputer similar to a modern workstation or personal computer this machine can be considered the first true personal computer given its versatile combination of a cathoderaytype screen mousetype pointing device and a qwertytype alphanumeric keyboard but the alto was never commercially sold as xerox itself could not see the sales potential of it it was however installed in xeroxs own offices worldwide and those of the us government and military who could see the potential within these sites the individual workstations were connected together by xeroxs own unique lan the ethernet data was sent around this system of heavy yellow low loss coaxial cable using the packet data system in addition parc also developed one of the earliest internetworking protocol suites the parc universal packet pup in  steve jobs made a deal with xeroxs venture capital division he would let them invest  million in exchange for a look at the technology they were working on jobs and the others saw the commercial potential of the wimp window icon menu and pointing device system and redirected development of the apple lisa to incorporate these technologies jobs is quoted as saying they just had no idea what they had in  jobs invited several key parc researchers to join his company so that they could fully develop and implement their ideas in  xerox released a system similar to the alto the xerox star it was the first commercial system to incorporate technologies that have subsequently become commonplace in personal computers such as a bitmapped display windowbased gui mouse ethernet networking file servers print servers and email the xerox star and its successor the xerox daybreak despite their technological breakthroughs did not sell well due to its high price costing  per unit a typical xerox starbased office complete with network and printers would have cost  in the mids apple considered buying xerox however a deal was never reachedcitation needed apple instead bought rights to the alto gui and adapted it into to a more affordable personal computer aimed towards the business and education markets the apple macintosh was released in  and was the first personal computer to popularize the gui and mouse among the

included some restatements on march   xerox restated its financials which reflected the reallocation of equipment sales revenue of more than  billion on april   the us securities and exchange commission filed a complaint against xerox the complaint alleged xerox deceived the public between  and  by employing several accounting maneuvers the most significant of which was a change in which xerox recorded revenue from copy machine leases – recognizing a sale when a lease contract was signed instead of recognizing revenue over the entire length of the contract at issue was when the revenue was recognized not the validity of the revenue xeroxs restatement only changed what year the revenue was recognized on december   xerox corporation reported that it had discovered an error in the calculation of its noncash interest expense related to a debt instrument and associated interest rate swap agreements resulted in aftertax understatement of interest expense of approximately  million to  million or less than  cent per share in each of the four quarters of  and for the first three quarters of  in response to the secs complaint xerox corporation neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing it agreed to pay a  million penalty and to restate its financial results for the years  through  on june   six xerox senior executives accused of securities fraud settled their issues with

during settlement with the securities and exchange commission xerox began to revamp itself once more as a symbol of this transformation the relative size of the word xerox was increased in proportion to the document company on the corporate signature and the latter was dropped altogether in september along with the digital x however the digital x and the document company were still used by fuji xerox until april character substitution bugedit in  german computer scientist david kriesel discovered an error in a xerox workcentre  copier the device would substitute number digits in scanned documents even when ocr was turned off for instance a cost table in a scanned document had an entry of  instead of the original sum of  after unsuccessfully trying to resolve this issue with xeroxs customer support he publicised his findings on his blog providing examples pages that lead to the bug occurrence it was confirmed that this bug was reproducible on a wide variety of xerox workcentre and other highend xerox copiers the source of the error was a bug in the jbig implementation which is an image compression standard that makes use of pattern matching to encode identical characters only once while this provides a high level of compression it is susceptible to errors in identifying similar characters a possible workaround was published by kriesel which involved setting the image quality from normal to higher or high shortly afterwards it was found that the same fix had been suggested in the printer manual which mentioned the occurrence of character substitutions in normal mode indicating that xerox was aware of the software error in xeroxs initial response to a growing interest by the media the error was described as occurring rarely and only when factory settings had been changed after kriesel provided evidence that the error was also occurring in all three image quality modes normal higher and high including the factory defaults xerox corrected their statement and released a software patch to eliminate the problem despite the problem being present in some instances also in higher quality mode xerox advises users that they can use this mode as an alternative to applying the patch trademarkedit the word xerox is used as a synonym for photocopy both as a noun and a verb in many areas for examplei xeroxed the document and placed it on your desk or please make a xeroxed copy of the articles and hand them out a week before the exam though both are common the company does not condone such uses of its trademark and is particularly concerned about the ongoing use of xerox as a verb as this places the trademark in danger of being declared a generic word by the courts the company is engaged in an ongoing advertising and media campaign to convince the public that xerox should not be used as a verb to this end the company has written to publications that have used xerox as a verb and has also purchased print advertisements declaring that you cannot xerox a document but you can copy it on a xerox brand copying machine xerox corporation continues to protect its trademark in most if not all trademark categoriescitation needed despite their efforts many dictionaries continue to include the use of xerox as a verb including the oxford english dictionary in  the intellectual property appellate board ipab of india declared xerox a nongeneric term after almost  years – of continued existence on the register without challenge and with proof of almost  years of use evident  but as of  most indians still use it as a synonym for photocopying see

photographic paper and equipment in  chester carlson a physicist working independently invented a process for printing images using an electrically charged photoconductorcoated metal plate and dry powder toner however it would take more than  years of refinement before the first automated machine to make copies was commercialized using a document feeder scanning light and a rotating drum joseph c wilson credited as the founder of xerox took over haloid from his father he saw the promise of carlsons invention and in  signed an agreement to develop it as a commercial product wilson remained as presidentceo of xerox until  and served as chairman until his death in  looking for a term to differentiate its new system haloid coined the term xerography from two greek roots meaning dry writing haloid subsequently changed its name to haloid xerox in  and then xerox corporation in  before releasing the  xerox tested the market by introducing a developed version of the prototype handoperated equipment known as the flatplate  the  was not actually a viable copier because of its speed of operation as a consequence it was sold as a platemaker to the offset lithography market perhaps most notably as a platemaker for the addressographmultigraph multilith  and related sheetfed offset printing presses it was little more than a high quality commercially available plate camera mounted as a horizontal rostrum camera complete with photoflood lighting and timer the glass filmplate had been replaced with a seleniumcoated aluminum plate clever electrics turned this into a quick developing and reusable substitute for film a skilled user could produce fast paper and metal printing plates of a higher quality than almost any other method having started as a supplier to the offset lithography duplicating industry xerox now set its sights on capturing some of offsets market share the  was followed by the first automatic xerographic printer the copyflo in  the copyflo was a large microfilm printer which could produce positive prints on roll paper from any type of microfilm negative following the copyflo the process was scaled down to produce the  microfilm printer at about half the size and weight this still sizable machine printed onto handfed cutsheet paper which was pulled through the process by one of two gripper bars a scaleddown version of this gripper feed system

prints produced in an hour although not as fast as offset printing this machine introduced the industrys first automatic document feeder paper slitter and perforator and collator sorter this product was soon sped up by fifty percent to become the xerox  duplicator meanwhile a small lab team was borrowing  copiers and modifying them the lab was developing what it called long distance xerography ldx to connect two copiers using the public telephone network so that a document scanned on one machine would print out on the other the ldx system was introduced in  many years later this work came to fruition in the xerox telecopiers seminal to todays fax machines the fax operation in todays multifunction copiers is true to carlsons original vision for these devices in  c peter mccolough a

developed at xerox parc in  under company president c peter mccolough xerox opened the xerox palo alto research center known as xerox parc the facility developed many modern computing technologies such as the graphical user interface gui laser printing wysiwyg text editors and ethernet from these inventions xerox parc created the xerox alto in  a small minicomputer similar to a modern workstation or personal computer this machine can be considered the first true personal computer given its versatile combination of a cathoderaytype screen mousetype pointing device and a qwertytype alphanumeric keyboard but the alto was never commercially sold as xerox itself could not see the sales potential of it it was however installed in xeroxs own offices worldwide and those of the us government and military who could see the potential within these sites the individual workstations were connected together by xeroxs own unique lan the ethernet data was sent around this system of heavy yellow low loss coaxial cable using the packet data system in addition parc also developed one of the earliest internetworking protocol suites the parc universal packet pup in  steve jobs made a deal with xeroxs venture capital division he would let them invest  million in exchange for a look at the technology they were working on jobs and the others saw the commercial potential of the wimp window icon menu and pointing device system and redirected development of the apple lisa to incorporate these technologies jobs is quoted as saying they just had no idea what they had in  jobs invited several key parc researchers to join his company so that they could fully develop and implement their ideas in  xerox released a system similar to the alto the xerox star it was the first commercial system to incorporate technologies that have subsequently become commonplace in personal computers such as a bitmapped display windowbased gui mouse ethernet networking file servers print servers and

a more affordable personal computer aimed towards the business and education markets the apple macintosh was released in  and was the first personal computer to popularize the gui and mouse among the

europe accounting irregularitiesedit on may   xerox corporation announced that its auditors kpmg llp had certified xeroxs financial statements for the three years ended december   and the financials included some restatements on march   xerox restated its financials which reflected the reallocation of equipment sales revenue of more than  billion on april   the us securities and exchange commission filed a complaint against xerox the complaint alleged xerox deceived the public between  and  by employing several accounting maneuvers the most significant of which was a change in which xerox recorded revenue from copy machine leases – recognizing a sale when a lease contract was signed instead of recognizing revenue over the entire length of the contract at issue was when the revenue was recognized not the validity of the revenue xeroxs restatement only changed what year the revenue was recognized on december   xerox corporation reported that it had discovered an error in the calculation of its noncash interest expense related to a debt instrument and associated interest rate swap agreements resulted in aftertax understatement of interest expense of approximately  million to  million or less than  cent per share in each of the four quarters of  and for the first three quarters of  in response to the secs complaint xerox corporation neither admitted nor denied wrongdoing it agreed to pay a  million penalty and to restate its financial results for the years  through  on june   six xerox senior executives accused of securities fraud settled their issues with

during settlement with the securities and exchange commission xerox began to revamp itself once more as a symbol of this transformation the relative size of the word xerox was increased in proportion to the document company on the corporate signature and the latter was dropped altogether in september along with the digital x however the digital x and the document company were still used by fuji xerox until april character substitution bugedit in  german computer scientist david kriesel discovered an error in a xerox workcentre  copier the device would substitute number digits in scanned documents even when ocr was turned off for instance a cost table in a scanned document had an entry of  instead of the original sum of  after unsuccessfully trying to resolve this issue with xeroxs customer support he publicised his findings on his blog providing examples pages that lead to the bug occurrence it was confirmed that this bug was reproducible on a wide variety of xerox workcentre and other highend xerox copiers the source of the error was a bug in the jbig implementation which is an image compression standard that makes use of pattern matching to encode identical characters only once while this provides a high level of compression it is susceptible to errors in identifying similar characters a possible workaround was published by kriesel which involved setting the image quality from normal to higher or high shortly afterwards it was found that the same fix had been suggested in the printer manual which mentioned the occurrence of character substitutions in normal mode indicating that xerox was aware of the software error in xeroxs initial response to a growing interest by the media the error was described as occurring rarely and only when factory settings had been changed after kriesel provided evidence that the error was also occurring in all three image quality modes normal higher and high including the factory defaults xerox corrected their statement and released a software patch to eliminate the problem despite the problem being present in some instances also in higher quality mode xerox advises users that they can use this mode as an alternative to applying the patch trademarkedit the word xerox is used as a synonym for photocopy both as a noun and a verb in many areas for examplei xeroxed the document and placed it on your desk or please make a xeroxed copy of the articles and hand them out a week before the exam though both are common the company does not condone such uses of its trademark and is particularly concerned about the ongoing use of xerox as a verb as this places the trademark in danger of being declared a generic word by the courts the company is engaged in an ongoing advertising and media campaign to convince the public that xerox should not be used as a verb to this end the company has written to publications that have used xerox as a verb and has also purchased print advertisements declaring that you cannot xerox a document but you can copy it on a xerox brand copying machine xerox corporation continues to protect its trademark in most if not all trademark categoriescitation needed despite their efforts many dictionaries continue to include the use of xerox as a verb including the oxford english dictionary in  the intellectual property appellate board ipab of india declared xerox a nongeneric term after almost  years – of continued existence on the register without challenge and with proof of almost  years of use evident  but as of  most indians still use it as a synonym for photocopying see

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal

provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples
