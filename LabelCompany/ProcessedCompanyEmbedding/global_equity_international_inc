company to a public company is commonly known as an ipo or dpo allowing the newly formed company to list and ultimately trade its shares on a recognized stock exchange the process to achieve the public company status differs greatly from jurisdiction to jurisdiction from stock exchange to stock exchange and from regulator to regulator the common denominator in any public listing or offering is planning and preparation in line with local regulation it takes many years to build a good business the ipo process can be part of that building and is never a quick fix we like to always keep in mind and have our clients understand that rome wasnt built in a day global equity work in many different markets exchanges and jurisdictions to guide a client through the right channel within the right time frame there are many factors to consider when seeking an ipo and the decision to become a public company does not come without its own idiosyncrasies regular reporting corporate governance and external shareholders are all realities that have to be factored into your thought process for the future once the decision has been made to go down the ipo route we must analyze the best possible route for the company a successful ipo or direct offering can very often be the spring board to rapid growth and expansion building true value within your company advantages and disadvantages of a public company advantages broad exposure for the company and its products – public companies become very visible ability to capital raise – public markets with many investors capital raising at lower cost – higher valuation thus less dilution ability to exit in part – to sell shares in small amounts higher corporate profile – high visibility of corporation higher company valuation – typically public companies have much higher valuation than a private company possibly subject to a predator – maybe providing management exit mass market for potential investors – open to retail and institutional investors attract institutional investors without losing management controls – traditionally no board seat required by institutions acquisitions with paper – stock for stock acquisitions allowing non organic growth staff retention and motivation with stock options – to retain valuable employees disadvantages regular reporting – regular quarterly and annual reporting mandatory disclosure of all material events – any material corporate activity must be disclosed shareholders – external shareholders corporate governance responsibility greater time involvement – management must devote additional time to public company operations ownership dilution – owners give up some equity percentage increased expense – higher costs of regulatory compliance for audit legal and investor relations possibly subject to a predator – company can be seen as vulnerable get global equity international updates right to your inbox global equity international inc

would like to announce that the board of directors have firmly decided to commence the process of acquiring regulated funds under management initially in the united kingdom in common with the overall financial services sector the micro fund management market is undergoing significant changes our company would like to take advantage of these changes and acquire a significant selection of international and united kingdom based financial advisory firms with funds under management and via acquisition create a subsidiary under one efficient and cost effective umbrella that will provide long term revenue for global equity international inc and its fully owned subsidiaries a fund division of our company global equity will provide long term stability via revenue attractive value by paying up to three times profits and short term income from both the fund division and our company due to our ability to then selffinance deals and ultimately close the circle major keys to success extensive and deep knowledge of the fund management sector  years of experience within management of this type of business close relationships with existing target companies to be acquired timing broadened product portfolio for clients cross border opportunities reduced general and administrative expenses once consolidated management previously created a similar company with us billion of funds under management to date we have identified four funds under management that we are interested in acquiring the total amount of money under management would be approximately us and total annual net profits vary between  and  of the fund value these regulated and licensed financial advisory firms with funds under management can be acquired for small multiples and with certain amounts paid upfront and the balance as a form of buyout over time which will end up being selffunded from the revenues we intend to acquire each of these target funds are based in the uk and are highly regulated by the uk fca  httpswwwfcaorguk  once we have acquired at least two of the financial advisory firms with funds under management that we have on our shortlist within  months we will create a global

to close the circle on our business model i travelled to the united kingdom two weeks ago and met with certain significant people within the sector with a view of posing to them our idea of commencing an acquisition trail on various uk regulated funds the idea was received with great enthusiasm so much so that i and my cfo enzo taddei will be travelling back to the uk this coming monday to follow up on my previous conversations and also to meet with all four potential acquisition targets with a view to agree on the basic terms of acquisition with each of them and to set a timeframe to commence our comprehensive due diligence also i have spoken to various of our financial partners about assisting us to source the funding required initially via debt only to acquire the various targeted financial advisory firms with funds under management and we have received an extremely positive response we are feeling very bullish about getting these funds acquired in the next  to  months i personally have extensive experience in this type of business hence i know how profitable it can be i also know that with a little tlc we can make the net profits of these funds substantially higher
