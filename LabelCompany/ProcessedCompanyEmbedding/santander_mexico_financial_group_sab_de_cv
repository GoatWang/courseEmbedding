of which are established large banks the remaining  was distributed among  other banks we also compete with credit unions in mexico credit unions are financial institutions that are formed for the purpose of providing access to funding and favorable conditions for savings and receipt of loans and financial services credit unions do not provide services to the public in general since they are only authorized to carry out transactions with their members the operation of a credit union is carried out by its own members in order to be a member of a credit union one must comply with the eligibility requirements established for that organization and acquire a certain number of shares of the credit union the deposits of members with a credit union are not subject to any form of deposit insurance there are credit unions for many different economic groups ranging from fishermen to industrialists but there are also “mixed” credit unions that accept members who perform different economic activities and “social sector” credit unions that serve economic sectors that are unable to access traditional financial institutions due to social economic and geographic conditions commercial banks in mexico also compete in the retail market with nonbanking institutions known as sofoles and sofomes which focus primarily on offering consumer commercial and mortgage loans to middle and lowincome individuals until recently the commercial credit market for middle and low income individual customers has been serviced almost exclusively by nonbanking institutions currently more than  nonbanking institutions are licensed to operate in mexico mexican nonbanking institutions may engage in certain specific lending activities but are prohibited from engaging in many banking operations including receiving deposits foreign trade financing offering current accounts and engaging in foreign currency operations traditional banks have begun to extend their credit services to the markets previously dominated by sofoles and sofomes at the beginning of  the mexican banking law ley de instituciones de crédito was modified to among other things grant authority to the cnbv with the assistance of other regulators but having primary responsibility to authorize the creation of banks solely to engage in certain activities which is intended to incentivize competition reduce required capital considering their risk exposure and improve the attention to certain industries and regions as compared to socalled “universal” banks such as banco santander mexico as a result of the reduced capital requirements and potential reduced operational costs that are likely to apply to this type of bank there could be increased competition as a result of the creation of more banks to target specific market niches to the best of our knowledge as of december   the cnbv has not granted any authorization for the creation of this kind of limited operation bank in addition commercial banks will probably face increasing competition from sofoles and sofomes as a result of reforms to several financial laws which have been enacted with the main purpose of deregulating lending activities in mexico including financial leasing and factoring activities commercial banks also face increasing competition from securities firms and other financial intermediaries that can provide larger companies with access to domestic and international capital markets as an alternative to bank loans in the brokerage services sector casa de bolsa santander our brokerdealer subsidiary competes
