noninvasive procedures gentelmans choice scar  keloid treatments before  after faqs testimonials contact home  procedures  gentlemans choice procedures   gentlemans choice procedures eyelid rejuvenation eye contact is very important for in business and social settings most men realize the importance of their eyes and requested blepharoplasty procedures to minimize the extra skin hooding puffiness and sagging each year over  men and women choose blepharoplasty to improve the way they look  droopy eyelids can make you look older and can also impair vision  blepharoplasty corrects these problems and also removes puffiness and bags under the eyes that make you look worn and tired  blepharoplasty does not correct dark circles fine lines and wrinkles around the eyes nor can it change sagging eyebrows so although it is typically performed as a single procedure you may also require a brow lift face lift or skin resurfacing to achieve the best results﻿  prior to visiting dr jones i went to another doctor and was not happy with my results luckily dr jones was able to correct my previous eye surgery – patient jl the procedure blepharoplasty commonly known as eyelid surgery removes the excess fat and drooping skin from the upper or lower eyelids or both to rejuvenate your appearance  the removal of fat deposits minimizes bags under the eyes and tightens the lower eyelid skin  variations of blepharoplasty include upper eyelid surgery  removes fatty deposits that appear as puffiness in the upper eyelids lower eyelid surgery  removes excess skin and wrinkles on the lower eyelid as well as corrects droopiness and bags under the eyes the methods eyelid surgery usually takes from one to three hours under local or general anesthesia  the doctor will make incisions in the creases of the upper eyelids andor below the lashes of the lower eyelids  the placement of the incision lines is designed to minimize visible scarring  once the incision is made the doctor will separate the skin from the fatty tissue and muscle remove excess fat and trim drooping skinmuscle  in instances where there is no drooping skin to be removed the doctor may make an incision line just below the lower lash to just remove excess fat ideal candidate the ideal candidate for eyelid surgery is a nonsmoking adult without predetermined serious eye conditions  healthy facial tissue and muscles is desired  the patient must also have realistic expectations for the outcome of the surgery recoverypostoperative  temporary eyelid swelling bruising irritation or dry eyes results of eyelid surgery will appear gradually as swelling and bruising subside  temporary discomfort and irritation at the incision site is possible   stitches will be removed two days to a week after surgery   avoid strenuous activities for two weeks after surgery﻿﻿   before  after images  back to procedures               male liposuction many men find that dieting and exercise are good ways to lose weight and tone muscle however they still find it difficult to achieve the typical body they desire  fat deposits may conceal the toned muscles and make it difficult to get rid of fat in certain areas ﻿  as a fireman i have to be physically able to lift heavy weight removing some of the fat in my stomach makes a difference when i’m moving around – patient kb the procedure the most popular areas for liposuction for men include waist abdomen lower back breast and neck  a key difference between liposuction for a man and a woman concerns the make up of the fatty tissue itself adipose tissue in women is softer and less fibrous than tissue found in men  therefore liposuction for males presents greater physical demands on the performing surgeon the methods there are several approaches to liposuction including standard liposuction powerassisted liposuction and laserassisted liposuction  standard liposuction utilizes various cannulas hollow stainless steel tube  power assisted liposuction utilizes oscillating cannulas which pretunnel the tissue and are especially helpful in difficult areas power assisted liposuction allows surgeons to effectively perform higher volumes of liposuction without burn risks trauma to fibrous tissues and in faster time  ideal candidate the ideal liposuction patient is a healthy nonsmoking adult  the procedure is an option for those who would like to remove excess fat deposits and have realistic expectations and goals for body contouring  fat deposits may form from over eating a lack of exercise or inherited family traits recoverypostoperative adherence to postoperative and recovery instructions is critical and mandatory   transportation postsurgery is strongly recommended  possibility of up to several months for swelling to completely disappear some supplements and vitamins are prohibited to reduce prolonged bleeding﻿﻿   before  after images  back to procedures               male breast reduction although rarely discussed enlarged male breasts are a common condition  the condition clinically known as gynecomastia affects  to  percent of men  in most cases there is no known cause for it although it has been correlated to various drugs and medical conditions﻿  the extra fat in my chest was embarrassing and hard to get rid of from exercising i should have done this years ago – patient dh ·          the procedure male breasts typically occur at times of hormonal change such as puberty  as men physically mature it sometimes disappears on its own  however occasionally it remains possibly due to heredity and as was aforementioned certain drugs or other medical conditions the methods prior to surgery a detailed medical history and physical examination is performed to assess the underlying causes for gynecomastia  dependent upon each case’s characteristics the doctor may correct the undesired look through alternative medical treatments like the removal of glandular tissue  the amount of glandular tissue present will determine the type of liposuction the doctor feels is best for the patient  typically there is a firm and tender mass of breast tissue beneath the areola that may need to be removed gynecomastia techniques include   liposuction alone  liposuction with breast gland removal    liposuction gland and skin removal ideal candidate﻿ the ideal candidate for breast removal surgery is a healthy nonsmoking adult with excess breast gland fat or both  the procedure is most commonly performed on adult males between the ages of  and  recoverypostoperative patients should arrange for transportation from surgery  home recovery for approximately  to  days is required before returning to work  postoperative swelling will begin to improve after a week resume exercise and heavy lifting within  weeks﻿﻿   before  after images  back to procedures               nose reshaping there are many reasons why men seek rhinoplasty some of these include removing a bump on the nose creating a bridge or opening their breathing passages most men who seek rhinoplasty do not wish to dramatically change their nose shape but instead are looking for subtle improvements﻿  i didn’t want a drastic change in my nose structure but it’s an obvious improvement to my face – patient el the procedure rhinoplasty also known as a “nose job” is a surgical procedure that improves the appearance proportions and balance of the nose including the nasal tip and nostrils  aside from aesthetic appearance surgery of the nose is also used to correct difficulty with breathing  for example a deviated septum causes breathing impairment which can be corrected by adjusting the nasal structure to improve alignment  the methods rhinoplasty can be performed in two ways “open” where an incision is made across the columella the strip of tissue that divides the nostrils or “closed” an lps procedure of choice whereby incisions are hidden inside the nose to reduce visible scarring  a typical rhinoplasty procedure lasts  to  hours ideal candidate the ideal candidate is a nonsmoking and healthy adult with realistic expectations  to consider rhinoplasty you should at least in your midteens to ensure the development of the nose has stabilized recoverypostoperative  temporary bruising may extend to the eyes and other areas of the face  nasal cast must be worn for  to  days  nasal tampons may be placed in the nose for up to  days most bruising and swelling should disappear within  weeks  return to work within  to  days﻿﻿   before  after images  back to procedures               razor bump laser hair removal tired of shaving yes many men are and that’s a fact not an assumption  according to the american society of plastic surgeons laser hair removal is one of the top cosmetic noninvasive procedures requested by men﻿  it saves me a lot of time not having to worry about shaving every other day – patient sl laser hair removal the laser hair removal process is performed with candela gentle yag the most advanced laser equipment focusing laser light energy at the surface of the skin targeting pigment in hair follicles  the laser is effective on all skin tones however gray whitesilver blonde and some shades of red cannot be treated the laser light energy quickly heats the targeted hair follicle while the skin is cooled and essentially destroys the hair in a process known as photothermolysis  with each laser treatment you can expect to see less hair grow back and the hair become finer andor is permanently or safely removed typically up to  treatments are required laser hair removal can be performed on the abdomen arm underarms back bikini chest face neck and legs  results may vary based upon location of hair removal and specific hormone conditions﻿﻿   before  after images  back to procedures
