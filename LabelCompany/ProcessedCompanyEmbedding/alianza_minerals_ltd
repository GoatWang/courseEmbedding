geophysics indicates a potentially larger mineralized body at depth summary the yanac prospect is a copper ± molybdenum porphyry occurrence located in the andean southern porphyry mineralization trend

reflected in a  x  m area of  copper in rock samples adjacent to this is a second area of  copper in rocks in a copperbearing coarse white silica breccia adjacent to the porphyry mineralization numerous silica clay ribs and sericitized areas surround the mineralization including a halo of sheeted pyrite ± quartz veinlets this distalstyle epidotechlorite  magnetite and perhaps biotite alteration in addition to geochemical pathfinder element distribution indicates the presence of an upper level porphyry system with high potential open at depth this is corroborated by the high chargeability response   mvv that may reflect an upper level copper porphyry system with a sulfide cap where pyrite is dominate over chalcopyrite with the possibility of there being a change to a chalcopyrite dominant over pyrite mineralization at ± m depth cliffs laid out a twenty drill hole proposal to test this hypothesis in  but due to the aforementioned issues at cliffs it was never
