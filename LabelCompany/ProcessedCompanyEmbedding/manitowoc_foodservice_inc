“clear ice” this is normally referring to the fact that the ice is literally clear and free of impuritiesnugget icenugget ice is also known by a couple of other names sometimes called hospital ice sonic ice or pellet ice this ice type is useful because it can fill up a glass but still leave plenty of room for a liquid also since it takes up so much space around the liquid it works very well at keeping a cups’ contents cold and refreshinggourmet icethis ice type is sometimes also referred to as top hat ice since the cubes themselves have tiny lips around the base giving them the appearance of a little hate these cubes are generally larger and slower melting making them popular for cocktails or neat drinksflake icethis interestingly shaped ice type is similar to nugget ice in some ways in addition to being put in beverages flake ice is popular for acting as the base for foods on display like seafood or soft cheeses in this way it’s good for large homecatered parties with buffet style serving tablessquare cube iceperhaps the most wellknown and classic form of ice cube this ice type can be seen in drinks everywhere popular due to ice trays that frequently make them you can find undercounter and freestanding ice machine units alike that make this ubiquitous form of ice sometimes these cubes are smaller and called halfsize or cubeletfor the outdoor ice makeroften able to be used as an undercounter unit some home ice makers are made from components that allow them to be operated in an outside environment a stainless steel and corrosionresistant exterior are common features for a model that boasts being able to be used outside also this generally means these machines sport features which help them function outside of a home as well for instance in addition to a corrosionresistant exterior these appliances will have things like a thermal insulated cabinet which helps them stay energy efficient and keep their cooling performance at its peak despite being installed outside of a temperature controlled environment like a kitchen or living roomfor nearly any type of commercial ice maker on the market there is a residential version that will do everything

items  days from purchase details ▸  years of service owned and operated in america since  encounter the commercial kindcommercial ice makers are great for anything from a home business setting to a massive industrial environment they produce clear ice which means the water used is pure and has no impurities in it selfcontained ice machines make ice and store it in one unit these models can produce up to  pounds of ice a day but can only store up to  pounds of ice at one time modular ice machines are larger and require an ice storage bin commercial ice storage bins are oftentimes refrigerated so the stored ice will not melt modular ice makers can produce up to  pounds ice daily and the attached ice bins can store up to  pounds of ice additionally there are also ice dispensers that are meant to produce large amounts of ice and can sometimes even store the ice these machines will also frequently dispense water too and can be found in environments like schools hospitals and restaurants it’s always important when making an important decision like purchasing a commercial ice machine to put in an appropriate amount of thought and researchmodular machinesyou can make almost any amount of ice you might need with a modular ice machine unit these commercialquality machines can produce massive amounts of ice in a single day some of them even have the ability to make upwards of  lbs of ice per day generally these machines are made of stainless steel in order to increase their durability and overall longevity just like a normal home portable ice maker these commercial versions can produce a number of different ice types flake and nugget style ice cubes are quite popular because these machines make so much ice a day they require more water and energy and are typically suited for a commercial retail or business environment they can also require more accessories or maintenance to keep them working at their maximum potentialfor instance since a modular machine is not stand alone and cannot store made ice by itself it requires a commercial grade ice bin to be attached it’s important to make sure that ice machine you pair with your storage bin doesn’t make more ice than your bin can hold it’s also a good idea to check what type of electrical connection your modular unit needs large commercial ice machines might require a higher voltage than the typical  v frequently a great attribute of modular ice makers is that they have aircooled condenser’s that are a part of the unit itself and don’t need to be purchased separatelyice storage binsthere are about as many different type of ice storage bins as there are types of modular ice machines this makes sense because however large of a daily production output a commercial ice machine may boast you’ll need proper storage to keep all that ice and if you need to hold on to that ice for a while it helps if that storage bin is refrigerated or insulated your ice storage bin will also need to be nsf certified or listed this certification is provided by the public health and safety organization and is placed on a product to show that it complies with a strict and extensive set of standards the nsf is considered to be one of the most respected independent testing organizationsselfcontained ice makersunlike a modular ice machine which will need a large and appropriately fitted ice bin to store ice a selfcontained commercial ice unit can make and store ice without the need of an extra ice bin while these ice machines don’t make as much ice as a typical modular unit they still can boast impressive daily outputs of course just like any other commercial ice machine selfcontained units come in a lot of different icetype varieties from cube to halfcube to nugget type ice selfcontained units can be quite versatile some even have the option to switch between making different sized type ice allowing the operator to choose between large or small cubesas stated earlier selfcontained ice makers can come in a lot of output varieties some are meant to fit undercounter and are ada certified meaning they come in at height under  inches this makes them especially useful for hospitals or retirement homes due to their ease of access since a selfcontained ice machine doesn’t have a lot of extra pieces and peripheral parts it’s often easier to install and also maintain throughout the yearsother ice needsice dispensers are popular in the commercial ice world you see these types of machines in hospitals schools restaurants and pretty much just about any other building that serves fountaintype drinks ice dispensers are fairly interesting because they often have a lot of other attributes for instance often time’s ice dispensers are also essentially ice storage ice dispensers can be standalone or modular but regardless of their type they generally work the same way ice is produced stored in a component or bin and then dispensed when a customer or user wants ice it’s not uncommon for these types of units to also dispense water or other types of beveragesa different type of ice storage type is a commercial ice merchandiser though this icethemed unit doesn’t make ice it’s used to store and display large amounts of ice usually in bags these units have to keep ice properly frozen and display them in an appealing manner for potential customers of course sometimes these merchandisers have solid doors too these ice merchandisers will generally be placed outside where is could potentially by sunny and hotter the solid doors help keep out sunlight and heat from working against the merchandiser’s refrigerationcheck out some of the dependable commercial ice products on ice maker direct we carry products from the worlds leading brands in commercial ice machines
