acquisition of shoppers drug mart corp by loblaw cos will benefit both companies and the canadian consumer according to sdm president domenic pilla sdm will bolster its food offerings with loblaws grocery expertise and experience while the supermarket retailer will enhance its health care offerings by tapping the drug chains pharmacy capabilities it’s about complementarity pilla said in an interview with chain drug reviewtoronto — the acquisition of shoppers drug mart corp by loblaw cos will benefit both companies according to sdm president domenic pilla domenic pilla in one of sdm’s beauty boutiques the canadian drug chain will bolster its food offerings with loblaw’s grocery expertise and experience while the supermarketer will enhance its health care offerings by tapping the drug chain’s pharmacy capabilities “it’s about complementarity” pilla said in an interview with chain drug review canada as a whole should gain from the deal he added because the combined entity will foster a convergence of health and nutrition “it’s a huge opportunity and it can have a much larger impact than either of us could have on our own on canada’s health care system” loblaw has pioneered the reduction of sodium and processed sugars from food as well as the elimination of additives especially in private label products said pilla “it’s fun to be working with another company that is just as iconic and has made so much progress in its area of expertise” the nearly nine months it took for regulators to approve the purchase has allowed for extensive planning one result is that sdm will add food this year especially from loblaw’s president’s choice private label line the brand’s wellknown decadent chocolate chip cookies already are selling well at the drug stores sdm’s life brand vitamins meanwhile have caught on at loblaw “we were ready to go and pulled that trigger and it was executed brilliantly by both teams and the response by the customers has been overwhelming” said pilla “we were very pleased at the response of the customer to the brands in each other’s formats” one distinction between the retailers will be in pharmacy loblaw and sdm pharmacies will retain separate banners although the chains will collaborate on programs to that end jeff leger who was sdm’s senior vice president of pharmaceutical partnerships has been promoted to head of loblaw pharmacies while health canada administrators trying to curb costs have targeted pharmacy reimbursements the pricing of generics has been stabilized “what we have now for the first time is a threeyear national arrangement” pilla said “that’s going to be very good for the ­industry” also five provinces allowed pharmacy reimbursements for flu shots last season and three more will join them this year negotiations are ongoing with the two holdouts alberta has taken the lead in granting pharmacists a wide range of prescribing rights making it “a world leader in terms of expanding the scope of practice” noted pilla “it’s a great model we’d like to see elsewhere” already other provinces are allowing pharmacist prescribing for minor ailments also authorization for other inoculations besides flu shots is on the horizon “we’re quite encouraged by the new reimbursed services” pilla remarked noting that some provinces have committed to reinvesting generics savings into expanding pharmacy practice in new brunswick  of savings will go to expanded services he pointed out “that kind of target setting is very encouraging that is the silver lining of the drug reform initiatives” sdm is responding to the trend by transforming its pharmacy business from a productcentric to patientcentered serviceoriented operation “we’ve been on that path” pilla said noting that its foundation will be the chain’s relaunched health watch ng pharmacy system “when we launch that in  we think it will give us the functionality and capability to truly expand our new professional services and deliver them seamlessly and efficiently clearly we would like the governments to come along with us but we made that decision regardless our pharmacies are going to be transformed” the transformation will include significantly greater use by pharmacies of electronic medical records he noted especially as doctors increasingly use the technology for disease state management already pharmacists have provided tremendous support to multidisciplinary family health care teams in the front end sdm sees an opportunity to bring its marketleading beauty merchandising to loblaw it can offer capabilities in product innovation storelevel support and sourcing to grow loblaw’s beauty business said pilla “we don’t see just taking share but actually growing the categories that’s what makes us excited we’ve shown that our partnerships with vendors are not just about growing share we’ve added incremental sales we’ve exposed more canadians to new products and product regimens” the latest beauty trends come out of cities and pilla noted that urbanization is reshaping canada nationwide sdm has a significant presence in urban markets and the economies of scale it’s gaining from loblaw are bringing its urban customers a new value proposition he said the drug chain’s beauty advisers have won over consumers with unbiased service and personal relationships the relationships have been enhanced with digital technology pilla said noting that sdm’s upscale murale beauty business is providing a laboratory for ­ecommerce generally he added sdm stands to benefit substantially from loblaw’s ecommerce capability “becoming an omnichannel company where people can experience our brand across any platform that they wish to interact with will be an important part of our ­development” the overall relationship between the two chains will be mutually beneficial he emphasized “we’re going to look at best practices across both organizations and help each other get better” the acquisition at heart is more about sales growth than cost cutting he added “long term that’s by far the biggest synergy which makes it exciting and engaging for employees” comments are closed search videos  slideshows
