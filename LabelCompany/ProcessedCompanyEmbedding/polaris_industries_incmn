use was to make hunting locations more accessible david johnson created the prototype in  while edgar was away edgar was furious after creating it using a grain silo conveyor belt as a track a briggs

germain wisconsin as the father of the snowmobile and allan hetteen were partners in hetteen hoist and derrick shop in roseau minnesota edgar had dropped out of school after the eighth grade in  their employees david johnson partnered with paul knochenmus and orlen johnson who was the first person to ride a polaris decided to create a vehicle that could travel through snow these vehicles primary use was to make hunting locations more accessible david johnson created the prototype in  while edgar was away edgar was furious after creating it using a grain silo conveyor belt as a track a briggs and stratton motor and an old chevy bumper for skis they had their first snow machine after returning from a trip edgar was shown the machine but was skeptical of its value and was disappointed that the group had spent company time and materials on the machine the no  sled was soon sold to roseau lumberyard owner silver pete hf peterson for  in order to meet company payroll however the employees continued to be focused on building snowmobiles and soon a second model was created by allen called the polaris sno traveler polaris was famous for copying other snowmobiles the first looked and operated like a bosak power toboggan and copied their design for the  polaris l after the teenee trailer companies eskimotor the first production model rolled off the assembly line in minnesota in  the original models weighed close to  lb  kg and moved at a speed of about  mph  kmh they came in a twotone paint job white below blue with a strip or chrome trim dividing them in order to publicize the new snowmobile and show their reliability and usefulness in  edgar led three snowmobiles on a mile trek across the alaskan wilderness starting from bethel alaska the trip took three weeks and much of the time edgar struggled to maintain  mph over the snow the fairbanks daily newsminer put them on its front page however his absence caused problems for him with the companys board of directors soon after completing the trip edgar left the company in june and started a competing company called polar manufacturing in thief river falls minnesota the company name later changed to arctic enterprises in the mids it filed for bankruptcy amid fierce competition as snowmobiles became popular and other manufacturers jumped into the market the company emerged from bankruptcy and continues on today as arctic cat polaris began developing a smaller consumersized front engine snowmobile to compete with the skidoo in the early s in  polaris released the comet however the comet soon ran into problems as it could not travel in all types of snow conditions polaris then recalled the sleds and quickly developed a new prototype to avoid bankruptcy the new model the  mustang became a hit as a family snowmobile and boosted polaris sales polaris continued to develop snowmobiles similar to this model throughout the ss and went on to become one of the leaders in the snowmobile industry in the early s polaris started creating an indy style snowmobile with ifs and a wider stance they continued with the indy style sled in the s with the storm ultra and trail lines within the last few years

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
