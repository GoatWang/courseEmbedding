introduced to indonesia in  by privately owned companies under a year government license in  all postal and telegraph services in indonesia were taken over by the government as single unified government agency named posts telegraafend telefoon diensts ptt in september  roughly a month after indonesian proclamation of independence the agency headquarters in bandung were taken over by indonesian nationalists in december  after years of national revolution war the ptt was nationalised by indonesian government as part of indonesian effort to oust the remaining dutch and nationalise dutch corporate assets stateowned companyedit in  ptt was converted from an official government agency into a newly established stateowned company the postal and telecommunications services company four year later in  indonesian government separated this company into two stateowned companies pn pos giro responsible for providing mail services and pn telekomunikasi as telecommunications services the mail services pn pos giro developed over year to become the pos indonesia in  which is still stateowned today and the official postal carrier for indonesias  million people in  pn telekomunikasi
