daly mike mike daly thank you ally good morning everyone thanks for joining us this morning for our second quarter call ill provide an overview of the quarter and then ill turn it over to jamie moses our cfo hell walk you through some of the specifics in our financials well discuss our outlook our guidance and then ill wrap it up so it was a good quarter for us and we delivered  growth in core earnings we had doubledigit annualized loan growth we had good operating leverage and we improved profitability we also executed a merger agreement to take us over  billion we completed an equity offering and we announced our plans to move our headquarters to boston so its been a busy few months for us but i really believe that the benefits of a lot of hard work from a cohesive employee base and our previous acquisitions and organic strategies are coming together and we boosted our returns this quarter driving core roa to  basis points and we believe this performance ratio will improve even further in the third quarter annualized loan growth was  quarteroverquarter including  annualized commercial growth this was led by significant gains in ci and as you know weve been working hard on driving more ci growth were focusing our teams and hiring new lenders in several markets so id expect us to continue to see good results there on the regional level were having success in central new york where theres a fair amount of economic activity and our relationships continue to grow we also saw growth in western mass and were seeing a pick up in abl activity in eastern mass in the midatlantic this year mortgage balances were up for the quarter including growth in adjustablerate mortgages as well as our shortterm leverage strategy for the new capital and jamie will touch on that in just a few minutes but with a clear path past the  billion threshold and additional capital we do expect to continue to produce solid commercial loan growth for the remainder of the year total annualized loan growth is expected to be in the midtohigh singledigits for the third quarter on the deposit side we had  annualized growth in the second quarter and we expect seasonal commercial demand deposits to bounce back in the second half of the year so we expect overall annualized deposit growth to be no less than midsingle digits again in the third quarter and deposit pricing has so far remained resistant to the moveup in fed funds base rates have seen little to no movement in our markets and while pricing on cds has inched up as the deposits rollover the betas remain significantly below the rate hikes meanwhile were going to closely monitor our markets for changes in behavior our fee income grew  quarteroverquarter in line with our expectations the sba business contributed  million to that number and mortgage banking fees were up  we originated  million in held for sale mortgages this quarter with new production coming on  purchase thats up from  in the first quarter for the third quarter we expect to see fee income grow in the midtohigh single digits led by mortgage fee revenue further growth in loans fee income and stable wealth management insurance and deposit fees as weve noted in the past some of this revenue will be offset by corresponding expenses but the overall growth is expected to have a positive effect on earnings now with that i am going to turn it over to jamie wholl give you some additional financial detail and then ill wrap it up jamie jamie moses thanks mike and good morning everyone it was another strong quarter for us were demonstrating positive operating leverage improving our profitability and maintaining a strong credit profile while growing the business core eps was  for the second quarter and gaap eps came in at  primarily reflecting acquisition activity average earning assets grew  our net interest margin was  for the quarter and  excluding purchased loan accretion the increase in margin this quarter was primarily due to the positive effects of the recent rate hikes coupled with some outsized prepayment penalties for the third quarter we expect the shortterm leveraging of a new capital to bring the margin down by about five basis points ill touch more on that in a minute purchased loan accretion for the second quarter came in at  million  million of that attributable to recovery we expect total purchased loan accretion to remain near this level in the third quarter the provision was  million in the second quarter exceeding net chargeoffs we dont expect any significant changes to our overall credit or chargeoff levels in the third quarter and we anticipate our provision will be in the area of  million again we continue to feel that credit is performing strongly and we are disciplined in managing our credit selection and concentrations moving on to expenses the  increase in operating expense quarteroverquarter was primarily tied to increased loan production particularly in mortgage and sba the efficiency ratio improved slightly to  importantly stripping out the first choice mortgage business the bank operated at a  efficiency in the second quarter we expect a lowtomid singledigit increase in operating expenses in the third quarter relating to the fee income growth that mike mentioned earlier our core tax rate for the second quarter was  including the benefit of some small tax credit investments this is slightly higher than we guided to last quarter as one of the historic tax credit deals we were working slipped into the third quarter that particular deal has already closed and we expect a couple more deals to close this quarter bringing our core tax rate for q down to the  to  range with a corresponding charge to noninterest income of approximately  million we still anticipate the  fullyear core tax rate to be around  looking at the big picture we expect to deliver  in core eps in the third quarter with only a  or  of noncore charges tied to acquisition factoring in the additional shares this would result in a mid to high singledigit increase in core earnings quarteroverquarter on the heels of the  increase in q we are pleased with our progress this quarter toward our profitability goals core roa improved to  basis points and we expect to do at least that well over the next couple of quarters core return on tangible equity came in at  due to noncore charges gaap return on assets was  basis points for the second quarter and return on equity was  as a result of our recent capital raise at quarter our tangible equity was  of tangible assets we initially used some of the  million in proceeds to pay down borrowings and then began the process of leveraging the capital as discussed on our may conference call  million of the raise will support the commerce transaction so we are intentionally investing in shorter duration assets including cmos this strategy impacts our nim in the short run and factors into our q guidance as mike mentioned we also added to our mortgage portfolio and we will be increasing our bully exposure the rest of the funds will be used to support commercial growth the net effect of this strategy is to offset some of the share count drag on our eps while continuing to drive roa north we estimate that the diluted share count will average around  million shares in the third quarter we are pleased with our performance this quarter and excited about our prospects for delivering solid results for the rest of the year our financial condition is good and we expect to continue to make progress on our strategic goals with that ill turn it back over to mike mike daly thank you jamie so as jamie said were expecting midtohigh singledigit growth in core earnings next quarter but of course with the increased share count our core eps is expected to be flat importantly these results would translate into a core roa in the mids and stable efficiency and for the full year we continue to anticipate core eps growth in the  to  range which is the equivalent of the high end of our original guidance when you take into account the impact of the recent share issuance we also expect stronger loan growth and the core roa to improve into the s for the year now this guidance doesnt include the impact from commerce as the expected timing of close is of course still unknown our local regions continue to show signs of optimism and were looking to capitalize on that while continuing to adhere to our credit disciplines now the team at commerce has been terrific to work with and we look forward to solidifying that partnership in the months ahead our strong integration history gives me confidence in our ability to hit the ground running and continue to build on expanded platforms were anticipating a great cultural fit and in smooth transition for customers and employees ive been spending much of my time in the boston area lately meeting with customers and employees as we thoughtfully build out our present there im pleased with the response weve gotten so far and the relationship weve been able to further develop weve also been identifying talent in this market and were pleased with the reception were getting in this regard as you know its a competitive market but also one where we believe we can be effective now let me touch on our preparations for crossing  billion were comfortable with the work weve done leading up to the commerce acquisition and weve been running internal dfast ready stress test for two years now and we had anticipated a dry run with regulators next year ahead of our first official filing in  and as ive said in the past weve got the people and the systems in place to support our growth well past these asset levels over the next several quarters however were going to be entirely focused on growing our organic business closing and integrating our acquisition of commerce bank and opening our new headquarters in boston we expect to deliver strong results over this period and that momentum should benefit all of our constituents and with that im going to open it up to any questions questionandanswer session operator thank you well now begin the questionandanswer session operator instructions our first question comes from mark fitzgibbon of sandler oneill please go ahead mark fitzgibbon hey guys good morning mike daly good morning mark mark fitzgibbon hey mark just to clarify i thought you had said you expected earnings in the third quarter to be  but then later you said they would be flat did i hear incorrectly because flat would imply  correct mike daly yes thats the incorrectly number i dont know if i said it or you heard it somewhere else but the  is the correct number mark fitzgibbon okay great and then how much in tax credit investments do you plan to make in the third quarter and also maybe some sense for fourth quarter expectation jamie moses hey mark its jamie we expect that were going to do a little bit of that in q and q and thats going to bring down the q and q tax rate in the  to  range or so and we expect than the fullyear of core tax rate to be about  which is straight in the middle of the guidance that we had talked about at the start of the year mark fitzgibbon okay great and then jamie is it possible you could give us maybe a little more detail on the mortgage banking income line maybe the approximate gain on sale margins and what the mix of originations look like jamie moses yeah so the originations came on at i think as mike said in his script  in the purchase category and i guess kind of the way to think about it mark we dont  we dont have this accounting segment broken out here but i think the way that were thinking about for you guys is probably in the  to  basis points range in terms of profitability dropping to the bottom line mark fitzgibbon okay and then do you have handy by chance the size of your commercial loan pipeline sean gray sure mark sean here it remained strong approaching the  million mark i think weve got a good spread amongst all geographies with ci remaining the focus but a little bit more balanced growth ci increase on a goforward mark fitzgibbon okay and sean i know its early but the boston off congress street there can you share with us any early data on loans and deposits out of that location sean gray yes going well organically that boston office in and of itself has driven about  million in deposits we look at this post the commerce acquisition we will have four branches in boston which will be a great platform within those four branches well have about  million in collective deposits and the bank in boston will have close to  billion in overall after so we feel post commerce its a great entry and a great platform to really increase our production in that boston market mark fitzgibbon thank you operator our next question comes from laurie hunsicker of compass point please go ahead laurie hunsicker hey good morning mike daly good morning laurie laurie hunsicker just to followup on boston i guess the marketing expense jump that we saw linked quarter from  million to  million is that somewhat related to boston or how should we think about that as you continue to push toward boston sean gray laurie sean here that had nothing to do with boston what that is is additional marketing related to the additional production we saw in mortgage this quarter it was within our expectation and within our budget laurie hunsicker okay and so how should we be thinking about that one going forward mike daly laurie i think you should think about it in terms of seasonality tied to the mortgage production so may be about the same or a little bit higher in q and then dropping down into q laurie hunsicker okay and then as we look at pro forma boston and pro forma rate now just overlaying commerce your  million in deposits the way that i guess im screening it for us now how do we think about that if we fast forward a year or two years how  where do you want to see your boston footprint with respect to your overall franchise value mike daly we see that as the area of most right for growth but one of the things that we see as an advantage to us from an opportunistic perspective is the geographic diversity we have were very particular from a profitability and a credit discipline perspective so well remain opportunistic rather than pigeonhole ourselves to growth in a particular area but we do see the contribution from that marketplace to continue to be a major factor on a goforward laurie hunsicker okay all right and then the merger charges of  that was all related to commerce first choice is completely done is that correct mike daly no no it was about two thirds related to commerce and a third related to first choice there will be a small pale in q related to first choice but not more than a  or  in terms of noncore charges in q laurie hunsicker okay i thought you guys had mentioned last quarter that first choice was all done in merger charges was there something else that come up or did i misheard that mike daly this is small sale  theres just a small sale thats left in q we thought it was all going to be finished up in q some things came in towards the end allison orourke laurie this is ali we said that we thought there was about  million worth left that we thought would be in q were going to come in total less that even though there is just a little bit left laurie hunsicker okay and then with respect to your commerce can you update us on your  million tax a portfolio jamie moses we really cant get into a lot of detail on commerce right now the s will be out probably in the next several days laurie and so were kind of precluded to get into any information on commerce at this point laurie hunsicker okay okay and then just lastly on firestone can you just give us where you are on loan balance new originations and nonperformers richard marotta yeah laurie this is richard ended the quarter at about  million which is about  growth quarteroverquarter originations were about  million for the quarter npls came in at about  versus the  million at the end of the first and chargeoffs for the quarter were  bps about  versus the  in the first quarter laurie hunsicker okay thanks mike daly thanks laurie operator our next question comes from collyn gilbert of kbw please go ahead collyn gilbert thanks good morning everyone mike daly hey collyn collyn gilbert just to go back to a followup on some of the questions can you give me just talk a little bit more about sort of the seasonality that we should be expecting in the mortgage banking business and i guess part of my question there is your midtohigh single digit core fee income growth linked quarter seems strong  really strong especially relatively to what you put up this quarter so just trying to frame that as we kind of look out for the rest of the year how we should be thinking about the volatility there mike daly yeah collyn thanks i think thats a good number for q there is going to be seasonality in that mortgage business q is going to be the highest in terms of expenses and then we think we should come back down to around the same levels of q in between q and q in terms of expenses in q that will generally be the pattern of the seasonality in the mortgage business and of course that can be affected obviously by things that happen in the macro markets in terms of interest rates but i think thats about the right way to think about it allison orourke from the fee income  the fee income guide collyn ill also include some seasonality in the sba business so that business too has a higher q q and then tailing off a little bit collyn gilbert okay okay thats helpful and then just back to the marketing number its a big number was there something i know you said it was tied to loan production but is there also something else that goes on in the second quarter within first choices mortgage business that that marketing number is going to be elevated i am just its just a big number to try to reconcile jamie moses no nothing no collyn nothing else coming through essentially its going to be a derivative of volumes so as a percentage and continue on this path collyn gilbert okay okay and then just on the commercial pipeline sean you mentioned the competition but how about the yields where are you guys seeing kind of origination yield relative to portfolio yields sean gray were actually seeing a slightly stronger rollon than rolloff by lowtomid single digits in that perspective collyn gilbert okay and then on the deposit side the pricing side too mike i know you said in your opening comments that despite the fed move youre not seeing much deposit pricing pressure in the core products can you just talk a little bit about the competitive environment as it relates to deposit pricing and maybe sean how you guys are positioning yourselves kind of going forward as you think about deposit pricing competition mike daly of course thats the benefit of the regionality of the franchise in the rural markets but sean you may want to give some color on that sean gray yeah obviously the new jersey market boston market from a macro perspective are more competitive you do see higher deposit rates we set our thresholds based on profitability and mix and then mine our entire geography and were bullish that we will be able to continue to do that and maintain the appropriate cost of deposits on the franchise mike daly and collyn ill just one thing to that is that in terms of our base rates across our geography were not seeing much of a change to those if any the changes in rates that we see are tied to time deposits which i suppose you would expect when rates rise and so  but were not seeing betas that are anything approaching historical averages theyre much lower than sean gray the larger bank market leaders have remained disciplined to this point which has helped all of this as well collyn gilbert okay okay thats helpful and then just one final question you mentioned  and if you guys talked about last quarter i apologize whats the relationship with costco and i am assuming that acronym was first choice or whatever the acronym was in the press release sean gray okay whats the specific question is… collyn gilbert oh i just didnt know what that relationship was cost like what that even was about like what is that sean gray okay so were the endorsed lender for the costco relationship from a mortgage perspective so we affiliate branding and marketing and we were very happy with it because it really drives our brand on a national level collyn gilbert thats right thats right okay and that was something that first choice had had before you guys entered into the agreement with them right or is thats a new relationship sean gray no something first choice has had for a long time a good longstanding relationship collyn gilbert okay ill leave it there thanks guys mike daly thanks collyn operator our next question comes from matthew breese of piper jaffray please go ahead matthew breese just to followup on that costco question i know when the deal was first announced that they had they were with costco and then costco did a lot of refi business but now the competition has switched right some more purchase versus refi and not i was curious if costco has moved in kind have they moved more towards purchase mike daly yes the costco team our costco team is based out of california its a fantastic team they have been able to move in kind and mind that purchase activity more i think thats a derivative of the strength of costcos membership and the brand loyalty they have that translates over as market conditions translate and its also a testament to the leadership of the overall fcls team that they built a team with purchaseoriented los and will continue to be able to keep that strong pace matthew breese and of the overall mortgage banking activities how much stems from costco mike daly costco still remains under a third of the overall activity so we havent seen no additional jumps in costco the blend has remained consistent from the early fcls days matthew breese okay and then i just wanted to get a firm handle on the margin this quarter and the outlook for next quarter so the  headline you had accretive yield so the core is  how much of the ninebasis point increase was due to prepayment and how much was due to the leverage strategy jamie moses so thanks matt for the question there is a ninebasis point increase as you highlighted a lot of that is due to prepayment a lot of it is due to just the rate hike activity that we saw heading into q and then there was a little bit of  we paid down some borrowings towards the end the quarter based on the leverage strategy that we had and i guess i would say from a goforward standpoint as we highlighted in the script were going to see about a fivebasis point decrease in the nim and thats primarily going to be based on the leverage strategy that we have over the back half of the year matthew breese okay but thats all inclusively like youre not backing out the prepayment and then applying to their fivebasis point decrease jamie moses no thats all inclusive our guidance of five basis point is where we think well be matthew breese okay and then do you have any idea of where the blended nim will shake out once commerce is completed jamie moses we dont have that broken out exactly yet matt but we expect its going to be  we expect to be pretty flat in terms of nim matthew breese and then the one thing in the press release i noticed was the alliance with princeton advisory group can you just talk what that is and what the benefits are the cost the expenses just more color sean gray sure matt its sean here its a strategic partnership so theres no cost to us but what we provide is private banking and deposit services for their customers so what that did was open up another wealth management book for us to provide our banking and deposit services to help them insulate themselves from some larger institutions that may pirate those customers what we get is they supplement our wealth banking offering they have a professional athlete offering they have a multitude of different offerings that allows us to build our skill in wealth management in a very practical sense down in new jersey over time so a great partnership from both ends that really is no cost with strategic upside matthew breese okay can we quantify the upside or is it more or less gravy if it works out well sean gray i think itll be gravy as it works out to this point but i think it then opens up additional partnerships with other organizations over time matthew breese understood okay my question mike you noted in your commentary activity upstate in new york was a little bit better and i was just curious was that a quarterly phenomenon or are you seeing in general better activity in those markets mike daly well weve said for some time that the chip manufacturing thats going on there would begin to show signs of a real economic activity and at this point this is just a continuance of what weve seen over the last few quarters so there is nothing major thats occurring other than there is the maturity of a market that weve been expecting for some time and the economic activity in that market is positive and its solid so were taking advantage of it matthew breese understood thats all i had thanks for taking my questions mike daly you bet thank you operator this concludes our questionandanswer session i would like to turn the conference back over to mike daly for any closing remarks mike daly okay well i appreciate
