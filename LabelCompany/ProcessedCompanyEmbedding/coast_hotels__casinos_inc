discounts  dealbase compare prices get the scoop heres the truth about those  off sales now that we have your attention are you ready to find out why you shouldnt believe those overhyped advertisements first off those enticing  off  off and  off ads generally refer to discounts off the highestpriced mostrestricted ticket classes refundable etc what the carriers are really saying is that there are cheaper flights out there than the most expensive tickets news flash in most cases theyre providing absolutely no support that any of those discounts exist under any circumstances heres the bottom line most leisure travelers never actually buy the costliest mostrestricted tickets those are generally picked up by business travelers shopping on the company dime with lowcost airlines online travel agents and flexible date searches all factoring in to your price hunting its rare that youd ever pay the highest possible price anyway so that  off discount doesnt apply to any flight youre likely to book for the best strategy search flights from a wide variety of providers comparing rates is the only way to ensure youre getting a competitive price its the closest thing youve got to a foolproof strategy for booking flights here are our top tips most domestic airlines release sales on tuesdays with the majority of competitors matching these deals within  hours to take advantage of these airfare sales and have the largest amount of seats to choose from search for fares on tuesdays and wednesdays historically saturdays have also proved fair prices for domestic travel when heading to a destination serviced by multiple airports be sure to check them all to ensure youre getting the best fare for example if youre flying to new york city search for the major airports jfk laguardia and newark as well as smaller options long islandislip and white plains be flexible with your dates searching a range of dates gives you a good ballpark budget for what you can expect to spend on airfare search then search again frequently checking fares for your preferred route over a fixed period of time eg once or twice per day over a week or two gives you an indepth realistic understanding of what your airfare costs should be then when you see a price you think is fair book with confidence knowing youve locked in the best fare for your route and budget bookingbuddy allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered offers and savings are based on information available on these sites there is no guarantee that these prices savings hotels or dates will be available at the time of booking please check the site for the most recent details when you book travel your booking is handled by one of those sites directly not by bookingbuddy transactions and all subsequent customer care are directly handled by the site where you booked your travel bookingbuddy does not control the price rules regulations or restrictions surrounding the price please read all rules and regulations before booking get the scoop heres the truth about those  off hotel deals you may have seen an enticing ad boasting huge discounts on hotel rooms though it got your attention the deals unlikely to hold up when subject to scrutiny here we detail why that discount is likely subtracted from the rooms rack rate the highest price for the room on specific days during the peak booking season since its unlikely that youll ever be charged that price the discount isnt really a discount at all advertisers also like to add extras to the room rate to artificially inflate that  off and sometimes even  off claim this value often includes daily breakfast internet access and other surchargecarrying services in the nightly rate the discount therefore isnt based on just the room but is based on all the related services that might not be of use to you hotel rates are constantly changing if an event is coming to town room rates will skyrocket since demand is at a premium conversely if there are extended periods of lower vacancy hurricane season in the caribbean for example room prices plummet attempting to determine the value of a percentage savings from such volatile price points is at best an inexact science here are our top tips for getting the best hotel deals every time dont only check one site and call it a day by comparing prices across several providers major online travel agencies and your favorite hotel brands site you may find that one price point undercuts the restor offers a little something extra for the same price go for it go opaque youll see the room class neighborhood amenities price and reviews before you book but if youre willing to take a chance with the hotel brand opaque sites such as our partners hotwire and priceline are great ways to save big forget the oranges only compare apples to apples make sure youre comparing the same offerings across providers and to ensure youre getting an even better deal youll want to compare prices for similar room types at all hotels look for discounts oftentimes hotels offer additional savings for aaa and aarp members students military personnel and their families teachers and other groups join a private sale site sign up for a luxury discounthotels site such as jetsetter which offers exclusive membersonly discounts at the finest properties throughout the world bookingbuddy allows you to search various partner sites at once so you can compare the prices and options offered offers and savings are based on information available on these

price rules regulations or restrictions surrounding the price please read all rules and regulations before booking always get lowprice guarantees you may have seen low or bestprice guarantees for hotel rooms but what does that lowprice guarantee for hotels actually mean the answer as youll see below is a little complicated bestprice guarantees for hotels promise the following the price you pay for your hotel room is the lowest available you wont find a cheaper rate for that hotel room during your preferred travel dates anywhere else if you find a lower price for your hotel room after booking you can get that cheaper rate a refund in the amount of the difference or a fixedguarantee payout but how can competing hotel providers all guarantee to have the best price for the same hotel room you ask the answer is simple they all have plenty of out built in to their guarantees to get around those promises for example most hotel providers only honor identical apples to apples claims eg sameclass room for the same travel period etc with absolutely no room for deviation maybe youre staying two nights someone else could be getting a better price for one or three nights the refund process for hotel price guarantees is typically lengthy and confusing you might be able to get a refund for said hotel room but youll have to work hard for it so how do you know that youre truly getting the lowest price for your hotel room by comparing hotel prices across several providers thats how shopping around is the closest there is to a foolproof strategy for booking the best hotel
