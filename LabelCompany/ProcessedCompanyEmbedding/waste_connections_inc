permian bakken and eagle ford basins waste connections serves more than six million residential commercial industrial and exploration and production customers from a network of operations in  states six provinces and the district of columbia the company also provides intermodal services for the movement of cargo and solid waste containers in the pacific northwest our corporate strategy targets secondary and suburban markets that have strong demographic growth trends and where competitive barriers to entry can be developed we seek to avoid highly competitive large urban markets and target markets where we can provide either nonintegrated or integrated solid waste services under exclusive arrangements or markets where we can be integrated and attain high market share we are a leading provider of solid waste services in most of our markets and approximately  of our revenues are derived from market areas where we have franchise or exclusive rights to provide our waste services we seek to avoid highly competitive large urban markets and instead target markets where we can attain high market share either through exclusive contracts vertical integration or asset positioning we also target niche markets like exploration and production or ep waste treatment and disposal services with similar characteristics and we believe higher comparative growth potential we are a leading provider of waste services in most of our markets and the key components of our operating strategy which are tailored to the competitive and regulatory factors that affect our markets are as follows target secondary and rural markets by targeting secondary and rural markets we believe that we are able to garner a higher local market share than attainable in more competitive urban markets which reduces our exposure to customer churn and improves financial returns in certain niche markets like ep waste treatment and disposal early mover advantage in certain rural basins may improve market positioning and financial returns given the limited availability of existing third partyowned waste disposal alternatives control the waste stream in markets where waste collection services are provided under exclusive arrangements or where waste disposal is municipally owned or funded or available at multiple sources we believe that controlling the waste stream through the provision of collection services is often more important to our profitability and growth than owning or operating landfills in addition in certain ep markets with “no pit” rules or other regulations that prohibit onsite storage or treatment of waste control of the waste stream allows us to generate additional service revenue from the transportation of waste as well as the waste treatment and disposal thus increasing the overall scope and value of the services provided optimize asset positioning we believe that the location of disposal sites within competitive markets is a critical success factor in both solid waste and ep waste services given the importance and costs associated with the transportation of waste to treatment and disposal sites having disposal capacity proximate to the waste stream may provide a competitive advantage and serve as a barrier to entry provide vertically integrated services in markets where we believe that owning landfills is a strategic element to a collection operation because of competitive and regulatory factors we generally focus on providing integrated services from collection through disposal of solid waste in landfills that we own or operate similarly we see this strategic advantage in ep waste services where we offer closed loop systems for liquid and solid waste storage transportation treatment and disposal manage on a decentralized basis we manage our operations on a decentralized basis this places decisionmaking authority close to the customer enabling us to identify and address customers’ needs quickly in a costeffective manner we believe that decentralization provides a lowoverhead highly efficient operational structure that allows us to expand into geographically contiguous markets and operate in relatively small communities that larger competitors may not find attractive we believe that this structure gives us a strategic competitive advantage given the relatively rural nature of many of the markets in which we operate and makes us an attractive buyer to many potential acquisition candidates we believe the solid waste service business is a local business managed by professionals living and working in the communities we serve we strive to provide service excellence for those communities that place their trust in our company and are always dedicated to putting our customers first company about us waste

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
