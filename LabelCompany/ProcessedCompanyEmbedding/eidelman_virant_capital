winning characteristics special situations investor psychology mean reversion incentives investment process step  spot opportunities step  apply philosophy step  rigorous research step  construct portfolio step   conduct rigorous analysis our core values and years of experience have shaped what we focus on during our intensive analysis and our interpretation of the information we uncover  we begin by determining what will be the key drivers of earnings cash flow and price appreciation going forward we scrutinize the financial statements and sec filings including a careful review of the footnotes looking for red flags and other discrete material information that others may overlook  after gaining a great understanding of the company we often speak directly with management  this is one of the best ways to get answers to our pointed questions and clarification on issues brought to light during our research finally we always ask ourselves the question “why buy now”  we look to buy companies with a catalyst which could be a driver of imminent price appreciation catalysts may include the introduction of a new exciting product hiring of improved management corporate restructuring extreme investor sentiment and other substantial corporate events throughout our analysis we add a healthy dose of skepticism  we even seek out opinions that differ from our own  after we have a full understanding of the other perspectives we are better able to objectively come to a conclusion stocks that pass the test of our rigorous analysis are worthy of inclusion in our clients’ portfolios
