start the book the next day although i am in education not business i realized that many of the principles this book discusses can be applied in the business world in the education world and in life at home the premise of this book is declared right away incorporating the authors’ own suggestion to declare intent “they people and companies can sense that their lives would be a lot better their jobs a lot more fulfilling and their personal relationships a lot more joyful if they could only operate in an environment of high trust” page  the book is divided into three parts to address this issue the first section sets up the problem with statistics and examples of low trust the question is posed regarding if a lack of trust hurts companies and countries economically this section also introduces smart trust “a competency and a process that enables us to operate with high trust in a low trust world it minimizes risk and maximizes possibilities it optimizes two key factors  a propensity to trust and  analysis” page  the next section discusses how individuals and companies can enact smart trust giving multiple examples of companies and individuals who did just that the final section challenges readers to establish smart trust as well as summarizes the previous two parts throughout the book the text is broken up by graphs images and key quotes the graphs images and a few quotes are helpful however i found that most of the quotes only served to disrupt the flow of my reading and i eventually started skipping those quotes all together since i am sure the authors purposely chose those quotes i would suggest that perhaps the quotes at the end of the section would be more beneficial on the other hand i liked the anecdotes from the authors’ personal experiences that were placed throughout the book even if they interrupted the text this book would probably be a great book for a small group within a company to read meet discuss and implement actions suggested in the book each chapter ends with insightful questions that could lead to businessaltering and lifealtering reflection and answers overall this book managed to capture and keep my attention i was

getting burned in a low trust world the analysis involves  components opportunity risk and credibility the authors use these components to launch into a discussion of the smart trust matrix citing a number of examples the chapter ends with examples of the reciprocity of trustthe next several chapters deal with the five smart trust actions• choose to believe in trust the authors delve into the three beliefs of trust a belief in being worthy of trust a belief that most people can be trusted a belief that extending trust is a better way to lead• start with self based on the principles of responsibility and creditability• declare your intent and assume positive intent in others stating what we want to do and why we want to do it • do what you say you are going to do• lead out in extending trust to others it produces results it increases trust and it elicits reciprocity the authors end with a chapter on how one person can make a changemy recommendation is that while this book

stretched out to  pages and that makes for some dull readingi can appreciate the challenge rebecca merrill the actual writer had crafting a book out of very little material in fact i think the book gains from her regular repetition of the phrase prosperity energy and joy because it is an everpresent reminder of why we should work so hard to earn and extend trust she does well with that its all
