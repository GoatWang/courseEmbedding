background graduate  united states military academy west points role in our nations history dates back to the revolutionary war when both sides realized the strategic importance of the commanding plateau on the west bank of the hudson river general george washington considered west point to be the most important strategic position in america washington personally selected thaddeus kosciuszko one of the heroes of saratoga to design the fortifications for west point in 8 and washington transferred his headquarters to west point in  continental soldiers built forts batteries and redoubts and extended a ton iron chain across the hudson to control river traffic fortress west point was never captured by the british despite benedict arnolds treason west point is the oldest continuously occupied military post in america several soldiers and legislators including washington knox hamilton and john adams desiring to eliminate americas wartime reliance on foreign engineers and artillerists urged the creation of an institution devoted to the arts and sciences of warfare president thomas jefferson signed legislation establishing the united states military academy in 8 he took this action after ensuring that those attending the academy would be representative of a democratic society colonel sylvanus thayer the father of the military academy served as superintendent from 8l8 he upgraded academic standards instilled military discipline and emphasized honorable conduct aware of our young nations need for engineers thayer made civil engineering the foundation of the curriculum for the first half century usma graduates were largely responsible for the construction of the bulk of the nations initial railway lines bridges harbors and roads after gaining experience and national recognition during the mexican and indian wars west point graduates dominated the highest ranks on both sides during the civil war academy graduates headed by generals such as grant lee sherman and jackson set high standards of military leadership for both the north and south the development of other technical schools in the postcivil war period allowed west point to broaden its curriculum beyond a strict civil engineering focus following the creation of army postgraduate command and staff schools the military academy came to be viewed as the first step in a continuing army education in world war i academy graduates again distinguished themselves on the battlefield after the war superintendent douglas macarthur sought to diversify the academic curriculum in recognition of the intense physical demands of modern warfare macarthur pushed for major changes in the physical fitness and intramural athletic programs every cadet an athlete became an important goal additionally the cadet management of the honor system long an unofficial tradition was formalized with the creation of the cadet honor committee eisenhower macarthur bradley arnold clark patton stilwell and wainwright were among an impressive array of academy graduates who met the challenge of leadership in the second world war the postwar period again saw sweeping revisions to the west point curriculum resulting from the dramatic developments in science and technology the increasing need to understand other cultures and the rising level of general education in the army in  president johnson signed legislation increasing the strength of the corps of cadets from  to  more recently reduced to  to keep up with the growth of the corps a major expansion of facilities began shortly thereafter another significant development at west point came when enrollment was opened to women in  sixtytwo women graduated in the class of 8 to include andrea hollen rhodes scholar just as women are a vital and integral part of the us army so they are at west point in recent decades the academys curricular structure was markedly changed to permit cadets to major in any one of more than a
