and we are excited to continue to play an important role in the companys growth said david mott head of the healthcare practice at nea and chairman of ardelyx since our initial investment in  ardelyx is transforming into an emerging biotech company with a pipeline of proprietary and novel drug candidates that have a clear path to commercialization the company has an exceptional team that can advance its clinical programs and execute on its business strategy mr mott added given the extensive expertise of the ardelyx team in developing and commercializing minimallyabsorbed products including polymers in the cardiorenal field we are uniquely positioned to develop an improved potassium binder to manage hyperkalemia in chronic kidney and heart disease patients noted mike raab president and ceo of ardelyx together with tenapanor and rdx our small molecule hyperkalemia program rdx is an exciting program that augments a formidable pipeline of innovative products this is a pivotal point in the history of ardelyx and an exciting time for our company as we focus our efforts towards building a commerciallydriven fullyintegrated company with whollyowned products to transform the treatment paradigm in the indications that they treat in a separate press release the company announced today it has regained from astrazeneca the worldwide development and commercialization rights for its latestage development candidate tenapanor and its related portfolio of nhe compounds proceeds from the private placement will be used to develop tenapanor and rdx two whollyowned programs that have the potential to be in phase  clinical trials in the fourth quarter of  and second half of  respectively  about the private placement ardelyx will sell approximately  million shares of the common stock and warrants to purchase approximately  million shares of common stock for aggregate gross proceeds of approximately  million in the private placement the price to

the company expects the offering to close by june   subject to satisfaction of specified customary closing conditions leerink partners llc is acting as the sole placement agent of the offering and wedbush pacgrow acted as a financial advisor to ardelyx in connection with this offering the securities to be sold in this private placement have not been registered under the securities act of  as amended or any state securities laws and will be sold in a private placement pursuant to regulation d of the securities act the securities may not be offered or sold in the united states absent

resale of the shares of common stock acquired by the investors and shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants acquired by the investors about rdx rdx is a novel nonabsorbed polystyrene sulfonate polymer being developed by ardelyx to treat elevated potassium or hyperkalemia a potentially dangerous problem common among patients with chronic kidney disease ckd and heart failure rdx is designed with improved chemical and physical properties as well as formulation improvements that may allow for a more palatable dosage form the company will be pursuing a b regulatory pathway in the united states for rdx allowing ardelyx a faster path to approval by referencing the literature and the us food and drug administrations previous findings of safety and effectiveness of the referenced drug product  ardelyx will supplement this approach with nonclinical and phase  clinical data on rdx to provide information for inclusion in the product label the company plans to progress rdx into late stage clinical development over the next  months   ardelyx will begin early stage clinical trials in mid  assuming the successful completion of those trials the company expects to commence a phase  clinical program to evaluate rdx for treatment in hyperkalemia patients as early as the second half of  ardelyx is also continuing research on its rdx small molecule drug candidate for hyperkalemia  this agent a potential potassium secretagogue is intended to enhance potassium secretion or prevent potassium absorption with a much lower pill burden than potassium binders and may provide significant advantages as a standalone agent or used in combination with the potassium binders including rdx  additional details on rdx and ardelyxs research and development programs will be presented at ardelyxs upcoming rd investor day planned for july th  in new york ny about hyperkalemia hyperkalemia is defined as the presence of blood potassium levels greater than meql  normal levels are  to  meql  when hyperkalemia is severe or above meql there is a significantly increased risk of death because of the potential for heart conductance problems  hyperkalemia can be caused by a variety of sources  kidney disease can result in the buildup of potassium in the blood  also certain drugs such as the common blood pressure medications known as raas inhibitors or inhibitors of the reninangiotensinaldosterone system can cause hyperkalemia  raas inhibitors though quite effective for controlling blood pressure are often significantly reduced in patients such as in those with ckd and congestive heart failure or chf whose potassium levels are elevated because of the fear that elevated potassium can cause significantly worse problems than hypertension including sudden cardiac arrest in severe cases according to einhorn et al about  and  of patients with ckd stage b and stage  had a hyperkalemic event during a month period suggesting that acute hyperkalemia affects about  individuals with ckd stage b or  in the united states there are approximately  million patients with stage b or  ckd who are taking raas inhibitors and about  of these patients or about  patients tend to have chronic problems with hyperkalemia there are about  million stage b or  ckd patients who are not prescribed raas inhibitors  given that hypertension is present in a majority of these patients the company believes that many of these patients are not prescribed raas inhibitors because of the risk of hyperkalemia  recent data fraser  suggests that of the  of ckd stage  patients with hypertension only  achieved the target of  with over  not taking any raas inhibitors despite their known success in achieving blood pressure control this supports the concept that a million or more ckd patients may be prescribed suboptimal doses of raas inhibitors with at least one reason being the avoidance of hyperkalemia additionally of the  million patients with heart failure over half are prescribed raas inhibitors  again these patients tend to receive suboptimal doses of raas inhibitors suggesting a large opportunity in this market as well conference call  webcast information
