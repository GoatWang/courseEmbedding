exchange act refers to the securities exchange act of  as amended corporate overview history of sino payments inc we were incorporated in the state of nevada on june   under the name china soaring inc on november   we changed the companys name to sino payments inc our initial business was to operate a credit card processing and merchantacquiring services company that provides credit card clearing services to merchants and financial institutions in prc since inception we have strived to implement our initial business plan including the key step of creating our global processing platform sinopay gpp and establishing our website wwwsinopaymentscom the initial business plan has been modified as indicated below as reported above under new developments we are implementing a corporate name change from sino payments inc to value exchange international inc this name change should be consummated twenty  days after the mailing of a definitive information statement which mailing should occur on or before october   as of the date of this quarterly report on form q we seek to help clients improve their business systems and information technology or it effectiveness specifically the companys business is in part to be a provider of internet protocol ip processing services in asia to bank cardaccepting merchants ip business we market our services to local merchants with regional retail locations across asia pacific as potential customers of their ip and related credit card and debit card processing systems we offer interoperability through what is envisioned as a highly efficient infrastructure and perceived exceptional knowledge of the ip processing market through our sinopay gpp platform the sinopay gpp system facilitates the processing of all major credit card types visamcamexdinersdiscoverjcb and will be integrated with china unionpay to provide processing of unionpay debit cards in hong kong sar and prc as of the date of this quarterly report on form q we still have not implemented any ip business to any customer while we have a functioning sinopay gpp system product for sale we have yet to sell any sinopay gpp system to a customer as of the date of this report on form q we will continue to promote the sinopay gpp system but our primary focus is on growing our it business because our strategic decision that it business presents greater growth and profit potential than ip business in the short term further we believe that the sinopay gpp system will require ongoing and potentially expensive marketing and sales effort due to the highly competitive and rapidly changing due in part to the growth and evolution of ecommerce on the internet market for point of sale pos systems and longer sales cycle for pos systems than it business project and consulting sales due to the cost of market penetration for the sinopay gpp we may suspend or reduce promotion of the sinopay gpp from time to time in order to enhance our focus on the it business industry trends and economic conditions the companys experience is that the it business in hong kong sar and prc is large and fragmented comprised of thousands of competitors as well as being a highly competitive industry a general trend affecting our it business is the trend of increasing competition for skilled labor with technical skills with a global economy and foreign competitors seeking to penetrate hong kong sar and prc as markets as well as to tap into new pools of skilled workers in it business we will undoubtedly face increasing competition for skilled workers in it business in the hong kong sar and prc markets we may be unable to afford or effectively compete for necessary skilled workers in hong kong sar and prc and if we are unable to afford or effectively compete for necessary skilled workers our growth and ability to attain and sustain profit operations in the it business may fail we have not experienced any significant problems in recruiting necessary skilled workers in fiscal year  or in year  to date a common problem in the it business is retaining skilled workers throughout the duration of a project or contract due to the global nature of the it business and the growing demand for skilled it business workers a skilled it business worker can often readily find higher paying positions with competitors whether local or foreign while we have not experienced retention problems due primarily to our focus on smaller shorter term it business projects and contracts we may experience retention of skilled worker problems if we grow our it business and undertake longer term more complex it business projects for customers it business is often affected by general economic conditions during periods of economic growth customers tend to spend more for it business products and services during periods of economic contraction or uncertainty such spending is expected to decrease or to be deferred as such the prospective business for our it business is generally greater during periods of economic growth or stability in hong kong sar or prc and decreases during periods of economic decline or stagnant growth or any economic uncertainty in hong kong sar and prc the it business is global and there is a growing capability and infrastructure for companies in a foreign nation to provide it business to customers around the globe as a complement to growth in cloud computing we have not seen any significant impact of cloud computing on our it business in fiscal year  or  to date but we perceive that the expansion of cloud computing could allow foreign customers to provide it business products and services to its cloud computing customers in our hong kong sar and prc core markets we may find it more difficult to compete for it business in hong kong sar and prc if customers of the it business elect to have cloud computing companies host manage repair and enhance it business products software and systems the growth of cloud computing coupled with it business products and services as an ancillary component of the cloud computing menu of products and services could adversely impact our it business in hong kong sar and prc markets the nature of our it business is such that our most significant current asset is accounts receivable from customers our most significant current liabilities are payroll related costs which are generally paid either every two weeks or monthly if the demand for our it business products and services increases we may generally see an increase in our working capital needs as we continue to pay our workers on a weekly or monthly basis while the related accounts receivable are outstanding for much longer than normal payment cycle which may result in a decline in operating cash flows conversely as the demand for our it business products and services declines we may generally see a decrease in our working capital needs as the existing accounts receivable are collected and not replaced at the same level this results in a decline of our accounts receivable balance with less of an effect on current liabilities due to the shorter cycle time of the payroll related items overall outcome will be an increase in our operating cash flows however any such increase would not be sustainable in the event that a local or global economic downturn continued for an extended period in order for us to remain successful in the near term we must continue to maintain and grow our customer base provide highquality service and satisfaction to our existing clients and take advantage of crossselling opportunities within and between the it business and ip business in the current economic environment we must offer our customers with services that are appropriately priced satisfy their needs and provide them with measurable business benefits while we have recently experienced higher demand for our it business products and services we believe that it is too early to determine if developments will translate into sustainable improvements in our pricing or margins for fiscal year  and over the longer term the increasing need for cybersecurity products and technologies may be a future weakness of our current business plan we currently do not have a cybersecurity product and service line beyond consultants engaged to provide cybersecurity consulting services cybersecurity companies may have an advantage over our business model in the future in that cybersecurity companies could leverage their cybersecurity offerings to also sell it business services and products that compete with our it business products and services share exchange on january   we received  of the issued and outstanding shares of in vei chn in exchange for i newly issued  shares of our common stock to the majority stockholder of vei chn and ii  shares of our common stock held by vei chn to be transferred to the majority stockholder of vei chn share exchange this transaction resulted in the owners of vei chn obtaining a majority voting interest in the company the merger of vei chn into the company which had nominal net assets results in vei chn having control of the combined entity for

services to commercial customers in prc and asia pacific region this strategy is based upon our subjective business judgment that the it business presents more opportunities for potential customer
