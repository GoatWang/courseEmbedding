outside of retail we saw strong revenue growth in our national account business as our diversification efforts over the last several years continued to pay off the company continued to win in the

constant currency for the year in refrigeration for the year overall revenue was up  at constant currency and profit was up  refrigeration margin expanded  basis points to  at constant currency north america europe and asia pacific was up lowsingle digits for the year and south america was up midsingle digits in a very tough end market environment turning to the fourth quarter company revenue was

nearly  refrigeration segment profit and margin were also flat in the fourth quarter after strong growth in the first three quarters of the year the parts for  refrigeration in the fourth quarter reflects timing of national account revenue and factory loading of our kysorwarren business while the fourth quarter was flat in refrigeration that business made nice progress in  and we expect progress to continue in  we expect the north america refrigeration market to be up lowsingle digits this year and are targeting another  basis points to  basis points of margin expansion for our refrigeration business in  before i hand it over to joe let me take a moment to make a couple of points on issues that investors have asked a lot about with the new administration potential tax reform and borderadjusted tax or tariffs first on the corporate tax rate given our current  effective tax rate we would be a significant beneficiary from a reduction to  or  we estimate that every  reduction in the tax rate equates to approximately a  benefit to eps for us this would obviously be a significant nearterm and longterm benefit with regard to a potential borderadjusted tax or tariffs we are monitoring closely alternative proposals i would highlight that we have flexibility with our north american residential manufacturing footprint especially with our lowcost assembly factory in south carolina to add capacity in us invest in factory automation to drive productivity or continue to make additional investments in mexico all depending on what path makes the most economic sense the bottom line is we have action plans in place depending on what policies are set to continue driving margin expansion in our residential business and across lii while there are a lot of headlines daytoday the overall perspective is another year of strong growth and profitability for the company in  and with a strong balance sheet and record cash generation we continue to be well positioned to make investments to drive future growth raise the dividend with earnings and repurchase company stock with  million planned for  now ill turn it over to joe joseph w reitmeier  lennox international inc thank you todd and good morning everyone ill provide some additional comments and financial details on the business segments for the quarter and full year starting with residential heating

distribution expansion and other product costs for the fullyear commercial revenue was a record  million up  volume was up  and price and mix combined was up  and foreign exchange had a negative  impact on revenue segment profit was record  million up  segment profit margin was a record  up  basis points in our refrigeration segment revenue in the fourth quarter was  million up  volume was up  and price and mix combined was down  and foreign exchange had a positive  impact on revenue from a regional perspective todd addressed revenue growth in constant currency on a reported basis south america was up more than  asia was up more than  australia was flat and north america and europe were down lowsingle digits refrigeration segment profit was  million up  segment profit margin was flat at  segment profit was positively impacted by lower material and other product costs offsets included lower factory productivity and higher sga for the fullyear refrigeration revenue was  million up  volume was up  and price and mix combined was down  foreign exchange had a negative  impact segment profit was  million up  segment profit margin was  up  basis points and as todd mentioned the fourth quarter reflects timing of national account revenue and factory loading at the kysorwarren business after a strong  overall for refrigeration we see the fourth quarter as the pause and continue to expect solid growth of  basis points to  basis points in margin expansion for that business in  regarding special items in the fourth quarter the company had net aftertax charges of  million with  million of that due to previously announced onetime lump sum pension buyout program to certain vested participants for the full year the company had net aftertax special charges totaling  million beyond the  million pension buyout other items included  million for asbestosrelated litigation and  million in special contingency charges corporate expenses were approximately  million in the fourth

a debt to ebitda ratio of  times cash and cash equivalents were  million at the end of the year before i turn it over to qa ill review our outlook for  one month into the year our underlying market assumptions for  remain the same for the overall industry we expect north american residential hvac shipments to be up midsingle digits we expect north america commercial unitary shipments to be up lowsingle digits and we expect north america refrigeration shipments to be up lowsingle digits based on this underlying market environment and our targets for market share gains revenue growth guidance for lennox international remains  to  for  with a minimal impact from foreign exchange our guidance for eps from continuing operations for the full year remains a range of  to  now let me run through the key points in our guidance assumptions and the puts and takes for  which remain the same as we first set out in mid december we continue to expect  million in savings from our sourcing and engineeringled cost reduction programs we expect  million in savings from our manufacturing operations in mexico from actions that have already been taken and we expect residential mix to be a  million benefit for the year we continue to expect  million of headwind from commodities in  and are targeting  million in price increases for the year we have assumed a minimal impact from foreign exchange and well monitor that closely as the year progresses just a few more other guidance points that are unchanged corporate expense is expected to be approximately  million we still expect net interest expense for the year of about  million our effective tax rate guidance remains approximately  on a fullyear basis we continue to expect the weighted average diluted share count for the full year to be between  million to  million shares which includes our plans to repurchase  million of stock this year capital expenditures are expected to be approximately  million for the year and we are targeting free cash flow of  million for  and with that well go to qa questionandanswer session operator thank you looks like our first question comes from the line of tim wojs of baird your line is open timothy ronald wojs  robert w baird  co inc hi good morning guys nice job on the quarter todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc thanks tim joseph w reitmeier  lennox international inc good morning tim thanks timothy ronald wojs  robert w baird  co inc i guess just to start todd maybe you could comment a little bit on how q is trending to date and then i know q seasonally is a little bit of a weaker quarter relative to the rest of the year but just how should we think of q eps as maybe percentage of the full year todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc on the first part of the question were off to a solid start in q weather has been a bit warmer in january than it was last year but you always quite frankly worry a little bit when you sort of push or not push but have such a strong december that maybe you pulled something from the beginning of the year but thats not the case off to a nice start but march is the most important month of the quarter with   of the revenue in that quarter in terms of first quarter i would just sort of model it similar to what weve done in history youre right its our lowest seasonal quarter and i would just look at the last two or three years the percentage of our profits in first quarter and those are not going to be any different in any meaningful way this year timothy ronald wojs  robert w baird  co inc okay and then just maybe just a biggerpicture question just with the  to  revenue guidance range for the year what would be the swing factors to get to kind of the top and the bottom to those ranges todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc weather always is a big swing factor and so if you remember last year we should have started out cool and then it got warmer as the year progressed so weather is a swing factor and then the other is how is this for an understatement there is macroeconomic and political uncertainty so there is some risk there also timothy ronald wojs  robert w baird  co inc okay great well good luck on  i appreciate it todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc okay thanks operator and our next question comes from the line of steve tusa with jpmorgan your line is open charles stephen tusa  jpmorgan securities llc hey guys good morning on the price cost side is there any update to kind of the price capture you guys are expecting in  maybe just give us a little bit of color around what youre seeing out there as far as the range of the increases that are out there and whether or not  is kind of forced to the high end of those ranges given where commodity has gone  todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc as joe talked about and reiterated our guide that we gave in december that right now were guiding that were going to have  million of headwind from commodities and  million of price benefit we announced the  price increase for lennox commercial effective november   and then the  to  price increase for lennox residential effective january  and in our other businesses similar things obviously thats the big umbrella that we announced but were very confident were going to get to  million you know and youve seen our competitors have all done similar things everybody understands the increasing commodity cost and the need to go out and get price so were confident were going to be able to go do that charles stephen tusa  jpmorgan securities llc yeah and those are higher than kind of normal type of numbers right than in previous years todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc i think the announcement is – we tend to announce   i think getting  million is higher than what we did last year but in prior years weve gotten  million  million in price when theres been commodity shocks charles stephen tusa  jpmorgan securities llc what was the price you got in  just price not mix todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc im turning to the team you asked me a question im – we were sort of rough  – i think for resi we said were going to be flat and then overall for the corporation we had positive price charles stephen tusa  jpmorgan securities llc okay and on the resi incrementals obviously you crushed it here in the fourth quarter how much of that is coming from kind of the new products that youve designed where you have done a great job of taking the cost out of those and not necessarily reinvesting all of that cost out and is there anything about the new product kind of phasing in  that was kind of unusually strong todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc i think the driver in the fourth quarter was sort of the drivers weve seen all year for our resi business with one exception i think we had stronger mix up in fourth quarter and so we had some nice mix tailwind for the quarter and again that reflects this move towards premium products the cost takeout we saw all year and again weve been at that for a while so it sort of didnt bunch up in fourth quarter sort of spread throughout the year and then we had another quarter of commodity tailwind and obviously as we go into  maybe early in the year well continue to have a little bit of tailwind but then as we get to the second half of the year it will start to be a headwind but again just overall strong performance from the resi team were able to surge on revenue and not add a whole lot of cost in overhead or factory to be able to do that just a wellrun business charles stephen tusa  jpmorgan securities llc okay and then one last question it seems like a lot of your peers some of the smaller guys have kind of revamped their product lines are you seeing that have any kind of impact from a share perspective maybe a little bit tougher to eke out market share with some of the guys that had been lagging historically thinking like kind of the yorks and the reams  are you seeing any initial impacts from their kind of reinvestments here todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc no i mean the longer answer is from the time somebody launches a new product given the distribution buffer and sort of all the touch points you have with the dealer its not coming out with the iphone and you swing huge share number one number two is i often joke from the time something is announced at mount olympus from one of our competitors to the dealers tested and get comfortable to quality and make sure it works and performs the way it takes a while and so theyre refreshing their product but guess what so are we our product innovation and our hvac businesses are over  of product – sales from product we launched in the last three years so we think the gap between our product and others is increasing not closing charles stephen tusa  jpmorgan securities llc okay great thanks a lot todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc thanks operator and our next question comes from the line of julian mitchell of credit suisse your line is open julian mitchell  credit suisse securities usa llc broker hi good morning i guess my first question really on the commercial business you had a very nice acceleration in q versus the preceding sort of six months youre guiding for sort of lowsingledigit growth in north america commercial unitary this year maybe just give us some sense around any shifts you saw in recent months in terms of the noises from customers the distribution channel how do you feel about that piece of your business in the us right now todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc we feel good going into  theres more of a natural chunkiness or choppiness to the business given some of the large orders from some of the large customers but again we had a nice second half of the year in commercial especially fourth quarter we had talked about earlier in the year some of the school business being pushed out to december and thats what we saw but order intake and backlog remains nice and strong as we enter  julian mitchell  credit suisse securities usa llc broker thank you and then just my followup would be on refrigeration you emphasized a sort of a pause a couple of times in the fourth quarter when youre thinking about how refrigeration plays out in  do you think that sort of pause continues into the first quarter or first half or you think we should see a fairly kind of levelloaded year in that business in terms of the revenue and margin progression that you talked about joseph w reitmeier  lennox international inc i think similar to commercial there can be some choppiness in the business i think i would highlight the change yearoveryear from  to  on why we saw the pause was third quarter was a much larger national account quarter for us than fourth quarter was in  and the opposite was true in  so as we enter first quarter were optimistic with what were seeing for order rates and backlog and we think were going to have a nice year in refrigeration and again weve guided that the market is going to be up lowsingle digits in north america and it can add another  basis points to  basis points to margin julian mitchell  credit suisse securities usa llc broker and just following up on refrigeration the factory loading item you talked about any more details joseph w reitmeier  lennox international inc tied to the same point large customer in arkansas the timing between third and fourth quarter last year versus this year youre building a product and so you get lots of factory absorption and benefit from those orders and then when its in a different quarter the next year you get the benefits at a different time julian mitchell  credit suisse securities usa llc broker great thank you joseph w reitmeier  lennox international inc thanks operator and our next question comes from the line of jeff hammond of keybanc your line is open jeffrey hammond  keybanc capital markets inc hey good morning guys joseph w reitmeier  lennox international inc hey jeff todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc good morning jeff jeffrey hammond  keybanc capital markets inc okay so just on residential i mean you guys talked certainly about weather issues at your analyst meeting i just want to get behind a little bit what really drove the strength given some of those dislocations and really maybe if you look more broadly second half really a nice acceleration here what do you really see inflecting todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc i think as often the case i think the markets solid and strong new construction being up replacement demand i know you were at our industry trade show when you walk around and talk to people people feel very confident number two is the weather got cold and then three is i think were performing all the things that weve talked about over the years just continues to be a virtual cycle we continue to build out partsplus we tend to put the partsplus stores frontend load them and so we have them in place as we go into the second half of the year the investment in controls the investment in lennoxpros our ability to convert dealers when you win dealers you win them during the dealer conversion period which is before the summer selling season and then it takes five six seven months to ramp them up and i think that you see that in the second half of the year but again i think our resi team is performing very well jeffrey hammond  keybanc capital markets inc okay and then just on emergency replacement you guys have done well there and very focused i would say the observation at these shows is more people seem to be focused there so are you seeing that space get any more crowded as you look into  todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc i think others are involved and coming out with product i think the thing i would underline is things that we can do – i think were absolutely at sort of the lowcost point and others i think could get close to us or match us but i cant imagine they can get below us given our factory in arkansas given the design of the product two is the buildout of our partsplus strategy for res and our ability to serve commercial customer same day i think is unique and then third is we really increased our focus on serving that segment carrier has been doing it forever but some of these other folks who are getting in some emergency replacement they may have the product they may even have physical distribution but the marketing programs and the focus of having a separate sales force for these smaller atonce emergency contractors weve gotten better and better at it and we said when we launched this will be a multiyear strategy and it continues to be the case and i know others are in it but we continue to win jeffrey hammond  keybanc capital markets inc great thanks a lot todd operator and our next question comes from the line of ryan merkel your line is open ryan j merkel  william blair  co llc thanks todd so first i want to talk about incremental margins i know in  youre targeting  but should we expect stronger results in the first half versus the second half just based on comparisons and is there any other considerations youd have us think about todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc i think thats what i would do i mean just given the commodity profile that all of us can model when you think about the hedges i think thats sort of the only thing that i would adjust for we – the weather is the other wild card but thats hard to model that so i think i would take what weve done over the last couple years maybe pull forward a little bit during the first half of the year because of commodities ryan j merkel  william blair  co llc okay great and then secondly on r allocations going down again in  i know its not a big category for you but was that – how are you going to offset that is the first question and then secondly do you expect the decline in the r availability to continue to push for more full replacements to ra next year todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc i think were really to the other side of that i mean from a regulatory pointofview youre not able to do dry charge units anymore and so when – really the r equation just becomes a question of if you have an old system and you want it to limp along but typically – not typically what will happen will be those systems are old enough now and the efficiency is low enough itd be silly if you had a catastrophic failure compressor failure to try and fix the compressor and then have it limp along by recharging the system so i think were really to the other side of that as of midyear  ryan j merkel  william blair  co llc okay and just lastly on walmarts plans for commercial and refrigeration in  any clarity there that you can provide todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc no i mean we continue to be a major supplier to them on the hvac side lesser percentage of their business is on refrigeration but theyre still very important customer to us and sort of our – from their lips to our ears is in our fullyear guidance i think they continue to sort of rethink as they go along maybe what theyre going to do but – so their best guess is what our best guess is and theyre an important customer and well see how it plays out ryan j merkel  william blair  co llc okay thank you todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc thanks operator and our next question comes from the line of gautam khanna with cowen  company your line is open gautam khanna  cowen and company llc yes thanks good morning todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc hey gautam gautam khanna  cowen and company llc following up on the last question with the walmart ex the refrigeration is there anything structural lead up that prevents kysor warren to get into the segment average refrigeration margin and if i recall it finally broke even right in q or q so maybe  todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc yeah i mean weve obviously had trouble with this business we took a writedown last year clearly on the right direction major driver of our plus basis point improvement in refrigeration it can clearly be – our overall margin in refrigeration is   it can clearly get to that level when you look at what hill phoenix which is part of dover has done and in prior years what hussmann has done so were focused on that and think were doing all the right things around cost reduction and focus on material cost reduction as well as innovative product alternative refrigerant systems so were confident were doing all the right things to drive the profitability of the business gautam khanna  cowen and company llc is it in the black now and how dependent is it just on customer mix ie you already go along in the restructuring and the product rationalization is it now just a function of you need your big customers to buy the stuff that you want them to buy and not somebody will commoditize products todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc without being too glib i mean ive never run a business where the customer mix wasnt the important thing and so kysor warren just like all our other businesses we got to get customers we got to have profitable customers and were moving in that direction and were focused on that gautam khanna  cowen and company llc and is it in the black now todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc i mean not in low seasonal quarters but were making money in kysor warren gautam khanna  cowen and company llc last question just on ma can you talk a little bit about what youre seeing if anything in the pipeline and what types of assets might interest you todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc no were very selective and i think we have this luxury that we can continue to expand margins in our businesses that we own and we play in end markets that are growing low to midsingle digits and we can grow revenue like we did this year in the last four five years of  to  a year our focus on ma hasnt changed if we could consolidate the north america unitary hvac market we would love to do it but its only a handful of assets and someone will have to decide they wanted to get out we – for the right business wed do something in europe we have an improving team there and if we could grow our business in europe through acquisitions we might want to do something and then the third one would be in commercial service weve done some deals over the years but organically were growing so again wed be very selective there gautam khanna  cowen and company llc thanks todd todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc thanks operator and our next question comes from the line of rich kwas of wells fargo your line is open deepa b n raghavan  wells fargo securities llc good morning this is deepa raghavan for rich kwas i have a question on refrigeration trend one of your competitors called out some mix headwinds some pricing there too not all translates to you we understand that but trying to get a sense for the confidence you have in getting  bps to  bps margin expansion potential how much of that is internal initiatives versus how much of that is macrodependent todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc i think its a little bit of both i mean our competitors im sure you probably talk – i assume youre talking about hill phoenix its – i mean thats a display case business thats maybe   of our refrigeration business we do a lot of other things cold room storage international business convenience stores and those businesses continue to grow and margin expand and we have the right customers so again from an overall perspective its obviously a combination of both the selfhelp and customers but we feel pretty good about the margin expansion in refrigeration we said at least  basis points this year and we did  basis points deepa b n raghavan  wells fargo securities llc okay residential revenue is pretty strong in q just given weather was not favorable early part and obviously – just curious was demand more december weighted or did you experience any electionrelated pause or was it an even quarter any color on trends within q would be helpful todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc it was driven by the cold weather second half november and december i dont think the election had any impact at all i think we just – it got cold and the dealers were waiting for it to get cold and it got cold and we sold product deepa b n raghavan  wells fargo securities llc okay my last one any updates to your outlooks post your analyst day anything youre seeing on quoting activities on the nonresidential side or residential or any verticals that you think picked up pace or anything that slowed since your analyst day todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc no i think its steady as she goes i mean joe reiterated all the financial guidance points its just – its early in the year as we get into the season well find out more but as we talk to our customers and were getting ready to start dealer meetings people feel very confident as we go into  deepa b n raghavan  wells fargo securities llc all right thank you very much todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc thanks operator and the next question comes from the line of robert mccarthy of stifel your line is open robert mccarthy  stifel nicolaus  co inc good morning everyone congratulations on the solid quarter todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc thanks robert joseph w reitmeier  lennox international inc thanks robert mccarthy  stifel nicolaus  co inc yeah two questions i guess one i think steve spoke to it but is there anything particularly in the quarter you mentioned the mix i mean obviously they could compare but anything else that you would just kind of cite in terms of incremental market share gains or anything for the strength across the board in terms of the revenues todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc no i mean its sort of what i said in our residential business and we heard some of our other competitors announce i think we gained share in fourth quarter thats certain in commercial i think we probably gained share and again it reflects all the good things were doing in the business there is no silver bullet to our strategy its three or four things weve talked about over a multiyear period that we continue to do to innovate to build out distribution and to focus on our channel partners and we had nice momentum in fourth quarter as we did in the full year robert mccarthy  stifel nicolaus  co inc yeah and i know you love talking about the internet of things and pieinthesky technology investments now that being said maybe you could talk about the investments you are making in distribution that are kind of technology or productivity related and do you think this is going to continue to be just kind of a strong market share driver over the next couple years anything to add there would be helpful todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc not to be sean spicer but just for the record i dont like to talk about internet of things and pieinthesky investments what id like to talk about is in investments that were investing to allow for ease with our dealer contractors and you were at our december analyst day and saw what were doing with lennoxpros to do prognostics and diagnostics and training and thats just part of our business now and we have a strong team on the it side and the engineering side and in our sales and marketing side so thats a big part of the investment and how we will continue to gain share going forward robert mccarthy  stifel nicolaus  co inc drive safe todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc thanks operator and the next question comes from the line of shannon ocallaghan with ubs your line is open shannon ocallaghan  ubs securities llc good morning guys todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc hey shannon shannon ocallaghan  ubs securities llc hey todd just relative to the scenario planning and ability to flex or pivot depending on tax law changes i mean how fast could you do that whats the capacity in south carolina how difficult is it to maneuver maybe just a little bit more color on what it would take todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc weve been very purposeful even before sort of all this happened to make sure we had a balance between us and mexico just given risks prior risks in that concern about mexico if you look at hours worked for our equipment business for residential a little under a quarter of our business comes out of south carolina today so its a wellrun large factory the other thing to always think about is we build product prior to the demand we build inventory and so if things change we could sort of ramp up the factory and start building inventory for the following season prior to what we normally would do and we could trade inventory load for product cost and then over a longer period of time we can move production there we have the people we have the capabilities we build everything we build there in terms of our residential product line so again well see how it plays out i mean what i wanted to convey in my comments is we have action plans and ive looked at the different scenarios whether its moving more south carolina as we just – as you asked and i answered or invest in factory automation both in iowa and in south carolina to lower our costs or continue to make investments in mexico depending on which way the policy goes but almost under any scenario were going to continue to drive margin expansion in our residential business and across lii shannon ocallaghan  ubs securities llc okay great thanks and then just one followup on the cold weather into the quarter i know a lot was kind of riding on december for the heating business was that – how unusually strong was that versus a typical december i mean was it – relative to the last couple decembers was it – i know last december was notably warm but relative to normal would you characterize it as extra strong todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc if you look at heating degree days it was actually a little warmer than average about  warmer than average but it was  warmer than last year so when i think about the comps going into next year which i assume is why youre asking the question it was sort of a normal december it was just so warm in  that the yearoveryear comp was very good shannon ocallaghan  ubs securities llc great thanks todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc thanks operator and our next question comes from the line of josh pokrzywinski of buckingham research joshua pokrzywinski  the buckingham research group inc hi good morning guys todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc hey josh joshua pokrzywinski  the buckingham research group inc on the most of the dealer meetings that you alluded to todd how are those discussions going are your dealers bringing up any of their own personal i guess contingencies or thoughts around mexico production does that factor into the equation or is that kind of out of their orbit yet without any specifics in policy todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc oh they could care less josh i mean my read as we moved down to mexico six years – five years six years seven years ago and when carrier moved to mexico before that i mean dealers want a highquality product at the right price it could be made on the moon for all they care and weve done that with mexico and theyre fine and then our sense was utx and carrier took a lot of public browbeating over their announcement in indianapolis from everything we can tell that had zero impact on any of their market share i mean the dealers sort of see through all that and they understand its a global economy now if we try and raise prices for mexico by  theyll knock down our door but we would never do that joshua pokrzywinski  the buckingham research group inc got you i wouldnt recommend making anything on the moon i think theres an atmosphere of adjusted tax being proposed and then just a followup on some of the energy efficiency initiatives that get enacted on the commercial side in  i think what percentage of the commercial portfolio do you think would get impacted those kind of being sold at the minimum today that would move up and be calibrated what that looks like and any signs that maybe you could get a prebuy later this year on that basis todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc i dont think therell be much of a prebuy at the end of the year because commercial whether emergency replacement national account sort of any scenario people buy it when they need it very few – because were selling to dealers if youre selling to independent distributors they may carry some minimal load so i dont think therell be any prebuy in terms of the impact i mean weve always focused on high efficiency and well tweak up our entry level product to meet your requirements and we think were well down the curve of doing that i mean the art of this always is when the new minimum efficiency comes out anyone can get there obviously but you want to be there at the lowest cost and we are pretty good at that and we think we are and well be joshua pokrzywinski  the buckingham research group inc got you all right thanks guys todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc thanks operator the next question from the line of walter liptak with seaport global your line is open walter scott liptak  seaport global securities llc hi thanks good morning guys todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc good morning walt walter scott liptak  seaport global securities llc i want to ask about the guidance on the mix the  million i think in  you had kind of a great year for that seer mix were plus seer how did you end the fourth quarter i know its low for cooling but how did the seer mix end and whats your thoughts on  is it tough comp now that weve moved up the way we have todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc were guiding as you suggested  million on residential mix in  and we got some tailwinds second half of the year as the minimum efficiency went from  seer to  seer in the south well get less of a tailwind but some tailwind in the first half of the year but really the focus has been and continues to be to mix people up beyond  seer or the minimum efficiency to  seer  seer  seer we had some natural headwind this year that sort of muted the benefits in the sense of – i mean its good problem to have but residential new construction the market and our sales grew faster than the replacement market and we tend to make – not tend we make higher margins on replacement business so we think were doing all the right things to continue drive mix up and  should be another good year walter scott liptak  seaport global securities llc great and in refrigeration there have been some cstore expansions that were announced i wonder if youve factored that in i dont think there was a change from the december analyst day how are you viewing that cstore business todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc well i think netnet the guide is still the same theres movement there but then theres move – walmart is a big driver of refrigeration sales for all of us and so some movement on convenience stores sort of gets dwarfed by what walmart is going to do or not do certainly in the display case business but again just to underline we continue to be confident in the market being up lowsingle digits were going to expand our margins  basis points to  basis points and we try to wrap all that breaking news into our current guidance walter scott liptak  seaport global securities llc okay all right great thank you operator and the next question comes from the line of robert barry of susquehanna your line is open robert barry  susquehanna financial group lllp hey guys good morning todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc hey robert robert barry  susquehanna financial group lllp hey i think at the analyst day you adjusted the guide and i think it implied q was maybe  or  lower from where it came in so just curious was better than you expected was it really just the weather todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc it was its sort of that simple robert barry  susquehanna financial group lllp got you and can you quantify how much you think the weather helped the resi growth todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc im not sure i put – i think we overshot the consensus revenue number by about  million and we overshot by  or so on eps to be consistent i would tie that to weather robert barry  susquehanna financial group lllp got you any impact either in resi sorry todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc again to repeat what i said to the earlier question i think it was cooler than we thought it would be given how warm it had been early but again the whole quarter was really just sort of an average coolness for winter so as we go into  i think the comps will still be fine robert barry  susquehanna financial group lllp got you got you any impact from maybe some buying ahead of these price hikes either in resi or in commercial todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc no i dont think so i mean again we have a price increase every year january  so you sort of have the yearoveryear window robert barry  susquehanna financial group lllp yeah todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc there is a pull forward that happened last year too the other point is what i mentioned earlier is january started off nice solid i guess is the word i would use and you get concerned maybe you pulled something for it but i dont think that is the case i think they just needed the product to meet demand when it got really cold robert barry  susquehanna financial group lllp got you the refrigeration factory loading how much did that weigh on the margin in the quarter todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc i understand the question im not going to answer it directly i think i would do this – id answer it this way as there was no surprises to us we guided  basis points for the whole year and even in middecember we said  basis points we knew how fourth quarter was going to shake out and had built that into our plans robert barry  susquehanna financial group lllp got you maybe just lastly a strategic question todd i think you mentioned earlier productivity or vitality is tracking in the s maybe even near  i see the benefits of that but it does also imply some fairly rapid obsolescence might there be an opportunity to moderate that investment just given the high level now and still have a very competitive offering todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc i dont think so robert i mean in the sense of rd is   of our pl and thats the lifeblood i dont think you can be a premium player if you cant be able to say to your customer – i mean what we say on our residential product is true high sufficiency lowest noise best reliability best control systems and when you go into a town you want to convert the premium dealers you need to be able to say that we have industryleading claims thats a big part of our strategy and if rd was  i might have a different answer but i dont think the leverage is there i think the difference between  point and  points of rd is well worth the market share gains that were getting that are being driven by the product innovation joseph w reitmeier  lennox international inc and also ill add to that robert that i think part of that vitality is also tied to lower cost products that were continuing to use to enhance profitability todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc thats a good point robert barry  susquehanna financial group lllp i see fair enough great thanks guys congrats on another solid quarter take care operator it looks as if our last question is a followup from the line of steve tusa of jpmorgan your line is open charles stephen tusa  jpmorgan securities llc yeah todd just one more question for you i usually have a pretty reasonable view of whats going on out there and i guess were all looking for a little bit of direction and i dont expect a precise answer to this question but obviously you guys are kind of a bit in i wouldnt say the crosshairs but in the middle of this big debate around taxes et cetera et cetera i mean what are the – what do you think and what are the experts telling you on kind of the likelihood of this actually getting through in the end i mean whats kind of your high level view on the ability for them to kind of execute this in washington todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc the honest answer is i have no idea i think the more constructive answer is ive gotten to the point professional and personally that im not going to listen im going to react whats done and from a business point of view ive sort of implied it in my comments or maybe even explicitly said weve scenario planned about every option we can think of and all those options turn out to increase profitability for us the flexibility of our manufacturing ability to build inventory the fact that we have low cost in south carolina i mean you sort of lay it all out what will happen will happen and were a small flea in this overall environment the administration or the government is going to do what its going to do and then well adjust accordingly and we have a path were going to continue to drive profitability and make money regardless of the scenario charles stephen tusa  jpmorgan securities llc have your experts and consultants and whoever else is running around for you any kind of – whats your view on timing of any of this and on any related news todd m bluedorn  lennox international inc
