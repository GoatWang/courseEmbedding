sixcampus purdue university system purdue was founded on may   as a landgrant university when the indiana general assembly taking advantage of the morrill act accepted a donation of land and money from lafayette businessman john purdue to establish a college of science technology and agriculture in his name the first classes were held on september   with six instructors and  students the university was founded with the gift of  from john purdue a lafayette business leader and philanthropist along with  from tippecanoe county and  acres  km² of land from lafayette residents in support of the project in  it was decided that the new school would be built near the city of lafayette and established as purdue university in the name of the institution’s principal benefactor the west lafayette campus offers more than  majors for undergraduates over  master’s and doctoral programs and professional degrees in pharmacy and veterinary medicine in addition purdue has  intercollegiate

proposal is to understand the structure and mechanism of dopamine betahydroxylase dbh and peptidyl alphaamidating monooxygenase pam the former enzyme dbh is responsible for the formation of norepinephrine a neurotransmitter from dopamine the latter enzyme pam is responsible for the production of bioactive peptide hormones both are classified as cuiiactivated monooxygenases and they use o and ascorbate as cosubstrates the specific aims with dbh are as follows  to determine the nature of the activated oxygen species and copper centers in the chemical mechanism using alternate substrates mechanismbased inhibitors and spectroscopic methods epr spinecho epr exafs  to isolate and determine the structure of the enzyme adducts peptides formed upon inactivation of dbh by several classes of mechanismbased inhibitors  to determine the nature of the transitionstate in the ch bond activation step by determining the intrinsic isotope effect for a series of ring substituted phenethylamine substrates  to clone dbh determine the primary amino acid sequence of the enzyme from the dna sequence and express the active enzyme the specific aims with pam as follows  to establish the role of o in the initial oxidation reaction isotopically labeled o and o and oho will be used to determine if the terminal gly residue of peptides is hydroxylated in the initial step or whether the gly undergoes dehydrogenation h by a cofactor followed by hydrolysis of an imine intermediate  to establish stereochemistry of the hydrogen abstraction step by using chirally labeled rh and sh gly terminated peptides  to synthesize several alphasubstituted terminal gly containing peptides as potential mechanismbased inhibitors with the intention of a determining mechanistic steps in the reaction and b isolating and identifying active site amino acid residues  to improve the purification of the enzyme by isolating monoclonal antibodies to pam for the preparation of antibodylinked sepharose columns  to establish the stoichiometry of peptide substrate o and ascorbate in the formation of alphaamide containing peptide and glyoxylate the role of copper in the reaction will be studied by epr methods   funding agency agencynational institute of health nih institutenational institute of general medical sciences nigms typeresearch project r project rgm application  study
