petroleum and industrial equipment before all of this was possible many pieces had to fall together here’s the story of who and what made meco the company it is today the meco story it all started in  when meco of savannah inc was established by walter matt matthews and his partner james jim nettles as a subsidiary of metal equipment company inc matt hired a couple of salesmen to call on agents for major oil companies in georgia and south carolina the salesmen traveled with their back seats packed with hoses nozzles pipe fittings mechanical computers and hand pumps as sales in savannah grew we knew we had to grow too as a result three main roots sprang forth from savannah— frank futrelle in  root  mike scudder in  root  and rentz woodruff in  root  the addition of these key players combined with increasing requests from augusta and north florida meant that it was time for meco to branch out root  meco of augusta in  frank an aspiring young safety shoe salesman learned about a job opportunity at meco of savannah that would change his life forever he became an outside salesman for matt matthews then in  he partnered with matt and jim as the owners of meco of augusta mike scudder also relocated to augusta to run the inside while frank managed sales business grew and meco of augusta prospered so mike scudder left meco of augusta to partner with matt in the meco of atlanta venture in  frank passed on as a victim of an automobile accident his son jeff futrelle took over the business and continued the meco heritage as a secondgeneration employee in february  jeff opened a branch in greenville south carolina the business continues to prosper and expand while the legacy lives on root  meco of atlanta in  meco of savannah opened a oneman sales office in atlanta georgia in  mike scudder moved to atlanta to take over sales and establish a branch operation in  matt sold his interest in meco of savannah and meco of atlanta to mike scudder and william billy carver in  meco of savannah and meco of atlanta established a branch in montgomery alabama in  mike scudder acquired billy carvers interest in meco of savannah mark scudder moved to savannah georgia to manage this operation in  meco of atlanta acquired the assets of sunbelt hose and equipment company formerly equipment sales company inc in georgia in  meco of atlanta opened a branch in macon georgia carlos mobley is the manager in  when stage ii vapor recovery hit atlanta meco of atlanta was contracted by nearly every major oil company to assist them in meeting these new federal regulations they counted on meco’s experience in the petroleum equipment industry to guide them to compliance in  meco of atlanta opened a branch in albany georgia wayne bell was the manager in  meco of atlanta purchased the assets of florida equipment sales inc in jacksonville florida partners lamar scott and mike meadors manage the newly formed meco of north florida branch meco of atlanta currently has more than  employees mike scudder is the general manager and mark scudder is the manager of sales and branch operations pamela scudder is the comptroller it is under their leadership but with the guidance of mike scudder that meco of atlanta has grown prospered and remains strong root  meco of florence in  rentz woodruff joined meco of savannah in  matt matthews sent rentz to florence south carolina where they opened meco of florence rentz brought along a young service technician from the savannah office named jack brantley in  rentzs son taylor woodruff joined the company as a secondgeneration
