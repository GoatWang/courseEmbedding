his taco mini bikes john had been living in mexico for the last  years and only moved back to the states to san diego after discovering he had cancer the history of john steen’s taco mini bikes would have been lost without the help of lynn wineland  lynn was a long time friend and employee of john steen but not just any employee  not only did lynn help john market his steen’s c synthetic oil back in the late ’s he was the graphic designer for the steen’s catalogs and helped design some of the taco mini bikes one of lynn’s greatest contributions to the taco mini bikes was coming up with the actual metallic purple color another person to help put the pieces back together is donal jolley who worked with lynn at rod and custom as a graphic artist donal’s two biggest contributions were the mexican bean riding the taco and the taco lettering jack poet is one more original steen’s employee who has helped us put the puzzle of ’s so cal history back together jack became steen’s shop foreman around  and designed most of the taco’s along with lynn wineland that we are all familiar with like the taco taco and taco some of the picture you will see were provided by ed kretz jr is a ama grand national champion of the s and ama motorcycle hall of famer and susan steen barr john steens daughter thank you lynn wineland donal jolley jack poet ed kretz jr and susan steen barr for all your help in saving a little bit of so cal history “the history of steen’s chemical and lubricants company” in the beginning this is the history of steen’s chemical and lubricants company a socal company in the ’s that by all accounts made and sold the first synthetic oil in america not to mention creating one of the greatest ’s mini bike brands of all time the  john steen created the company in the late ’s by selling used speed equipment and the synthetic oil formulated by his father in the ’s while working for standard oil as a chemist  prior to this in the early ’s john steen was an off road motorcycle rider john rode with  legendary riders ed kretz jr cliff coleman dave and bud ekin and steve mcqueen and others these are  some of the guys who created the motocross sport on the west cost  around this time john’s dad  passed away leaving him his formula for synthetic oil one side note you would think that with  john’s dad working for standard oil they would own the formula for synthetic oil well they did but  they told him that they were in the oil business not the synthetic oil business and he could have the  formula so john’s father took it john talked to union carbide and worked out a deal to start  making small amounts of this synthetic oil and asked people he knew to try it some people known to try steens c were           ed kretz jr                                                                   catalina grand prix ed kretz jr who ran it in his triumph cub in  at the catalina grand prix and won ed claims that it held the engine together and the engine never ran smoother        richie ginther ran steens c in his ferrari  gt in  at the scca palm springs race richie was in the lead with two laps left when unknowingly ripped off the drain plug from the engine losing all his synthetic oil richie finished the race and won and when they tore down the engine to check the damage there was none john claimed that there were three types of oil “green oil castro bean oil and steen’s oil” making rent in alhambra some time in the late ’s john was involved in a motorcycle accident and injured himself enough that he had to get out of dirt bike racing john is definitely not in a good place at this time he starts working for the los angeles harold examiner delivering news papers to distribution stations for delivery to news stands and homes  worse john is now homeless and sleeping in his delivery truck john is very well known at this point with all of the west coast motorcycle riders and hot rodders of the day  some of his friends at this time were the guys at webco motorcycle accessories tom heininger bob hughes and harry weber their business was located at  east valley blvd alhambra california soon to be steen’s location   webco had moved to venice beach but they had two weeks left  on the rent at the alhambra location they told john he could  move in for the two weeks and if he could get something going  he could take over the lease john moved in and started selling  used speed equipment for motorcycles and cars the speed  equipment came from all the people he knew from the west cost  motorcycle and hot rod community at the time motorcycle  racers and hot rodders would bring their used parts and  equipment to john and he would sell it on consignment through  the store  it was from these sales and  dollars in dimes  collected in a milk bottle that john made his first months rent of  course john was also selling his steen’s c synthetic oil along  with all this used speed equipment john is now on his way to  making rent month to month but there is one big moment to  come that will really get things going acceleration of steen’s c going back to september  art ingles who worked for indianapolis car builder frank kurtis in glendale built what was going to be the first gokart art ingels                                                                         the first gokart in  after seeing art ingles’ oneoff creation duffy livingston and roy debrow of gp muffler services in monrovia california built their own version bill rowles then a salesman of surplus materials in the la area was a frequent visitor at the gp muffler shop bill had located a source of inexpensive engines from a failed west bend and mcculloch rotary lawn mower venture the engines cost about  each the engine did have one small problem the seal on the crank shaft would come lose causing the crank to brake right where the lawn mower blade was attached  this caused the blade to brake lose and fly free sometimes into the ankle of the lawn mower operator  hearing about steen’s c synthetic oil the guys at gp mufflers talk to john about their small engine and wondered if it would work for them john told them that if they used steens c synthetic oil the engine would hold together and run better they tried the steen’s c and the engines held together in late  the popularity of the little car lynn wineland still hasn’t named the “gokart” yet in rod  custom was so great that duffy roy and bill formed a partnership to manufacture and sell  little car kits for  dollars each at the same time the guys asked commercial artist lynn wineland who hung around gp mufflers and was working at rod and custom to come up with a mail order ad for the little car   this is the moment when lynn actually names gp’s little car the “gokart” in a mail order ad in the november  issue of rod and custom by  the business and hobby had exploded overnight and so did steen’s c synthetic oil     the gokart is now selling so fast that the guys move out of the gp muffler shop and start the gokart mfg company  they lease a fiveacre facility in azusa california from aero jet general corporation gokart mfg becomes the leader of this new hobby and steen’s c becomes the necessary accessory for these fast revving  stroke engines if you wanted to win races john now needs to start mass marketing and packaging his steen’s c synthetic oil  he turns to lynn wineland who was suggested to him by the boys at gokart lynn designs a new qt can for steen’s c and an ad campaign for his new synthetic oil birth of the mini cycle    the gokart world is born and it’s on fire john is selling a lot of steen’s c oil but something else is about to happen a few of the guys lynn wineland duffy livingston tom person micky rupp chuck swanson and others started building small two wheel cycles with the same  stroke engines   the guys at gokart mfg start building two models of their own to sell their standard model was the enduro greenhorn powered by the clinton a  stroke and their deluxe model was the big bear scrambler powered by the west bend   stroke they start massproducing these mini cycles gokart mfg is by far the manufacturing giant of gokarts and mini cycles at this time and john is selling more and more of steen’s c     by august of  rod and custom were the first to take notice of the mini cycle just like they did with the gokarts  since lynn wineland is the art director of rod and custom he did an entire article on the new gokart cycle and this new hobby this might actually be the first article about mini bikes but the little twowheel vehicle still is unnamed as a hobby  most of the mini cycles are named after their manufactures with the word cycle added to the end of the name the mini bike was almost named the mini cycle because of this trend     by  john is now fit enough and misses dirt bike riding so much he starts to ride again and eventually he gets back in to competition dirt biking again on the weekends and is back out in the deserts of palmdale lancaster and the mountains of big bear running in “hare and hounds” and “hare and scramble” races john is also sponsoring a lot of these events with his steen’s c oil lynn is also out there but in more of a photojournalist and organizer for the motorcycle and mini cycle race events     in march  rod and custom’s new product section “auto mart” highlighted the viper cycle this might be the first time the name mini bike is used to describe this new hobby in print     motorcycling gokarting midgets and mini cycles are so hot that small companies start popping up all over the country making all kinds of parts and accessories for these new weekend toys  john decides that he should sell all the speed and accessory parts for these new vehicles in one catalog and of course john enlisted lynn’s help to design the first catalog lynn is still working at rod and custom but now he is the editor of the magazine lynn is too busy to work on the new steen’s catalog full time so he hirestom ulher the graphic editor of rod and custom as a freelance graphic artist to help out tom ulher side note the only complete gokart and mini cycle that the steen’s catalog offers was the gokart mfg vehicles   with all of these new mini cycles popping up racing came to everybodies mind we’re not sure who came up with the idea to have a race‚ but lynn wineland was still working at rod  custom created a full page ad announcing the first big west coast mini cycle race in july of  “ the tiny bear”  the tiny bear race was named after the big bear scrambler race and was held at vincent junction off the california hyw   a motorcycle race which started at vincent junction and ran through the desert and all the way up the mountains to fawnskin big bear lake   rod and custom did a whole story on the race in their oct  issue micky rupp came from the east coast to run the race some of the other guys who ran the race were chuck pelly larry hester tom person charles swanson and others this is the race that actually started the mini bike movement more and more guys start to build and ride these new mini cycles some of the earliest models were gokart cycle l’il indian skat kitty falco caper cycle dart cycle viper cycle savage scooter and the  club       in june  karting sport writes the third article announcing this new hobby and sport but still the article states no name yet       business is growing so fast that john has out grown steen’s location   east valley blvd and moves to steen’s location   west valley blvd mini bikes   november  lynn wineland and rod and custom use the term mini bike in an extensive article all about the mini bikes of the day this is the first mini bike buyers guide with a list of the first mini bike manufactures this is the moment the name mini bike really came together     the mexican sandwich    by  the gokart manufacturing company had gone bankrupt the company had grown so fast in the five years it existed that it financially overextended itself into bankruptcy       the flexo products company in los angeles a newer and much smaller catalog like steen’s purchased the gokart manufacturing company’s patents tool and dies for all their gokarts and mini bikes the fox corporation gokarts and mini bikes mfg bought the gokart trademark name and logo                     john steen now decided it was time for him to manufacture his own mini bike john based his decision on the large number of orders steen’s chemical and lubricants had received for mini bikes everyone was crazy about gokarts and there were hundreds of companies competing for the gokart market but not that many mini bike companies  john was a motorcycle rider not a race car driver… so it just seemed to fit   in early  john steen builds his own brand of mini bike  at this point we are not sure who designed the first   and mini bikes the first steen’s minibikes were painted metallic gold bolted together and simply constructed for shipping but they were based on years of crosscountry racing experience john steen did carried the number “” plate for lightweight desert racing in southern california in the ’s before his accident when the mini bike was done john was still without a trademark name for his mini bike and they were built before any sales program had begun lynn being the ad man for steen’s and still the editor of rod and custom informed john that he had to have a name for his new mini bike within a day or he would haved to refile for a new trademark name at the same time john had come down with the hong kong flu and was burning with fever enroute to the doctor’s office he racked his mind for a name semidelirious he looked down the street and saw a large sign that stood on top of a mexican restaurant and advertised “’s the mexican sandwich” when john called from the doctor’s office lynn asked him if he had come up with a name yet john told him “it’s a ” lynn filed the papers for the trademark   lynn brought in donal jolley another rod and custom graphic artist to help out with the work load with lynn and john’s direction donal created the mexican bean on the mini bike the line “it’s a ” was based on the original phone call that john made to lynn to tell him the name of the new mini bike donal also came up with the lettering style for the name  check out donals web site with his current art work at httpwwwjolleyartcomindexcfm                                                             donal jolly                                                                                                 ford pick up rod and custom project car   steen’s chemical and lubricants company catalog  introduced the mini bike just one original design frame model to choose from but there were various engines shocks and rim opinions  a very similar package to the gokart mfg company’s enduro and scrambler mini cycles through these change of events john steen starts building the mini bikes   the color purple the first ’s were painted metallic gold a very popular gokart color but john knew it just wasn’t right lynn knew the right color back in  lynn had seen the doane spencer at the first hot rod car show in los angeles in  well lynn was in the air force and stationed in ohio on his off duty time lynn had started building a  channeled roadster inspired by the doane spencer lynn wineland  in  at the indianapolis hot rod show lynn exhibitived his  lynns  was originally painted black and all the hot rods of the day were black or red lynn wanted his hot rod to be different so he mixed up his own custom metallic purple and painted his    indianapolis hot rod show lynns metallic purple  lynn had extra paint that he had saved and he knew this was the color for the new ’s  he showed john the color and from that moment on mini bikes would be recognized and remembered mostly for this metallic purple… and of course the cast aluminum chain guard cover also designed by lynn in  check out more on lynn at httpwwwkustomramacomindexphptitlelynnwineland in the summer of  john and lynn headed to europe for the th annual international six days trial hosted by east germany the isdt was a test of skill and endurance in all terrain motorcycle riding this was the biggest international motorcycle event of the day hosted by a new country every year even at the height of the cold war this event was so important that the russian would enter riders and host event some of the years       john had join the american team and lynn of course would photo documented the race as he had for the last  years this year would be highly publicized because of another new american team member steve mc queen       after the race john headed back for the states lynn stayed in europe for a little sight seeing before coming home while in italy lynn met with the ceriani family and had setup the north american distribution of ceriani forks and shocks for steen’s this would become a great addition to the supply of hiperformance motorcycle parts steen was now offering                               in the summer of  john return to europe to ride in the th annual international six days trial and lynn return to document the event once again this year was hosted by great britain in the isle of man before coming home lynn went to london to do some sight see during lynn visit he had meet the rickman brothers and this time had secured the north american distribution of rickman metisse parts and accessories once again this was going to be a great addition to the catalog of equipment offered by steen’s finally home by  three new models are introduced the  and  mini bikes are selling faster then john can manufacture them steen’s c oil is still a hot seller and sales from the accessory side of the steen’s catalog are through the roof at this point john is making more money than he knows what to do with but doesn’t have any time to spend his new wealth the building that steen’s is operating out is to small and it’s time to move again hire more employees and incorporate steen’s this time john decides to build his own building a big one that he and lynn design for the assembly of mini bikes this would be the last building steen’s location   west valley blvd  would move to in the summer of  john ran in to an old family friend jack poetker at a car show at the shirian auditorium jack had just finished his time in vietnam with the army john had worked for jacks father who ran a construction company in the s and john knew how skilled and creative jack could be and asked him to come to work as the shop foreman lynn only had been working for john as a freelance employee but in october of  john convinces lynn to leave rod and custom and to start working for him full time lynn agrees to make the move when jack came to work for steen’s he redesign the mini bikes and turn them in to a sturdier welded frame bikes jack and lynn are responsible for the   and later  and t        in  steen’s discountinues the series i taco and the  steen’s is now selling hodaka motorcycles and with all of these motorcycle parts and accessories john decides to build his own custom light weight dirt bikes taking a stock hodaka and stripping it down to the bare frame making some adjustments to it adding ceriani forks and shocks rickman metisse handle bars new exhaust skid plate and a new metallic blue paint job john has made the first and one of the greatest light weight offroad bikes ever the hodaka ss john steen is now what dirt bikes are to what carroll shelby is to mustang     the highest from of flattery mini bikes were becoming so popular that japanese motorcycle companies were buying ’s and sending them back to japan to be examined and copied when the first  production model s were made norm reaves honda bought the first ten and sent them back to japan honda and kawasaki would copy two models honda would copy the with the z and kawasaki would first copy the with the coyote and then the with the mt   other domestic companies would also copy steen’s like janho industries copying the  and with their zebra mini bikes janho even copied steen’s c oil with their own chemically formulated zebra racing oil right down to the chemical flask logo on the can in  steen’s chemical and lubricants is now incorporated and the company name is changed to steen’s inc now john has more time to enjoy himself and spend some of his wealth on a new ferrari daytona     this is the end my friend john will go on to build  different models before selling the company in  to “suburban gas of pomona”     lynn wineland will leave steens around  after the mismanagement and lack of understanding of the vehicles and the hobby in  company is stilled called steen’s and they will produce three new models the super t t and the f matterhorn these models are not mini bikes but mini trail bikes made to compete with the honda z and the kawasaki kt these three new models are the last bikes steen’s will ever introduce for this market        the gokart and mini bike craze is now on the down swing in the ’s the national transprtation safety board was giving the gokart and mini bike hobby a bad name in  suburban gas of pomona decides to sell the company  they sell to alsport an east cost company that wanted to make a move out west alsport now changes the name to alsportsteen one side note to this sale was alsport had no interest in the steen’s c synthetic oil and tugee bought the rights to steen’s c  another funny point about synthetic oil is chevron is listed on internet searches as the first to market and produce a complete range of  synthetic oil in the mid s john was marketing and producing a  synthetic oil back in the mid ’s alsportsteens with no new r and d or new model mini bikes or mini tail bike is unfortunately losing out to the new cheaper and better mini trail bikes not mini bikes and motorcycles the japanese started massproducing alsportsteen would close it doors in late  and just like the muscle cars
