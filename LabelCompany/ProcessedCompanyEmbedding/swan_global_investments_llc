launches the swan defined risk emerging markets fund offering an actively managed hedged equity product for the emerging markets asset class jan   am est durango colo jan    prnewswire  the swan defined risk emerging markets fund tickers sdfax sdfcx sdfix seeks to offer a defined risk hedged equity solution for the emerging markets asset class the fund objective is to seek income and growth the fund seeks to reach this object by minimizing risk improving longterm returns and lowering volatility by applying swans proprietary defined risk strategy drs to a basket of international stocks and exchangetraded funds etfs swans drs has a successful track record in its us equities product since  and the funds managers believe that this innovative method of combining hedging and option income can be applied to other asset classes such as emerging markets swan global investments llc previously swan wealth advisors inc announced the launch of the swan defined risk emerging markets fund tickers sdfax sdfcx sdfix the fund seeks to implement the swan defined risk strategy drs with a basket of international stocks and exchangetraded funds etfs and will be available on numerous platforms logo  httpphotosprnewswirecomprnhlogo information regarding the swan defined risk emerging markets fund may be obtained by contacting the company directly at  or wwwswanglobalinvestmentscom we believe that it is imperative for investors to find alternative forms of asset growth and diversification that have upside potential especially in todays low interest rate and perceived risk environment said randy swan president and portfolio manager the expansion of our defined risk strategy to emerging markets may provide investors with an investment product that is noncorrelated to traditional asset classes helping to guard against systematic risk to longterm returns with a carefully constructed hedging and income strategy swans investment philosophy is that market timing and stock selection are imperfect investment tools making it extremely difficult to outperform a respective benchmark over time furthermore swan believes that market risk regardless of the underlying asset class cannot be minimized or reduced solely by diversification across asset classes this claimed risk reduction by asset allocation is strictly theoretical and typically based upon relationships that existed over a particular period there is no guarantee that these same relationships will continue in the future options and specifically hedging with options can help to address market risk directly it is through this approach that swan has been able to lower the market risk associated with the sp  in its us equities product since july of  by quantifying risk through its proprietary drs rather than by using approaches built on hypothetical speculation the companys new defined risk emerging markets fund fully implements the principles of the drs with actively managed equity exposure through emerging market index etfs that are fully hedged at all times with no aspiration to market prediction and an options income strategy built on defined risk our research confirms the effectiveness of the drs engine with other asset classes and most extensively with international equities both foreign developed and emerging markets said mr swan we are excited that the defined risk emerging markets fund will bring swans proprietary and compelling investment method to an asset class that we believe is brimming with growth potential about swan global investments swan global
