flow across the membrane pulling large molecular weight uremic toxins across the membrane as well to stay in fluid balance hdf requires the addition of a purified or sterile substitution fluid to be infused back into the blood to replace the flow of uremic plasma water standard hemodialysis hd hd is primarily a diffusivetype blood purification method that relies on differences in concentration as the driving force to remove toxins from of uremic blood this method is effective for small uremic toxins like urea however hd is less effective at removing larger molecular weight uremic toxins like betamicroglobulin hd is primarily performed in an outpatient clinic but is often performed in an acute hospital setting recent developments have enabled hd to be performed in the home setting the nephros hdf solution nephros has designed and patented the olpür hh module and hdf filter to be used in conjunction with a standard hd machine to deliver hdf therapy the hh module is connected to fresh dialysate fluid line from the hd machine the hh module delivers ultrafiltered dialysate to the hdf filter to enable both diffusivetype and convectivetype forces to remove uremic toxins and to provide substitution fluid to replace fluid loss from convection the nephros hdf filter olpür md provides a unique solution to standard hdf which is commonly used in europe for practical reasons the injection location of the substitution fluid is typically performed either before or after the blood flows through the dialyzer the midfilter location of substitution fluid injection attempts to maximize the positive impact of both postdilution and predilution injection modalities as show in the picture below the patented hdf filter is a two stage device in the first stage incoming blood flows down a portion of the hollow fibers making up an annular area of the outside of the fiber bundle and is discharged into the substitution header region at the other end substitution fluid is infused into the substitution header and mixes with the blood exiting from stage  in stage  the mixture flows through the remaining portion of hollow fibers in the core area of the fiber bundle after passing through the hollow fibers of stage  blood enters the center header region of the twoport cap and exits out the blood outlet port of the device dialysate flows in one direction that is countercurrent to blood flow in stage  and cocurrent to blood flow of stage  products olpur® hh hemodiafiltration module the olpur® hh hemodiafiltration module hh module utilizes a standard hd machine to perform online hemodiafiltration therapy the hd machine controls and monitors the basic treatment functions as it would normally when providing hd therapy the hh module is a freestanding movable device that is placed next to either side of an hd machine the hh module is connected to the clinic’s water supply drain and electricity the nephros olpur hh module has received fda k clearance in the usa clinicians overview olpur® md hemodiafilter the olpur® md hemodiafilter hdf filter is very similar to a typical hollow fiber dialyzer assembled with a single hollow fiber bundle made with a highflux or highpermeability membrane the fiber bundle is separated into two discrete but serially connected blood paths dialysate flows in one direction that is countercurrent to blood flow in stage  and cocurrent to blood flow of stage  product spec team  nephros close home dialysis infection control hdf commercial product resources press team corporate governance investor relations contact the

section h of the federal food drug and cosmetic act the act  usc § h these products are devices because they are intended for use in the diagnosis of disease or other conditions or in the cure mitigation treatment or prevention of disease or are intended to affect the structure or function of the bodythe inspection revealed that the devices are adulterated within the meaning of section h of
