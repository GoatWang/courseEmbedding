president and director thank you very much i would like to welcome everyone to mercurys first quarter conference call im gabe tirador president and ceo in the room with me is mr george joseph chairman ted stalick senior vice president and cfo robert houlihan vice president and chief product officer and chris graves vice president and chief investment officerbefore we take questions we will make a few comments regarding the quarter our first quarter operating earnings were  per share compared to  per share in the first quarter of  the improvement in operating earnings was primarily due to an improvement in the combined ratio from  in the first quarter of  to  in the first quarter of our results in the quarter were negatively impacted by  million of catastrophe losses and  million of unfavorable reserve development the majority of which was attributable to higherthanestimated development of property losses from storms in december  this compares to the first quarter of  which had  million of catastrophe losses and  million of adverse reserve developmentrainstorms in california accounted for  million of the  million of catastrophe losses in the quarter storms in georgia and texas made up the majority of the remainder of the catastrophe losses in the quarter excluding the impact of catastrophe losses and unfavorable reserve development the combined ratio was  in the quarterour homeowners results were significantly impacted by the record rainfall in california during the quarter our calendar year homeowners combined ratio was  in the quarter compared to  in the first quarter of  our calendar year auto combined ratio was  in the quarter compared to  in the first quarter of to help offset increasing loss trends we have been increasing rates in california we received approval for a  personal auto rate increase in california automobile insurance company effective in may and a  rate increase in our homeowners line effective in august in addition a  rate increase is pending approval with the department of insurance for mercury insurance companyread morepersonal auto premiums in mercury insurance company represents about half of our companywide premiums earned and california automobile insurance company represents about  of our companywide premiums earned california homeowners premiums represent about  of our companywide premiums earnedpremiums written grew  in the quarter primarily due to higher average premiums per policy companywide private passenger auto new business applications submitted to the company decreased approximately  in the quarter as we focused on improving profitability in our private passenger auto line companywide homeowners applications increased about  in the quarterwith that brief background we will now take questionsquestions and answersoperator operator instructions your first question comes from greg peters from raymond jamescharles gregory peters raymond james  associates inc research division  equity analyst i had just a couple of questions first of all like you have in the past quarterly calls i was wondering if you could give us an update on frequency and severity trends in the first quarter not only as they relate to the yearago comparison but also as it relates to the fourth quarter resultgabriel tirador mercury general corporation  ceo president and director ted do you want to handle thattheodore r stalick mercury general corporation  cfo and svp yes the overall frequency was obviously elevated due to the cat losses but when you strip out the cat losses the trends vary a lot by state we try to sort of focus on california because thats our largest state so california personal auto frequencys up slightly in the quarter and were seeing severity increases in the mid to upper single digits so pure premium kind of the midupper single digits i think the latest fast track had annual pure premium at about  for california and thats reasonably comparable to the trend weve been seeing for the last few quarterscharles gregory peters raymond james  associates inc research division  equity analyst so if we look back on the result for auto insurers just auto only in california i have to imagine last year most of them didnt do too well and consequently im wondering how the department of insurance is responding to the rate increases because they must be getting many of themgabriel tirador mercury general corporation  ceo president and director yes theyve been getting many of them and from what we can tell many are getting increases including us so the department had been approving rate increases weve been seeing that in the marketplace and i will note that in this quarter our private passenger auto results actually were  in california we booked a  combined ratio in the quarter with pretty heavy weather as ted was mentioning so we feel that with a  rate increase that we got coming here in cal auto thats going to continue to improve the results we have of  pending that will probably come later in the year and we have a  in our homeowners book that we got approved that is going to go into effect in august so obviously the heavy rains in california definitely had a very big impact on our homeowners line this quartercharles gregory peters raymond james  associates inc research division  equity analyst right and if i look at just the consolidated net premium written in the first quarter it was  relative to what i thought it might be  look like it came in below target at least my expectations and with all the rate thats going through im curious if theres some other nonflorida  noncalifornia states that are affecting the consolidated growth of that to come in less than gabriel tirador mercury general corporation  ceo president and director yes outside of california is definitely having a much bigger impact than california if you take a look at our new business volume this quarter our app counts for california they were down    but outside of california they were down like  and that is a result of us just taking aggressive action in some of these states outside of california to improve the combined ratio which we are seeing quite a bit of an improvement in the combined ratio in some of these states outside of california as a result but its obviously having an impact on our top line in our case and i think we said at the end of last quarter at the end of the fourth quarter we basically told everyone that we thought that the growth was going to be relatively flat we felt in charles gregory peters raymond james  associates inc research division  equity analyst okay all right just  cleanup questions in  first of all i did notice that you had a higher quarterly interest expense in the first quarter compared with the fourth quarter and all of last year im just curious if the first quarter result is expected to continue through the remainder of the yeartheodore r stalick mercury general corporation  cfo and svp so we refinanced all of our shortterm bank loans and we closed that transaction at the early part of march with a year senior debt offering and the shortterm loans were a spread over libor so were being priced off of shortterm rates we were in the process of renegotiating that debt those rates were going to go up due to higher spreads required by the banks as well as libor rates have been going up as well so we thought that we would lock in some longterm rates over a year period with these senior notes and because of that you are going to see higher interest expense its fairly easy to calculate now its  times  million of outstanding debtcharles gregory peters raymond james  associates inc research division  equity analyst excellent and then id be remiss if i didnt lob a question in chriss direction on investment income the result obviously improved on a yearoveryear basis taking away just the realized gains just looking at the core and i was a little bit surprised the trends of last year relative to  were down low to midsingle digits have we crossed a threshold where now its reasonable to assume that youre going to begin growing investment income againchristopher graves mercury general corporation  cio and vp yes greg last year was one of those periods where there was  we were at kind of at a pivot point and where rates started the year it certainly was at a rate or at a level that would be accretive but weve  rates have come back down so im kind of tempering my excitement for the year but i think that well definitely grow income over last year but i do have an internal goal and i think it may be challenging but i think we may still get there so im cautiously optimisticgabriel tirador mercury general corporation  ceo president and director i mean i think the aftertax yield this quarter was the same if i   is that right ted so the aftertax yield has stabilized and it had been declining for as you know greg for some time now but this latest quarter compared to the quarter in  the average annual yield on investments after income tax was steady at  were hopeful that that stays at that level or possibly higher depending on what interest rates do we do expect at some point to  for interest rates to rise they backed up here a while ago but now theyve come back down a little bit so well have to wait and see what happens with the interest ratesoperator operator instructions the next question is from gary ransom from dowling  partnersgary kent ransom dowling  partners securities llc  partner i wanted to ask about your agent force whether when you watch whats happening in the agent offices whether the quote volume youre seeing is up or do you see more shopping and are you winning more of those quotes losing more of those quotes i just wondered if you could give us a little color of whats happening at that levelgabriel tirador mercury general corporation  ceo president and director do you want to talk about that robertrobert houlihan mercury general corporation  chief product officer and vp yes this is robert houlihan it varies from state to state i think were  weve taken rate maybe in advance of the market in a number of these states so weve seen our conversion rate generally lower but were again cautiously optimistic as the market catches up and were seeing other carriers taking rate action that will move back to more normal levels quote volume i think has been fairly steady fairly even i dont think weve seen a big uptick in shopping at this pointgary kent ransom dowling  partners securities llc  partner okay yes on the california regulatory environment too is that  it always seems to take a long time to get your approvals through and are you already in process to file another one for cal auto knowing that it may take several months to get it throughgabriel tirador mercury general corporation  ceo president and director well we just got it approvedgary kent ransom dowling  partners securities llc  partner yes i know thats sort of my point its like everyone asks  and then that may be keeping up with trend but maybe you need more andgabriel tirador mercury general corporation  ceo president and director yes and what i was going to say is like what we did in mic is we just got mic approved not too long ago and right after we got that approved we  a few months later we filed for a  so were going to evaluate basically this quarter we do quarterly indications and based on that quarterly indication well make an evaluation but it  let me just put it this way it would not surprise me if we filed within the next  days another rate increase in cal autogary kent ransom dowling  partners securities llc  partner do you feel like youre able to put through the price increases quickly enough to stay up with loss costs or in fact get ahead of loss costs to improve the loss ratio theregabriel tirador mercury general corporation  ceo president and director well i think if loss costs dont continue to go up at these high rates that weve seen absolutely i mean as i mentioned earlier our combined ratio in california was a    this quarter with a lot of weather so  and we still have the  thats going to be coming into effect for cal auto and we got the mic one coming on the heels of that hopefully later this year so if trend continues at  a year then were going to   to  a year then were just going to hold steady right but at some point we dont think that trends going to continue at these elevated levels and youll see the combined ratio go down even furtheroperator there are no further questions i will turn the call back over to the presentersgabriel tirador mercury general corporation  ceo president and director wed like to thank everyone for joining us this quarter we look forward to speaking with you again next quarter thank you very muchoperator this concludes todays conference call you may now disconnectreblogsharetweetsharerecently viewedyour list is emptywhat

license is in your wallet in your back pocket you are sitting on your wallet the cop does not want you to get out of the car so you stay inside the cop asks for your driver license and you have to roll a bit and reach around to pull your wallet out the cop at that point is not pointing a gun at you so if someone wanted to pull a weapon out from behind themself while appearing to pull out their wallet they could get the drop on the cop so the cop can shoot first and always say they thought you were reaching for a weapon bottom line is the cop who claims i felt threatened always gets off and
