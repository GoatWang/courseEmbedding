in the itunes entertainment category to date we have grown our user base without material investment in marketing user acquisition or advertising we generate over  of our revenues from selling our advertising inventory to advertising networksexchanges real time bidding platforms and game publishers advertising networksexchanges are technology platforms that facilitate the buying and selling of media advertising inventory from multiple ad networks advertisers are attracted to us because of our sizable user base and our focus on mobile phone personalization the remainder of our revenue is primarily generated from managing and optimizing advertising inventory for a thirdparty app publisher as well as revenue billing collection and reporting with respect to the advertising a key element in maintaining our position is our ability to meet users expectations which necessitates retaining employees with solid educational and professional credentials who are passionate about our mission to serve as a medium for selfexpression our ability to continue attracting advertisers depends on the growth and demographics of our user base increased app usage and improved retention these will require continued investment in product technology and marketing our growth plan also relies on improved monetization techniques and selective strategic investments and acquisitions we believe that our business model is scalable and allows for significant portions of revenue growth to flow to our bottom line we were formerly a majorityowned subsidiary of idt corporation or idt on june   idts interest in zedge was spunoff by idt to idts stockholders and we became an independent public company through a pro rata distribution of our common stock held by idt to idts stockholders the spinoff critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or us gaap our significant accounting policies are described in note  to the consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended july   the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses as well as the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities critical accounting policies are those that require application of managements most subjective or complex judgments often as a result of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods our critical accounting policies include those related to capitalized software and technology development costs revenue recognition and goodwill management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions for additional discussion of our critical accounting policies see our managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended july   recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted in may  the financial accounting standards board or fasb issued an accounting standards update or asu to provide guidance about which changes to the terms or conditions of a sharebased payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting pursuant to this asu an entity should account for the effects of a modification unless all the following are met  the fair value or calculated value or intrinsic value if such an alternative measurement method is used of the modified award is the same as the fair value or calculated value or intrinsic value if such an alternative measurement method is used of the original award immediately before the original award is modified if the modification does not affect any of the inputs to the valuation technique that the entity uses to value the award the entity is not required to estimate the value immediately before and after the modification  the vesting conditions of the modified award are the same as the vesting conditions of the original award immediately before the original award is modified and  the classification of the modified award as an equity instrument or a liability instrument is the same as the classification of the original award immediately before the original award is modified we will adopt the amendments in this asu prospectively to an award modified on or after on august   we are evaluating the impact that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements in january  the fasb issued an asu to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of adding guidance to assist entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions or disposals of assets or businesses under the current guidance there are three elements of a businessinputs processes and outputs while an integrated set of assets and activities collectively referred to as a set that is a business usually has outputs outputs are not required to be present in addition all the inputs and processes that a seller uses in operating a set are not required if market participants can acquire the set and continue to produce outputs for example by integrating the acquired set with their own inputs and processes the amendments in this asu provide a screen to determine when a set is not a business the screen requires that when substantially all of the fair value of the gross assets acquired or disposed of is concentrated in a single identifiable asset or a group of similar identifiable assets the set is not a business this screen reduces the number of transactions that need to be further evaluated if the screen is not met the amendments in this asu  require that to be considered a business a set must include at a minimum an input and a substantive process that together significantly contribute to the ability to create output and  remove the evaluation of whether a market participant could replace missing elements the amendments provide a framework to assist entities in evaluating whether both an input and a substantive process are present the framework includes two sets of criteria to consider that depend on whether a set has outputs although outputs are not required for a set to be a business outputs generally are a key element of a business therefore the fasb has developed more stringent criteria for sets without outputs lastly the asu narrows the definition of the term output we will adopt the amendments in this asu on august   we are evaluating the impact that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements in january  the fasb issued an asu that simplifies the subsequent measurement of goodwill by eliminating step  from the goodwill impairment test in computing the implied fair value of goodwill under step  an entity had to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities including unrecognized assets and liabilities following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination instead under the amendments in this asu an entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting units fair value however the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit additionally an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss if applicable an entity still has the option to perform the qualitative assessment for a reporting unit to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary early adoption of this standard is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing dates after january   we intend to adopt this standard for its goodwill impairment test to be performed in fiscal  in june  the fasb issued an asu that changes the impairment model for most financial assets and certain other instruments for receivables loans and other instruments entities will be required to use a new forwardlooking expected loss model that generally will result in the earlier recognition of allowance for losses for availableforsale debt securities with unrealized losses entities will measure credit losses in a manner similar to current practice except the losses will be recognized as allowances instead of reductions in the amortized cost of the securities in addition an entity will have to disclose significantly more information about allowances credit quality indicators and past due securities the new provisions will be applied as a cumulativeeffect adjustment to retained earnings we will adopt the new standard on august   we are evaluating the impact that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements in march  the fasb issued an asu to improve the accounting for employee sharebased payments the new standard simplifies several aspects of the accounting for sharebased payment transactions including the income tax consequences classification of awards as either equity or liabilities and classification on the statement of cash flows we will adopt the new standard on august   we do not expect that the adoption of the new standard will have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements in february  the fasb issued asu related to the accounting for leases the new standard establishes a rightofuse or rou model that requires a lessee to record a rou asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than  months leases will be classified as either finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement we will adopt the new standard on august   a modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements with certain practical expedients available we are currently evaluating the impact that the new standard will have on our consolidated financial statements in may  the fasb and the international accounting standards board jointly issued a comprehensive new revenue recognition standard that will supersede most of the current revenue recognition guidance under us gaap and international financial reporting standards or ifrs the goals of the revenue recognition project were to clarify and converge the revenue recognition principles under us gaap and ifrs and to develop guidance that would streamline and enhance revenue recognition requirements to accomplish this objective the standard requires five basic steps i identify the contract with the customer ii identify the performance obligations in the contract iii determine the transaction price iv allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract and v recognize revenue when or as the entity satisfies a performance obligation we are required to adopt this standard on august   entities have the option of using either a full retrospective or modified retrospective approach for the adoption of the standard we are evaluating the impact that the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements and have not yet selected an adoption date or a transition method we cannot reasonably estimate the impact that the adoption of the standard will have on our consolidated financial statements results of operations three and nine months ended april   compared to three and nine months ended april   three months ended nine

exchange transactions              provision for benefit from income taxes           net loss income                     nmnot meaningful revenues revenues decreased slightly in the three months ended april   compared to the same period in fiscal  due to a combination of factors including the continued negative impact from having been removed from the itunes store in early  our decision to reduce our investments in our game channel in midapril  which resulted in a decline in game installs for which we are paid on a cost per install basis a decrease in revenue from advertising inventory offered on both our desktop and mobile websites and a drop in revenue from our managing and optimizing advertising inventory for a thirdparty app publisher yet aggregate revenue from our native android and ios apps increased even though mau in the welldeveloped markets declined by approximately  our average revenue per monthly active user derived from our apps or arpmau increased  to  from  in the three months ended april   compared to the same period in fiscal  this increase resulted primarily from the introduction of a new android ad unit in march  which replaced a less valuable one and the addition of new and direct advertising relationships with demand partners interested in our inventory revenues decreased in the nine months ended april   compared to the same period in fiscal  primarily due to a  decline in our app arpmau to  from  the app arpmau decrease was primarily due to our app being temporarily removed from the itunes store on february   which lowered the revenue per user that we were able to generate a decline in mau across more developed markets where we are able to command higher advertising rates as well as our decision to reduce our investments in our game channel in midapril  which resulted in a decline in game installs for which we are paid on a cost per install basis although we launched a wallpaper app in itunes in march  and a ringtones app in december  we still have not recovered from the time when our app was unavailable on the itunes store also we experienced lower advertising ecpms effective cost per thousand impressions than expected when compared to last year due to what we believe to be a shift in advertising budgets allocating more spend for video andor native ad units vs static ad units like banners and interstitials due to user concerns and the current nature of our product we have a limited inventory of higher value ad formats although we started addressing this by rolling out higher value native ad units that do not negatively impact on the user experience monthly active users or mau during the last  days of the quarter increased by  to  million at april   from  million at april   driven by growth in the emerging markets offsetting declines in the well developed markets we have several initiatives underway focused on content discovery and freshness which we believe will improve user growth engagement and retention in addition we are releasing new features and investing in product marketing across both the android and ios apps in order to reverse the mau downturn we experienced on a yearoveryear basis in the well developed markets mau is a performance indicator that captures the number of unique users that opened our app in the previous day period our install count that is the number of times the zedge app has been installed on devices increased to  million at april   from  million a year ago zedge introduced a standalone wallpaper app in itunes in march  and a standalone ringtone app in itunes in december  the rollout of these individual apps was done in order to both fully comply with itunes terms and conditions as well as mitigate risk considering that itunes removed our bundled ringtone and wallpaper app on february   leaving us with no market offering for many months in middecember  we launched a new ad strategy with our wallpaper and ringtones apps intended to improve user engagement even with the introduction of these two apps we still havent recovered from being removed from the itunes store in february  direct cost of revenues the increase in direct cost of revenues in the three and nine months ended april   compared to the same periods in fiscal  was attributable to the fees that we pay to third parties that provide us with internet hosting content serving and filtering and marketing automation services the costs associated with content serving and filtering and push notification marketing increased as a result of a new product offering from one of our vendors and because of expanding the addressable customer base that benefits from marketing automation services respectively selling general and administrative expense selling general and administrative expense consists mainly of payroll benefits facilities marketing content acquisition and consulting and professional fees the increase in selling general and administrative expense in the three and nine months ended april   compared to the same periods in fiscal  was mostly due to increases in payroll and benefits accounting tax legal fees rent and noncash compensation the increase was partially offset by a reduction in benefits expense in the nine months ended april   due to the recording of a  million receivable from norways skattefunn government program designed to encourage research and development in norwegian trade and industry which related to previous periods in addition our headcount increased from  employees at april   to  employees at april   selling general and administrative expense included stockbased compensation expense of  and  in the three months ended april   and  respectively and  and  in the nine months ended april   and  respectively at april   unrecognized compensation expense related to unvested stockbased compensation was an aggregate of  the unrecognized compensation expense will be recognized on a straightline basis over the remaining vesting period of the relevant grant that ends in  in september  the compensation committee of our board of directors approved an equity grant of options to purchase  shares of our class b common stock to our executive officers a consultant and a nonexecutive employee the options vest over a threeyear period unrecognized compensation expense related to this grant was an aggregate of  based on the estimated fair value of the options on the grant date the unrecognized compensation expense is recognized on a straightline basis over the vesting period while many of the costs of being a public company were already borne by us either directly or by allocation of corporate overhead from idt those expenses were allocated among all of idts operations and we need to have the proper infrastructure in place to perform the necessary legal treasury accounting internal audit and reporting functions we anticipate our total costs will increase by  to  per year as a result of the spinoff several of the costs included in this estimated range are preliminary subject to negotiation and may vary from the estimates when finalized depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization consists mainly of amortization of capitalized software and technology development costs of our internal developers on various projects that we invested in specific to the various platforms on which we operate our service writeoff of capitalized software and technology development costs in the nine months ended april   we decided not to launch a project that was in development since this abandoned project did not have any future benefit we charged the capitalized software and technology development costs for the project to expense net loss gain resulting from foreign exchange transactions net loss gain resulting from foreign exchange transactions are comprised of losses and gains generated from movements in norwegian krone or nok relative to the us dollar including gains or losses from our nok hedging activities in the three months ended april   and  we had losses of  and gains of  respectively from nok hedging activities and in the nine months ended april   and  we had losses of  and  respectively from nok hedging activities provision for benefit from income taxes the decrease in the provision for income taxes in the three and nine months ended april   compared to the same periods in fiscal  was due to the jurisdiction in which income was earned in the three and nine months ended april   compared to the same periods in fiscal  and our ability to use net operating losses in those jurisdictions liquidity and capital resources general at april   we had cash and cash equivalents of  million and working capital current assets less current liabilities of  million we currently expect that our cash and cash equivalents on hand and our cash flow from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements during the twelve months ending april   jun   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights reserved more from marketwatch more coverage wall street isn’t ready for a point tumble in the dow industrials watch out
