generally accepted in the united states requires our management to make assumptions estimates and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements including the notes thereto and related disclosures of commitments and contingencies if any we consider our critical accounting policies to be those that require the more significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of financial statements including the following accounts receivable trade accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful accounts we determine the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying potential troubled accounts and by using historical experience and future expectations applied to an aging of accounts trade accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible recoveries of trade accounts receivable previously written off are recorded as income when received we determined that no allowance for doubtful accounts was required at

agreement the company will have an exclusive license to the mixer indefinitely no specific legal life or term to the license is otherwise stated in the agreement we have concluded that no legal regulatory contractual competitive economic or other factors limit the useful life of this intangible asset we therefore have classified the license as indefinite and are not amortizing its carrying value impairment of longlived assets we periodically review our longlived assets including intangible assets for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable no events or changes in circumstances have occurred to indicate that the carrying amount of our longlived assets may not be recoverable therefore no impairment loss was
