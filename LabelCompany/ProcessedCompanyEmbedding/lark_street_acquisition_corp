accounting policies presented below is designed to assist in understanding the companys unaudited condensed financial statements such unaudited condensed financial statements and accompanying notes are the representations of the companys management who are responsible for their integrity and objectivity these accounting policies conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap in all material respects and have been consistently applied in preparing the accompanying unaudited condensed financial statements certain information and footnote disclosures normally present in annual financial statements prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us gaap were omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations the results for the period from july   inception to september   are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending december   use of estimates the preparation of unaudited condensed financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ from those estimates cash cash and cash equivalents include cash on hand and on deposit at banking institutions as well as all highly liquid shortterm investments with original maturities of  days or less

street acquisition corporation notes to unaudited condensed financial statements income taxes under asc  income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled valuation allowances are established when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized as of sesptember   there were no deferred taxes due to the uncertainty of the realization of net operating loss or carry forward prior to expiration loss per common share basic loss per common share excludes dilution and is computed by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted loss per common share reflect the potential dilution that could occur if securities or other contracts to issue common stock were exercised or converted into common stock or resulted in the issuance of common stock that then shared in the loss of the entity as of september   there are no outstanding dilutive securities fair value of financial instruments the company follows guidance for accounting for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial statements on a recurring basis additionally the company adopted guidance for fair value measurement related to nonfinancial items that are recognized and disclosed at fair value in the unaudited condensed financial statements on a nonrecurring basis the guidance establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs to valuation techniques used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows level  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date level  inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within level  that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly level  inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability the carrying amounts of financial assets such as cash approximate their fair values because of the short maturity of these instruments recent accounting pronouncements on november   fasb issued asuincome taxes the board is issuing this update as part of its

process is not confidential posted on august    leave a comment on july  we celebrated the sixth birthday anniversary of doddfrank and although some of the ruling’s initiatives are less than beloved by many aka volcker rule the “confidential ipo” bucketed under the jobs act has been an undisputed success i was reminded of this when reviewing last week’s list of companies who officially became “issuers” all three were emerging growth companies egc and all three filed as a confidential ipo airgain wireless telecommunication equipment filed confidentially as an egc in aug  filed publicly in jul  raised m – priced below the range – traded on the nasdaq on aug  protagonist therapeutics biopharmaceuticals filed confidentially as an egc in may  filed publicly in jul  raised m – priced within the range – traded on the nasdaq on aug  and finished the day down  medpace clinical contract research company filed confidentially as an egc in mar  filed publicly in jun  raised m – priced within the range – traded on the nasdaq on aug  and finished the day up  what is emerging growth company  an emerging growth company egc is an issuer that has total annual gross revenues of less than  billion during its most recently completed fiscal year  what is confidential filing process  an emerging growth company can submit a confidential draft ipo registration to the sec for review in advance of its initial public offering this allows the company to hone their message and offering – especially with the secit allows the company to change their mind about going public without anyone knowing publicly “pulling their ipo” is often viewed as a failure download the workflow whitepaper here the egc and sec are prohibited from publicly disclosing the confidential filing comments and amendments during this review process as the egc moves closer toward its ipo the jobs act requires that these filings be made available to the public the egc would be required to publicly file their draft registration and amendments with the sec no later than  days before its roadshow plus the sec staff will publicly release its comment letter and responses to staff comment letters on confidential draft submissions after the registration statement for the ipo becomes effective but no sooner than  days after the effective date as you see in the three companies above confidential does not equate to simple airgain needed two years to get into position what is ipo compliance requirements ipo requirement traditional ipo registrant ecg jobs act registration process public confidential audited financial statements  years  years selected financial data  years  years executive compensation disclosures full equal to smaller reporting companies disclosures  what about xbrl

punditisms towards what has been a sad year for ipos kathleen smith a principal at ipofocused renaissance capital expects a uptick the remaining of the year but doesn’t expect  to match the  ipos and  billion raised in  which itself was down from the ’s big ipo year “the enemy of a healthy ipo market is uncertainty and volatility we’ve had some high volatility in the past year but that’s moderated back down to normal levels” the ipo window is ready to open “it’s just a matter of when” said garvis toler global head of capital markets at the new york stock exchange “the enemy of a healthy ipo market is uncertainty and volatility we’ve had some high volatility in the past year but that’s moderated back down to normal levels people need to perceive that it’s a hospitable environment” liz myers jpmorgan’s global head of equity capital markets reported that jpmorgan has  ipos in their global pipeline in september and a “full pipeline” for the balance of  additionally jp morgan expects to see more than a dozen tech ipos before the end of the year venture capitalists count more than  unicorns privately held companies valued above  billion in the us ipos bring big gains to vc firms and other early investors allowing them to invest in the next star companies what do companies especially emerging growth companies do as they prepare for their ipo well… they prepare one place to start is to understand the actual drafting registration process you’ll experience with the sec this whitepaper illustrates that process what you’ll see illustrated in the whitepaper is that the sec will absolutely pong back your ping looking for sharper definition on one some or all eek of these topics acquisitions contingencies divestitures estimates fair value goodwill impairment income taxes internal controls mda nongaap abuse  reconciliation segment reporting stock compensation as your securities lawyers will clearly express “don’t take it personally” sec letters are a part of the process and the backandforth can take months with an average of  months lastly although it is a bit of a ping pong match its not a competition the sec wants companies to succeed while simultaneously protecting investors   share thistwitterfacebooklinkedin leave a comment posted in ipo the sec suggests redefining “smaller” to reduce filing burden for some issuers posted on august    leave a comment the sec has proposed an updated change regarding the definition and subsequent qualification of a src smaller reporting company  today us issuers qualify as a src if they either  have a public float of less than  million or  for issuers without a public float annual revenues of less than  million the benefit of being a src company is a lighter disclosure burden under regulation sk and regulation sx including only having to disclose two years of audited financial statements and zero compensation discussion  analysis reporting responsibility the new update would allow issuers to be reclassified as a src if they have  a public float of less than  million or  for companies without a public float annual revenues of less than  million the updates are projected to reduce the work burden and costs for reporting while still protecting investors for close to  current nonsrc issuers… about  of all sec reporting issuers one point issuers with more than  million in public float even if reclassified as a src are still accelerated filers their q and k filings deadlines do not change nor does their sarbanesoxley  auditor verification reporting also a sdc is still required to file xbrl –our team will assist in keep those fees low and accuracy high if all that is not confusing enough a src can also be an egc which may be not have sox responsibilities for sure talk to your sec lawyer pdq you know… cya comments on the proposed rules are due august   share thistwitterfacebooklinkedin leave a comment posted in sec regulations xbrl experts for corporate exit execution posted on august    leave a comment as of last week in  only  companies have rung the ipo bell on wall street or in times square this is  yoy of  and  yoy of  the money raised is the same percentages so with such dramatic reductions in s filings what has kept our capital markets operations team so busy mergers ’s domestic ma although down onefourth from last years’ tremendous activity has kept our transactions pros working all three shifts sec form s can be as complicated as an ipo’s s and absolutely the production precision needed is equal prior the s our team is onboarding and training the appropriate working groups to manage their virtual data room view demo video – assuring the right content gets into the right folders and that the wrongs eyes don’t have access security and administrative permissioning is paramount why are companies exiting via ma rather than an ipo the wall street journal states several factors including the soft market performance of many ipos buyers’ appetite for great targets and notably the underlying patience of private equity from the wsj “trader corp an online automotive marketplace owned by privateequity firm apax partners was days away from publicly unveiling its ipo plans in early july when it announced a deal to sell itself to thoma bravo llc for about  billion according to several people close to the deal the move surprised many of the company’s ipo bankers who expected the company to fetch a higher valuation in a public offering according to people familiar with the matter” regardless of a company’s individual exit strategy we’re pleased so many are allowing us to help them execute their plan note by operating three shifts – typesetting edgarizing production – we mitigate rush charges to clients we know filings are always on deadline it’s the nature of the business charging “rush” charges rarely makes sense share thistwitterfacebooklinkedin leave a comment posted in ipo ma ipos and transactions aug    plus s
