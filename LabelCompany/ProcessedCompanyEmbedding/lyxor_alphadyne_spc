observe any such restrictions         index replication process   lyxor ucits etfs follow both physical and synthetic index replication process   however most lyxor ucits etfs follow synthetic replication process this consists of entering into a derivative transaction a ‘performance swap’ as defined below with a counterparty that provides complete and effective exposure to its benchmark index lyxor has adopted this methodology in order to minimise tracking error optimise transaction costs and reduce operational risks   a performance swap is a contractual agreement which is negotiated overthecounter otc between two parties the lyxor ucits etf and its counterparty from a risk perspective each performance swap ranks equally with other senior unsecured obligations of the counterparty such as common bonds ie same rights to payments in the performance swap the counterparty of the lyxor ucits etf commits to pay the lyxor ucits etf a variable return based on a predetermined benchmark index instead of a fixed stream of income as in bonds at the same time the counterparty will receive from the lyxor ucits etf the performance and any related revenues generated by the baskets assets excluding the value of the performance swap held by the lyxor ucits etf information provided on individual etfs includes data on the basket relating to the etf and the percentage value of the basket represented by each asset the information is relevant to the closing values on the date given    investment risks   the lyxor ucits etfs described on this website are not suitable for everyone investors capital is at risk investors should not deal in this product unless they understand having obtained independent professional advice where necessary its nature terms and conditions and the extent of their exposure to risk the value of the product can go down as well as up and can be subject to volatility due to factors such as price changes in the underlying instrument and interest rates if a fund is quoted in a different currency to the index currency risks exist   prior to any investment in any lyxor ucits etf you should make your own appraisal of the risks from a financial legal and tax perspective without relying exclusively on the information provided by us we recommend that you consult your own independent professional advisors including legal tax financial or accounting advisors as appropriate   specific risks   ·         capital at risk etfs are tracking instruments their risk profile is similar to a direct investment in the benchmark index investors’ capital is fully at risk and investors may not get back the amount originally invested investments are not covered by the provisions of the financial services compensation scheme “fscs” or any similar scheme ·         counterparty risk investors may be exposed to risks resulting from the use of an otc swap with societe generale physical etfs may have counterparty risk resulting from the use of a securities lending programme ·         currency risk etfs may be exposed to currency risk if the etf or benchmark index holdings are denominated in a currency different to that of the benchmark index they are tracking this means that exchange rate fluctuations could have a negative or positive effect on returns ·         replication risk etfs are designed to replicate the performance of the benchmark index unexpected events relating to the constituents of the benchmark index may impact the index provider’s ability to calculate the benchmark index which may affect the etf’s ability to replicate the benchmark index efficiently this may create tracking error in the etf ·         underlying risk the benchmark index of a lyxor etf may be complex and volatile when investing in commodities the benchmark index is calculated with reference to commodity futures contracts which can expose investors to risks related to the cost of carry and transportation etfs exposed to emerging markets carry a greater risk of potential loss than investment in developed markets as they are exposed to a wide range of unpredictable emerging market risks ·         liquidity risk onexchange liquidity may be limited as a result of a suspension in the underlying market represented by the benchmark index tracked by the etf a failure in the systems of one of the relevant stock exchanges
