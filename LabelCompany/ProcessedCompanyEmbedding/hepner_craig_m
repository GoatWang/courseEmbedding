hepner     prepaidlegalcom ive been involved in the home based business industry now for nine years full time  i love the concept of working from home representing a real company with a great product perfect timing and incredible residual income not knowing any better to begin with i got involved with one startup company after another  for a total of four  before our team leaders decided to take some appropriate time to find a longterm company with tremendous growth potential  we couldnt afford to pour all our efforts into companies which were bound to fail like most startups are we saw prepaid legals opportunity immediately during the acquisition of tpn in october of   we made the commitment as a team to work together and get to the top as soon as possible  because of the fabulous team i have the privilege of working with i achieved the level of executive director my first  days and platinum within  months  after  months we now have dozens of executive directors and well soon have dozens of ring earners as well  we are absolutely overwhelmed with excitement and gratitude for what prepaid legal has given back to all of us  our life when we started my girlfriend tara paustenbach and i along with our good friend ben kane all had to share a twobedroom apartment   and none of us had a car  we were so broke  its amazing we were able to get caught up so quickly  a year later we moved into a fourbedroom home and purchased a brand new ford expedition ben got a  series bmw    not to mention getting caught up on all sorts of bills  my three sons joshua jeremy and julian have witnessed how prepaid legal has changed our lives for the better  and i look forward to traveling this country with all of them helping as many people as possible with this product and opportunity while building a permanent financial wall around my family my parents terry and maxine hepner are my sponsors in ppl and ive been able to watch them achieve tremendous success as well  its a wonderful feeling to know youre helping to put your parents into a very strong retirement  in the first  days of  my parents earned more in overrides from their ppl business than what social security paid them all year long our philosophy for success is to first surround yourself with successful people in this business then do what they do  ppl is the perfect business for someone who has no experience because new people can simply copy what the top earners are doing to achieve the same results  second utilize the tools get paid daily cd our ppl personal websites videos conference calls to explain ppl  the simpler you keep it the more people can see themselves doing it and duplicate it  third attend all events  theres nothing like the feeling you have as you leave an international convention charged up and ready to recruit the world for us ppl has truly changed our lives  the future looks extremely bright and were all dreaming about a fantastic life again  our attitude is great and when that happens everything else seems to fall into place   back to top contact us copyright   lk marketing group llc   all rights reserved last modified tuesday march   craig m

tap to call customer service   craig hepner go back craig hepner home based business newport coast ca for approximately the last  years ive made my career in the homebased business industry however not until i joined legalshield in october  did i find the personal rewards and financial success i was seeking after enduring the failure of five different startup companies it was very exciting to align myself with a longterm company poised for all out massive momentum with legalshield soon becoming a household name there will be no limits to our ability to deliver affordable legal services while achieving personal and financial goals at the time that legalshield was introduced to me i found myself in a place in life i never ever thought i would be after those five startup companies failed in their first couple of years all of a sudden i found myself with no car no credit cards no checking or savings account no drivers license and no place to call my own i was approximately  in debt with legalshield however i managed to pull myself out of the hole when i joined legalshield with the help of my parents and sponsors terry and maxine hepner and the hard work of an incredible team i achieved the executive director level in  days in about a year i earned my  ring now i’ve also earned the   and  rings i was inducted into the millionaire club my fifth year in the business with the phenomenal leadership and friendship of sean and loren mikael kai deering bill and yadira butkovich tara paustenbach tony agurs debra otten michael swanson lisa melville annesah and zarinah nadir jerri harris brandon and terrie beals julian hepner and sanela hadzihasanovich and their amazing teams our organization has thousands of people earning great extra income from home dozens of whom have earned the sixfigure ring and half dozen who are in the millionaire club its been exciting to see so many friends and family members get out of debt send their children to quality schools go on vacations and purchase cars and homes most importantly we now have the time to do the things in life that are most meaningful and rewarding including spending quality time with family and friends for so many of us this business is truly a dream come true the aspect of legalshield that i value most is how it empowers all of us to give back more to our communities and take back our equal rights and justice throughout the s and early s i was involved in several efforts aimed at securing universal human and civil rights and alleviating poverty in our own country and throughout the world because of the opportunity this company has given me i am once again able to participate in these causes through the life examples of my inspirations dr martin luther king jr malcolm x john lennon bob marley and gandhi we have the ability to offer social justice in the marketplace with our product while providing economic justice at home with our business opportunity but there is even more that we can do working together our goals can be much higher and accomplishments much greater we can make a difference as the acclaimed anthropologist margaret mead once said “never doubt that a small group
