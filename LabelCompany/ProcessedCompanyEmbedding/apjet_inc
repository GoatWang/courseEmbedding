apjet advantage applications and end uses company our team partners press releases contact us what is a plasma the first three states of matter are solid liquid and gas and matter transitions from one state to the next by the addition of energy often in the form of heat  for example “solid” water is ice and melts into water with the addition of heat energy  water is evaporated into a gas with the addition of more heat  plasma occurs after the gas state with the addition of more energy   when molecules of the gas are given energy in excess of their ionization potential electrons are able to escape the electron cloud  this results in a body of positively charged ions and negatively charged electrons  these charged species can be affected by electric and magnetic fields resulting in the production of additional excited species more information click below  visit wikipedia plasma exists in many everyday forms   the glow from neon signs is a plasma as are lightening bolts  flames lasers and most of “outer space” are also plasma   in general plasma is classified by two factors electron number density and temperature  electron number density refers to the number of molecules that have ionized lost one or more electrons relative to the number of neutral gas species  “plasma temperature” is a bit confusing and does not refer to whether a plasma feels hot or cold but rather to the energy in the units ev of the free electrons  if there are significantly more neutral gas molecules than ionized gas molecules the plasma may be cold to the touch but still have very energetic electrons and thus a very high plasma temperaturechemically active species can be produced by plasma if the proper conditions for generating  plasma are chosen and  the correct gases are selected  apjet™ is an expert in selecting gases and designing systems to maximize the production of these chemically active species and engineering them for the finishing of fabric and other substrates  design
