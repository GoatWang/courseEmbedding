to owens realty mortgage chairman and board of directors freestone capital management sends letter to owens realty mortgage chairman and board of directors  highlights significant longterm destruction of shareholder value at owens realty mortgage questions external managers conflicts of interest with the company calls for the immediate liquidation of the company to close the value gap between the companys current market price of  and estimated  liquidation value news provided by freestone capital management llc jun    et share this article seattle june   prnewswire  freestone capital management llc together with its affiliates the largest shareholder of owens realty mortgage inc the company nyse mkt orm today announced that it has delivered a letter to the chairman and board of directors of the company the full text of the letter follows june   owens realty mortgage inc  olympic blvd walnut creek ca  attn william c owens chairman of the board cc board of directors the board dear mr owens freestone capital management llc together with its affiliates freestone beneficially owns approximately  of the outstanding shares of owens realty mortgage inc owens or the company making us the companys largest shareholder  as longterm investors since  we have been patient and supportive shareholders of the company watching managements questionable decisions and listening to their promises of longterm value unfortunately those promises have remained unfulfilled and frankly we can no longer stand by in light of managements continued destruction of shareholder value we believe that management should explore the immediate liquidation of the company to close the value gap between the companys current market price and our estimated liquidation value thereby returning capital to the companys longsuffering investors the destruction of shareholder value and the enrichment of management the company and its predecessor company owens mortgage investment fund omif has a longterm history of trailing market returns based on our calculations from january   to may   an investment in omifowens has provided a total return to shareholders of approximately  compared to the returns of the ftse nareit mortgage reit index of  and the russell  index of  during this same time period we believe that this enormous gap is due to a flawed business model which penalizes shareholders and primarily enriches management based on our analysis we further believe that owens pays abovemarket fees to its external manager owens financial group inc the owens manager through a management agreement that has been in place for years currently management makes loans at a  interest rate borrows capital at a  interest rate and pays owens manager a  annual management fee and a  servicing fee in addition to  of the loan origination fees and a  expense reimbursement in our view this explains why the company with a tangible book value of approximately  million incurred an aggregate operating loss from  to  of approximately  million based on these numbers we believe the only winner here is the owens manager with the shareholders stuck with an underperforming investment perhaps the discrepancy between the companys significant tangible book value and its operating loss can be found in the longterm enrichment of the companys management through the owens manager at the expense of the shareholders in fact from  to  owens paid a total of  to the owens manager during the same timeperiod the company had an operating loss of  the owens managers compensation keeps rolling in while shareholders lose money – in our opinion shareholders are clearly losing at the expense of management not surprisingly the owens manager is owned by company insiders william c owens the executive chairman of the board holds approximately  of the owens manager while bryan h draper the president and ceo of the company and member of the board holds approximately  of the owens manager  the management agreement with the owens manager creates material conflicts of interest and has an outrageous fee structure we believe that the abovemarket fees paid to the owens manager are the result of the companys conflicts of interest with the owens manager the company itself recognizes this conflict of interest inherent in the management agreement stating in the companys k that i the management agreement was negotiated by related parties and as such the terms of the management agreement were not subject to armslength bargaining ii the owens manager will face conflicts of interest arising from the companys fee structure and iii with respect to the companys personnel they will face conflicts of interest concerning the allocation of its personnels time due to the management agreement even worse the owens manager does not have the industry expertise to account for its abovemarket fees the company specifically states in the same k that our managers lack of experience with certain real estate markets could impact its ability to make prudent investments on the companys behalf further the company concludes that it may have to rely on more advisors than just the owens manager in circumstances where the owens manager cannot reliably make prudent investment decisions in those circumstances ofg the owens manager intends to rely on independent real estate advisors and local legal counsel to assist them in making prudent investment decisions  you will not have an opportunity to evaluate the qualifications of such advisors and no assurance can be given that they will render prudent advice to ofg perhaps it should not be surprising that management entered into such a lopsided agreement that favors an entity other than the company considering managements relative lack of skin in the game in fact the companys compensation committee which currently consists of messrs james m kessler dennis g schmal and gary c wallace who made the decision regarding the egregious manager compensation has a collective beneficial ownership in the company of only  according to the companys last proxy statement filed with the sec management should immediately pursue a complete liquidation of the company and return the proceeds to shareholders unfortunately the company seems determined to engage in further lending during the quarterly earnings call in may  mr draper discussed managements plan to deploy more capital into loans despite describing the environment for lending as challenging not surprisingly making more loans would increase loan balances which would result in millions of dollars in new fees for the owens manager and its insider owners messrs owens and draper at the expense of the companys shareholders we view the approval of such action as a breach of the boards fiduciary duty to the companys shareholders this is a continuation of behavior that has occurred at the company since at least  and is the reason why the owners of the owens manager have received over  million in fees from  to  despite the companys operating loss of approximately  million over the same time period after more than eight years of poor returns instead of continuing to bet on unprofitable and risky loans the company should recognize reality and return its underperforming capital to its longsuffering shareholders the company should liquidate and thereby close the value gap between the companys current market price of  and the estimated  liquidation value quite simply it is time for the board to do their job and maximize shareholder value sincerely

been working at freestone capital management fulltime more than  yearsprosi joined freestone a few years ago for the opportunity to be a client advisor to manage relationships with high net worth individuals and their families my experience to date has had its own high and lows but i can honestly say no firm has believed in and respected me more for my talents and contributions to the company i have had the opportunity to grow my client base with support from my team and the mentorship from more senior advisorspartners freestone has a sense of entrepreneurship that allows you to excel if you know where you want to go i have also been very pleased with the benefits they provide and the support they give to new parents while on maternity leave and the months back when you’re adjusting to your new normalconsfreestone can be a hard place to work if you do not have a good idea of the direction you want to go in your career we have employees who are very content with their current role and we have employees who look to advance to the next level by advocating for themselves to get there i would say it would be difficult if you fall somewhere in between the other thing and this might be a “me issue” but i always have a hard time finding information for example i never know when we have holidays off work there’s nothing worse than planning client meetings and then realize the entire office is closed for the day…advice to management keep your employees happy by continuing to provide great benefits and a fun work atmosphere build out a team and structure that encourages

making meaningful steps to achieving that path i feel valued here at freestone if you are a problem solver innovative determined and can work well in a team environment you will find you are absolutely not a cog in the larger machine like so many larger companies  i worked at a  person firm before arriving here the employee benefits are top of the line the people generally enjoy being around each other and can go out together and have fun at the end of the workday the people i have worked with embrace the client first attitude and always consider that first in decision making fun and loose environment focused on making the company better which inspires me on a daytoday basis the office is bright with natural light and has a great view upper management is investing in younger people to take over the company in the futureconsto do what is necessary for the company to succeed you must be willing to work  and sometimes work long hours to make this happen if you are looking for a  hour work week this is not the place for you  however i see this as a symptom of the industry and american worklife balance in general not specifically freestone i see it as a learning experience and variety of workflow keeping it interesting but some people view the fact that employees wear multiple hats or are responsible for many tasks as a negative see comments about being a cog
