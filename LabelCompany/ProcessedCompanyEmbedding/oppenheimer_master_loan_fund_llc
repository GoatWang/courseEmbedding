fund performance discussion how has the fund performed below is a discussion by oppenheimerfunds inc of the fund�s performance during its fiscal period ended september�  followed by a graphical comparison of the fund�s performance to an appropriate broadbased market index management�s discussion of fund performance for the reporting period ended september�  the fund returned outpacing its benchmark the credit suisse leveraged loan index which returned  the fund�s negative absolute performance was primarily due to unusually volatile conditions in the bank loan market and credit problems affecting a small number of holdings a severe credit crisis and economic slowdown roiled the financial markets over the reporting period and the bank loan market proved to be no exception �����turbulence in the credit markets occurred throughout the reporting period when investor concerns in the subprime mortgage sector of the us bond market began to spread to stocks and other fixedincome market sectors as more subprime mortgage holders defaulted on their loans due to higher interest rates and declining housing prices investors grew increasingly concerned that other market sectors would be adversely affected at the same time the us economy suffered a downturn also led by the plunge in home values and exacerbated by soaring fuel and food prices �����as a result previously risktolerant investors began to reassess their attitudes toward risk sparking selling pressure in most asset classes other than us treasury securities this �flight to quality� produced price declines in both lower risk and higher risk credits a number of highly leveraged institutional sellers faced with margin calls and redemption requests were compelled to raise cash by selling their more creditworthy holdings which prolonged and intensified the credit crisis early in  in addition many of the world�s largest and more recognizable commercial and investment banks reported massive subprime related losses reinforcing negative investor sentiment contrary to many analysts� expectations early in  reports of writeoffs and writedowns continued through the end of the reporting period fueling additional market turbulence �����in addition to the economic and market influences discussed above the bank loan market was influenced by its own supplyanddemand factors as investors grew increasingly riskaverse demand for bank loans and other forms of corporate debt waned the collapse of the structured securities market which previously had been a robust source of demand for bank loans was particularly noteworthy meanwhile a surge in leveraged buyouts during the first half of  left an �overhang� of unsold loans and supply remained ample for some time these imbalanced technical conditions put downward pressure on loan prices in the primary and secondary markets   oppenheimer master loan fund llc � � �����in the midst of persistently unsettled economic and market conditions throughout the reporting period we maintained a generally defensive investment strategy deemphasizing loans from issuers in industry groups�such as retailers consumer products finance and housing�that we regarded as relatively sensitive to macroeconomic factors instead we focused primarily on loans from issuers in less cyclical areas including the health care and energy sectors in addition the fund held no exposure to troubled subprime mortgages during the reporting period �����this sector allocation strategy enabled the fund to participate more fully in some of the bank loan market�s better performing areas while sheltering it from the full brunt of weakness among the laggards overweight positions in the energy health care and cableandbroadcasting sectors proved particularly beneficial to the fund�s relative performance however the positive effects of our sector allocations were offset by shortfalls in our security selection strategy as credit issues among individual holdings in the building materials and consumer products areas detracted from performance �����as of the reporting period�s end we have maintained the fund�s generally defensive investment posture we are albeit selectively taking a more proactive approach to capturing potential opportunities among what we believe to be fundamentally sound loans that may have been punished too severely during the downturn comparing the fund�s performance to the market the graph that follows shows the performance of a hypothetical  investment in shares of the fund held until september�  performance is measured from inception of the fund on october   the fund�s performance reflects the reinvestment of all dividends and capital gains distributions past performance cannot guarantee future results �����the fund�s performance is compared to the credit suisse leveraged loan index a representative index of tradable senior secured us dollardenominated noninvestmentgrade loans index performance reflects the reinvestment of income but does not consider the effect of transaction costs and none of the data in the graph shows the effect of taxes the fund�s performance reflects the effects of the fund�s business and operating expenses while index comparisons may be useful to provide a benchmark for the fund�s performance it must be noted that the fund�s investments are not limited to the investments in the index   oppenheimer master loan fund llc � � fund performance discussion comparison of change in value of  hypothetical investments in ����� the performance data quoted represents past

contingent deferred sales charges on redemptions and redemption fees if applicable and  ongoing costs including management fees distribution and service fees and other fund expenses these examples are

investment of  invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire month period ended september�  actual expenses the first section of the table provides information about actual account values and actual expenses you may use the information in this section together with the amount you invested to estimate the expense that you paid over the period simply divide your account value by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number in the first section under the heading entitled �expenses paid during period� to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period hypothetical example for comparison purposes the second section of the table provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the fund�s actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of  per year before expenses which is not the actual return the hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period you may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the fund and other funds to do so compare this  hypothetical

or a basket of securities the �reference asset� �����the buyer of protection pays a periodic fee similar to an insurance premium to the seller of protection based on the notional amount of debt securities underlying the swap contract the seller of protection agrees to compensate the buyer of protection for future potential losses as a result of a credit event on the reference asset the contract effectively transfers the credit event risk of the reference asset from the buyer of protection to the seller of protection �����the ongoing value of the contract will fluctuate throughout the term of the contract based primarily on the credit risk of the reference asset if the credit quality of the reference asset improves relative to the credit quality at contract initiation the buyer of protection may have an unrealized loss greater than the anticipated periodic fee owed this unrealized loss would be the result of current credit protection being cheaper than the cost of credit protection at contract initiation if the buyer elects to terminate the contract prior to its maturity and there has been no credit event this unrealized loss will become realized if the contract is held to maturity and there has been no credit event the realized loss will be equal to the periodic fee paid over the life of the contract �����if there is a credit event the buyer of protection can

head of the operations group at eaton vance and steve levielle an employee in the operations group at eaton vance id eaton vance asserts that these two set of email communications between itself and kaye scholer are privileged for several reasons first eaton vance argues that kaye scholer  of  filed new york county clerk   am  nyscef doc no  index no  received nyscef  index no  mtn seq no  page  of  represented it in its capacity as a member of the steering committee to support this contention eaton vance points to a kaye scholer press release in which kaye scholer claimsto have represented both deutsche bank and the iaps lender group in the iap restructuring nyscef doc no  christensen similarly contends that messersmith and kaye scholer advised eaton vance as an individual lender throughout the process of the restructuring christensen  ebt p  second saton vance argues that its communications with messersmith and kaye scholer post restructuring but pretransfer of oppenheimers shares are privileged because those communications were that of a prospective client seeking legal advice in his affidavit christensen explains the nature of the relationship as follows i have always on behalf of eaton vance obtained the legal services of mr messersmith and kaye scholer before during and after the iap restructuring was concluded all of my dealings with mr messersmith which have extended across several legal matters and have occurred over several years have been in the context of an attorneyclient relatiortship he has consistently undertaken to provide me with the legal services i requested on behalf of eaton vance i always understood that he would provide advice consistent with the interests of eaton vance on my side i further understood that our communications were to be confidential i have no reason to think that mr messersmith had a different view christensen aff   nyscef doc no  as a result of this alleged longstanding professional relationship with messersmith christensen further explained in  of  filed new york county clerk   am  index no  nyscef doc no  received nyscef  index no  mtn seq no  page  of his affidavit that he chose to consult with him transfer of shares regrding  the in that regard he provides after oppenheimer honored the right of first refusal on or about april   i sought legal assistance from mr messersmith with regard to the transfer of the iap llc interests from oppenheimer to eaton vance i chose among my various options to contact mr · messersmith because i believed he had the specific legal information i was seeking with regard to the iap situation at that time the plaintiffs motion to compel is directed to my email communications with mr messersmith regarding the transfer of iap llc interests christensen aff   in further support of its privilege claim eaton vance argus that although it had no formal retainer agreement with kaye scholer an attorneyclient relationship can in certain circumstances encompass preliminary consultation with a prospective client see pellegrino v oppenheimer  co inc  add   st dept  in response black diamond argues that eaton vance was never a client of kaye scholer during or after the restructuring and that eaton vance has failed to produce evidence of any such attorneyclient relationship in that regard black diamond points to the fact that eaton vance has failed to establish that there existed between the parties a fee arrangement  formal contract or retainer agreement an informal relationship of representation an actual representation in one aspect or matter  of  filed new york county clerk   am  nyscef doc no  index no  received nyscef  index no  mtn seq no  page  of  or a reasonable belief that messersmith and kaye scholer represented it black diamond also argues that eaton vance cannot claim that it was under the impression that kaye scholer represented it in its capacity as an individual lender of the steeringcommittee and that this relationship extended post restructuring to support that argument black diamond points to the engagement letter signed by deutsche bank the agent at the time of the restructuring which shows that the agent was kaye scholers client not the steering committee kelley affirm ex c black diamond also refers to a letter sent by messersmith to iaps attorneys and forwarded to the first lien lenders including eaton vance which stated that kaye scholer represented the agent kelley affirm ex d and points to the restructuring support agreement in which the first lien lenders acknowledged that kaye scholer represented the agent kelley affirm ex eat§  black diamond argues that if eaton vance was truly under the impression that kaye scholer represnted it eaton vance would not have retained orrick in the t transfer of the iae equity trade with oppenheimer discussion the attorneyclient privilege applies to communications made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice and directed to an attorney

sys intl corp v chemical bank  nyd i   china privatization fund del lp v galaxy entertainment group ltd  add   st dept  in order to establish attorneyclient privilege the party asserting the privilege must first establish the existence of this requisite professional relationship as that between attorney and client ambac assur corp v countrywide home loans nyd    inc  formality is not necessary to create a legal services contract but the words and actions of the parties must be analyzed to assess whether an attorneyclient relationship was formed talansky v schulman  add   st dept  although an attorneyclient relationship can arise only when one contacts an attorney in his capacity as such for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or services id internal quotations and citations omitted a plaintiffs unilateral actions and beliefs are insufficient to form an attorneyclient relationship jane st co v rosenberg  estis  add  st dept  pellegrino v oppenheimer  co inc  add   st dept  when there is nothing in the record to indicate that a law firm either affirmatively  of  filed new york county clerk   am  nyscef doc no  index no  received nyscef  index no  mtn seq no  page  of  led plaintiff to believe it was acting on plaintiffs behalf or knowingly allowed plaintiff to proceed under this misconception jane st co v rosenberg  estis  add at  a clients belief as to the existence of the professional relationship is not dispositive weadick v herlihy  add    st dept internal citations omitted here the record demonstrates that eaton vance has failed to establish the existence of the requisite attorneyclient relationship between itself and messersmith and kaye scholer although eaton vance argues that it had a longstanding relationship wth messersmith it fails to provide any evidence of such besides the selfserving conclusory assertions made by christensen in his affidavit eaton vance fails to provide any evidence regarding kaye sholers or messersmiths perception of the relationship there is no indication in the record that kaye scholer nd messersmith affiimatively led eaton vance to believe they were acting on its behalf or for that matter allowed eaton vance to proceed under this misconception in that regard the press release that eaton vance relies on to deonstrate an attorneyclient relationship is simply insufficient to establish kaye scholers belief that it represented eaton vance in its capacity as a first lien lender particularly in the absence of any supplemental affirmation from messersmith or any kaye scholer  of  filed new york county clerk   am  nyscef doc no  received nyscef  page  of index no  mtn seq no  attorney index no  n  fact the record is devoid of any explanation from eaton vance concerning the absence of such documentary evidence in any event even if eaton vance believed kaye scholer was representing it as part of the steering committee during the restructuring process and not just representing the agerit that fact is of no moment july   here the restructuring was finalized on the  emails and  emails were sent nine and ten months respectively after the restructuring ·further christensens claim in his affidavit that eaton vance sought the advice of kaye scholer regarding the transfer of oppenheimers iap shares is inconsistent with and contrary to his earlier september   ebt when asked at his eposition if he was aware of any work that kaye scholer did that specifically was directed at eaton vance christensen responded only in regards to kaye scholer representing eaton vance in the restructuring stating i generally view kaye scholer as representing us with respect to iap as a member of the first lien lenders christensen  ebt pp   when asked about when he secured advice from kaye scholer and specifically messersmith christian responded that it was throughout the restructuring the  timeframe and sincethen id  thus although christensen briefly alludes to some form of post restructuring communication with messersmith he makes no mention of the iap share transaction  of  filed new york county clerk   am  nyscef doc no  index no  received nyscef  page  of index no  mtn seq no   christensen confirmed in his ebt that orrick was eaton vances outside counsel on the trade documentation id pp  when asked if it was correct that no other lawyers othr than orrick attorneys helped represent eaton vance in the transaction with oppenheimer christensen replied thats correct and that s right id p  in addition with respect to the  emails at the time they were sent eaton vance had already retained orrick to represent it in the iap share tranaction with oppenheimer lhus kaye scholer was merely a third party outside the scope of orrick and eaton vances attorneyclient relationship the principle is well settled that communicatiqns made in the presence of third parties whose presence is known to the client are not privileged communications and can be disclosed subject to few exceptions ambac assur  nyd at  statements made to the agents or employees of the attorney or client  retain their confidential and therefore privileged character where the presence of such third parties is deemed necessary  so too when one attorney represents multiple clients concerning a matter of common interest internal citations omitted those exceptions are not present in this case as no communications were made by an agent to an attorney nor was there a common interest amongst clients as such the attorney client privilege does not attach to the  emails sent  of  filed new york county clerk   am  nyscef doc no  index no  received nyscef  index no  mtn seq no  page  of  between eaton vance orrick and kaye scholer the presence of thirdparty kaye scholer effectively waived the privilege accordingly it is hereby
