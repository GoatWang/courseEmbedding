fema not only is waterrelated damage one of the most common causes of an insurance claim thanks to recent floodzone revisions by fema millions of homeowners are racing to find affordable flood insurance for the first time unfortunately selecting the best flood insurance isnt always the easiest of tasks following is a checklist to use when speaking with an agent about purchasing the right flood insurance protection for your property many underwriters are restricted from writing a new flood policy once a major event is announced so shop for flood insurance ahead of time find out when the flood policy is scheduled to go into effect and ask about purchasing a temporary policy during the interim remember flood insurance doesnt always cost a lot homes in low to moderate risk areas may qualify for preferred risk policies policy specifics understand what type of flooding is included and what is excluded as well as which portion of the policy will cover the damage for example high winds from a hurricane may result in water damage to exposed areas of the home earthquakes can cause pipes to burst and even putting out a fire may result in extensive water damage ask your agent what portions of the policy provide needed protection in different scenarios and evaluate the deductibles limitations and restrictions for each review your risk updated flood maps have resulted in big

national flood insurance program nation flood insurance program background on the national flood insurance program nfip the nfip is a federal program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding this insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods participation in the nfip is based on an agreement between local communities and the federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce a floodplain management ordinance to reduce future flood risks to new construction in special flood hazard areas the federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection against flood losses for decades the national response to flood disasters was generally limited to constructing floodcontrol works such as dams levees seawalls and the like and providing disaster relief to flood victims this approach did not reduce losses nor did it discourage unwise development in some instances it may have actually encouraged additional questionable development to compound the problem the public generally could not buy flood coverage from insurance companies and building techniques to reduce flood damage were often overlooked in the face of mounting flood losses and escalating costs of disaster relief to the general taxpayers the us congress created the nfip the intent was to reduce future flood damage through community floodplain management ordinances and provide protection for property owners against potential losses through an insurance mechanism that requires a premium to be paid for the protection the us congress established the nfip on august   with the passage of the national flood insurance act of  the nfip was broadened and modified with the passage of the flood disaster protection act of  and other legislative measures it was further modified by the national flood insurance reform act of  and the flood insurance reform act of  the nfip is administered by the federal emergency management agency fema a component of the us department of homeland security dhs what is the write your own wyo program the write your own wyo program began in  and is a cooperative undertaking of the insurance

 federal disaster assistance is not the answer federal disaster assistance is only available if the president declares a disaster flood insurance pays even if a disaster is not declared its just good sense to protect your home and business in some instances people have been told that they cannot buy flood insurance because of where they live to clear up this and other misconceptions about national flood insurance the nfip has compiled the following list of common myths about the program and the real facts behind them to give the full story about this valuable protection myth you cant buy flood insurance if you are located in a highfloodrisk area fact you can buy national flood insurance no matter where you live if your community participates in the nfip except in coastal barrier resources system cbrs areas the program was created in  to make federally backed flood insurance available to property owners who live in eligible communities flood insurance was then virtually unavailable from the private insurance industry the flood disaster protection act of  as amended requires federally regulated lending institutions to make sure that mortgage loans secured by buildings in highfloodrisk areas are protected by flood insurance lenders should notify borrowers prior to closing that their property is located in a highfloodrisk area and that national flood insurance is required myth you cant buy flood insurance immediately before or during a flood fact you can purchase national flood insurance at any time there is usually a day waiting period after premium payment before the policy is effective with the following exceptions  if the initial purchase of flood insurance is in connection with the making increasing extending or renewing of a loan there is no waiting period coverage becomes effective at the time of the loan provided application and payment of premium is made at or prior to loan closing  if the initial purchase of flood insurance is made during the month period following the effective date of a revised flood map for a community there is a day waiting period this applies only where the flood insurance rate map firm is revised to show the building to be in a special flood hazard area sfha when it had not been in an sfha the policy does not cover a loss in progress defined by the nfip as a loss occurring as of  am on the first day of the policy term in addition you cannot increase the amount of insurance coverage you have during a loss in progress myth homeowners insurance policies cover flooding fact unfortunately many home and business owners do not find out until it is too late that their homeowners and business multiperil policies do not cover flooding the nfip offers a separate policy that protects the single most important financial asset which for most people is their home or business homeowners can include contents coverage in their nfip policy residential and commercial renters can purchase contents coverage business owners can purchase flood insurance coverage for their buildings and contentsinventory and by doing so protect their livelihood myth flood insurance is only available for homeowners fact most people who live in nfip participating communities including renters and condo unit owners are eligible to purchase federally backed flood insurance a maximum of  of building coverage is available for singlefamily residential buildings  per unit for residential condominiums the limit for contents coverage on all residential buildings is  which is also available to renters commercial structures can be insured to a limit of  for the building and  for the contents the maximum insurance limit may not exceed the insurable value of the property myth you cant buy flood insurance if your property has been flooded fact you are still eligible to purchase flood insurance after your home apartment or business has been flooded provided that your community is participating in the nfip myth only residents of highfloodrisk areas need to insure their property fact all areas are susceptible to flooding although to varying degrees if you live in a lowtomoderate flood risk area it is advisable to have flood insurance between  and  percent of the nfips claims come from outside highfloodrisk areas residential and commercial property owners located in lowtomoderate risk areas should ask their agents if they are eligible for the preferred risk policy which provides very inexpensive flood insurance protection myth national flood insurance can only be purchased through the nfip directly fact nfip flood insurance is sold through private insurance companies and agents and is backed by the federal government myth the nfip does not offer any type of basement coverage fact yes it does the nfip defines a basement as any area of a building with a floor that is below ground level on all sides while flood insurance does not cover basement improvements such as finished walls floors or ceilings or personal belongings kept in a basement such as furniture and other contents it does cover structural elements and essential equipment the following items are covered under building coverage as long as they are connected to a power source if required and installed in their functioning location sump pumps well water tanks and pumps cisterns and the water in them oil tanks and the oil in them natural gas tanks and the gas in them pumps andor tanks used in conjunction with solar energy furnaces water heaters air conditioners and heat pumps electrical junction and circuit breaker boxes and required utility connections foundation elements stairways staircases elevators and dumbwaiters unpainted drywall walls and ceilings including fiberglass insulation cleanup the following items are covered under contents coverage clothes washers and dryers food freezers and the food in them the nfip recommends both building and contents coverage for the broadest protection myth the nfip encourages coastal development fact one of the nfips primary objectives is to guide development away from highfloodrisk areas nfip regulations minimize the impact of structures that are built in sfhas by requiring them not to cause obstructions to the natural flow of floodwaters also as a condition of community participation in the nfip those structures built within sfhas must adhere to strict floodplain management regulations enforced by the community in addition the coastal barrier resources act cbra of  relies on the nfip to discourage building in fragile coastal areas by prohibiting the sale of flood insurance in designated cbra areas while the nfip does not prohibit property owners from building in these areas any federal financial assistance including federally backed flood insurance is prohibited however the cbra does not prohibit privately financed development or insurance myth federal disaster assistance will pay for flood damage fact before a community is eligible for disaster assistance it must be declared a federal disaster area federal disaster assistance declarations are issued in less than  percent of flooding events the premium for an nfip policy averaging a little over  a year can be less expensive than the monthly payments on a federal disaster loan furthermore if you are uninsured and receive federal disaster assistance after a flood you must purchase flood insurance to remain eligible for future disaster relief flood zones explained zonea geographical area shown on a flood hazard boundary map or a flood insurance rate map that reflects the severity or

discourages development by withholding subsidized insurance also a study released by the fema on june   reported that close to  homes and buildings have been built on land likely to wash away during

about bluefin ministry of defence to insurance chief investor in customers awards three stars to jelf and bluefin merger uk general announces new chief risk officer inet launches flood re products specialist property mga inet has launched a flood re solution for nonstandard homes alongside a new learning hub for brokers speaking to insurance business uk chairman of inet catherine bell said the solution has been in the works for a very long time as well as being chairman of inet bell is also on the board of the managing general agents association and chairman of the mgaa membership benefits committee she said these positions and her work with biba made her very aware of the demand among brokers for a flood re product for nonstandard homes “i was very keen to help consumers via brokers and because of the government’s new signposting for consumers to brokers which is something biba have been very active in” bell said “it made perfect sense that as an mga supporting those brokers that we needed to get our act together be nimble and quick and research how we could really make a difference and take part in that” one of the reasons inet has been able to quickly launch its own solution is the company’s internal software systems by building software in house bell said the company did not have to get in the queue and wait for a software developer to do the work for them the new scheme is also accompanied by extensive updates to inet’s learning hub to educate brokers about the new solution “the learning hub is the icing on the cake of our service delivery of added value to our broker partners because it gives them access to a concise and clear message on the product for their whole organisation to understand how that can be offered to their clients” said bell bell praised the work of flood re ceo brendan mccafferty in handling a very difficult project “it’s been difficult by everyone’s own admission” she said “it was a little bit like holding a tiger by the tail at one point because they were trying to put together an offer that would work financially” bell said she hopes inet’s new product will help many property owners who have found it virtually impossible to get insurance to find cover the first to get access to the solution are bluefin network broker partners director of bluefin network duncan pagan said brokers who are reaching out to the right customers will benefit most from these changes “inet has worked very hard to be ready for flood re and i’m delighted that our partner brokers have access to their solutions and training materials” said pagan

federal emergency management agency fema not only is waterrelated damage one of the most common causes of an insurance claim thanks to recent floodzone revisions by fema millions of homeowners are racing to find affordable flood insurance for the first time unfortunately selecting the best flood insurance isnt always the easiest of tasks following is a checklist to use when speaking with an agent about purchasing the right flood insurance protection for your property many underwriters are restricted from writing a new flood policy once a major event is announced so shop for flood insurance ahead of time find out when the flood policy is scheduled to go into effect and ask about purchasing a temporary policy during the interim remember flood insurance doesnt always cost a lot homes in low to moderate risk areas may qualify for preferred risk policies policy specifics understand what type of flooding is included and what is excluded as well as which portion of the policy will cover the damage for example high winds from a hurricane may result in water damage to exposed areas of the home earthquakes can cause pipes to burst and even putting out a fire may result in extensive water damage ask your agent what portions of the policy provide needed protection in different scenarios and evaluate the deductibles limitations and restrictions for each review your risk

flood insurance info blog national flood insurance program nation flood insurance program background on the national flood insurance program nfip the nfip is a federal program enabling property owners in participating communities to purchase insurance protection against losses from flooding this insurance is designed to provide an insurance alternative to disaster assistance to meet the escalating costs of repairing damage to buildings and their contents caused by floods participation in the nfip is based on an agreement between local communities and the federal government that states if a community will adopt and enforce a floodplain management ordinance to reduce future flood risks to new construction in special flood hazard areas the federal government will make flood insurance available within the community as a financial protection against flood losses for decades the national response to flood disasters was generally limited to constructing floodcontrol works such as dams levees seawalls and the like and providing disaster relief to flood victims this approach did not reduce losses nor did it discourage unwise development in some instances it may have actually encouraged additional questionable development to compound the problem the public generally could not buy flood coverage from insurance companies and building techniques to reduce flood damage were often overlooked in the face of mounting flood losses and escalating costs of disaster relief to the general taxpayers the us congress created the nfip the intent was to reduce future flood damage through community floodplain management ordinances and provide protection for property owners against potential losses through an insurance mechanism that requires a premium to be paid for the protection the us congress established the nfip on august   with the passage of the national flood insurance act of  the nfip was broadened and modified with the passage of the flood disaster protection act of  and other legislative measures it was further modified by the national flood insurance reform act of  and the flood insurance reform act of  the nfip is administered by the federal

your home or business  federal disaster assistance is not the answer federal disaster assistance is only available if the president declares a disaster flood insurance pays even if a disaster is not declared its just good sense to protect your home and business in some instances people have been told that they cannot buy flood insurance because of where they live to clear up this and other misconceptions about national flood insurance the nfip has compiled the following list of common myths about the program and the real facts behind them to give the full story about this valuable protection myth you cant buy flood insurance if you are located in a highfloodrisk area fact you can buy national flood insurance no matter where you live if your community participates in the nfip except in coastal barrier resources system cbrs areas the program was created in  to make federally backed flood insurance available to property owners who live in eligible communities flood insurance was then virtually unavailable from the private insurance industry the flood disaster protection act of  as amended requires federally regulated lending institutions to make sure that mortgage loans secured by buildings in highfloodrisk areas are protected by flood insurance lenders should notify borrowers prior to closing that their property is located in a highfloodrisk area and that national flood insurance is required myth you cant buy flood insurance immediately before or during a flood fact you can purchase national flood insurance at any time there is usually a day waiting period after premium payment before the policy is effective with the following exceptions  if the initial purchase of flood insurance is in connection with the making increasing extending or renewing of a loan there is no waiting period coverage becomes effective at the time of the loan provided application and payment of premium is made at or prior to loan closing  if the initial purchase of flood insurance is made during the month period following the effective date of a revised flood map for a community there is a day waiting period this applies only where the flood insurance rate map firm is revised to show the building to be in a special flood hazard area sfha when it had not been in an sfha the policy does not cover a loss in progress defined by the nfip as a loss occurring as of  am on the first day of the policy term in addition you cannot increase the amount of insurance coverage you have during a loss in progress myth homeowners insurance policies cover flooding fact unfortunately many home and business owners do not find out until it is too late that their homeowners and business multiperil policies do not cover flooding the nfip offers a separate policy that protects the single most important financial asset which for most people is their home or business homeowners can include contents coverage in their nfip policy residential and commercial renters can purchase contents coverage business owners can purchase flood insurance coverage for their buildings and contentsinventory and by doing so protect their livelihood myth flood insurance is only available for homeowners fact most people who live in nfip participating communities including renters and condo unit owners are eligible to purchase federally backed flood insurance a maximum of  of building coverage is available for singlefamily residential buildings  per unit for residential condominiums the limit for contents coverage on all residential buildings is  which is also available to renters commercial structures can be insured to a limit of  for the building and  for the contents the maximum insurance limit may not exceed the insurable value of the property myth you cant buy flood insurance if your property has been flooded fact you are still eligible to purchase flood insurance after your home apartment or business has been flooded provided that your community is participating in the nfip myth only residents of highfloodrisk areas need to insure their property fact all areas are susceptible to flooding although to varying degrees if you live in a lowtomoderate flood risk area it is advisable to have flood insurance between  and  percent of the nfips claims come from outside highfloodrisk areas residential and commercial property owners located in lowtomoderate risk areas should ask their agents if they are eligible for the preferred risk policy which provides very inexpensive flood insurance protection myth national flood insurance can only be purchased through the nfip directly fact nfip flood insurance is sold through private insurance companies and agents and is backed by the federal government myth the nfip does not offer any type of basement coverage fact yes it does the nfip defines a basement as any area of a building with a floor that is below ground level on all sides while flood insurance does not cover basement improvements such as finished walls floors or ceilings or personal belongings kept in a basement such as furniture and other contents it does cover structural elements and essential equipment the following items are covered under building coverage as long as they are connected to a power source if required and installed in their functioning location sump pumps well water tanks and pumps cisterns and the water in them oil tanks and the oil in them natural gas tanks and the gas in them pumps andor tanks used in conjunction with solar energy furnaces water heaters air conditioners and heat pumps electrical junction and circuit breaker boxes and required utility connections foundation elements stairways staircases elevators and dumbwaiters unpainted drywall walls and ceilings including fiberglass insulation cleanup the following items are covered under contents coverage clothes washers and dryers food freezers and the food in them the nfip recommends both building and contents coverage for the broadest protection myth the nfip encourages coastal development fact one of the nfips primary objectives is to guide development away from highfloodrisk areas nfip regulations minimize the impact of structures that are built in sfhas by requiring them not to cause obstructions to the natural flow of floodwaters also as a condition of community participation in the nfip those structures built within sfhas must adhere to strict floodplain management regulations enforced by the community in addition the coastal barrier resources act cbra of  relies on the nfip to discourage building in fragile coastal areas by prohibiting the sale of flood insurance in designated cbra areas while the nfip does not prohibit property owners from building in these areas any federal financial assistance including federally backed flood insurance is prohibited however the cbra does not prohibit privately financed development or insurance myth federal disaster assistance will pay for flood damage fact before a community is eligible for disaster assistance it must be declared a federal disaster area federal disaster assistance declarations are issued in less than  percent of flooding events the premium for an nfip policy averaging a little over  a year can be less expensive than the monthly payments on a federal disaster loan furthermore if you are uninsured and receive federal disaster assistance after a flood you must purchase flood insurance to remain eligible for future disaster relief flood zones explained zonea geographical area shown on a flood hazard boundary map or a flood

wildlife living in valuable ecological areas the government discourages development by withholding subsidized insurance also a study released by the fema on june   reported that close to  homes and buildings have been built on land likely to wash away during the next  years some insurance companies are willing to expose themselves to higher risks and take on policies in some of the developed
