organizations allegations is clear students and community groups must also adopt a proactive strategy to undermine the credibility and influence of these groups this strategy will marginalize many of

populations are rebelling he said other artists who have voiced opposition to the campaign include writers umberto eco and film makers joel and ethan coen many musicians such as elton john leonard cohen lady gaga rihanna metallica editors placebo lcd soundsystem mgmt justin bieber madonna paul mccartney ziggy marley red hot chili peppers mark ronson depeche mode gilberto gil daniela mercury rolling stones alicia keys tom jones eric burdon bon jovi and ziggy marley have chosen to perform in israel in recent years novelist ian mcewan upon being awarded the jerusalem prize was urged to turn it down but said that if i only went to countries that i approve of i probably would never get out of bed its not great if everyone stops talking the irish dance production riverdance performed in israel in  despite requests that it boycott israel the group stated that riverdance supports the policy of the irish government and indeed the policy of every other eu state that cultural interaction is preferable to isolation reverend jim barr president of the australia palestine advocacy network while supporting the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign against israel disagreed with the protest action at israeliowned max brenner chocolate stores in australia saying that stuff just discredits the whole movement in  noam chomsky was interviewed regarding the boycott movement against israel he said that while he supported correctly targeted boycott calls he called inaccurately targeted boycott calls hypocritical according to chomsky boycotting israeli settlements or arms sales made sense but calling for a boycott of anything israeli or demanding for the right of return would be hypocritical and play into the hands of hardliners in the united states and israel in july  noam chomsky warns that the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign could end up harming the palestinian cause since the demand for a right of return for palestinian refugees has failed to muster significant international support he also said if we boycott tel aviv university because israel violates human rights at home then why not boycott harvard because of far greater violations by the united states in october  izzat abdulhadi head of the general delegation of palestine to australia said that he is against the fullscale bds campaign and in particular expressed his anger over the occasionally violent protests at the max brenner stores in australia saying bds is a nonviolent process and i dont think its the right of anybody to use bds as a violent action or to prevent people from buying from any place  madonnas the mdna tour began in may  in tel aviv israel she said that the concert in tel aviv was a peace concert and offered about  tickets to the show to various israeli and palestinian groups but this offer was rejected by anarchists against the wall and the sheikh jarrah solidarity group one activist said no one is talking about dismantling the privileged regime or of ending the occupation they talk of peace as a philosophical thing without connecting to things happening on the ground and that concert is going in that direction the offer was accepted by the palestinianisraeli peace ngo forum madonnas performance was criticised by a group called boycott from within as a blatant attempt at whitewashing israeli crimes and omar barghouti said that by performing in israel madonna has consciously and shamefully lent her name to figleafing israels occupation and apartheid and showed her obliviousness to human rights ed husain writing in the new york times says that the boycott of israel should end since it is hurting the palestinians more than helping them husain believes that the voice of the palestinian imams who want to see an end to the boycott needs to be amplified as well as those religious leaders in egypt and in saudi arabia who advocate peace in january  scarlett johansson started to promote sodastream an israeli company operating in maale adumim a west bank settlement which sparked criticism from oxfam in response johansson severed ties with oxfam after eight years saying she supports trade and social interaction between a democratic israel and palestine and she has a fundamental difference of opinion with oxfam in regards to the boycott divestment and sanctions movement sodastream plant employs both palestinians and israelis and the company says it is a model of peaceful cooperation in october  jk rowling was one of the  people from the british arts world who signed a letter against the call for a boycott of israel that was made in february the signatories of the letter said cultural boycotts singling out israel are divisive and discriminatory and will not further peace open dialogue and interaction promote greater understanding and mutual acceptance and it is through such understanding and acceptance that movement can be made towards a resolution of the conflict some of the signatories were closely aligned with israel for example via the conservative friends of israel and labour friends of israel united states government response in the united states the export administration act discourages and in some circumstances prohibits us companies and individuals from furthering or supporting the boycott of israel the department of commerces bureau of industry and security bis is responsible for penalties are imposed for each knowing violation with fines of up to  or five times the value of the exports involved whichever is greater and imprisonment of up to five years during the mids the united states adopted two laws that seek to counteract the participation of us citizens in other nations economic boycotts or embargoes these antiboycott laws are the  amendments to the export administration act eaa and the ribicoff amendment to the tax reform act of  tra while these laws share a common purpose there are distinctions in their administration the antiboycott laws were adopted to encourage and in specified cases require us firms to refuse to participate in foreign boycotts that the united states does not sanction they have the effect of preventing us firms from being used to implement foreign policies of other nations which run counter to us policy the arab league boycott of israel is the principal foreign economic boycott that us companies must be concerned with today the antiboycott laws however apply to all boycotts imposed by foreign countries that are unsanctioned by the united states the antiboycott provisions of the export administration regulations ear apply to the activities of us persons in the interstate or foreign commerce of the united states the term us person includes all individuals corporations and unincorporated associations resident in the united states including the permanent domestic affiliates of foreign concerns us persons also include us citizens abroad except when they reside abroad and are employed by nonus persons and the controlled in fact affiliates of domestic concerns the test for controlled in fact is the ability to establish the general policies or to control the daytoday operations of the foreign affiliate the scope of the ear as defined by section  of the eaa is limited to actions taken with intent to comply with further or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott what do the laws prohibit conduct that may be penalized under the tra andor prohibited under the ear includes agreements to refuse or actual refusal to do business with or in israel or with blacklisted companies agreements to discriminate or actual discrimination against other persons based on race religion sex national origin or nationality agreements to furnish or actual furnishing of information about business relationships with or in israel or with blacklisted companies agreements to furnish or actual furnishing of information about the race religion sex or national origin of another person implementing letters of credit containing prohibited boycott terms or conditions the tra does not prohibit conduct but denies tax benefits penalizes for certain types of boycottrelated agreements what must be reported the ear requires us persons to report quarterly requests they have received to take certain actions to comply with further or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott the tra requires taxpayers to report operations in with or related to a boycotting country or its nationals and requests received to participate in or cooperate with an international boycott the treasury department publishes a quarterly list of boycotting countries penalties the export administration act eaa specifies penalties for violations of the antiboycott regulations as well as export control violations these can include criminal the penalties imposed for each knowing violation can be a fine of up to  or five times the value of the exports involved whichever is greater and imprisonment of up to five years during periods when the ear are continued in effect by an executive order issued pursuant to the international emergency economic powers act the criminal penalties for each willful violation can be a fine of up to  and imprisonment for up to ten years administrative for each violation of the ear any or all of the following may be imposed general denial of export privileges the imposition of fines of up to  per violation andor exclusion from practice boycott agreements under the tra involve the denial of all or part of the foreign tax benefits discussed above

of up to the greater of  per violation or twice the value of the transaction for administrative violations of antiboycott regulations and up to  million and  years imprisonment per violation for criminal antiboycott violations israeli government response main article law for prevention of damage to state of israel through boycott on  july  the israeli knesset passed a law that makes the call for a boycott on israel or israeli settlements a civil wrong  members of the knesset voted in favour and  against the law primarily allows targets of announced boycotts to persons and organisations that promote them without having to first prove they were harmed by the boycott the law also allows the israeli government to deny contracts and withdraw financial support to those who promote boycotts the law does not create any criminal offences or criminal sanctions the law was heavily criticized in israel by both leftwing and arab political parties israeli leftist and human rights organizations also criticized the law and launched a public campaign against it prior to the laws approval four israeli human rights groups sent letters to knesset speaker reuven rivlin justice minister yaakov neeman and finance minister yuval steinitz demanding a halt in the approval process of the law after the law was passed the farleft gush shalom movement petitioned the supreme court claiming that the law violated basic democratic principles the supreme court has given the israeli government  days to respondneeds update thirtyfour law professors signed a petition against the law to be forwarded to attorneygeneral yehuda weinstein during an address to the knesset israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu rejected criticism over his failure to attend the boycott law vote and stressed that he had in fact approved the bill he also criticized kadima party members who initially supported the bill and later opposed its final version accusing them of folding to pressure australian government response though israeli chocolate company max brenner is targeted by some australian palestinian activists the australian minister for foreign affairs and former prime minister kevin rudd said i dont think in stcentury australia there is a place for the attempted boycott of a jewish business senior figures in the australian labor party linked action against the australian greens at a state conference where the greens were denied automatic preferences to the greens previous support for the bds movement former new south wales treasurer and australian labor party general secretary eric roozendaal and fellow legislative councillor walt secord stated the greens will carry forever the stain of their support for the bds campaign and their attempts to delegitimise israel and the jewish community—and this is one of the reasons why we must stand strong against the greens in april  prime minister julia gillard said that the campaign does not serve the cause of peace and diplomacy for agreement on a twostate solution between israel and palestine and added that australia has always had firm opposition to the bds movement representing the coalition prior to the  federal election liberal party deputy leader julie bishop reaffirmed gillards stance by promising to cut off federal grants for individuals and institutions who support the bds campaign on  may  jewish australian academics andrew benjamin michele grossman and david goodman condemned the coalitions election promise as an antidemocratic gesture par excellence french supreme court verdict on  may  the cour de cassation one of the french final appeals courts ruled that publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products constitutes incitement and discrimination based on nationality the verdict by the cour de cassation was the final verdict in a lengthy legal battle which consisted of a series of convictions acquittals and appeals french lawyer michael ghnassia wrote that the ban on publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products does not violate freedom of speech because such boycotts affect all israelis and is therefore based on a racial religious or national criterion and rather than representing a simple opinion is a discriminatory action united kingdom a uk court dismissed in  claims that the university and college union was institutionally antisemitic due to motions it had passed in favour of a boycott of israel the judgement by an employment tribunal was strongly critical of the claims referring to them as an impermissible attempt to achieve a political end by litigious means and displaying a worrying disregard for pluralism tolerance and freedom of expression in  a uk administrative court ruled the british government had acted unlawfully in implementing

personal status and family law such as marriage divorce and alimony that are binding on all members of the communities   jacoby tami amanda  women in zones of conflict power and resistance in israel montreal quebec and kingston ontario mcgillqueens university press pp – isbn  although there is no official religion in israel there is also no clear separation between religion and state in israeli public life tensions frequently arise among different streams of judaism ultraorthodox nationalreligious mesorati conservative reconstructionist progressive reform and varying combinations of traditionalism and nonobservance despite this variety in religious observances in society orthodox judaism prevails institutionally over the other streams this boundary is an historical consequence of the unique evolution of the relationship between israel nationalism and state building  since the founding period in order to defuse religious tensions the state of israel has adopted what is known as the status quo an unwritten agreement stipulating that no further changes would be made in the status of religion and that conflict between the observant and nonobservant sectors would be handled circumstantially the status quo has since pertained to the legal status of both religious and secular jews in israel this situation was designed to appease the religious sector and has been upheld indefinitely through the disproportionate power of religious political parties in all subsequent coalition governments  on one hand the declaration of independence adopted in  explicitly guarantees freedom of religion on the other it simultaneously prevents the separation of religion and state in israel   englard izhak winter  law and religion in israel the american journal of comparative law

present in berlinerblau jacques fainberg sarah nou aurora secularism on the edge rethinking churchstate relations in the united states france and israel new york palgrave macmillan pp – isbn  the compromise therefore was to choose constructive ambiguity as surprising as it may seem there is no law that declares judaism the official religion of israel however there is no other law that declares israels neutrality toward all confessions judaism is not recognized as the official religion of the state and even though the jewish muslim and christian clergy receive their salaries from the state this fact does not make israel a neutral state this apparent pluralism cannot dissimulate the fact that israel displays a clear and undoubtedly hierarchical pluralism in religious matters  it is important to note that from a multicultural point of view this selfrestrained secularism allows muslim law to be practiced in israel for personal matters of the muslim community as surprising as it seems if not paradoxical for a state in war israel is the only western democratic country in which sharia enjoys such an official status   sharot stephen  judaism in israel public religion

public life tensions frequently arise among different streams of judaism ultraorthodox nationalreligious mesorati conservative reconstructionist progressive reform and varying combinations of traditionalism and nonobservance despite this variety in religious observances in society orthodox judaism prevails institutionally over the other streams this boundary is an historical consequence of the unique evolution of the relationship between israel nationalism and state building  since the founding period in order to defuse religious tensions the state of israel has adopted what is known as the status quo an unwritten agreement stipulating that no further changes would be made in the status of religion and that conflict between the observant and nonobservant sectors would be handled circumstantially the status quo has since pertained to the legal status of both religious and secular jews in israel this situation was designed to appease the religious sector and has been upheld indefinitely through the disproportionate power of religious political parties in all subsequent coalition governments  on one hand the declaration of independence adopted in  explicitly guarantees freedom of religion on the other it simultaneously prevents the separation of religion and state in israel   englard izhak winter  law and religion in israel the american journal of comparative law

further suggestions june  in august  a strong delegation from the world council of churches produced a report calling for a boycott of goods produced by jewish settlers the report called on the executive of the wcc to affirm the legitimacy of palestinian resistance to injustice and foreign occupation in february  following a sixmonth inquiry a select committee presented a report to the british parliament calling for the suspension of the european unions preferential trade agreement with israel until it israel lifts the movement restrictions which it has placed on palestinian trade between  and  the eu exported £ billion worth of goods to israel while the value of goods imported was £ billion archbishop desmond tutu has called on the international community to treat israel as it treated apartheid south africa and supports the divestment campaign against israel swedish archbishop k g hammar ambassador carl tham and a list of  others have supported a boycott of products from the occupied areas a joint open letter by  uk academics was published in the guardian  january  the letter called on the british government and the british people to take all feasible steps to oblige israel to stop its military aggression and colonial occupation of the palestinian land and its criminal use of force suggesting to start with a programme of boycott divestment and sanctions in  former beatles singer paul mccartney decided to perform in israel for the countrys th anniversary despite a death threat from militant islamic activist omar bakri muhammad who said if he values his life mr mccartney must not come to israel he will not be safe there the sacrifice operatives will be waiting for him omar barghouti one of the founders of the palestinian campaign for the academic and cultural boycott of israel described the threat as deplorable mccartney said i do what i think and i have many friends who support israel in  british member of parliament sir gerald kaufman claimed it is time for our government to make clear to the israeli government that its conduct and policies are unacceptable and to impose a total arms ban on israel norman finkelstein writing in  said he supports a us academic boycott of israel  and an economic boycott of israel “  do israeli human rights violations warrant an economic boycott and  can such a boycott make a meaningful contribution toward ending these violations i would argue that both these questions should be answered in the affirmative ” — norman finkelstein article economic boycott of israel on wwwnormanfinkelsteincom in february  finkelstein launched a blistering attack of the bds movement during an interview saying it was a hypocritical dishonest cult that tries to cleverly pose as human rights activists while in reality their goal is to destroy israel  in addition he said im getting a little bit exasperated with what i think is a whole lot of nonsense im not going to tolerate silliness childishness and a lot of leftist posturing i loathe the disingenuousness we will never hear the solidarity movement back a twostate solution furthermore finkelstein stated that the bds movement has had very few successes and that just like a cult the leaders pretend that they are hugely successful when in reality the general public rejects their extreme views he does mention though that he supports the idea of a nonviolent bds movement in an email dated  december  noam chomsky defended the tactics as nonantisemitic although chomsky believes that any tactic however legitimate can be misused he also remarked that they can also be used quite properly and effectively against state crimes and in this case of bds they regularly have been in may  chomsky along with other professors such as professor malcolm levitt advised professor stephen hawking to boycott an israeli conference in november  a group of  people including nobel peace laureates prominent artists and activists published a letter calling for a military embargo on israel the letter accused several countries of providing assistance to israel that facilitated israels  military operation in the gaza strip nobel peace laureates mairead maguire and adolfo pérez esquivel were among the group signing the letter the antidefamation league whose mission is to stop the defamation of jews has claimed that singling out israel is outrageous and biased as well as deplorable and offensive and heads of several major us jewish organizations have referred to them as lopsided and unbalanced boycott calls have also been called profoundly unjust and relying on a false analogy with the previous apartheid regime of south africa one critical statement has alleged that the boycotters apply different standards to israel than other countries that the boycott is counterproductive and retrograde yet has no comparability to nazi boycotts of jewish shops in the s according to a ruling by the french appellate court of colmar publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products constitutes discrimination and as such is illegal under french law yet the court of cassation the highest criminal court of appeal in france has separately confirmed the legality of calling for a boycott or israeli goods the economist contends that the boycott is flimsy and ineffective that blaming israel alone for the impasse in the occupied territories will continue to strike many outsiders as unfair and points out that the palestinian leadership does not support the boycott in an oped published in the jerusalem post in november  gerald steinberg and jason edelstein contend that while the need to refute their bds organizations allegations is clear students and community groups must also adopt a proactive strategy to undermine the credibility and influence of these groups this strategy will marginalize many of the bds movements central actors and expose the lie that bds is a grassroots protest against israeli policy exposing their abuses and funding sources and forcing their campaign leaders and participants to respond to us will change the dynamic in this battle in an effort to combat bds in march  ngo monitor produced the bds sewer system intended to provide detailed information about boycott campaigns against israel after the postpunk group pil went to tel aviv to headline the heineken music conference  festival in august  british musician john lydon responded to criticism by saying if elvisfuckingcostello wants to pull out of a gig in israel because hes suddenly got this compassion for palestinians then good on him but i have absolutely one rule right until i see an arab country a muslim country with a democracy i wont understand how anyone can have a problem with how theyre treated martin raffel who oversees the israel action network argued in march  that israels supporters can respectfully debate artists who choose to boycott the west bank town of ariel but not recognizing israel as a jewish democratic state is a completely different story in october  the cape town opera cto declined an appeal by desmond tutu to cancel a tour of israel the cto stated that the company was reluctant to adopt the essentially political position of disengagement from cultural ties with israel or with palestine and that they had been in negotiations for four years and would respect the contract gene simmons lead singer of kiss said that artists who avoid israel—such as elvis costello the pixies and roger waters—would be better served directing their anger at arab dictators the countries they should be boycotting are the same countries that the populations are rebelling he said other artists who have voiced opposition to the campaign include writers umberto eco and film makers joel and ethan coen many musicians such as elton john leonard cohen lady gaga rihanna metallica editors placebo lcd soundsystem mgmt justin bieber madonna paul mccartney ziggy marley red hot chili peppers mark ronson depeche mode gilberto gil daniela mercury rolling stones alicia keys tom jones eric burdon bon jovi and ziggy marley have chosen to perform in israel in recent years novelist ian mcewan upon being awarded the jerusalem prize was urged to turn it down but said that if i only went to countries that i approve of i probably would never get out of bed its not great if everyone stops talking the irish dance production riverdance performed in israel in  despite requests that it boycott israel the group stated that riverdance supports the policy of the irish government and indeed the policy of every other eu state that cultural interaction is preferable to isolation reverend jim barr president of the australia palestine advocacy network while supporting the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign against israel disagreed with the protest action at israeliowned max brenner chocolate stores in australia saying that stuff just discredits the whole movement in  noam chomsky was interviewed regarding the boycott movement against israel he said that while he supported correctly targeted boycott calls he called inaccurately targeted boycott calls hypocritical according to chomsky boycotting israeli settlements or arms sales made sense but calling for a boycott of anything israeli or demanding for the right of return would be hypocritical and play into the hands of hardliners in the united states and israel in july  noam chomsky warns that the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign could end up harming the palestinian cause since the demand for a right of return for palestinian refugees has failed to muster significant international support he also said if we boycott tel aviv university because israel violates human rights at home then why not boycott harvard because of far greater violations by the united states in october  izzat abdulhadi head of the general delegation of palestine to australia said that he is against the fullscale bds campaign and in particular expressed his anger over the occasionally violent protests at the max brenner stores in australia saying bds is a nonviolent process and i dont think its the right of anybody to use bds as a violent action or to prevent people from buying from any place  madonnas the mdna tour began in may  in tel aviv israel she said that the concert in tel aviv was a peace concert and offered about  tickets to the show to various israeli and palestinian groups but this offer was rejected by anarchists against the wall and the sheikh jarrah solidarity group one activist said no one is talking about dismantling the privileged regime or of ending the occupation they talk of peace as a philosophical thing without connecting to things happening on the ground and that concert is going in that direction the offer was accepted by the palestinianisraeli peace ngo forum madonnas performance was criticised by a group called boycott from within as a blatant attempt at whitewashing israeli crimes and omar barghouti said that by performing in israel madonna has consciously and shamefully lent her name to figleafing israels occupation and apartheid and showed her obliviousness to human rights ed husain writing in the new york times says that the boycott of israel should end since it is hurting the palestinians more than helping them husain believes that the voice of the palestinian imams who want to see an end to the boycott needs to be amplified as well as those religious leaders in egypt and in saudi arabia who advocate peace in january  scarlett johansson started to promote sodastream an israeli company operating in maale adumim a west bank settlement which sparked criticism from oxfam in response johansson severed ties with oxfam after eight years saying she supports trade and social interaction between a democratic israel and palestine and she has a fundamental difference of opinion with oxfam in regards to the boycott divestment and sanctions movement sodastream plant employs both palestinians and israelis and the company says it is a model of peaceful cooperation in october  jk rowling was one of the  people from the british arts world who signed a letter against the call for a boycott of israel that was made in february the signatories of the letter said cultural boycotts singling out israel are divisive and discriminatory and will not further peace open dialogue and interaction promote greater understanding and mutual acceptance and it is through such understanding and acceptance that movement can be made towards a resolution of the conflict some of the signatories were closely aligned with israel for example via the conservative friends of israel and labour friends of israel united states government response in the united states the export administration act discourages and in some circumstances prohibits us companies and individuals from furthering or supporting the boycott of israel the department of commerces bureau of industry and security bis is responsible for penalties are imposed for each knowing violation with fines of up to  or five times the value of the exports involved whichever is greater and imprisonment of up to

agreements what must be reported the ear requires us persons to report quarterly requests they have received to take certain actions to comply with further or support an unsanctioned foreign boycott the tra requires taxpayers to report operations in with or related to a boycotting country or its nationals and requests received to participate in or cooperate with an international boycott the treasury department publishes a quarterly list of boycotting countries penalties the export administration act eaa specifies penalties for violations of the antiboycott regulations as well as export control violations these can include criminal the penalties imposed for each knowing violation can be a fine of up to  or five times the value of the exports involved whichever is greater and

criminal antiboycott violations israeli government response main article law for prevention of damage to state of israel through boycott on  july  the israeli knesset passed a law that makes the call for a boycott on israel or israeli settlements a civil wrong  members of the knesset voted in favour and  against the law primarily allows targets of announced boycotts to persons and organisations that promote them without having to first prove they were harmed by the boycott the law also allows the israeli government to deny contracts and withdraw financial support to those who promote boycotts the law does not create any criminal offences or criminal sanctions the law was heavily criticized in israel by both leftwing and arab political parties israeli leftist and human rights organizations also criticized the law and launched a public campaign against it prior to the laws approval four israeli human rights groups sent letters to knesset speaker reuven rivlin justice minister yaakov neeman and finance minister yuval steinitz demanding a halt in the approval process of the law after the law was passed the farleft gush shalom movement petitioned the supreme court claiming that the law violated basic democratic principles the supreme court has given the israeli government  days to respondneeds update thirtyfour law professors signed a petition against the law to be forwarded to attorneygeneral yehuda weinstein during an address to the knesset israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu rejected criticism over his failure to attend the boycott law vote and stressed that he had in fact approved the bill he also criticized kadima party members who initially supported the bill and later opposed its final version accusing them of folding to pressure australian government response though israeli chocolate company max brenner is targeted by some australian palestinian activists the australian minister for foreign affairs and former prime minister kevin rudd said i dont think in stcentury australia there is a place for the attempted boycott of a jewish business senior figures in the australian labor party linked action against the australian greens at a state conference where the greens were denied automatic preferences to the greens previous support for the bds movement former new south wales treasurer and australian labor party general secretary eric roozendaal and fellow legislative councillor walt secord stated the greens will carry forever the stain of their support for the bds campaign and their attempts to delegitimise israel and the jewish community—and this is one of the reasons why we must stand strong against the greens in april  prime minister julia gillard said that the campaign does not serve the cause of peace and diplomacy for agreement on a twostate solution between israel and palestine and added that australia has always had firm opposition to the bds movement representing the coalition prior to the  federal election liberal party deputy leader julie bishop reaffirmed gillards stance by promising to cut off federal grants for individuals and institutions who support the bds campaign on  may  jewish australian academics andrew benjamin michele grossman and david goodman condemned the coalitions election promise as an antidemocratic gesture par excellence french supreme court verdict on  may  the cour de cassation one of the french final appeals courts ruled that publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products constitutes incitement and discrimination based on nationality the verdict by the cour de cassation was the final verdict in a lengthy legal battle which consisted of a series of convictions acquittals and appeals french lawyer michael ghnassia wrote that the ban on publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products does not violate freedom of speech because such boycotts affect all israelis and is therefore based on a racial religious or national criterion and rather than representing a simple opinion is a discriminatory action united kingdom a uk court dismissed in  claims that the university and college union was institutionally antisemitic due to motions it had passed in favour of a boycott of israel the judgement by an employment tribunal was strongly critical of the claims referring to them as an impermissible attempt to achieve a political end by litigious means and displaying a worrying disregard for pluralism tolerance and freedom of expression in  a uk administrative court ruled the british government had acted unlawfully in implementing

the british parliament calling for the suspension of the european unions preferential trade agreement with israel until it israel lifts the movement restrictions which it has placed on palestinian trade between  and  the eu exported £ billion worth of goods to israel while the value of goods imported was £ billion archbishop desmond tutu has called on the international community to treat israel

from the occupied areas a joint open letter by  uk academics was published in the guardian  january  the letter called on the british government and the british people to take all feasible steps to oblige israel to stop its military aggression and colonial occupation of the palestinian land and its criminal use of force suggesting to start with a programme of boycott divestment and sanctions in  former beatles singer paul mccartney decided to perform in israel for the countrys th anniversary despite a death threat from militant islamic activist omar bakri muhammad who said if he values his life mr mccartney must not come to israel he will not be safe there the sacrifice operatives will be waiting for him omar barghouti one of the founders of the palestinian campaign for the academic and cultural boycott of israel described the threat as deplorable mccartney said i do what i think and i have many friends who support israel in  british member of parliament sir gerald kaufman claimed it is time for our government to make clear to the israeli government that its conduct and policies are unacceptable and to impose a total arms ban on israel norman finkelstein writing in  said he supports a us academic boycott of israel  and an economic boycott of israel “  do israeli human rights violations warrant an economic boycott and  can such a boycott make a meaningful contribution toward ending these violations i would argue that both these questions should be answered in the affirmative ” — norman finkelstein article economic boycott of israel on wwwnormanfinkelsteincom in february  finkelstein launched a blistering attack of the bds movement during an interview saying it was a hypocritical dishonest cult that tries to cleverly pose as human rights activists while in reality their goal is to destroy israel  in addition he said im getting a little bit exasperated with what i think is a whole lot of nonsense im not going to tolerate silliness childishness and a lot of leftist posturing i loathe the disingenuousness we will never hear the solidarity movement back a twostate solution furthermore finkelstein stated that the bds movement has had very few successes and that just like a cult the leaders pretend that they are hugely successful when in reality the general public rejects their extreme views he does mention though that he supports the idea of a nonviolent bds movement in an email dated  december  noam chomsky defended the tactics as nonantisemitic although chomsky believes that any tactic however legitimate can be misused he also remarked that they can also be used quite properly and effectively against state crimes and in this case of bds they regularly have been in may  chomsky along with other professors such as professor malcolm levitt advised professor stephen hawking to boycott an israeli conference in november  a group of  people including nobel peace laureates prominent artists and activists published a letter calling for a military embargo on israel the letter accused several countries of providing assistance to israel that facilitated israels  military operation in the gaza strip nobel peace laureates mairead maguire and adolfo pérez esquivel were among the group signing the letter the antidefamation league whose mission is to stop the defamation of jews has claimed that singling out israel is outrageous and biased as well as deplorable and offensive and heads of several major us jewish organizations have referred to them as lopsided and unbalanced boycott calls have also been called profoundly unjust and relying on a false analogy with the previous apartheid regime of south africa one critical statement has alleged that the boycotters apply different standards to israel than other countries that the boycott is counterproductive and retrograde yet has no comparability to nazi boycotts of jewish shops in the s according to a ruling by the french appellate court of colmar publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products constitutes discrimination and as such is illegal under french law yet the court of cassation the highest criminal court of appeal in france has separately confirmed the legality of calling for a boycott or israeli goods the economist contends that the boycott is flimsy and ineffective that blaming israel alone for the impasse in the occupied territories will continue to strike many outsiders as unfair and points out that the palestinian leadership does not support the boycott in an oped published in the jerusalem post in november  gerald steinberg and jason edelstein contend that while the need to refute their bds organizations allegations is clear students and community groups must also adopt a proactive strategy to undermine the credibility and influence of these groups this strategy will marginalize many of the bds movements central actors and expose the lie that bds is a grassroots protest against israeli policy exposing their abuses and funding sources and forcing their campaign leaders and participants to respond to us will change the dynamic in this battle in an effort to combat bds in march  ngo monitor produced the bds sewer system intended to provide detailed information about boycott campaigns against israel after the postpunk group pil went to tel aviv to headline the heineken music conference  festival in august  british musician john lydon responded to criticism by saying if elvisfuckingcostello wants to pull out of a gig in israel because hes suddenly got this compassion for palestinians then good on him but i have absolutely one rule right until i see an arab country a muslim country with a democracy i wont understand how anyone can have a problem with how theyre treated martin raffel who oversees the israel action network argued in march  that israels supporters can respectfully debate artists who choose to boycott the west bank town of ariel but not recognizing israel as a jewish democratic state is a completely different story in october  the cape town opera cto declined an appeal by desmond tutu to cancel a tour of israel the cto stated that the company was reluctant to adopt the essentially political position of disengagement from cultural ties with israel or with palestine and that they had been in negotiations for four years and would respect the contract gene simmons lead singer of kiss said that artists who avoid israel—such as elvis costello the pixies and roger waters—would be better served directing their anger at arab dictators the countries they should be boycotting are the same countries that the populations are rebelling he said other artists who have voiced opposition to the campaign include writers umberto eco and film makers joel and ethan coen many musicians such as elton john leonard cohen lady gaga rihanna metallica editors placebo lcd soundsystem mgmt justin bieber madonna paul mccartney ziggy marley red hot chili peppers mark ronson depeche mode gilberto gil daniela mercury rolling stones alicia keys tom jones eric burdon bon jovi and ziggy marley have chosen to perform in israel in recent years novelist ian mcewan upon being awarded the jerusalem prize was urged to turn it down but said that if i only went to countries that i approve of i probably would never get out of bed its not great if everyone stops talking the irish dance production riverdance performed in israel in  despite requests that it boycott israel the group stated that riverdance supports the policy of the irish government and indeed the policy of every other eu state that cultural interaction is preferable to isolation reverend jim barr president of the australia palestine advocacy network while supporting the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign against israel disagreed with the protest action at israeliowned max brenner chocolate stores in australia saying that stuff just discredits the whole movement in  noam chomsky was interviewed regarding the boycott movement against israel he said that while he supported correctly targeted boycott calls he called inaccurately targeted boycott calls hypocritical according to chomsky boycotting israeli settlements or arms sales made sense but calling for a boycott of anything israeli or demanding for the right of return would be hypocritical and play into the hands of hardliners in the united states and israel in july  noam chomsky warns that the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign could end up harming the palestinian cause since the demand for a right of return for palestinian refugees has failed to muster significant international support he also said if we boycott tel aviv university because israel violates human rights at home then why not boycott harvard because of far greater violations by the united states in october  izzat abdulhadi head of the general delegation of palestine to australia said that he is against the fullscale bds campaign and in particular expressed his anger over the occasionally violent protests at the max brenner stores in australia saying bds is a nonviolent process and i dont think its the right of anybody to use bds as a violent action or to prevent people from buying from any place  madonnas the mdna tour began in may  in tel aviv israel she said that the concert in tel aviv was a peace concert and offered about  tickets to the show to various israeli and palestinian groups but this offer was rejected by anarchists against the wall and the sheikh jarrah solidarity group one activist said no one is talking about dismantling the privileged regime or of ending the occupation they talk of peace as a philosophical thing without connecting to things happening on the ground and that concert is going in that direction the offer was accepted by the palestinianisraeli peace ngo forum madonnas performance was criticised by a group called boycott from within as a blatant attempt at whitewashing israeli crimes and omar barghouti said that by performing in israel madonna has consciously and shamefully lent her name to figleafing israels occupation and apartheid and showed her obliviousness to human rights ed husain writing in the new york times says that the boycott of israel should end since it is hurting the palestinians more than helping them husain believes that the voice of the palestinian imams who want to see an end to the boycott needs to be amplified as well as those religious leaders in egypt and in saudi arabia who advocate peace in january  scarlett johansson started to promote sodastream an israeli company operating in maale adumim a west bank settlement which sparked criticism from oxfam in response johansson severed ties with oxfam after eight years saying she supports trade and social interaction between a democratic israel and palestine and she has a fundamental difference of opinion with oxfam in regards to the boycott divestment and sanctions movement sodastream plant employs both palestinians and israelis and the company says it is a model of peaceful cooperation in october  jk rowling was one of the  people from the british arts world who signed a letter against the call for a boycott of israel that was made in february the signatories of the letter said cultural boycotts singling out israel are divisive and discriminatory and will not further peace open dialogue and interaction promote greater understanding and mutual acceptance and it is through such understanding and acceptance that movement can be made towards a resolution of the conflict some of the signatories were closely aligned with israel for example via the conservative friends of israel and labour friends of israel united states government response in the united states the export administration act discourages and in some circumstances prohibits us companies and individuals from furthering or supporting the boycott of israel the department of commerces bureau of industry and security bis is responsible for penalties are imposed for each knowing violation with fines of up to  or five times the value of the exports involved whichever is greater and imprisonment of up to

the tra requires taxpayers to report operations in with or related to a boycotting country or its nationals and requests received to participate in or cooperate with an international boycott the treasury department publishes a quarterly list of boycotting countries penalties the export administration act eaa specifies penalties for violations of the antiboycott regulations as well as export control violations these can include criminal the penalties imposed for each knowing violation can be a fine of up to  or five times the value of the exports involved whichever is greater and

criminal antiboycott violations israeli government response main article law for prevention of damage to state of israel through boycott on  july  the israeli knesset passed a law that makes the call for a boycott on israel or israeli settlements a civil wrong  members of the knesset voted in favour and  against the law primarily allows targets of announced boycotts to persons and organisations that promote them without having to first prove they were harmed by the boycott the law also allows the israeli government to deny contracts and withdraw financial support to those who promote boycotts the law does not create any criminal offences or criminal sanctions the law was heavily criticized in israel by both leftwing and arab political parties israeli leftist and human rights organizations also criticized the law and launched a public campaign against it prior to the laws approval four israeli human rights groups sent letters to knesset speaker reuven rivlin justice minister yaakov neeman and finance minister yuval steinitz demanding a halt in the approval process of the law after the law was passed the farleft gush shalom movement petitioned the supreme court claiming that the law violated basic democratic principles the supreme court has given the israeli government  days to respondneeds update thirtyfour law professors signed a petition against the law to be forwarded to attorneygeneral yehuda weinstein during an address to the knesset israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu rejected criticism over his failure to attend the boycott law vote and stressed that he had in fact approved the bill he also criticized kadima party members who initially supported the bill and later opposed its final version accusing them of folding to pressure australian government response though israeli chocolate company max brenner is targeted by some australian palestinian activists the australian minister for foreign affairs and former prime minister kevin rudd said i dont think in stcentury australia there is a place for the attempted boycott of a jewish business senior figures in the australian labor party linked action against the australian greens at a state conference where the greens were denied automatic preferences to the greens previous support for the bds movement former new south wales treasurer and australian labor party general secretary eric roozendaal and fellow legislative councillor walt secord stated the greens will carry forever the stain of their support for the bds campaign and their attempts to delegitimise israel and the jewish community—and this is one of the reasons why we must stand strong against the greens in april  prime minister julia gillard said that the campaign does not serve the cause of peace and diplomacy for agreement on a twostate solution between israel and palestine and added that australia has always had firm opposition to the bds movement representing the coalition prior to the  federal election liberal party deputy leader julie bishop reaffirmed gillards stance by promising to cut off federal grants for individuals and institutions who support the bds campaign on  may  jewish australian academics andrew benjamin michele grossman and david goodman condemned the coalitions election promise as an antidemocratic gesture par excellence french supreme court verdict on  may  the cour de cassation one of the french final appeals courts ruled that publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products constitutes incitement and discrimination based on nationality the verdict by the cour de cassation was the final verdict in a lengthy legal battle which consisted of a series of convictions acquittals and appeals french lawyer michael ghnassia wrote that the ban on publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products does not violate freedom of speech because such boycotts affect all israelis and is therefore based on a racial religious or national criterion and rather than representing a simple opinion is a discriminatory action united kingdom a uk court dismissed in  claims that the university and college union was institutionally antisemitic due to motions it had passed in favour of a boycott of israel the judgement by an employment tribunal was strongly critical of the claims referring to them as an impermissible attempt to achieve a political end by litigious means and displaying a worrying disregard for pluralism tolerance and freedom of expression in  a uk administrative court ruled the british government had acted unlawfully in implementing

articles for further suggestions june  in august  a strong delegation from the world council of churches produced a report calling for a boycott of goods produced by jewish settlers the report called on the executive of the wcc to affirm the legitimacy of palestinian resistance to injustice and foreign occupation in february  following a sixmonth inquiry a select committee presented a report to the british parliament calling for the suspension of the european unions preferential trade agreement with israel until it israel lifts the movement restrictions which it has placed on palestinian trade between  and  the eu exported £ billion worth of goods to israel while the value of goods imported was £ billion archbishop desmond tutu has called on the international community to treat israel as it treated apartheid south africa and supports the divestment campaign against israel swedish archbishop k g hammar ambassador carl tham and a list of  others have supported a boycott of products from the occupied areas a joint open letter by  uk academics was published in the guardian  january  the letter called on the british government and the british people to take all feasible steps to oblige israel to stop its military aggression and colonial occupation of the palestinian land and its criminal use of force suggesting to start with a programme of boycott divestment and sanctions in  former beatles singer paul mccartney decided to perform in israel for the countrys th anniversary despite a death threat from militant islamic activist omar bakri muhammad who said if he values his life mr mccartney must not come to israel he will not be safe there the sacrifice operatives will be waiting for him omar barghouti one of the founders of the palestinian campaign for the academic and cultural boycott of israel described the threat as deplorable mccartney said i do what i think and i have many friends who support israel in  british member of parliament sir gerald kaufman claimed it is time for our government to make clear to the israeli government that its conduct and policies are unacceptable and to impose a total arms ban on israel norman finkelstein writing in  said he supports a us academic boycott of israel  and an economic boycott of israel “  do israeli human rights violations warrant an economic boycott and  can such a boycott make a meaningful contribution toward ending these violations i would argue that both these questions should be answered in the affirmative ” — norman finkelstein article economic boycott of israel on wwwnormanfinkelsteincom in february  finkelstein launched a blistering attack of the bds movement during an interview saying it was a hypocritical dishonest cult that tries to cleverly pose as human rights activists while in reality their goal is to destroy israel  in addition he said im getting a little bit exasperated with what i think is a whole lot of nonsense im not going to tolerate silliness childishness and a lot of leftist posturing i loathe the disingenuousness we will never hear the solidarity movement back a twostate solution furthermore finkelstein stated that the bds movement has had very few successes and that just like a cult the leaders pretend that they are hugely successful when in reality the general public rejects their extreme views he does mention though that he supports the idea of a nonviolent bds movement in an email dated  december  noam chomsky defended the tactics as nonantisemitic although chomsky believes that any tactic however legitimate can be misused he also remarked that they can also be used quite properly and effectively against state crimes and in this case of bds they regularly have been in may  chomsky along with other professors such as professor malcolm levitt advised professor stephen hawking to boycott an israeli conference in november  a group of  people including nobel peace laureates prominent artists and activists published a letter calling for a military embargo on israel the letter accused several countries of providing assistance to israel that facilitated israels  military operation in the gaza strip nobel peace laureates mairead maguire and adolfo pérez esquivel were among the group signing the letter the antidefamation league whose mission is to stop the defamation of jews has claimed that singling out israel is outrageous and biased as well as deplorable and offensive and heads of several major us jewish organizations have referred to them as lopsided and unbalanced boycott calls have also been called profoundly unjust and relying on a false analogy with the previous apartheid regime of south africa one critical statement has alleged that the boycotters apply different standards to israel than other countries that the boycott is counterproductive and retrograde yet has no comparability to nazi boycotts of jewish shops in the s according to a ruling by the french appellate court of colmar publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products constitutes discrimination and as such is illegal under french law yet the court of cassation the highest criminal court of appeal in france has separately confirmed the legality of calling for a boycott or israeli goods the economist contends that the boycott is flimsy and ineffective that blaming israel alone for the impasse in the occupied territories will continue to strike many outsiders as unfair and points out that the palestinian leadership does not support the boycott in an oped published in the jerusalem post in november  gerald steinberg and jason edelstein contend that while the need to refute their bds organizations allegations is clear students and community groups must also adopt a proactive strategy to undermine the credibility and influence of these groups this strategy will marginalize many of the bds movements central actors and expose the lie that bds is a grassroots protest against israeli policy exposing their abuses and funding sources and forcing their campaign leaders and participants to respond to us will change the dynamic in this battle in an effort to combat bds in march  ngo monitor produced the bds sewer system intended to provide detailed information about boycott campaigns against israel after the postpunk group pil went to tel aviv to headline the heineken music conference  festival in august  british musician john lydon responded to criticism by saying if elvisfuckingcostello wants to pull out of a gig in israel because hes suddenly got this compassion for palestinians then good on him but i have absolutely one rule right until i see an arab country a muslim country with a democracy i wont understand how anyone can have a problem with how theyre treated martin raffel who oversees the israel action network argued in march  that israels supporters can respectfully debate artists who choose to boycott the west bank town of ariel but not recognizing israel as a jewish democratic state is a completely different story in october  the cape town opera cto declined an appeal by desmond tutu to cancel a tour of israel the cto stated that the company was reluctant to adopt the essentially political position of disengagement from cultural ties with israel or with palestine and that they had been in negotiations for four years and would respect the contract gene simmons lead singer of kiss said that artists who avoid israel—such as elvis costello the pixies and roger waters—would be better served directing their anger at arab dictators the countries they should be boycotting are the same countries that the populations are rebelling he said other artists who have voiced opposition to the campaign include writers umberto eco and film makers joel and ethan coen many musicians such as elton john leonard cohen lady gaga rihanna metallica editors placebo lcd soundsystem mgmt justin bieber madonna paul mccartney ziggy marley red hot chili peppers mark ronson depeche mode gilberto gil daniela mercury rolling stones alicia keys tom jones eric burdon bon jovi and ziggy marley have chosen to perform in israel in recent years novelist ian mcewan upon being awarded the jerusalem prize was urged to turn it down but said that if i only went to countries that i approve of i probably would never get out of bed its not great if everyone stops talking the irish dance production riverdance performed in israel in  despite requests that it boycott israel the group stated that riverdance supports the policy of the irish government and indeed the policy of every other eu state that cultural interaction is preferable to isolation reverend jim barr president of the australia palestine advocacy network while supporting the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign against israel disagreed with the protest action at israeliowned max brenner chocolate stores in australia saying that stuff just discredits the whole movement in  noam chomsky was interviewed regarding the boycott movement against israel he said that while he supported correctly targeted boycott calls he called inaccurately targeted boycott calls hypocritical according to chomsky boycotting israeli settlements or arms sales made sense but calling for a boycott of anything israeli or demanding for the right of return would be hypocritical and play into the hands of hardliners in the united states and israel in july  noam chomsky warns that the boycott divestment and sanctions campaign could end up harming the palestinian cause since the demand for a right of return for palestinian refugees has failed to muster significant international support he also said if we boycott tel aviv university because israel violates human rights at home then why not boycott harvard because of far greater violations by the united states in october  izzat abdulhadi head of the general delegation of palestine to australia said that he is against the fullscale bds campaign and in particular expressed his anger over the occasionally violent protests at the max brenner stores in australia saying bds is a nonviolent process and i dont think its the right of anybody to use bds as a violent action or to prevent people from buying from any place  madonnas the mdna tour began in may  in tel aviv israel she said that the concert in tel aviv was a peace concert and offered about  tickets to the show to various israeli and palestinian groups but this offer was rejected by anarchists against the wall and the sheikh jarrah solidarity group one activist said no one is talking about dismantling the privileged regime or of ending the occupation they talk of peace as a philosophical thing without connecting to things happening on the ground and that concert is going in that direction the offer was accepted by the palestinianisraeli peace ngo forum madonnas performance was criticised by a group called boycott from within as a blatant attempt at whitewashing israeli crimes and omar barghouti said that by performing in israel madonna has consciously and shamefully lent her name to figleafing israels occupation and apartheid and showed her obliviousness to human rights ed husain writing in the new york times says that the boycott of israel should end since it is hurting the palestinians more than helping them husain believes that the voice of the palestinian imams who want to see an end to the boycott needs to be amplified as well as those religious leaders in egypt and in saudi arabia who advocate peace in january  scarlett johansson started to promote sodastream an israeli company operating in maale adumim a west bank settlement which sparked criticism from oxfam in response johansson severed ties with oxfam after eight years saying she supports trade and social interaction between a democratic israel and palestine and she has a fundamental difference of opinion with oxfam in regards to the boycott divestment and sanctions movement sodastream plant employs both palestinians and israelis and the company says it is a model of peaceful cooperation in october  jk rowling was one of the  people from the british arts world who signed a letter against the call for a boycott of israel that was made in february the signatories of the letter said cultural boycotts singling out israel are divisive and discriminatory and will not further peace open dialogue and interaction promote greater understanding and mutual acceptance and it is through such understanding and acceptance that movement can be made towards a resolution of the conflict some of the signatories were closely aligned with israel for example via the conservative friends of israel and labour friends of israel united states government response in the united states the export administration act discourages and in some circumstances prohibits us companies and individuals from furthering or supporting the boycott of israel the department of commerces bureau of industry and security bis is responsible for penalties are imposed for each knowing violation with fines of up to  or five times the value of the exports involved whichever is greater and imprisonment of up to

the tra requires taxpayers to report operations in with or related to a boycotting country or its nationals and requests received to participate in or cooperate with an international boycott the treasury department publishes a quarterly list of boycotting countries penalties the export administration act eaa specifies penalties for violations of the antiboycott regulations as well as export control violations these can include criminal the penalties imposed for each knowing violation can be a fine of up to  or five times the value of the exports involved whichever is greater and

criminal antiboycott violations israeli government response main article law for prevention of damage to state of israel through boycott on  july  the israeli knesset passed a law that makes the call for a boycott on israel or israeli settlements a civil wrong  members of the knesset voted in favour and  against the law primarily allows targets of announced boycotts to persons and organisations that promote them without having to first prove they were harmed by the boycott the law also allows the israeli government to deny contracts and withdraw financial support to those who promote boycotts the law does not create any criminal offences or criminal sanctions the law was heavily criticized in israel by both leftwing and arab political parties israeli leftist and human rights organizations also criticized the law and launched a public campaign against it prior to the laws approval four israeli human rights groups sent letters to knesset speaker reuven rivlin justice minister yaakov neeman and finance minister yuval steinitz demanding a halt in the approval process of the law after the law was passed the farleft gush shalom movement petitioned the supreme court claiming that the law violated basic democratic principles the supreme court has given the israeli government  days to respondneeds update thirtyfour law professors signed a petition against the law to be forwarded to attorneygeneral yehuda weinstein during an address to the knesset israeli prime minister benjamin netanyahu rejected criticism over his failure to attend the boycott law vote and stressed that he had in fact approved the bill he also criticized kadima party members who initially supported the bill and later opposed its final version accusing them of folding to pressure australian government response though israeli chocolate company max brenner is targeted by some australian palestinian activists the australian minister for foreign affairs and former prime minister kevin rudd said i dont think in stcentury australia there is a place for the attempted boycott of a jewish business senior figures in the australian labor party linked action against the australian greens at a state conference where the greens were denied automatic preferences to the greens previous support for the bds movement former new south wales treasurer and australian labor party general secretary eric roozendaal and fellow legislative councillor walt secord stated the greens will carry forever the stain of their support for the bds campaign and their attempts to delegitimise israel and the jewish community—and this is one of the reasons why we must stand strong against the greens in april  prime minister julia gillard said that the campaign does not serve the cause of peace and diplomacy for agreement on a twostate solution between israel and palestine and added that australia has always had firm opposition to the bds movement representing the coalition prior to the  federal election liberal party deputy leader julie bishop reaffirmed gillards stance by promising to cut off federal grants for individuals and institutions who support the bds campaign on  may  jewish australian academics andrew benjamin michele grossman and david goodman condemned the coalitions election promise as an antidemocratic gesture par excellence french supreme court verdict on  may  the cour de cassation one of the french final appeals courts ruled that publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products constitutes incitement and discrimination based on nationality the verdict by the cour de cassation was the final verdict in a lengthy legal battle which consisted of a series of convictions acquittals and appeals french lawyer michael ghnassia wrote that the ban on publicly calling for a boycott of israeli products does not violate freedom of speech because such boycotts affect all israelis and is therefore based on a racial religious or national criterion and rather than representing a simple opinion is a discriminatory action united kingdom a uk court dismissed in  claims that the university and college union was institutionally antisemitic due to motions it had passed in favour of a boycott of israel the judgement by an employment tribunal was strongly critical of the claims referring to them as an impermissible attempt to achieve a political end by litigious means and displaying a worrying disregard for pluralism tolerance and freedom of expression in  a uk administrative court ruled the british government had acted unlawfully in implementing

israels tariff classification is based on the harmonized system hs code israel’s customs and purchase tax tariff is the main instrument used for the classification of goods the correct classification of goods is the key to determining tax rates as well as obtaining various authorizations permits and licenses and all other conditions of importation in accordance to the applicable laws regulations and instructions we recommend contacting a professional customs broker for consultation since classification of goods requires professional knowledge israeli customs provides free preruling

department trade barriers in general israel offers a good commercial environment for us companies the united statesisrael free trade agreement fta has eliminated almost all tariffs leaving israels agricultural sector as the only one with substantial barriers the fta also provides for a joint committee comprised of representatives from both countries to review the functioning of the agreement israel is a member of the world trade organization wto a  agreement on trade in agricultural products atap with the united states permits israel to maintain nontariff protection for certain agricultural products this framework expired at the end of  but the signed agreement was renegotiated and extended until the end of  since then the agreement was extended three times until the end of  negotiations on a new expanded agreement are ongoing with the intention of both sided to sign the agreement before the end of under the agreement israel permits free access to a long list of food products and dutyfree access for certain quantities of a list of us products under tariff rate quotas trq american exporters and israeli importers however complain that these trqs provide an insufficient dutyfree quota for many fruits and other products and very high tariffs on imports above quota israel excludes most of us fresh vegetative products on phytosanitary grounds israel has revised its phytosanitary restrictions and requirements making them consistent with wto requirements the us embassy in tel aviv is very actively pursuing muchneeded improvements in the export and investment climate for us firms in israel these efforts are focused in three specific areas incorporating technical standards in israel that do not discriminate against us products protecting intellectual property rights and establishing greater transparency in israel’s public procurement process for further information about how these issues may affect your export prospects in israel

quantity indicated in the license importers wishing to bring in goods without availing themselves of the trq are not required to obtain a license all imported agricultural and food products must carry a health certificate or an import license for veterinary phytosanitary or public health reasons the israel veterinary services ivs the plant protection and inspection services ppis and the food control service fcs of the ministry of health issue these licenses respectively please contact agricultural specialist yossi barak for more details at yossibarakusdagov us export controls us exporters to israel must follow standard us government requirements regarding export control documentation for sensitive us technology exports  for information on this subject contact the us department of commerce bureau of industry and security internet web site httpwwwbisdocgov or the trade information center at  or the us department of state directorate of defense trade controls ddtc although israel is not a signatory to the wassenaar arrangement it has adopted the wassenaar list of dualuse items subject to control as of january   the ministry of industry trade  labor is responsible for the administration of israel’s dualuse export control system however it lacks sufficient trained personnel to shoulder this responsibility completely and continues to rely on staff work of the ministry of defense the ministry of defense has established a new division to deal exclusively with the export controls of defense items us export licenses are required for exports to israel of certain high technology defense related equipment and technologies and weapons for chemical and biological warfare us exporters should ensure that they are in compliance with the export control regulations as administered through the us department of commerce bureau of industry  security and us department of state office of defense trade controls temporary entry temporary entry of usmade goods is possible with an ata carnet issued by a us chamber of commerce or through payment of a deposit reimbursable upon reexport labeling and marking requirements israel has strict marking and labeling requirements that frequently differ from those of other countries us exporters should consult with their israeli importer prior to shipping any product that will be offered to the local market the food control services fcs of the ministry of health his enforcing the labeling regulations embassy tel aviv is working with the ministry to try to resolve any discrepancy all imports into israel must have a label indicating the country of origin the name and address of the producer the name and address of the israeli importer the contents and the weight or volume in metric units in all instances hebrew must be used english may be added provided the printed letters are no larger than those in hebrew nutritional labeling is compulsory on all packaged foods for more information on marking and labeling requirements see the information in fairs report or please contact agricultural specialist yossi barak for more details at yossibarakusdagov tel  israel has no declared government policy on genetically modified organisms gmo although regulations are being prepared which will require positive labeling when a product or an ingredient is genetically modified israel’s main export market for food is europe where consumer concern over gmo is considerable thus many israeli raw material importers require an exporter’s declaration that the product is gmo free marking should be done by printing engraving stamping or any other means on the package or the goods themselves if marking is not possible a label should be well sewn or stuck to the goods or package marking details should be clear legible and in a different color from the background in order to be clearly distinguishable printing dyes and other marking materials should not affect merchandise quality the marking should not be blurred on a multilayered package the external layer should be marked if the external layer is transparent the marking should be done underneath that layer provided it is still clear and legible on a package containing subpackages the labeling should specify the number of such subpackages the net content of a subpackage and the overall net weight of the package an aerosol container should indicate the net quantity weight unit for semisolid or powder products and volume unit for liquids for products that tend to lose weight under regular marketingcommercial conditions the maximum quantity of expected depletion should be mentioned specific labeling regulations apply to some consumer goods paper products handbags musical recordings fertilizers insecticides chemicals pharmaceuticals some food products seeds and alcoholic beverages outside and inside containers of dangerous articles such as poisons insecticides drugs flammable goods ammunition explosives reptiles insects bacteria and radioactive materials should be clearly marked exporters of auto parts to israel are concerned about a ministry of transportation requirement that they affix “made in the usa” labels to their product before entry into israeli customs territory most us auto parts manufacturers label their parts as being “assembled in the usa” required by the us federal trade commission for domestic parts that contain some portion of foreign content prohibited and restricted imports israel maintains restrictions on imports of agricultural and food products the government considers to be economically sensitive and subject to agricultural policy considerations us meat exports face an especially difficult environment due to a ban on beef meat due to veterinary restrictions and for kosher requirements waiving the ban on imports of live cattle and beef meat and products is under advanced discussions israeli law determines that the sole authority for certifying food as kosher is the council of the chief rabbinate of israel hence products considered kosher in the united states still must obtain certification from israels chief rabbinate to be considered kosher in israel with the exception of meat poultry and their products there is no legal requirement that imported food be kosher however for commercial considerations in most cases it is advisable to obtain kosher certification for products and raw materials as surveys show that between  and  percent of the jewish population prefer kosher food please contact agricultural specialist yossi barak for more details at yossibarakusdagov tel  customs regulations and contact information israeli customs stringently enforces import documentation regulations including the requirement for a us certificate of origin for exports to israel therefore us exporters should meticulously follow the advice given below and always doublecheck with the israeli customs clearing agent before the goods leave the united states to avoid potentially lengthy delays when the goods enter israel in order for us exporters to qualify for preferential access to the israeli market a hard copy green color certificate of origin must accompany all shipments from the united states to israel the fta came into full effect in  under this agreement american companies exporting to israel can gain greater market access reduce transaction costs increase sales enhance export revenues and become more competitive in the israeli marketplace us exporters are encouraged to qualify for preferential tariff treatment and to obtain when necessary a certificate of nonmanipulation for transshipments if the exporter is also the manufacturer the certificate does not need to be notarized or stamped by a chamber of commerce instead the exporter should make the following declaration in box  of the certificate the undersigned hereby declares that he is the producer of the goods covered by this certificate and that they comply with the origin requirements specified for those goods in the usisrael free trade area agreement for goods exported to israel” the actual forms are printed by a number of commercial printing houses in the united states please note that the aforementioned process is being reviewed for possible modifications and that the us commercial service should be contacted for more information at certificate of origin for exporting to israel other documentation the israeli customs services prefer that exporters use their own commercial invoice forms containing all required information including name and address of supplier general nature of the goods country of origin of the goods name and address of the customer in israel name of the agent in israel terms rate of exchange if applicable israel import license number if applicable shipping information and a full description of all goods in the shipment including shipping marks quantity or measure composition of goods by percentage if mixed tariff heading number gross weight of each package net weight of each package total weight of shipment price per unit as sold and total value of shipment the total value of the shipment includes packing shipping dock and agency fees and insurance charges incurred in the exportation of the goods to israel the commercial invoice must be signed by the manufacturer consignor owner or authorized agent us exporters should also double check with their freight forwarder shipping company or importer to find out if any other documentation including bill of lading and packing list is required it is imperative that these issues be addressed before the goods arrive at the israeli port to avoid any possible delays and storage fees in addition us goods that are transshipped through third countries require a certificate of nonmanipulation from the customs authority of the third country in order to qualify for the fta preferential tariff authorization procedures for approved exporter status potential candidates for “approved exporter” status are us firms with total annual exports to israel of at least  million that have a clean record with the israel customs services israel customs will examine whether the manufacturer or exporter complies with the criteria and grant approval for approved exporter status the approved exporter will be given an identity number to be stamped on all invoices the approval is valid for six months after which the exporter should receive an automatic extension from israel customs if the exporter does not receive an extension notice heshe must

compromise therefore was to choose constructive ambiguity as surprising as it may seem there is no law that declares judaism the official religion of israel however there is no other law that declares israels neutrality toward all confessions judaism is not recognized as the official religion of the state and even though the jewish muslim and christian clergy receive their salaries from the state this fact does not make israel a neutral state this apparent pluralism cannot dissimulate the fact that israel displays a clear and undoubtedly hierarchical pluralism in religious matters  it is important to note that from a multicultural point of view this selfrestrained secularism allows muslim law to be practiced in israel for personal matters of the muslim community as surprising as it seems if not paradoxical for a state in war israel is the only western democratic country in which sharia enjoys such an official status   sharot stephen  judaism in israel public religion

public life tensions frequently arise among different streams of judaism ultraorthodox nationalreligious mesorati conservative reconstructionist progressive reform and varying combinations of traditionalism and nonobservance despite this variety in religious observances in society orthodox judaism prevails institutionally over the other streams this boundary is an historical consequence of the unique evolution of the relationship between israel nationalism and state building  since the founding period in order to defuse religious tensions the state of israel has adopted what is known as the status quo an unwritten agreement stipulating that no further changes would be made in the status of religion and that conflict between the observant and nonobservant sectors would be handled circumstantially the status quo has since pertained to the legal status of both religious and secular jews in israel this situation was designed to appease the religious sector and has been upheld indefinitely through the disproportionate power of religious political parties in all subsequent coalition governments  on one hand the declaration of independence adopted in  explicitly guarantees freedom of religion on the other it simultaneously prevents the separation of religion and state in israel   englard izhak winter  law and religion in israel the american journal of comparative law

compromise therefore was to choose constructive ambiguity as surprising as it may seem there is no law that declares judaism the official religion of israel however there is no other law that declares israels neutrality toward all confessions judaism is not recognized as the official religion of the state and even though the jewish muslim and christian clergy receive their salaries from the state this fact does not make israel a neutral state this apparent pluralism cannot dissimulate the fact that israel displays a clear and undoubtedly hierarchical pluralism in religious matters  it is important to note that from a multicultural point of view this selfrestrained secularism allows muslim law to be practiced in israel for personal matters of the muslim community as surprising as it seems if not paradoxical for a state in war israel is the only western democratic country in which sharia enjoys such an official status   sharot stephen  judaism in israel public religion

public life tensions frequently arise among different streams of judaism ultraorthodox nationalreligious mesorati conservative reconstructionist progressive reform and varying combinations of traditionalism and nonobservance despite this variety in religious observances in society orthodox judaism prevails institutionally over the other streams this boundary is an historical consequence of the unique evolution of the relationship between israel nationalism and state building  since the founding period in order to defuse religious tensions the state of israel has adopted what is known as the status quo an unwritten agreement stipulating that no further changes would be made in the status of religion and that conflict between the observant and nonobservant sectors would be handled circumstantially the status quo has since pertained to the legal status of both religious and secular jews in israel this situation was designed to appease the religious sector and has been upheld indefinitely through the disproportionate power of religious political parties in all subsequent coalition governments  on one hand the declaration of independence adopted in  explicitly guarantees freedom of religion on the other it simultaneously prevents the separation of religion and state in israel   englard izhak winter  law and religion in israel the american journal of comparative law

modern archaeology has largely discarded the historicity of the narrative in the torah concerning the patriarchs the exodus and the conquest described in the book of joshua and instead views the narrative as constituting the israelites inspiring national myth ancestors of the israelites may have included ancient semiticspeaking peoples native to canaan– the archaeological evidence indicates a

by force but instead branched out of the canaanite peoples and culture through the development of a distinct monolatristic—and later monotheistic—religion centered on yahweh the growth of yahwehcentric belief along with a number of cultic practices gradually gave rise to a distinct israelite ethnic group setting them apart from other canaanites map of israel and judah in the th century

compromise therefore was to choose constructive ambiguity as surprising as it may seem there is no law that declares judaism the official religion of israel however there is no other law that declares israels neutrality toward all confessions judaism is not recognized as the official religion of the state and even though the jewish muslim and christian clergy receive their salaries from the state this fact does not make israel a neutral state this apparent pluralism cannot dissimulate the fact that israel displays a clear and undoubtedly hierarchical pluralism in religious matters  it is important to note that from a multicultural point of view this selfrestrained secularism allows muslim law to be practiced in israel for personal matters of the muslim community as surprising as it

public life tensions frequently arise among different streams of judaism ultraorthodox nationalreligious mesorati conservative reconstructionist progressive reform and varying combinations of traditionalism and nonobservance despite this variety in religious observances in society orthodox judaism prevails institutionally over the other streams this boundary is an historical consequence of the unique evolution of the relationship between israel nationalism and state building  since the founding period in order to defuse religious tensions the state of israel has adopted what is known as the status quo an unwritten agreement stipulating that no further changes would be made in the status of religion and that conflict between the observant and nonobservant sectors would be handled circumstantially the status quo has since pertained to the legal status of both religious and secular jews in israel this situation was designed to appease the religious sector and has been upheld
