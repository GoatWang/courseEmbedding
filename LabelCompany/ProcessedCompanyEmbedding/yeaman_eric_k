hawaii business ceo of the year eric yeaman beverly creamer january  in the  am darkness each workday eric yeaman slips out of his house and into the garage closing the door he flips on a largescreen tv for the latest news  and sports and runs three to six miles on his treadmill as a stressreducing prep for another hour day at hawaiian telcom “i set things up in my garage because i don’t want to wake up my family or the neighbors” says the yearold ceo after his minute workout yeaman showers and then leaves home while his wife son and daughter are still sleeping after stopping at a starbucks for a caloriefree iced decaf americano he’s in his thfloor bishop street office by  am munching on oatmeal while planning another day of sea change at the iconic hawaii company founded  years ago with a charter from king david kalakaua yeaman’s stamina and discipline have served him well over the past three years as he carried hawaiian telcom from bankruptcy and malaise back to profitability reliability and employee engagement the company went from losing  million in  to earning a profit three years later when he took over the company’s top line revenue was eroding by  million a quarter says yeaman “we needed to stabilize that” that has occurred and now revenues have been holding steady at  million a quarter for the last eight quarters there are other encouraging numbers since it emerged from bankruptcy on oct   the company has generated  million in profit and now has a net worth of  million it even placed in the  and  hawaii business list of the state’s best places to work a ranking based primarily on anonymous employee surveys his patience in dealing with a restive union – the international brotherhood of electrical workers local  authorized a strike then walked out for a day and a half during apec week – reinforced his reputation as a leader able to handle challenges inside and outside the company his success in one of hawaii’s biggest and most difficult corporate situations is why hawaii business chose him as ceo of the year for  those who’ve known yeaman since his college days recognize the past few years as just the latest manifestation of his inner strength “it’s a fine line he has to walk and it’s going to be a pretty tough situation to get through but if anyone’s going to get through it he can” says daren katayama who heads his own accounting firm in kailuakona and has known yeaman since they were both accounting students at the university of hawaii at manoa college of business yeaman’s life has been shaped by personal tragedy his parents divorced when he was  and then his father stepmother and young sister died in an automobile accident when he was  that moment is seared in his memory he was called off an airplane as he was leaving for a colorado vacation with college friends the plane pulled back to the gate and yeaman was handed a piece of paper with a big island phone number and told to call “i was my father’s oldest child and here i was in the middle of honolulu airport with this news what helped me through was remembering what my father wanted for me the reason i felt i could go on was asking myself ‘what would my dad want me to do’ he wouldn’t want me to give up that’s what gave me the motivation to keep going” his ability to move forward despite adversity was one reason the arthur andersen cpa firm singled him out in  to be project leader in the probate court’s management audit of bishop estate now called kamahemeha schools for nine months yeaman worked hour days seven days a week unraveling the books for court master colbert matsumoto amid the trust’s financial and moral crisis “initially i was wary of whether he was up to the task” says matsumoto recalling that yeaman was barely  then “i quickly learned my apprehension was unfounded it didn’t take long for him to win my confidence and become a critical partner in developing my investigative strategy eric was smart hardworking and tenacious i placed him in some tough situations for a young professional but he took on the challenges with courage and aplomb he quickly identified the key issues and helped me marshal the right resources always prepared i could count on him being one step ahead of whatever issue we faced” even at that young age matsumoto says “it was quite apparent he was bound to become a successful leader” yeaman was recruited by kamehameha schools as its coo and cfo moved to hawaiian electric industries as financial vp treasurer and cfo and then was asked to lead hawaiian telcom by its former chairman walter dods “i knew it was a long shot to get eric” dods admits “when he came in the company was going through bankruptcy going to be torn apart and the workers didn’t know if they’d have jobs he saved the company and almost all the jobs that’s the way it really ought to be looked at” dods says yeaman first appeared on his radar during the kamehameha schools restructuring “i had heard on the street that he did a very good job on the accounting side … that he was extremely principled and competent” a little later dods spoke to a group of young future leaders that included yeaman and afterward they talked “the more we talked the more i identified with him” says dods “it was my first insight into how he handled people and what his personality and demeanor were like and i was quite impressed” by the time dods went looking for someone to save hawaiian telcom yeaman was at hei “he had all the qualities i felt were needed” says dods “he understood strategic planning was a utility executive believed in community service … one of the things i look for too was he started at the bottom picking coffee in the kona mountains” when dods asked yeaman felt a sense of mission to rebuild the homegrown utility and reposition it for a more global future but when he took over in june  the company was falling apart “the financial situation was dire” he remembers the company was  billion in debt overleveraged and requiring total restructuring “you have to assess the brutal facts and be honest about the situation and then you can find the path … we needed to restructure the balance sheet stabilize the business and reposition it for growth and that would be shaped by looking for a combination of leaders who would work well in our local culture along with industry expertise from the mainland” yeaman wasted no time his new leadership team developed what he calls a “believable strategic backtobasics” plan with a focus on what success would look like then a broadbased employee committee created a set of company values everyone could relate to their jobs “i’ve had people tell me ‘now i know how my job related to the objectives of the company’ ” he says he ordered an employee engagement survey in his first week and discovered that just  percent of employees were happy in their jobs in the latest similar survey at the end of   percent said they were happy “the culture is the hardest thing to change but it’s the ballgame” yeaman says “i read ‘who says elephants can’t dance’ by louis gerstner the guy who turned around ibm and at ibm he said the culture was the single most important thing “we needed to give employees hope that we had a plan and that this company was being led by someone who grew up here cares about this company and came here to run it … i believe we’ve made a lot of progress but there’s still a lot to do” overall hawaiian telcom had  employees when yeaman came aboard and has about  now the job losses came from attrition retirements outsourcing store closures and a realignment of job positions due to changes in communications technology for example to fasttrack growth in areas where it competes with oceanic time warner the company realigned and redefined some jobs yeaman says the realignment affected about  positions primarily in areas of the business that have eroded or changed but it opened  new or vacant positions geared to growth areas of the union employees initially identified for change about  percent stayed in their same positions because others in the same job classification took new positions around  percent moved into newly created or different positions and about  percent took buyouts while job losses of any kind are hard says yeaman his focus must be ht’s longterm success “there’s no question i’ve faced major challenges and the labor issue is a difficult challenge … my job is always to decide what is in the best interests of the company i have to look at all the stakeholders and come up with what’s best but we’ll stay the course” ibew local ’s business manager scot long declined to be interviewed for this story because of the sensitive nature of the union’s contract dispute but former local  leader george waialeale wasn’t so reticent he says yeaman’s compensation has created a stumbling block for some “when eric gets a percent raise and everyone else gets squat people are not too happy” says waialeale who retired from the company six years ago yet stays in touch “but when it’s better to have a job than no job then everyone stays quiet that’s what i hear sure they want their jobs but if you push the pendulum too far one way it will swing back to the other and sooner or later the guys are going to get pissed” what few know is how much compensation yeaman relinquished during the two years of bankruptcy proceedings along with cuts in his compensation package mandated by the company’s lenders “all employees including me are part of a performance compensation program designed to make sure we are all focused on the things that are going to create value for the company” says yeaman “it’s very much an incentivebased program so if i wasn’t successful in working with the team there would have been nothing but if we were successful there would be a payout in the first year of a payout –  – i waived my  bonus i felt if i did that the court would be more apt to approve the payout for all the other employees and it did the total payout for all other employees was roughly  million divided according to level and performance” yeaman waived a second  million payment that would have come with the company’s change of control his compensation – a package worth  million – must be earned over several years he says even though it’s sometimes reported as a single year’s total compensation while some sources say the recent labor difficulties reflect growing employee confidence in the company’s viability yeaman says hawaiian telcom still has far to go to solidify its future he says it won’t get there without a dedicated team united around strong central values one of his first actions was to rekindle a local cultural sensibility something employees complained was missing in the years that the carlyle group was in charge “fierce resolve” say signs now emblazoned on walls everywhere at hawaiian telcom  “aloha spirit … superior service … trustworthiness” “we call them our fast values” says yeaman “i told employees we need to find our north star – what’s going to guide us – and that is a set of values and that became something our employees could rally around” yeaman’s
