snyderslance inc thanks kevin and good morning everyone we appreciate you joining our first quarter earnings conference call my comments this morning will be focused on providing more texture to the priorities i outlined on our last conference call ill then be followed by alex pease who will review our q performance and outlook as we discussed during last months conference call our first quarter financial results were very disappointing and significantly behind our expectations category softness lower net price realization unfavorable favorable mix cost headwinds and certain execution lapses converged stalling our earnings momentum and pressuring our full year outlook as we examine the issues and challenges behind our disappointing results substantial underlying cost and complexity drags were exposed which were not sufficiently addressed in the past as a result we determined the need to launch a comprehensive and aggressive performance improvement plan while we continue to diagnose the issues and gather more facts we have coalesced around a set of priorities and actions designed to deliver a step change in our level of profitability and margin expansion going forward by later this summer we should be in a position to share more specifics regarding our cost reduction and margin targets for the next one to three years suffice to say the work has begun and progress is being made we are approaching this with an extreme sense of urgency and focus and are looking to capture value quickly with that as context id like to spend some time expanding on the five priorities we shared during our last conference call first we plan to significantly improve our net price realization since early  our average retail price per pound has declined by approximately  over that same timeframe our peer group has been moving in the opposite direction with an average retail price per pound increasing approximately  we intent to significantly improve this position through more strategic promotion merchandising and trade spend planning greater focus on optimizing price size architecture strategic pricing actions where we have clear competitive advantages and a more proactive approach to vol mix management weve already identified the most compelling opportunities and have begun making refinements which will begin taking effect in the back half of this year and accelerate into fiscal  and beyond second we must sustainably reduce our manufacturing and supply chain complexity – im sorry substantially reduce our manufacturing and supply chain complexity resulting in a more cost efficient footprint and a more seamless distribution model for perspective capacity utilization levels across our footprint range from the lows to the highs with  of our  manufacturing facilities falling below bestinclass utilization of  to  streamlining our manufacturing and supply chain footprint to better align resources should enable us to unlock significant costsofgoods savings in addition we will develop nextlevel procurement excellence to extend beyond the diamond foods acquisition synergies to more value engineering specification standardization and sku simplification we will evaluate the entire logistics network and push aggressively to optimize the efficiency of our dsd operation to better compete with our peer group third we are launching a broad based sku rationalization effort intended to reduce enterprisewide complexity while providing focus to the core drivers of performance roughly  of our approximately  skus are contributing only  of our total branded gross sales on average those products are delivering annual sales of around  each each versus the remaining  which drive annual sales of about  million each this proliferation of lower volume skus is having an adverse impact on our manufacturing and supply chain productivity and presents a meaningful opportunity for improvements in efficiency with minimal topline sales impact in fact we believe that a substantial reduction in unproductive skus will have a liberating effect on our dsd network resulting in improved productivity and selling effectiveness relatedly this optimization will also focus on orienting our rd efforts around bigger ideas resizing our comanufacturing portfolio and evaluating our branded portfolio for noncore divestiture candidates next we plan to accelerate the deployment of a rigorous zerobased budgeting initiative while building and then preserving the culture of cost discipline that we have lacked when benchmarking our sga spend adjusted for advertising rd and shipping and handling costs its apparent that our level of inefficiency provides a significant cost reduction opportunity our zbb approach will target over  million of nonhead count indirect costs with a target of unlocking significant value against that baseline we are also evaluating our organizational structure and our appropriate staffing levels moving forward finally we are planning to accelerate topline momentum on core brands through greater focus and investment on base business fundamentals and marginaccretive innovation we have historically been overreliant on promotional spend to drive sales and as a result our volumes sold at a discount has accounted for nearly  of our sales growth since  in contrast we spend  of sales on advertising where bestinclass cpg has spending closer to  over time we plan to shift unproductive promotional spending to consumerfacing equitybuilding activity before i turn it over to alex id like to make a few final remarks snyderslance remains a growth story in our view but growth will not come at any cost we will continue to target organic topline sales growth that outperforms our respective subcategories but well plan to do so with less emphasis on discounting and more on equitybuilding activities on our core brands we will take a thoughtful and gradual approach to this as we work to minimize inherent transition pressures on volume and market share with that said we are estimating margin expansion to begin gaining momentum later in fiscal  with accelerating progress plan in fiscal  and beyond as our efforts take hold linked with our goals to deliver consistent operating margin expansion reaching low to mid teens over the next few years we anticipate a more moderate organic topline growth trajectory through fiscal  lastly as we balance growth with margin expansion we will be more disciplined in our capital spend we will focus capital expenditures on higher returnoncapital opportunities that support core product profitability and growth which will result in better returns for our shareholders and now id like to turn the call over to alex for more detail on the quarter and to review our financial outlook for  alex alexander w pease  snyderslance inc thanks brian and good morning everyone id like to expand on brians first quarter financial results commentary and then take a few moments to discuss our fullyear  outlook total first quarter revenue increased  to  million driven by the additional two months of diamond revenue and snyderslance legacy growth on a pro forma basis as if wed owned diamond for the full quarter the revenue growth in the quarter would have been closer to  to   total branded revenue increased  to  million while partner brand net revenue decreased  and contract manufacturing revenue declined  partner brand revenues declined as a result of weaker sales of thirdparty brands which we need to manage more proactively the decline in contract manufacturing revenue was the result of lower volumes in our charlotte bakery due to the loss of a key customer organic growth for legacy snyderslance business was  legacybranded net revenue increased  with alliedbranded growth about flat and core brands increasing  on approximately  of volume growth the branded growth partially offset the declines in partner brands and contract manufacturing the core branded net revenue growth was led by snack factory cape cod snyders of hanover and late july partially offset by a slight decline in lance turning to operating income the first quarter operating income excluding special items decreased  to  million or  of total revenue the decline in operating margin was due to weakerthanexpected gross margin performance and sga expense deleveraging gross margin was negatively impacted by lower net price realization adverse mix of branded sales higher input cost and lower overhead absorption partially offset by synergy realization by the diamond foods acquisition sga expenses as a percent of sales increased as a result of higher planned marketing and advertising expenses to support growth of the companys core brands higher service and distribution costs and incremental amortization expense resulting from the diamond foods acquisition these expenses were partially offset by synergy realization from the diamond foods acquisition adjusted ebitda declined  to  million or  of revenue the decline in adjusted ebitda margins reflect the margin drivers we just discussed net income excluding special items decreased  to  million or  a share turning to cash flow we generated  million of free cash flow in the trailing  months period that ended april   this included  million of cash from operations and nets out  million in capital expenditures largely related to growth investment in addition we reduced our leverage to  times at the end of the quarter given the first quarter performance we revised expectation for the year and now anticipate reducing leverage to approximately  times by the end of  in order to provide greater financial flexibility we amended our credit agreement effective today to extend the covenant period for the maximum total debt to ebitda ratio of  times through the first quarter of  the total debt to ebitda ratio will then step down a quarter of a turn through the next three quarters eventually to the  times where it will continue for all quarters thereafter now lets move to our fullyear outlook based on our first quarter results expectations for the remainder of the year and our performance improvement initiatives in flight we are reaffirming our recently revised fullyear  guidance for  we continue to expect to generate revenue in the range of  billion to  billion and expect adjusted earnings per share of  to  we forecast adjusted ebitda to be in the range of  million to  million as you consider the profitability drivers and the cadence of our results id like to offer a few additional assumptions to help you with your modeling for the full year we expect modest operating margin expansion resulting from gross margin expansion and for sga expenses as a percentage of net revenue to be relatively flat we expect second and third quarter earnings per share consistent with last year and earnings growth to meaningfully accelerate in the fourth quarter the acceleration is the result of expected promotional trade spend efficiency improvement incremental synergies from the diamond foods acquisition that we intend to unlock the pull forward of zerobased budgeting costsaving initiatives from early in  and the ramping of our performance style costsavings initiatives finally some additional assumptions for the full year include capex in the range of  million to  million net interest expense in the range of  million to  million an effective tax rate in the range of  to  and the weighted average diluted share count of approximately  million shares again to reiterate on brians comments were at an exciting and critical inflection point for the company as we pivot towards unlocking our margin potential while delivering on our longerterm growth aspirations now operator wed like to open the line up for questions operator operator questionandanswer session operator and our first question comes from the line of brett hundley of the vertical group your line is now open brett hundley  vertical group hey thanks good morning guys alexander w pease  snyderslance inc hey brett hey just before you ask your question i understand the line cut out when did it cut out do i need to reread some of the prepared remarks before we get into qa brett hundley  vertical group no i heard you the whole way through personally alexander w pease  snyderslance inc okay thanks okay well your question brett hundley  vertical group sure so my first question to both of you alex you went through kind of how you get to your guidance on the last call and ive been thinking about specifically the seasonality piece that you talked about and i think you put that at around  to  kind of building up from q so i wanted to look into kind of how you measured that over time you can clearly see it over time and i was trying to think about what would put that seasonality piece at risk because i think thats an important part of your getting to fullyear expectations and one of the things that i was thinking about was how a number of competitors of yours that have already reported as you go through their call transcript a lot of them are not only talking about innovation but theyre about that increased brand support spend as a firm reason why they believe that they can deliver on their own fullyear expectations following the soft q that youve all talked about and brian you had mentioned in the last call in april and you expounded on it today about the changes that you want to make to your own ap spend over time and you mentioned that some of that will be in place in the back half of the year here and accelerating to early next year so my question is do you guys believe that as you take some of these actions to correct the business that you will have the proper type of brand support spend in place in the back half of the year not only to compete against competitor actions but also to deliver on that seasonality aspect brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc so let me – before alex gets into the seasonality effects let me clarify a point we think that we will begin to see the benefits of our net price realization and some of our cost reduction activities as we get into the back half of the year but most prominently as we get into  and beyond i dont think well see a significant shift in the spending profile so in other words our campaign executions deciding the role of particular brands within our portfolio et cetera will take more time so i dont think well see the kind of increased investments in consumerfacing activity in the back half of  but we will begin to see it much more prominently in  so the back half really will be the benefit derived from improvements in net price realization and we are beginning to identify activities that we were planning to engage in from a trade promotion perspective that were going to begin to minimize so thats really the bigger impact of the back half alexander w pease  snyderslance inc so brett let me get into your seasonality question so youre right the number that you quoted in our guidance were contemplating between  and  of natural seasonality really as you think about it thats largely – and we see this historically when we look over the last number of years that q tends to be soft people coming off new years resolutions those sorts of things combined with obviously as you get into the summer months theres more events and occasions for snacking particular in the salty snacks area and so thats just a trend that we typically see if you combine that with the deleverage effect thats where you get the real softness in earnings in the first quarter so you see much better much improved leverage off the fixed asset base as the volumes increase there is another couple of things that are probably anomalous with our first quarter that you need to understand at least the first quarter that were talking about here so one is in anticipation of the growth rates that wed articulated towards the end of last year the  to  growth range that youll remember we did pull forward a bunch of our planned advertising and promotional spending so you did see us running hotter on both advertising as well as trade spending as part of the plan obviously the volumes didnt materialize the way wed hoped but youll see that naturally start to abate towards the last half of the year just in conjunction with the plan that weve put in place the other thing that you saw in the first quarter which is anomalous was the prebuild for some of our innovations particularly around the variety pack so we had effectively no sale in variety pack for the first two months of the year theyre starting to ramp now but youll see that begin to reach a better level of scale which will have a favorable impact on both service and distribution expense as well as obviously the leverage in the plant and then youre continuing to see the ramp of our other innovations throughout the course of the year so those are sort of natural tailwinds on the seasonality and then the third impact – and sorry im going on a little long here but its important for you to understand the third impact theres some onetime costs we were operating under the tsa related to the diamond of california divestment so we were incurring incremental costs associated with the tsa we were also in process of moving the emerald production line from stockton california to the charlotte location and we were incurring both inventory prebuild expenses as well as just the expenses associated with that redeployment of capital we expect that to be behind us in june and fully ramping emerald production in june so those are sort of all the tailwinds on the seasonality that we can point to brett hundley  vertical group thats really helpful i appreciate it and then just my other question i want to make sure im kind of working through the math right but on the numbers that you give us topline growth it implies some pretty big declines for the diamond business and im trying to make everything applestoapples excluding culinary and looking at things on a likeforlike basis as it relates to a threemonth period and im wondering if you can kind of qualitatively if you want call out the different pieces of that softness for the diamond business so that we can get a better understanding of trends there youve talked of pop secret but i wanted to ask you whether there was a pretty big deflationary component in the top line for diamond and anything else that you would want to call out there im basically trying to look at – im trying to isolate pop secret and understand the softness there but i also wanted to be aware of any deflationary component alexander w pease  snyderslance inc yeah let me take sort of the quarter specifics and obviously heres where we have the benefit of brians history with the business and he can talk little longer historical trends so pop secret is by far the biggest driver of the softness in the acquired brands so that was down on a net basis in the order of around  obviously thats pro forma since we didnt own the brand for the first two months of last year but on a pro forma basis that would be down in the order of  net sales so thats a significant decline on a very profitable brand which also points to some of the mix effects that weve talked about if you unpack that negative  there is really two things one is more temporary in nature and the other – well three things one is – two of those are more temporary in nature and one is more structural in nature so the two things that are temporary in nature we had a – one of our large mass customers made some changes in their store layout that caused basically distribution loses for the business we are behind that now so we have a plan in place for that to all be in the rearview mirror the other thing thats temporary in nature is we had some supply chain disruptions that basically caused us to cut customers which were fairly significant in nature again that is behind us and so we dont anticipate that headwind going forward there is a structural issue which is just the overall softness in the category i believe – my numbers may be wrong but i believe the category is declining around  overall so we need some support in the category to really get to more sustainable growth rate the good news is in the most recent trends we appear to be holding share relatively constant so we feel good about the performance of the brand in the category overall weve also rolled out some innovations which youll see on the shelves around new flavorings new packaging and so forth and are optimistic that that will basically get the brand back on the right track the other big driver of the decline in the acquired brands is the kettle chips business in the uk so obviously private brands in the uk have been gaining strength so were seeing some headwinds there as well as the impact of brexit sort of encouraging people to move toward more value consciousness rather than the premium product line we are optimistic that we can get ahead of those trends but thats where weve been seeing some headwinds in terms of both the kettle us business and the emerald business we feel pretty good about those growth is moderate for those we feel pretty good about the health of those two brands so thats at least as the quarter looks – and i dont mean to interrupt you brett but maybe brian can give some of the longer and more historical context brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc go ahead brett you were going to piggyback on that brett hundley  vertical group yeah i want to yield the floor to others here but i just – i basically want to – with that as context you dont expect any impairment over the near term of the diamond assets alexander w pease  snyderslance inc obviously brett we are always evaluating the impairment risk we dont see a triggering event in this quarter and well continue to monitor that but we wont have a formal impairment review until yearend as is the normal process brett hundley  vertical group that answers my questions thanks so much guys brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc thanks brett operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of jonathan feeney of consumer edge research your line is now open jonathan feeney  consumer edge research llc thanks very much a couple of questions welcome brian first is wanted – officially anyway first i wanted just a detail and secondly a bigger picture question for brian a detailed could you comment about the marginal profitability alex of this comanufacturing business obviously we saw that loss i wouldnt think its that profitable how big of a driver of the profit shortfall this quarter versus your plans was that and what risk is there going forward and then i have a question after that alexander w pease  snyderslance inc yeah so the coman business is actually – the piece of the coman business that we lost is actually quite profitable so its in the bakery in charlotte its around  to  contribution margin so that was a pretty significant driver of the miss in terms of going forward we see that softness abating but not going away completely so really what was behind that was as i mentioned the loss of one key customer who moved from a solesourced arrangement to more of a dual or trisource arrangement and has been diversifying their source of supply over time were obviously working hard to get in front of that and address that and also to the extent there is fixed costs that we can take out of the system were moving to sort of rightsize the manufacturing footprint as brian mentioned jonathan feeney  consumer edge research llc thank you and brian you mentioned a rationalization and gave us some really helpful stats about discounting activity over the past two or three years it strikes me that maybe one of the drivers of some of this behavior by snyderslance has been the distribution network itself is that youre chasing that marginal profitability i mean some version of this seems to have been going on at least for the  years ive covered the company as bringing a perspective you know a thing or a two about distribution particularly different modes of costs and maybe decisions that are too distributioncentric i guess two questions really how do you manage a reduction in the total product available to a distribution network while still keeping their economics viable the distributors the ibos themselves and secondly when you look at whatever  or  gross cost of your – of just the dsd side of your business as an offset to revenue plus the total cost it would seem like on anyway you look at this per route per dollar of sales this is a relatively expensive route to market for these kinds of longer shelflife products if you could put that in maybe some of your historical context with products of different shelf lives and why is that that the opportunity – what gives you confidence that there is an opportunity to expand margin so much in this business thank you brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc yeah its a great question and i appreciate it and it frankly is the reason i put the comment in about this effort having a liberating effect on dsp productivity and sales effectiveness yeah first and foremost as you think about the long tail on skus i know the audience here hears quite a bit about sku rationalization et cetera i think an element of it thats not often spoken about is the amounts of promotional spending or trade spending that goes against that long tail just to keep them on the shelf i mean as you think about the average of that  of skus i referred to that doing average of  a year it is safe to say that there is a fair amount of trade spending that goes against those skus just to enable them to hit the minimum thresholds allowable to stay on the shelf so were spending money on unproductive skus that could be deployed in other ways whether thats towards better promotional more strategic a better lift promotions with retailers or on equityfacing activity so first and foremost there is an enormous amount of spending or a healthy amount of spending that goes against the tail that we believe can be redeployed in so doing thats less unproductive units that our direct store universe is merchandising in store which allows them to spend more time on our core what tends to happen in the dsd network and i think you know i have a fair amount of experience there is to the extent that you minimize the emphasis on the tail the dsd network will magnify the amount of focus on the core and they will flex up the core so youll have them spending more time on the products that drive better profitability that have better productivity in store and will actually enable them to get in and out of stores quickly enhancing their coverage so i think that the liberating effect this can have is no small matter i think it can have a substantial effect on our ability to make this transition in a very smooth manner so thats the first element of it as far as the dsd network goes in and of itself i really believe that in our categories it can be a strategic weapon in fact i think that we have an opportunity to invest in ways that allow us to optimize that potential in terms of technology at store level in terms of having more seamless communications with our routes et cetera and i think that effect could make it even more of a weapon for us than it is today jonathan feeney  consumer edge research llc understood thank you very much brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of amit sharma of bmo your line is now open amit sharma  bmo capital markets united states hi good morning everyone alexander w pease  snyderslance inc hey amit brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc good morning amit sharma  bmo capital markets united states alex a couple of questions for you and then one for brian after that just so that i – make sure i heard it there was a little bit of a disturbance in the line so you were calling for second and third quarter eps to be relatively flat versus year ago and then a ramp up in the fourth quarter did i hear that correctly alexander w pease  snyderslance inc thats right amit sharma  bmo capital markets united states okay got it and then that just driven by the seasonality discussion that we had earlier alexander w pease  snyderslance inc combination obviously seasonality is somewhat of an impact but then we anticipate some of the cost improvement initiatives that we have put in place in q to begin realizing sort of full run rate by q amit sharma  bmo capital markets united states and this is what you had adjusted eps that was the last year it doesnt take out the diamond of california divestiture right alexander w pease  snyderslance inc no were talking on a – maybe i misunderstand the question im talking on a continuing operations basis so it would not include diamond of california in those numbers that we quoted is that your question amit sharma  bmo capital markets united states yeah no im saying youre not taking it out of the last years number right youre just comparing the number that alexander w pease  snyderslance inc no it is out of the last years number these are continuing operations only amit sharma  bmo capital markets united states got it okay and then on interest expense you lowered it by  million today this morning what happened why were you able to lower it and why didnt it flow down to the eps line alexander w pease  snyderslance inc so the interest expense basically we amended the debt which i mentioned in the results we were able to address that through just an amendment fee rather than an increase in rate the original guidance had an increase in rate embedded in that assumption so we obviously relaxed that in our revised guidance the reason it didnt flow through to eps is is really just because the range of eps right now is sufficiently wide that we chose to keep the range where it stands absent better information amit sharma  bmo capital markets united states got it and then brian really helpful to lay out those five priorities and i think it helps – obviously helps you but it helps us also to sort of look at the opportunity and perhaps be able to monitor it as you deliver on those can you just outline – so you talked about today  million cost bucket on the operating line i think you mentioned  million of trade spending is that sort of the big bucket of opportunity combined almost  billion of costs that you think that over the next  months  months thats the opportunity or thats the size of the opportunity available to you to act against brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc i think its certainly perhaps the most significant opportunity but i do believe that all of these initiatives that were working on are inextricably linked go ahead im sorry alexander w pease  snyderslance inc also just – i mean the numbers you quoted amit so  million trade thats directionally right  million just to be clear that brian referred to thats indirect costs so thats both indirect in the operating expense line as well as indirects in cogs there is additionally opportunity brian referred to in just looking at the overall staffing levels of the organization and then brian also referred to the optimization of the manufacturing footprint and procurement which would not be in that baseline that were talking about here brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc but all of these things are inextricably linked we believe we think that well be able to get the full effect of our efforts by doing – the accumulative effect of all of these together will be significant amit sharma  bmo capital markets united states last one from me when you talk about realigning trade spending and maybe focusing a little bit more on brand investment in terms of if you look at your total sales bucket can you quantify for us like whats the dollar number of sales that are potentially at risk as you realign your manufacturing or pull back on trade brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc i appreciate the question as i mentioned earlier were going to take a thoughtful and gradual approach to this i have some indication of what the impact could be but im not prepared to be specific at this stage were still evaluating everything and examining all the numbers just to make sure that before we reveal anything were accurate amit sharma  bmo capital markets united states but thats included in your  outlook brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc yeah amit sharma  bmo capital markets united states the reason im asking is i believe there is no risk that that number could be lowered down as you provide more detail on to that number brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc its already contemplated in our outlook amit sharma  bmo capital markets united states got it thank you so much brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc you got it operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of steven strycula of ubs your line is now open steven strycula  ubs securities llc hi good morning brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc good morning steven strycula  ubs securities llc quick question for alex on the top line just wanted to get a sense as you have a few moving pieces between partner and allied brands in contract for the balance of the year how should we think about the likeforlike sales in the branded segments for the remaining nine months of the year should we be thinking about that as a like a  to  growth rate for that portion of the business looking forward again q through q combined alexander w pease  snyderslance inc yes i think our aggregate number for growth is around  on the top line that includes obviously the partner and the contract brand we expect the softness in partner and contract to continue although it will abate somewhat and then i think when you think about the core branded growth yeah were in the  to  range for the balance of the year steven strycula  ubs securities llc okay and then brian how do you think about the need for advertising spend to drive household penetration within the brands that youre most familiar with with diamond and then this legacy snyderslance portfolio where do you think the greatest opportunity is going forward over the next  months where you can put real ad dollars customerfacing into the portfolio and extract a reasonable return brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc well let me talk about that at a high level im not prepared today to provide specifics around the role of each brand within our portfolio in that regard but i do believe there is a significant opportunity to increase household penetration and i think dollars spent against that in core markets go further in many cases than trying to spend similar dollars in new markets we saw that effect on kettle where we began to spend more heavily on the west coast and spend less around the expansion we had initially deployed going east on the brand and we found very favorable results in that regard doubling down if you will in core markets to improve household penetration i think thats the first place to look what tends to happen is you feel like youve got a strong market share in a region and therefore the great temptation is to move to new geographies but when you dig deeper and you look at actual household penetration there appears to be a substantial opportunity for upside there and then of course the investment spending against that has a better roi because youre investing it in a market where your brand already has equity and your hope is that you can grow share that way so we think there are very significant portions of our portfolio that will benefit from that investment profile and we think the return on that will be better than the return were getting on spending today steven strycula  ubs securities llc great and then a quick followup for alex alex as we think about the lower bracket of  and an upper bracket for earnings of  what type of macro scenario or operationally has to happen within your portfolio to get to either one of those scenarios just to understand kind of the spectrum that were dealing with alexander w pease  snyderslance inc yeah so there was an earlier question around the seasonality the biggest delta if you just kind of project out where we are right now and take a fourquarter average thatll get you to roughly  then you add on sort of what we see as onetime expenses thats another  so that gets you to  just continuing to do what were doing now then the biggest walk from there is this  to  seasonality impact i feel as though thats relatively conservative given all of the actions that we have in flight but thats going to be basically the biggest headwind so then if you move from there to what gets you closer to the high end of the range versus the low end of the range obviously improved seasonality if you get something north of  to  that gives you a much more favorable leverage on the fixed asset so youll see gross margin improvement from there and then we have some operational improvements kind of in flight that are contributing call it in the range of between  and  so if you believe that we took action quickly when we saw what needed to be done in the first couple of months of the year then youll believe that we can hit the high end of the range if you think maybe its a little more difficult to turn the ship around then were at the low end of the range but we feel like the  to  is pretty achievable most of the stuff that brians talking about those are obviously the big unlocks to get us to something like a low to midteens margin profile and most of the value from those wont be flowing through the pl until  and into  steven strycula  ubs securities llc okay great thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of bill chappell of suntrust your line is now open william b chappell  suntrust robinson humphrey inc thanks good morning brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc hey bill william b chappell  suntrust robinson humphrey inc hey brian as we look back at the quarter it seems like the issue wasnt that you missed it the issue was that the company didnt realize they were going to miss it until pretty late in the quarter at least after cagny so i guess the thought is coming in do you have the systems in place to kind of really understand how to turn things do you need to add more investment do you have all the information really to make changes or is it still a work in progress alexander w pease  snyderslance inc hey bill ill let brian talk about what he has observed in the first couple of weeks on the job but let me give you a sense because this is obviously very important for everybody to know we did anticipate softness in january when we came to cagny we hadnt closed the books yet on the february results so we did see softness in january what we didnt have a solid point of view on was the persistence of the softness and the magnitude of the overall deleveraging trends so what we anticipated and what we frankly deliberately did was pull forward advertising spending pull forward some promotional spending and so we knew that we were going to have a slightly inflated pl in january and while we were concerned we werent overly concerned headed into cagny and it all tied with the growth story that we were articulating where the concern got elevated was when that result persisted into february and we saw a combination of continued softness in the top line and then frankly increasing deleveraging in the bottom line and that was when we had indications that this may be something more systematic in place and we started doing a much broader forensic diagnosis of what all was going on in the pl and in the process of doing that we uncovered things that were more structural in nature that had been really effectively concealed by a lot of the synergy valuecapture work that happened throughout the course of  as well as a lot of the complexity related to the disentanglement and divestment of diamond of california so thats sort of what happened and why we didnt have a better lens on things going on while we were speaking at cagny but brians gotten into things pretty deeply here over the course of last month so ill let him give a bigger picture for you brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc i mean look we need to make sure we have in place early warning systems to make sure that there are no surprises and so we have been working hard on understanding exactly what happened learning from it and doing everything we can to make sure it doesnt happen again so thats the first thing secondly the areas that were honing in on bill are areas that have always existed as opportunities they just were masked by a series of transactions that have occurred frankly not just the diamond of california – its not just the diamond foods acquisition but other transactions that took place prior to that and i think what its done is kind of like the tide goes out and you see some of the rocks and thats what weve exposed here but these things we have plenty of data we have sufficient recognition of where those rocks lie i think we have good systems capability to assure that were approaching this the right way and i have a high degree of confidence that we have visibility to what we need to have visibility to in order to execute this thing in a very strong way so hopefully that answers your question william b chappell  suntrust robinson humphrey inc yeah i think so and then the second brian just as we look out to the back half i mean how does the conversation go when you call up walmart and say hey by the way were going to raise prices now and later in the year were going to cut trade promotions so what do you think about that and how do you expect volumes to be reacted i mean in the past walmart has penalized snyderslance for not kind of going along on certain pricing but same with other retailers i mean how does the trade promotion kind of change work with the retailers but also with your different brands where some brands like pop secret probably are more reliant on trade promotions whereas kettle or cape cod might not be how do you evenly do this across the platform brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc yeah its a great question the answer is somewhat complex ill do the best i can to kind of frame it but what were talking about really is a net price realization as you know and youve heard me talk about this many times in the past and improving net price realization is not just the function of reducing trade spend in absolute its frankly deploying that trade spend against more profitable activities more profitable events and more profitable brands and reducing the amount of emphasis that exists on the tail of skus if you will so as i mentioned on an earlier question we spend a fairly healthy amount of trade if you will on that tail in many respects just to keep those brands and distribution because theyre not meeting minimum thresholds of velocity and thats just not the way we should be spending our money so if we can – and thats not good for the retailer and its not good for us i think the whole system would be better if we redeployed those dollars against higher traction activities and brands that are going to produce the best outcome i think thats better for retailers i think thats better for us and the entire economic profile of our relationship with our customers but thats only one element of it i mean theres other ways in terms of better managing our mix our innovation pipeline our price pack architecture et cetera all will be involved – all are being reassessed to assure we optimize our net price realization ill also say that were not planning to do anything abrupt its not as if were going out to retailers now and pulling programming what were doing is as were planning new activity we are incorporating this thinking into that new activity so that phone call you referred to is probably not one that ill have to make quite in that way itll be more around spending against activities that produce a better outcome william b chappell  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay and last one is there – and maybe i missed it reason why theres such a big range on the tax rate i would expect its fairly predictable this year alexander w pease  snyderslance inc the biggest driver in the tax rate is going to be the domestic manufacturing credits and which way that goes which is largely driven by how contract manufacturing performs and the overall mix so thats going to be the biggest one obviously the other big driver is the uk so depending on the mix of domestic earnings versus foreign earnings that will drive that the – an advantage that we see in the uk versus the us william b chappell  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay great thanks brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc thanks bill operator thank you and our next question come from the line of akshay jagdale of jefferies your line is now open akshay jagdale  jefferies llc good morning thanks for the question brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc good morning akshay jagdale  jefferies llc so i wanted to ask about conversion costs or basically cost of manufacturing there hasnt been a lot of discussion about that today i know that you talked a lot about pricing and so on can you talk a little bit about the conversion costs i mean thats a big bucket of your total  billion in addressable cost right its in my estimate at least  million to  million worth but just be curious to get your perspective maybe its part of your strategy down the road once you figure out what the skus look like on a ongoing basis type of thing and thats why its not a discussion point today but isnt that a big area of improvement just reducing the overall sort of cost per pound of products that youre manufacturing alexander w pease  snyderslance inc yeah so help me out just on a definitional question when you say conversion cost in my mind thats cost of goods sold but your  million number would be way off if thats what youre referring to akshay jagdale  jefferies llc yeah im just taking cost of goods sold minus raw material costs alexander w pease  snyderslance inc okay yeah you akshay jagdale  jefferies llc im assuming raw material is like  so alexander w pease  snyderslance inc yeah yeah youre probably directionally right okay so theres a couple of things going on if you use that one is weve got a very high level of temp labor spending in the facility primarily in the packing areas and thats driven a lot by some of the small bag work that we do variety packs some of that stuff so we have – actually are in the process of implementing some automation projects that will not only first and foremost eliminate the temp labor issue but then you get a twofold benefit because not only do you eliminate higher price temp labor but you also eliminate the labor in its entirety so thats a piece of whats going on the second piece of whats going on in the conversion cost use to use your word is fairly high scrap rates and so particularly in the bakeries our scrap rates are in the order to  which is problematic you anticipate higher scrap rates in cracker manufacturing just the nature of the manufacturing but  feels high so to the extent we are able to address that you obviously drive fairly significant yield improvements and then brian mentioned that we have a reasonably high number of our plants that are operating subscale and so there is active work going on to figure out what the right manufacturing footprint should be and do we really need all of these plants operating at    capacity utilizations or can we consolidate some production so thats really how you get after the conversion cost and then i probably should mention there is always the traditional taking a look at indirects and spends and layers brian mentioned just taking a look at the organizational staffing overall will be an opportunity there is no question that there is opportunity to address fixed head count expense as well akshay jagdale  jefferies llc perfect but overall pretty sizeable opportunity there as well in this area alexander w pease  snyderslance inc yeah for sure akshay jagdale  jefferies llc okay and then brian can you help sort of compare and contrast your tenure obviously at diamond you took over in some pretty tough conditions and you turned that business around and you took some brands that were pretty good brands that were managed relatively well i guess kettle pop secret didnt have that much of unwinding of bad habits to do and you did it while your hands were tied to your back i guess because you had some constraints on the balance sheet and all these issues with the diamond of california brand so can you just compare and contrast what youre dealing with here and give us a sense of how much of the issues that you see here are controllable completely in your hand as the company and management and how much are sort of market related in the sense that there is element where if you lower prices or the net price realization as you promote less on certain brands that youre going to see a lower level of sales right so thats hard to i guess predict accurately but can you just compare and contrast for us like what you did back there and here and give us some sense of magnitude in terms how difficult this is going to be thank you brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc sure thanks akshay well i think the for formula that we applied at diamond is the same formula were applying here which is to cost reduce and net price realize in order to sharply improve our margin profile and then reinvest a portion of that back into hightraction activities and i think the real challenge for a leadership team is making the right decisions on that deployment because oftentimes you see restructure efforts and costreduction efforts et cetera but then that money gets spent back in ways that dont produce a great outcomes so the critical linkage is driving that margin expansion and then freeing up the company to put fuel against the hightraction brands and activity so i think that kind of highlevel philosophy that we applied at diamond is very much what were applying here the difference is the nature of the challenge at diamond was fundamentally different what we were faced with when i went in there had – there were a lot of external pressures that were not faced with here and so that element of it is certainly not the same and i do view the lions share of the issues that were confronting here to be in our hands i think that it is really substantially up to us to make a difference here i dont see much externally that i view as barriers to what we say were going to do here i mean look ive been doing this for a long time and there is always issues around softness in categories and changes in retailer strategy et cetera and in many cases theyre cyclically you hear them the same kind of themes over the course of several years and so im not looking at any of the external factors confronting us or many of the external factors confronting us as the kind of barriers that would stand in a way of us getting this done i think its largely in our hands and i feel confident that we can pull it off akshay jagdale  jefferies llc and just one last one this is more on culture and organizational structure if i may so there has clearly been an emphasis on growth that may be tilted too far on the growth side here and a lot of food companies are having trouble shifting or finding a balance between growth and margin management and crossfunctional collaboration is sort of becomes a key element in finding that balance so can you help us understand sort of structurally way the teams are structured maybe what you think you could change that could easily switch this culture from very growth oriented to finding a balance between growth and profitability and am i generally characterizing the culture issue correctly brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc first of all its a great question and im glad you surfaced it because i think that ive had quite an enlightenment in this role over the past few weeks as ive done a number of town halls plant visits et cetera and what im finding is that the core of our organization is actually anxious for us to make this shift i think our folks actually believe – kind of the broader organization believes that our effort on growth with a discounting approach and sku proliferation has impeded our ability to optimize our growth profitably over time i think the sense im getting is that the organization feels very strongly about this and has felt strongly about this the way weve been going out weve been going about getting growth in many respects has been tied to this proliferation and to excessive discounting and i think reorienting our focus on bigger ideas on our bigger brands on our core business and on consumerfacing activities i think is widely viewed as more sustainable by our organization and i think weve already begun to rally the troops in ways that i think will have a solid benefit for us akshay jagdale  jefferies llc thank you ill pass it on brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc thanks akshay operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of rob dickerson of deutsche bank your line is now open rob dickerson  deutsche bank securities inc thank you very much so just a couple of questions ill try to keep it as short as possible its getting late so just to go back to the entire savings opportunity i know it sounds like you said its about  million trade there is a staffing opportunity some footprint optimization and then there is obviously the reinvestment piece but i mean even if you reinvest that lets call it at  right and we just take the  million number for the sake of argument i mean that does still leave you with a net  million which is frankly on a percent of sales basis thats like much more in line with a kraft heinz model than it is relative to your larger cap peer average so im just curious is this level of improvement just as simple as this is a longtime coming catchup and theres significant inefficiencies that have just kind of been let go for too long and then two am i thinking about that number at least directionally the right way and then lastly it sounds like the board is – you have sign off from the board as well thanks alexander w pease  snyderslance inc so rob just i wasnt exactly following your math and i want to clarify the numbers that were throwing around the  million in trade and the  million in indirect cost that was a baseline that was not – those werent savings targets so obviously the savings would be some percentage of the baseline and i dont think were prepared yet to say exactly what we think that percentage savings is in addition to those two items on the baseline we do have the additional issue of the head count and the facility restructuring that we mentioned so i just want to clarify your numbers and then ill let brian comment on the state of conversations with the board and our aspirations to migrate towards something more like an industry normal margin profile brian j driscoll  snyderslance inc yeah well i can assure that we wouldnt be talking about these initiatives the way were talking about these initiatives unless we had alignment from the board we are also keeping the board engaged as we begin the further – as we continue to define the approach going forward but yes we have strong board support rob dickerson  deutsche bank securities inc okay great and then regarding the comment you made around noncore brands i believe you said you would consider there some strategic divestment if it comes to that so just to clarify i guess the first question is just what do you consider core brands at this stage and then regarding the noncore brands are all of those under review and essentially anything is on the table or are these kind of part of that smaller tail that you refer to alexander w pease  snyderslance inc yeah so its worth a little bit of clarification so when we talk about the core brands what were referring to is snyders of hanover lance cape cod snack factory late july kettle kettle chips which is the uk piece of that emerald and pop secret so those – when we talk about core brands those are the core brands that were referring to we have a whole bundle of brands that fall under the basket of allied brands so you will have heard me or carl talk about that those are brands like toms jays archway okedoke all these sort of brands so when we talk about evaluating sku rationalization simplification work were talking about yes evaluating where brands fit in the whole – in the portfolio so to the extent brands arent accretive to either our margin or our growth story what is a – what role do they play in the portfolio and is there a more logical home for them there is also the next level of analysis which is even within those core brands weve seen significant sku proliferation and so what is really the role of the individual skus within that brand how does that support the net price realization how does that support the growth strategy and so forth so really were looking at the issue kind of in its entirety and to the extent there are options around divesting aspects that arent core to the business thats certainly on the table if there is – if a better option is to manage that brand for cash and just slowly wind it down over time thats also an option so i would say there is a pretty broad based strategic look at what the overall portfolio looks like today and what it should look like going forward rob dickerson  deutsche bank securities inc okay great and then just my last question is on cash flow allocation obviously if you have a larger lets call it restructuring plan at this place – sorry at this point in place and i just think though historically if i look at your dividend payout ratio it is fairly high relative to peers while at the same time you really havent been known for repurchasing shares so im just curious kind of two you are now in the seat there is a larger plan in place sounds like theres board signoff as you think going forward the next two three years call it is there a potential that youll look to potential – to bring that dividend payout maybe a little bit more in line with peer average considering stock repurchase alexander w pease  snyderslance inc yeah id be interested in taking a look at the analysis when i did the analysis the payout ratio was in line with peers it was a little bit on the low side but it certainly wasnt dramatically low youre absolutely right about the history of share buybacks i dont think the companys really ever bought back a material number of shares and i think look as there is more work for us to do to figure out what the growth algorithm is for the company and to the extent we cannot deploy the cash flow towards accretive valueadded growth then it certainly should be on the table to look at the dividend and share buybacks i think right now as brian said i think were all optimistic that this is a growth story given the categories we play in given the execution given the strategic advantage of the dsd so i think the first priority is really around growth but – well the second priority is around growth the first priority is around getting our returns to be delivering in excess of our cost of capital because obviously any dollar we deploy towards growth if were not delivering our the cost of capital is dilutive to shareholder value but first and foremost its lets focus on margins then lets redefine the growth algorithm and then to the extent there is surplus after that i think obviously returning cash to shareholders is on the table rob dickerson  deutsche bank securities inc okay super

keyword snyderslance snyderslances snyder’s of hanover brand has an opportunity to roll out nationwide distribution   paris — snyder’slance inc has its sights set on a number of pockets of growth from expanding distribution of key brands across the united states to exploring ways to break into new categories said alexander w pease chief financial officer and executive vicepresident in a june  presentation at the deutsche bank global consumer conference in paris mr pease discussed the ways the charlotte ncbased snack maker is differentiating itself in a fiercely competitive snack industry alexander pease cfo and executive vicepresident of snyder’slance mr pease said the company’s northeastfocused snyder’s of hanover brand has an opportunity to roll out nationwide distribution and intends to push the brand’s consumer base beyond the boomer segment and into the millennial segment similarly the company’s lance sandwich crackers a southeast dominated brand may go national “gaining crosscountry distribution … is clearly an opportunity” he said snyderslance also sees growth opportunities in expanding the snack factory and late july brands to the perimeter of the store   mr pease said the company also sees growth opportunities in expanding the snack factory and late july brands to the perimeter of the store one brand that is struggling to generate growth is pop secret the company’s microwave popcorn brand “its a boomerfocused category” mr pease said of microwave popcorn “we’re the no  player and so there’s some work that needs to be done around reminding consumers of the event and really evaluating what can be done to stabilize that category in and of itself” the one snyderslance brand struggling to maintain growth is pop secret   a little over a year after acquiring the kettle chips business as part of its acquisition of diamond foods snyder’slance continues to look for ways to drive future growth for the brand a heavily millennialoriented brand kettle stands for bold flavors and frequent flavor rotations mr pease said a formula that has worked for the brand now the company is trying to find the right balance to fuel growth “we’ve gone from  flavor profiles to  over the course of  or  months” mr pease said “we have no intention of going to half a dozen flavors of kettle that would be sort of death for the brand given the target — the millennial consumer that we’re targeting what we are saying is that they’ve had a very successful and profitable growth run — at  skus stockkeeping units so maybe there needs to be more than  but probably not all the way to  and so getting that formula right will be important snyder’slance continues to look for ways to drive future growth for kettle brand chips   “kettle is largely a west coastdominated brand there is clearly opportunity on nationwide distribution for that brand to really fuel the growth there’s also opportunity through the directstoredelivery channel that we brought to the acquisition party it was largely going direct to the market which limited it more to the natural channel we’ve got opportunities in club we’ve got opportunities in the natural section of the traditional grocery retailers we’ve got opportunities in small bag format and food service so there’s a lot of potential for that brand”  another area of opportunity exists in the cracker aisle where mr pease said snyder’slance is underpenetrated although the company has a strong presence in sandwich crackers it is “basically nonexistent” in the categories adjacent to sandwich crackers he said snyderslance recently introduced wholey cheese baked crackers   “we did introduce a cracker innovation aligned with the snyder’s of hanover brand called wholey cheese which is giving us a new set of facings in the cracker aisle directly aligned with a large competitor in that space but there is still more room to go in the cracker aisle” mr pease said “bars which you mentioned are an opportunity that we effectively don’t play in that’s a pretty significant growth opportunity we like meat snacks as an adjacency — obviously that’s one of the fastestgrowing categories so we see a number of opportunities both in the center of the store as well as in the perimeter” meanwhile mr pease said snyder’slance sees ma as “a big piece of the growth algorithm going forward” while the company doesn’t expect to make a broad move into dairy or frozen products he said potential acquisitions in adjacent categories are part of the growth formula for the company before that happens though snyder’slance is focusing on ensuring its platform is stable he said the company will consider all options he said including divestments lance sandwich crackers a southeast dominated brand may go national snyderslance said   “the two candidates in the portfolio that are obviously worth continuing to monitor are pop secret given the category trends that we’ve seen” he said “we feel confident in our ability to renovate that brand and we feel as though we’re the natural owner for the time being but obviously we’ll have to continue to monitor that as the situation develops “and then emerald which plays in the snack nuts category is quite small so it’s only a  share in the overall snack nuts planters is the owner of the peanut subcategory blue diamond is the owner of the almond subcategory we view a significant opportunity in cashews lining up some of our seasoning capability that we bring to the party with the kettle brand with the ability of cashews to basically be a good vehicle for seasoning so we see a good opportunity there to make emerald meaningful in this space but obviously that would be one that we have to evaluate if we can’t get to no  or no  position”
