total returns since it went public in  on the companys conference call managers pointed to a new future for main street capital one that would have it following in the footsteps of larger bdc rivals a new way to make moneymain street capital runs a number of investment funds rolling up several of its previously nonpublic funds into one company a diagram in its annual report helps explain the complexity of main street capital  and most bdcs for that matter source page  of main street capitals  annual report but theres something brewing behind the scenes at main street whereas it has previously invested its own money in middlemarket companies its working hard to build out an asset management business main street capital wouldnt be the first bdc to manage other peoples money for its own profits american capital ltd nasdaqacas owns a sizable asset manager that manages public mreits american capital agency nasdaqagnc and american capital mortgage nasdaqmtge ares capital

a subadvisor collecting  of assets plus  of returns when the fund clears a hurdle of  per year thus main street capital is rewarded handsomely for managing the fund which invests in substantially similar assets as main street capital in effect the company earns money on other peoples money which is arguably one of the best businesses in the world so whats the hms income fund some googlefu reveals its a nontraded bdc sold by financial advisors to their clients the hms income fund isnt something youd want to own the fund has all the attributes of a nontraded bdc including illiquidity exorbitant transaction fees totaling  of the purchase price and an ongoing andstyle management fee this is the fund youve read warnings about but for main street capital the fund couldnt be better the

shouldnt be surprising incentives are aligned to grow the fund financial advisors can make a killing selling it so assets should only rise over time besides hines securities has its own economic interest in promoting the fund as it will generate larger management and administrative fees as hms income fund grows on the secondquarter  call hms was said to be raising about  to  million a month in equity capital the foolish bottom linethis fund could be spectacular for main street capital providing a new source of revenue without any investment requirements additionally it could serve as a way for main street capital to grow without diluting equity holders of the bdc previously i noted that future growth in main street capitals balance sheet may increase its cost of funds as its lowcost governmentbacked debt would be diluted with additional equity and debt itll be interesting to see how main street capital grows its asset management arm ceo vince foster alluded that this isnt the
