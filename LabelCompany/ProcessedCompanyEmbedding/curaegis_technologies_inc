investors investor relations board financial reports corporate governance accredited investor contact search investor relations corporate profile curaegis technologies inc was incorporated as a new york business corporation on september   the company develops and markets advanced technologies in the areas of wellness safety and power  currently we are focusing on the commercialization strategies in the following technologies     i the cura system which includes the mycadian™ watch which measures degradation of alertness and sleep attributes and the zcoach elearning education and training tool and     ii the aegis hydraulic pump    the mycadian™ watch consists of hardware and software that measures multiple metrics in order to establish that a persons ability to perform a task or job appears to be degrading the aegis hydraulic pump is designed with an innovative hydraulic design that delivers greater efficiencies and is smaller than currently offered products  the company has not had any significant revenueproducing operations   cura division the mycadian ™ watch the cura™ system and zcoach™ elearning the company’s cura division is developing a proprietary technology and suite of products designed to i measure the decrease in a person’s alertness and ii to train individuals on how to improve alertness levels the cura™ system and the mycadian™ watch enable the user and third parties to anticipate and avert undesired or disastrous situations caused by the degradation of alertness with the information provided from the cura™ software analytics employees can work with zcoach our proprietary sleep training and education solution to correct sleep issues and improve overall wellness      the mycadian™ watch is a wearable device developed using physiological monitoring hardware and our proprietary cura™ circadian user risk assessment software and detects a degradation of alertness in a user and reveals sleep and fatigue problems the mycadian™ watch will contain an emergency notification function through the use of a panic button or in sensing a lack of motion which would generate a third party panic notification the cura™ system will include     ● a proprietary tool that combines signal processing and pattern recognition to guide users and third parties about the alertness of the wearer     ● a risk assessment that identifies the degradation of alertness potentially affecting the wearer’s ability perform tasks     ● a comprehensive assessment for wellness alertness and sleep     ● realtime reporting that distills complex data into actionable information on mobile and desktop platforms     ● predictive reporting for a user to take action when alertness begins to wanebefore fatigue becomes dangerous     ● flexible settings to provide employers a customized cura tool within existing safety definitions and to create protocols for a unique environment     ● pricing that makes it affordable across a broad based workforce     the zcoach elearning tool was created by highly respected fatigue management scientists and was acquired by the company in september  the first of six zcoach elearning modules zcoach aviation has been designed for aviation professionals from flight and ground crews to scheduling dispatch administration and management zcoach learning topics include risks and costs of fatigue fundamentals of sleep fatigue mitigation and countermeasures zcoach participants gain an awareness of the dangers inherent in the lack of sleep and learn to utilize lifestyle tools to make changes to improve their health mood productivity and safety curaegis technologies plans to release five additional industryspecific versions of zcoach in conjunction with the launch of the cura™ system and the mycadian™ watch    aegis division hydraulic pump –   the development of our hydraulic pump has taken on added significance in light of recent us government emissions regulations for off road diesel engines these regulations will require diesel engines to pollute less to help achieve these new standards companies are attempting to run diesel engines and thus their hydraulic pumps at lower rotational speeds this requires larger displacement hydraulic pumps to be installed to compensate for the decrease in rotational speed among other advantages the unique technology of our hydraulic pump allows a larger displacement pump to fit into the same or smaller footprint than that of existing pumps this enables manufacturers to keep the current equipment layout without the need for expensive modifications to accommodate larger hydraulic pumps   our goal with the hydraulic pump technology is to give the marketplace a revolutionary new concept in hydraulic pumps and motors that will be     ● smaller and lighter than conventional pumps and motors     ● more efficient     ● as reliable     ● price competitive and     ● unique in its ability to scale larger allowing more powerful pumps and motors   we are now ready to approach corporate industry leaders in the hydraulic pump market to propose a prototype for a specific application in connection with this we are hiring an experienced industry advisor for market introductions discussions and presentations of this unique technology   we will continue to design modifications to enhance the overall pump technology we have filed for patent protection for our novel nonrotating group pump concept and we are also working on additional patents as a result of engineering breakthroughs in our design process although there is still much to be done we continue to be extremely encouraged by our testing  this website contains forwardlooking statements that are based on current expectations estimates and projections about the company and its

contact search torvec inc announces new product acquisition advisory board and name change  rochester ny september   newswire  richard a kaplan chief executive officer of torvec inc otcqb – tovc richard a kaplan ceo of torvec inc announces a name change for the company he states “we have split the company into two divisions the cura division will oversee our fatigue management consulting business and the aegis division will oversee our power and hydraulic business” cura is the name of a divine figure who personifies care and concern it also is an acronym for circadian user risk assessment  aegis means doing something under a powerful knowledgeable and benevolent source the new name of the company will be curaegis™ technologies inc this will be used as a dba until the next shareholders meeting when we will officially change the name mr kaplan states “we feel these changes more accurately reflect the vision and direction of the company and will create better transparency and understanding to our shareholders and our customers” you can see the new versions of the logo on our website torveccom we are very excited about the tremendous potential of our cura division sleep and fatigue management is an industry in its infancy and we feel we can be in the forefront the unchecked degradation of an individual’s alertness is a growing concern and the consequences in some areas are approaching epidemic proportions as an example it is estimated that  drivers per day fall asleep at the wheel serious and fatal truck bus train and automobile accidents are occurring at an alarming rate many injuries and accidents in manufacturing plants are fatigue related the purpose of monitoring alertness is to prevent these and other emergency situations from happening rather than dealing with them after the fact for instance waking someone up after they have fallen asleep at the wheel is too late our goal is to develop a robust offering of products and programs that evaluate monitor and help alleviate sleep and fatigue problems and the disastrous outcomes they can create up until now we know of no comprehensive programs that effectively and efficiently deal with these issues sleep is at the core of wellness and alertness problems with sleep and rest manifest themselves in individuals by compromising the immune system creating stress on the body and in turn affects their quality of life as well as longevity for businesses and other organizations they manifest themselves in lower productivity higher absenteeism more mistakes and accidents and lower moral the mycadian™ watch is a wearable device consisting of the latest physiological monitoring hardware along with the proprietary cura™ software it is intended to identify a degradation of alertness in a user and help remedy the problem this is especially important when an individual’s alertness is essential in properly performing tasks and fulfilling responsibilities the mycadiantm watch may also assist the user in remaining alert by periodically providing a stimulus this can create real positive and powerful changes in many areas in the fatigue management consulting industry one of the biggest challenges for consultants is assessing the problems and needs of large employee populations with our system employees can wear the watch for a prescribed period of time in which it learns their personal rhythms sleep habits and other pertinent information we can then correlate this information into a curatm wellness index for the organization this will give the company an overview of their employee population and how serious a problem they may have we then start educating and training individuals with sleep andor alertness problems and have a significant affect on their quality of life health care costs longevity and attitude all this can be achieved while maintaining an individual’s confidentiality the mycadian™ watch and cura™ systems have the following unique advantages of a unique combination of biological and motion measurements that communicates information relating to sleep and alertness with minimal distraction or disruption to normal activities a numerical and color coded riskassessment analysis that is easy to understand and react to cura™ is an easy to use software package that distils complex data into simple actionable information cura™ is designed to work on both mobile and desktop platforms provides the added benefit of potentially helping a user to stay alert versatile and flexible settings to allow users to customize the parameters of the device in order to work with andor establish safety and information system ability to communicate with other devices such as telematics systems cell phones etc to notify other parties of a pending or existing emergency situations cura™ software can be purchased as an application app when devices such as smart phones smart watches etc are manufactured with all the necessary hardware being relatively inexpensive creates real and measurable value propositions as an additional benefit the mycadian™ watch has many of the same features and dashboards as other wearable fitness watches  as another major initiative the corporation has closed on the purchase of certain assets of alertness solutions inc of menlo park california the assets consist of the zcoach tool a robust web based training and educational software for the fatigue management consulting industry the zcoach tool will integrate with augment and enhance our real time alertness monitoring and emergency systems and other new technologies in our suite of products  the zcoach technology was originally designed developed and enhanced by some of the world’s most respected fatigue management scientists and experts mr kaplan stated that ms leigh white president of alertness solutions will be joining torvec as executive vice president of the fatigue management consulting division we are also working on some other exciting technologies that we hope to add to our suite of fatigue management products in the near future to aid in these incredibly important endeavors we have put together an advisory board of some of the worlds most respected scientists and experts they are dr kenneth wright jr of the university of colorado at boulder dr richard j hanowski of virginia tech dr jonathan a marcus of the university of rochester dr laura k barger of harvard university dr melissa mallis scientist expert and researcher in fatigue risk management systems their bio’s can be seen on torvec’s website or clicking the links above we feel we now have both an internal and external team that will allow us to reach our goals our mycadian™ watch and cura™ software programming is on schedule we should have prototypes in the last quarter of  we will be starting our clinical analyses in october which also will be completed in the last quarter   using the abilities of our systems some of our potential markets are truck drivers retailgeneral public drivers airline pilots train engineers school and over the road bus drivers corporationsto improve productivity lower absenteeism have less mistakes and accidents hospital personnel security guards municipalitiesfor police fireman dpw workers etc militarygovernment such as air traffic controllers guards etc security systems for store clerks children or emergency notifications campers hunters and hikers surveillance agents students people in meetings people with health problems people monitoring critical processes ie nuclear facilities infrastructure etc hydraulic pump we are presently making adjustments to our new valve technology each change has shown improvement we are focusing on performing at the maximum required operating conditions for the pump we are confident that our targeted performance metrics can be achieved our goal is to create the most efficient pump on the market in a smaller lighter and more economical package we have concepts for the variable displacement pump ready but at this time are focusing our efforts on the valve which will be used in both pumps  we plan on testing portions of the variable displacement design with our current hardware  this will save us time and effort in the development of the variable displacement design we are making progress and are confident we will meet our goals  we are using advanced engineering tools and reference materials to assist us in our development  while developing new technologies issues come up that are difficult to predict and unfortunately can affect our timelines   we are currently  days behind schedule  we are working hard to get the best product to milwaukee school of engineering for third party testing as quickly as possible lastly we will be redesigning our website which should also be completed in the last quarter of  forwardlooking statements this news release may contain forward looking statements regarding torvecs future economic performance and
