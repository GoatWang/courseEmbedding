face to face with martin flanagan the ceo has transformed invesco from a company in danger of being swallowed by rivals to a firm on the prowl by douglas appell · may   as invesco ivzs board of directors sought a successor for founder charlie brady in mid sharks were circling the money manager hoping to bite off choice morsels back then the farflung firm was hamstrung by weak performance and fallout from its involvement in an industrywide trading scandal times have changed less than three years after the board hired martin l flanagan cochief executive officer of san mateo califbased franklin resources inc as president and ceo invesco looks more like a hunter than the hunted following its latest quarterly earnings report april  equity analysts overwhelmingly urged investors to buy the publicly traded money managers stock arguing that mr flanagans success in turning around the firm has left it poised for further gains mr flanagan says his predecessors did a great job bringing a bevy of outstanding investment managers around the globe under one corporate roof while his focus has been one of integrating them progress there combined with investment judgments that allowed invescos managers to sidestep the markets ongoing credit crisis should fuel the firms continued momentum he says leland holder martin l flanagan current position president and chief executive officer

franklin i grew up at templeton and ultimately franklin i was very happy and content invesco was just a compelling opportunity what did your initial todo list look like i wouldnt have taken the job if i didnt have a fundamental belief that it was a company with global capabilities with talent that needed to be reenergized and given some direction it was clear the organization was going through a succession process and people wanted to move forward � a very positive thing as opposed to showing up and finding everybody saying �everythings fine� analysts had called invesco an �undermanaged� company charlie brady did a heck of a job putting a talented organization together around the world but it was much more a holding company of asset managers than an integrated asset management company around each investment team there was sales and support � we could have been covering the same client through   different investment centers thats not what the client wants the client wants heres my problem come solve it for me thats really what weve been able to do the investment management teams do what theyre best at managing money and we can be responsive to the client in a much more efficient effective way how did you get there in september  we had  leaders of the organization get together for the better part of a week we said to them describe your business � what are we doing right wrong opportunities challenges it became blatantly clear � this is a smart group of people � that theres a better way if im a us investor only by looking at the world i broaden my opportunities and thats how weve done it organizationally sales and client support have become much more global in nature as opposed to being matched off against a specific investment team look at invescos quantitative team � together   years largely managing money for clients in the us today they manage for clients in  countries  the real estate business which started as a us business has a european presence and  an asian presence thats whats so fantastic about the global operating platform enabling you to respond to clients it involved a reorganization of the sales team now headed by jack markwalter the chairman and president of atlantic trust private wealth management your highnetworth arm yes with your latest earnings release showing high net worth accounting for less than  of invescos business some people speculate atlantic trust could break away from the firm thats absolutely false lets get back to how we look at the organization right now its becoming by the day more difficult to stick clients into historic retail institutional or private wealth management channels the whole notion is to have the capabilities to match up against the client in the past the business was organized as channelbased businesses we just dont see it that way integrating invesco � leaving investment centers with more clients more assets � sounds popular why didnt that happen sooner through the decade of the s invescos success was spectacular only when things become challenged do you look at different possibilities the notions a very simple one our fundamental strengths are distinctive investment management teams around the world and we want to deliver them to clients around the world through vehicles � separate accounts commingled funds mutual funds and now exchangetraded funds � that they want has it been a matter of pulling teeth you move a lot of boxes around its an enormous amount of work a multiyear effort is what youve done so far the heavy lifting or the lowhanging fruit a little bit of both you wish there was more lowhanging fruit were very excited about where we are as a firm you can sense the success the opportunities a lot of the very difficult restructuring is over and its now a matter of taking advantage of where we are did last years liftout of stable value veterans by deutsche asset management affect your priorities in any way you have to step back and ask �why did this happen are we on the right track or not� and redouble your efforts it was a shortterm disruption but the organization is stronger today and invescos broader fixedincome team has more assets now than it did a year ago we think were on the verge of a great opportunity there the money fund business theyve done a spectacular job no siv exposure we havent written checks no need to step in with support agreements was that luck skill or both it was very much part of the investment management process thats what i feel so good about for a liquidity product what do people really care about safety liquidity and then yield and thats what we did people who got themselves in trouble maybe had the order reversed go to the other end of the spectrum we had a good business doing collateralized debt obligations collateralized loan obligations � dirty words these days right the fact is weve done very well with it at the end of  our different investment teams around the world were looking at the opportunities and saying �something doesnt look right here� we stopped participating in the cdo market when you could have done one a month we wanted to improve our competitive position with our clients by not disappointing them gmo suffered when it did the same in the late s were you suffering as well in  and early  sure we were willing to give up shortterm gains for the longer term success of the institution for example there was a quant opportunity for multihundreds of millions of dollars that we turned down because we werent willing to give a single client so much of a capacityconstrained product think of where we were as an institution in   dont you think we would have loved to report a big win but were building the organization for the long
