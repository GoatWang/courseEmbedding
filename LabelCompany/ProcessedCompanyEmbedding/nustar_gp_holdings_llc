earnings edge up on a tax benefit midstream general partner’s mlp nustar energy completed several strategic initiatives that should fuel growth going forward matthew dilallo tmfmd jan   at pm image source getty images midstream general partner nustar gp holdings nysensh financial results have not moved all that much in quite a while primarily because cash flow at its master limited partnership nustar energy nysens has plateaued due to the oil market downturn that was the case again in the fourth quarter after the mlp sent virtually the same amount of money to its parent company as it did the prior year however this trend could be about to change after the midstream company completed several strategic initiatives during the quarter which should help drive cash flow growth in the future should that earnings growth materialize it will eventually flow down to nustar gp nustar results the raw numbers metric q  q  yearoveryear change total cash distributions from nustar energy  million  million  distributable cash flow  million  million  dcf per unit    data source nustar gp holdings what happened with nustar this quarter  nustar results were slightly higher thanks to a tax benefit nustar gp continues to receive virtually the same amount of income from nustar energy the only difference this quarter is that the general partner incentive distribution was  million higher offset slightly by a reduction in earnings from its limited partner interest meanwhile distributable cash flow rose thanks to a tax benefit which reversed a large tax expense in the yearago period this increase in cash flow enabled the company to cover its distribution during the quarter for the full year nustar gp generated  million of distributable cash flow and it paid  million in distributions covering the shortfall with incremental debt nustar energy also covered its distribution during the quarter at  times and achieved fullyear coverage to  times that marked  consecutive quarters that the mlp covered its payout  what management had to say  about the quarter ceo brad barron said nustar gp holdings llcs fourth quarter and full year  results were primarily driven by strong performance from nustar energy lps base pipeline and storage operations barron noted in the mlps earnings release what drove those results saying our base storage and pipeline operations performed very well in the face of a continued weak commodity price environment throughout the year during  our storage segment benefited from increased storage rates at some of our facilities while our pipeline segment experienced higher overall refined product throughputs due in part to some completed expansion projects in our central east system and higher utilization at some of the refineries we serve however the more notable highlight during the quarter was the completion of three strategic initiatives first the company closed the acquisition of martin midstream partners nasdaqmmlp crude oil and refined product terminal assets in the port of corpus christi nustar paid martin midstream partners  million for the assets which are expected to produce  million of annual ebitda second the company issued  million of perpetual preferred units which gives it funding for future growth capital needs finally it officially closed the book on the  sale of its asphalt marketing business by reducing the value of the associated term loan by  million in exchange for a  million cash payment that transaction also frees up  million in borrowing capacity because it eliminates a credit support agreement with the entity furthermore it will boost terminal lease revenue by  million per year as a result of these transactions nustar has significantly increased its liquidity and earnings profile looking forward  regarding what lies ahead barron added the future looks bright as we will benefit from the additional  million barrels of storage at our piney point maryland facility a newly renegotiated longterm storage lease at our st eustatius facility expansion of our propane and distillate services on our central east system and the synergies achieved by the acquisition of terminal assets in corpus christi that support our eagle ford operations in addition to the higher earnings from those assets the company has ample liquidity to build or buy additional cash flowing assets if it can turn that capital into a sustainable cash flow stream it could allow it to increase the distribution which would finally drive earnings growth at nustar gp matt dilallo has no position in any
