that results from three clinical studies of the company’s investigational readytouse liquid glucagon formulation were presented at the th scientific session of the american diabetes association ada in san diego from june   in a pilot study patients with type  diabetes td experienced normalization of plasma glucose levels and demonstrated complete resolution of symptoms of severe experimentally induced hypoglycemia following a rescue dose of the company’s glucagon formulation in two proofofconcept studies minidoses of the same glucagon formulation were found to be as effective as carbohydrates at treating or preventing mildmoderate and exerciseinduced hypoglycemia a pilot study in adults with tdm to examine the efficacy of stable nonaqueous glucagon for treatment of severe hypoglycemia abstract lb this study was conducted in adults with type  diabetes to explore whether a subcutaneous injection of liquidstable glucagon  or  mg could rescue subjects from insulininduced severe hypoglycemia after an overnight fast subjects were administered intravenous iv insulin under controlled conditions to induce plasma glucose   mgdl for  minutes this procedure resulted in symptoms typical of hypoglycemia in most subjects following the  mg glucagon dose  subjects achieved primary response with plasma glucose   mgdl in an average time of  minutes range  minutes following the  mg dose  subjects achieved plasma glucose   mgdl in an average time of  minutes range  minutes symptomatic relief began within  minutes of dosing with glucagon and all subjects experienced complete resolution of hypoglycemia symptoms in a median time of  minutes range  no significant safety concerns were noted efficacy and safety of minidose glucagon for treatment of nonsevere hypoglycemia in adults with type  diabetes abstract p twenty adults with type  diabetes using an insulin pump and continuous glucose monitor cgm and experiencing frequent mild hypoglycemia participated in a crossover trial two week periods comparing nonaqueous minidose glucagon mdg  µg versus oral glucose tablets tabs  g to treat hypoglycemia blood glucose bg  mgdl successful treatment was defined as bg  mgdl at  minutes and  mgdl at  minutes after intervention sixteen participants mean age  years  female mean diabetes duration  years mean hbac  had  analyzable events with initial bg  mgdl successful treatment criteria were met for   of  events during the mdg period and   of  events during the tabs period adjusted p cgmmeasured time with blood glucose in the range of  mgdl data did not differ between treatment groups during the  hours postevents but tabs resulted in higher maximum glucose  vs  mgdl p over the first hour some participants reported injection site discomfort mdg as well as nausea mdg and tabs patients with type  diabetes td who perform aerobic exercise often experience a decrease in blood glucose concentration that can result in hypoglycemia current approaches to prevent exerciseinduced hypoglycemia include reduction in insulin delivery or ingestion of carbohydrates but either strategy can result in hypo or hyperglycemia this study sought to determine whether minidose glucagon mdg given subcutaneously before exercise could prevent subsequent glucose lowering and to compare the glycemic response to current approaches the study was a randomized period crossover trial involving  adults with td who exercised at  vomax for  min with either  no intervention control   basal insulin reduction   g oral glucose tabs or   µg glucagon administered  min before exercise during exercise mean plasma glucose increased slightly with mdg compared to a decrease with control and insulin reduction and with a greater increase with glucose tabs insulin levels were not different while glucagon increased with mdg six subjects experienced hypoglycemia   mgdl during control  during insulin reduction and none with glucose tabs or mdg  subjects experienced hyperglycemia  mgdl with glucose tabs and  with mdg no significant safety concerns were noted xeris pharmaceuticals inc presents at prefilled syringes san diego summit jun  pm jun

wwwxerispharmacom about glucagon glucagon is a metabolic hormone secreted by the pancreas that raises blood glucose levels by causing the liver to rapidly convert glycogen the stored form of glucose into glucose which is then released into the bloodstream  glucagon and insulin are two critical hormones in a glycemic control system that keeps blood glucose at the right level in healthy individuals in people with diabetes who are dependent on insulin this control system is disrupted and insulin must be injected prior to meals to avoid high levels of blood glucose hyperglycemia  the opposite effect of low blood glucose hypoglycemia is also prevalent in this population due to dysregulated glucagon secretion severe hypoglycemia is a serious condition and can lead to loss of conciseness seizures coma potential brain injury and if untreated death  xeris proprietary formulation technology has the potential to provide the first soluble room temperature stable readytoinject glucagon for use by people with diabetes and other indications to prevent or manage both moderate and severe hypoglycemia and achieve optimal glucose control xeris media contact brad huckabee xeris pharmaceuticals
