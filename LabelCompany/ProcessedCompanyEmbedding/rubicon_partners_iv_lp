enemy armor — that function was performed by the lighter panzer iii  however with the flaws of prewar doctrine becoming apparent and in the face of soviet t tanks the panzer iv soon assumed the tankfighting role of its increasingly obsolete cousin   robust and reliable the panzer iv saw service in all combat theaters involving germany and has the distinction of being the only german tank to remain in continuous production throughout the war with over  produced between  and   upgrades and design modifications often made in response to the appearance of new allied tanks extended its service life  generally these involved increasing the panzer iv’s armor protection or upgrading its weapons although during the last months of the war with germany’s pressing need for rapid replacement of losses design changes also included retrograde measures to simplify and speed up the manufacturing process   the panzer iv was the most widely exported tank in german service with
