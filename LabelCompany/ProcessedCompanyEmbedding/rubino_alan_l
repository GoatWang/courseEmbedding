conference call can be accessed through the companys website at wwwemispherecom an archive of the webcast will be available beginning today at  am eastern standard time for approximately one week we

morning everyone and thank you for joining us to discuss emispheres financial results for the quarter ended june   and other corporate highlights on todays call alan rubino will provide an overview of recent corporate achievements and plans then i will review financial results for the second quarter following closing remarks we will open the lines for a questionandanswer session i hope youve had an opportunity to review the second quarter financial results press release which we issued earlier this morning before moving into the discussion of our financial results please note that todays remarks will contain forwardlooking statements that involve risks and uncertainties including but not limited to statements regarding success of the companys outlicensing and other business development initiatives and the sufficiency of the companys cash position these risks and uncertainties are outlined in emispheres filings with the securities and exchange commission including its quarterly report on form q which we expect to file later today as such actual results may differ materially from what is discussed on todays call please note that our earnings release q and other sec filings are available on the investor relations page of our website at wwwemispherecom with that ill turn the call over to alan rubino alan alan l rubino thank you very much alan and good morning to all of you and thanks for joining us on this call first let me just get right into the discussion of our first quarter ph  achievements during the first half of  as mentioned before we continued to focus our efforts on ongoing and in progress business development initiatives first let us discuss eligen b our discussions continue to advance with potential partners for a strategic transaction or alliance for the ongoing commercialization of the oral b product this is both true in the us and internationally for those of you who maybe new to emisphere eligen b quite simply is the first commercial product using emispheres product proprietary eligen snac carrier it is the first and only prescription oral vitamin b therapeutic in a market segment that previously offered only injectible or nasal delivery formulations it is the first oral prescription tablet clinically proven to normalize vitamin b levels without the need for an injection also important is eligen b works even in the absence of intrinsic factor which is a protein made in the stomach which normally facilitates b absorption we believe that eligen bs full market potential will best be achieved by an organization with a much greater commercial resources and an established infrastructure and the best way to achieve this would be through potential strategic partnerships with a third party or parties as mentioned partnership discussions for eligen b continued to advance we are actively engaged in dialogue with approximately a dozen major healthcare and pharmaceutical companies each of these organizations is seeking to license or acquire the rights to eligen b in the us also as indicated during our last call we also have interest for global markets as well regarding exus territories as i have alluded to before we are currently in active discussions with a major pharmaceutical company who has interest in global nonus rights we have been discussing deal terms and anticipate advancing towards the first draft of an agreement soon interestingly several of the other potential partners have communicated their desire to pursue a possible otc commercialization strategy for eligen b while others remain squarely focused on continuing to market the product as a prescription medical food so we will continue to pursue all these active discussions and we will work towards securing a partnership that brings the most value for our shareholders looking back to the pilot launch of eligen b in  we have seen and continue to see highly positive physician and patient reception a sentiment that certainly has continued to date also importantly there have been no adverse reactions and no reports of patients not responding to treatment so we continue to hear a positive feedback from both patients and prescribers that is always very good for a new therapeutic given the eligen b product profile and the initial market uptake we believe that the market potential for an oral b replacement is significant and largely untapped the potential partners we are speaking with possess the substantial capabilities and resources to effectively promote eligen b and significantly expand its commercial potential while also adding the vitally important b deficiency in treatment education which will be critical to the overall marketing now i would like to turn to our carrier partnerships as you all know our most advanced partnership with novo nordisk is not only important but continues to be on track as many of you are aware novo nordisk is developing oral semaglutide a once daily oral formulation of a longacting glp analog for the treatment of type ii diabetes this product utilizes our absorption enhancing snac carrier the phase iii clinical testing of oral semaglutide is now well underway novo nordisk has stated their plans to conduct  clinical trials which are expected to enroll approximately  patients with type ii diabetes in addition they have also stated their intention to invest an estimated  billion over the next coming five years in two new production facilities in north carolina and denmark related to this product this is in order to meet the capacity requirements for their diabetes care products including oral semaglutide emisphere is eligible to receive future milestone and royalty payments in connection with marketplace success of this novo nordisk product as you all know but maybe those of you new to the call emisphere also newly partnered with novo nordisk for the development and commercialization of oral formulations of four classes of novo nordisks investigational molecules these target major metabolic disorders including diabetes and obesity we also use various carriers from our oral eligen technology library clearly the effective oral delivery of these agents is a major novo nordisk business and differentiating strategy and quite frankly we are very enthusiastic to be part of this key initiative under this new development and license agreement novo nordisk is solely responsible for the development and commercialization of all product candidates and during the first half of  they continued with important feasibility testing for these license molecules if approved these product candidates will compete in high value therapeutic areas that represent over  billion in total product sales again novo nordisk is well known to be a key player in these high value metabolic indications as a reminder emisphere is eligible to receive up to  million in development and sales milestone payments in addition to royalty on sales of each successfully commercialized product covered by this agreement so clearly novo nordisk is an important partner for emisphere the oral semaglutide partnership combined with the new multimolecule agreement for candidates in high value metabolic indications all significant potential for emispheres future success and even if only a small number of the new molecules are eventually brought to the market i would like to continue with the eligen carrier technology and beyond novo nordisk we are also expanding our scope of potential new partners by working with other high profile companies these firms are currently conducting feasibility evaluations with multiple additional molecules and utilizing our unique eligen technology oral delivery carriers the eligen technology is our proven delivery system technology and the success we have seen to date with novo nordisk including the expanded agreement for development of the metabolic molecules has been a significant catalyst for a new wave of business development and collaboration enquiries as such we expect to be attending and increasing our presence at drug delivery industry meetings with the goal of maintaining the momentum we have created on this front our carriers are applicable through broad range of chemical entities and have been clearly shown to increase the benefit of the therapy by improving bioavailability or absorption or by decreasing time to onset of action all of these are practical and substantial innovation offerings during the first half of  we continued to receive unsolicited interest from companies interested in our technology as well as interest from firms we have worked with previously who now have new needs the molecule they have approached is about our marketed drugs and this is important because that means these products have been proven already to be safe and effective there are feasibility studies ongoing with several potential partners and we would like to see these move forward towards an agreement with one or more of these markets in the coming months and quarters so naturally we are highly encouraged by the growing interest and activity surrounding our eligen technology and we look forward to providing updates on this whenever possible it is also important to mention that we currently own the rights to an extensive portfolio of carriers and our current focus on the eligen technology business development initiatives remains on the development of new oral formulations to replace injectible formulations however and i have said this before we have a renewed action and focus on approved drug compounds and we are  and that also includes those that are next generation smaller proteins and peptides including certain pegylated versions now turning just quickly to operations just like to touch on cost reduction and resource allocation initiatives as a result of our strategic decision to secure a partner for eligen b we also have successfully implemented several cost control and resource allocation initiatives these enable us to reduce our cash burn while being right sized but still being able to intensely focus on our new strategic trust we are confident that our ongoing cost management measures will enable us to better preserve our financial resources and yet remain efficient and effective in our work efforts with that i would like to turn the call back over to alan where he will review second quarter  results and financial highlights and then i would like to come back to make a few closing remarks alan alan gallantar thank you alan next ill provide an overview of the financial results for the second quarter ended june   for the quarter the company reported a net loss of  million or a loss of  per basic and diluted share compared to a net income of  million or  per basic share and loss of  per diluted for the same period in  total operating expenses were  million for the quarter a decrease of  million or  compared to the same period in  total operating expenses include research and development costs of approximately  million and compared to  million in  and selling general and administrative expenses of  million a decrease of  million or  compared to the same period in  other nonoperating expenses for the second quarter of  was  million compared to other nonoperating income of  million for the same period in  weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding for the three months ended june   was  weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding for the three months ended june   was  and  respectively and now turning to the yeartodate financials for the six months ended june   emisphere reported a net loss of  million or a loss of  per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of  million or a loss of  per basic and diluted share for the same period last year total operating expenses for the six months ended june   was  million a decrease of  million or  compared to the same period in  total operating expenses include rd expenses of approximately  million compared to  million for the same period in  and sga expenses of  million a decrease of  million or  compared to the same period in  weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding for the sixmonth periods ended june   and  were  as of june   emisphere had approximately  million in cash a net decrease of  million from december   on october   we received a total payment of  million from novo nordisk pursuant to and consisting of  million as payment for entry into a license agreement and  million as payment in connection with the third amendment to the existing glp license agreement with novo nordisk under terms of our loan agreement we are obligated to prepay certain loans and notes using  of any extraordinary receipts such as the  million received from novo nordisk a creditor under our loan agreement and reimbursement notes has agreed to extend the date by which we are required to use  of the  million received from novo nordisk to prepay certain loans and notes until august   however because of such prepayment deadline has not been extended beyond one year from the june   we have classified  million of the loans and notes as the current liability as of june   we believe that our current cash balance will provide sufficient capital to continue operations through september  however if the prepayment obligation is further extended or waived we will have sufficient cash to operate through september  our future capital requirements beyond september  or september  in the event that prepayment obligation is further extended or waived and our financial success depends largely on our ability to raise additional capital including by leveraging existing and securing new partnering opportunities for eligen b and eligen technologies as of june   we have received approximately  million from novo nordisk under the glp license agreement we are eligible to receive up to an additional  million in contingent product development payments and sales milestone payments under the terms of the disagreement and now id like to turn the call back over to alan rubino for closing remarks alan l rubino thank you alan looking ahead to the remainder of  we would certainly will continue to focus on aggressively exploring and identifying and especially advancing the existing discussions with potential partners for eligen b this will be true both for the us and for attractive nonus markets we are focusing on companies as i have mentioned earlier with significant resources and bona fide interest in realizing the full healthcare and economic value of this unique product because we believe and it is demonstrated that it addresses a substantial and real unmet medical need we will also be laser focused on securing new andor expanding development partnerships with our carriers and doing this with high profile biopharmaceutical firms that have demonstrated interest in utilizing our eligen drug delivery technology again as mentioned earlier few times during our conversation here this morning there has been significant and tangible interest expressed by several such organizations these include some well known healthcare and biopharmaceutical companies that have strong rd and commercial capabilities all of these organizations share our goal of creating new oral formulations to replace important injectible products we will also continue to effectively manage our cash resources and conduct calculated strategic spending to best preserve our financial resources we are rather pleased by the significant advancement made recently on the business development front but i must add we must continue to make steady progress and all of you know that and we will try to exercise the intended business outcomes we are seeking we firmly believe that products developed using eligen carriers have the potential to overcome bioavailability challenges commonly associated with the oral administration particular of peptides and certain other compounds and we will remain fully engaged in all of these initiatives to turnaround emispheres course and create shareholder value for all of our loyal shareholders those of you who have been with us for some time as well as new ones we want to have everyone here for the longer term let me thank everyone now this morning
