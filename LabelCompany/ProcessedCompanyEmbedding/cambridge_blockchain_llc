of personal identity data back in the hands of the end user our platform allows financial institutions to meet the strictest new data privacy rules eliminate redundant identity compliance checks and improve the customer experience     the challenge financial institutions are facing an explosion of costs related to identity compliance annual spending and fines for knowyourcustomer and antimoney laundering regulations now exceed  billion more than double their levels before the financial crisis at the same time strict new data privacy rules are limiting the ability of institutions to freely collect and share the personal identity data needed to complete these checks centralized compliance databases struggle to meet these conflicting priorities resulting in duplication of the same identity checks across institutions and severe impacts to customer experience and operating costs identity compliance spending and fines b source accenture celent our solution a better way is now possible cambridge blockchains distributed architecture resolves the competing challenges of transparency and privacy leading to stronger regulatory compliance lower costs and a seamless customer experiences user controlof personal identity reuse of identity validations blockchainaudit trail cambridge blockchain solves the problem of enabling strong digital identities at a global scale while providing individuals control over their identity data by combining blockchain technology with an offchain personal data service we create an independent source of truth through the network effects of transactions amongst individuals and trusted parties never before has identity been so reliably and flexibly managed leading to seamless transactions operational efficiencies and strong privacy by giving control of personal data back to the end user cambridge blockchain allows financial institutions to collect and validate client data in privacyprotecting manner our platform facilitates client control of their own personal data in a single unified version through a virtual container called a personal data service pds using the pds a user can  preapprove automated rules that allow financial institutions to access the data  ensure that each division is working with the most updated version of the data and  confirm that the data is identical to what has been checked by another trusted party the shared blockchain ledger does not contain any personal data but rather cryptographic proofs that can attest to the validity of personal data and who has signed it along with an auditable and trusted tracking of changes competitions and awards cambridge blockchain was a graduate of the  fintech innovation lab a week program in which an elite group of growth technology companies are selected to be mentored by senior executives from the top financial services companies and some of new yorks leading entrepreneurs and technology luminaries the fintech innovation lab was cofounded by

cambridge blockchain identity blockchain genesis block alpha sept    utc what are you talking about this page describes the start of the identity blockchain a tool for validating secure digital identity documents processing electronic signatures and recording transactions since this is a new blockchain it begins with a genesis block shown below all subsequent data entries in the blockchain must reference this genesis block through a chain of strong cryptographic proofs any attempt at manipulation of blockchain data will break the chain of proofs making it effectively impossible to alter records without detection the genesis block is structured as any other typical block with the exception that it references no previous block and includes no transactions all values are represented in hexadecimal ie base  with numbers running from zero through the letter f abcdef hexadecimal is a convenient way to represent the binary data of computers in a form more easily readable to humans numbers are stored in bigendian order where the big end most significant value in the sequence is stored first the term bigendian derives from jonathan swifts gullivers travels in which the big endians were a political faction who broke their eggs at the large end show me the genesis block genesis block  the first block in the identity blockchain magicno the magic number is an unique identifier for the blockchain and remains constant for all subsequent blocks timestamp the genesis block timestamp is september   at midnight utc time is represented in a unix format which counts up in seconds from january   the timestamp is encoded as double primary data type version the genesis block shows a version of ffff ffff the highest hexadecimal value possible to indicate that it is an alpha version still in development hashprevblock the genesis block is the first blockchain entry so there is no previous block to reference therefore its hashprevblock value is  zero the genesis blocks own block identifier described below then serves as the hashprevblock value for the second block in the blockchain hashmerkleroot the hashmerkleroot is computed from transaction data it is named for ralph merkle who received a patent in  for the efficient and secure verification of large data structures using a hash tree the genesis block contains no transactions so its hashmerkleroot value is  zero  a bc e dc a  ecc e bfe fb f c c f edc block identifier double sha hash df ee  d a  e fcc   f cf e f dc  d c   ffff ffff                                 move your mouse cursor over one of the colored terms to see a short description for more information please scroll down how is the block identifier derived the colored numbers from the genesis block are used to compute a block identifier signature shown in the black box above the computation is a oneway function known as a cryptographic hash this allows one to easily verify that some input data maps to a given hash value but if the input data is unknown it is deliberately difficult to reconstruct it or equivalent alternatives by knowing the stored hash value the particular function used here is a  bit secure hash algorithm known as sha  which was patented by the us national security agency and subsequently released under a royaltyfree license this function has been in the public domain since  and is generally considered by cryptography experts to be extremely secure proof published in mits oldest and largest newspaper limited edition — blockchain mug cambridge blockchain llc company profile  bloomberg
