sidebar for the official electronic format start preamble august   pursuant to section b of the securities exchange act of  the “act” and rule b thereunder notice is hereby given that on august   bats edgx exchange inc the “exchange” or “edgx” filed with the securities and exchange commission “commission” the proposed rule change as described in items i and ii below which items have been prepared by the exchange the exchange has designated this proposal as a “noncontroversial” proposed rule change pursuant to section ba of the act  and rule bf thereunder which renders it effective upon filing with the commission the commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons i selfregulatory organizations statement of the terms of substance of the proposed rule change the exchange filed a proposal to amend rule  to adopt a new market data product known as edgx summary depth the text of the proposed rule change is available at the exchanges web site at wwwbatstradingcom at the principal office of the exchange and at the commissions public reference room ii selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and statutory basis for the proposed rule change in its filing with the commission the exchange included statements concerning the purpose of and basis for the proposed rule change and discussed any comments it received on the proposed rule change the text of these statements may be examined at the places specified in item iv below the exchange has prepared summaries set forth in sections a b and c below of the most significant parts of such statements a selfregulatory organizations statement of the purpose of and the statutory basis for the proposed rule change  purpose the exchange proposes to amend rule  to adopt a new market data product known as edgx summary depth edgx summary depth would be a data feed that offers aggregated twosided quotations for all displayed orders entered into the system  for up to five  price levels for securities traded on the exchange and for which the exchange reports quotes under the consolidated tape association “cta” plan or the nasdaqutp plan edgx summary depth also contains the individual last sale information market status trading status and trade break messages the individual last sale information will include the price size and time of execution the last sale message will also include the cumulative number of shares executed on the exchange for that trading day the exchange will disseminate the aggregate best bid and offer “bbo” and last sale information through edgx start printed page summary depth no earlier than it provides its bbo and last sale information to the processors under the cta plan or the nasdaqutp plan the market status message will reflect a change in the status of the exchange for example the market status message would indicate whether the exchange is experiencing a systems issue or disruption resulting in quotation or trade information not currently being disseminated as part of the aggregated bbo the market status message will also indicate when exchange has resolved a systems issue or disruption and is properly reflecting the status of the aggregated bbo the trade break message will indicate when an execution is broken in accordance with exchange rules the trading status message will indicate the current trading status of a security on the exchange for example a trading status message will be sent when a short sale price restriction is in effect pursuant to rule  of regulation sho “short sale circuit breaker” or when the security is subject to a trading halt suspension or pause declared by the listing market a trading status message will be sent whenever a securitys trading status changes the exchange intends to offer edgx summary depth as of january   prior to january   the exchange will file a separate rule change with the commission proposing fees to be charged for edgx summary depth  statutory basis the exchange believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section b of the act in general and furthers the objectives of section b of the act in particular in that it is designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices to promote just and equitable principles of trade to remove impediments to and perfect the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system and to protect investors and the public interest and that it is not designed to permit unfair discrimination among customers brokers or dealers this proposal is in keeping with those principles in that it promotes increased transparency through the dissemination of edgx summary depth the exchange also believes this proposal is consistent with section b of the act because it protects investors and the public interest and promotes just and equitable principles of trade by providing investors with an alternative for receiving market data as requested by market data vendors and purchasers that expressed an interest in exchangeonly data for instances where consolidated data is no longer required to be purchased and displayed the proposed rule change would benefit investors by facilitating their prompt access to realtime depthofbook information contained in edgx summary depth the exchange also believes that the proposed rule change is consistent with section a of the act  in that it supports i fair competition among brokers and dealers among exchange markets and between exchange markets and markets other than exchange markets and ii the availability of information with respect to quotations for and transactions in securities to brokers dealers and investors furthermore the proposed rule change is consistent with rule  of regulation nms which provides that any national securities exchange that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an nms stock do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory edgx summary depth would be accessed and subscribed to on a voluntary basis in that neither the exchange nor market data distributors are required by any rule or regulation to make this data available accordingly distributors and subscribers can discontinue their use at any time and for any reason in adopting regulation nms the commission granted selfregulatory organizations and brokerdealers increased authority and flexibility to offer new and unique market data to consumers of such data it was believed that this authority would expand the amount of data available to users and consumers of such data and also spur innovation and competition for the provision of market data the exchange believes that the data products proposed herein are precisely the sort of market data products that the commission envisioned when it adopted regulation nms the commission concluded that regulation nms—by lessening regulation of the market in proprietary data—would itself further the acts goals of facilitating efficiency and competition efficiency is promoted when brokerdealers who do not need the data beyond the prices sizes market center identifications of the nbbo and consolidated last sale information are not required to receive and pay for such data the commission also believes that efficiency is promoted when brokerdealers may choose to receive and pay for additional market data based on their own internal analysis of the need for such data by removing “unnecessary regulatory restrictions” on the ability of exchanges to sell their own data regulation nms advanced the goals of the act and the principles reflected in its legislative history in addition edgx summary depth removes impediments to and perfects the mechanism of a free and open market and a national market system by providing investors with alternative market data and competing with similar market data products currently offered by the new york stock exchange inc “nyse” and the nasdaq stock market llc “nasdaq” the provision of new options for investors to receive market data was a primary goal of the market data amendments adopted by regulation nms b selfregulatory organizations statement on burden on competition the exchange does not believe that the proposed rule change will result in any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act the start printed page exchange believes that the proposal will promote competition by enabling the exchange to offer a market data product similar to that currently offered by the nyse and nasdaq thus the exchange believes this proposed rule change is necessary to permit fair competition among national securities exchanges c selfregulatory organizations statement on comments on the proposed rule change received from members participants or others the exchange has neither solicited nor received written comments on the proposed rule change iii date of effectiveness of the proposed rule change and timing for commission action because the proposed rule change does not i significantly affect the protection of investors or the public interest ii impose any significant burden on competition and iii become operative for  days from the date on which it was filed or such shorter time as the commission may designate it has become effective pursuant to section ba of the act  and rule bf thereunder at any time within  days of the filing of the proposed rule change the commission summarily may temporarily suspend such rule change if it appears to the commission that such action is necessary or appropriate in the public interest for the protection of investors or otherwise in furtherance of the purposes of the act if the commission takes such action the commission shall institute proceedings to determine whether the proposed rule change should be approved or disapproved iv solicitation of comments interested persons are invited to submit written data views and

bats exchange inc “bats” bats yexchange inc “byx” edga exchange inc “edga” and edgx exchange inc “edgx” collectively the “exchanges” filed with the securities and exchange commission “commission” pursuant to section b of the securities exchange act of  “act”  and rule b thereunder proposed rule changes to establish a new market data product called the “bats one feed” on november   each of the exchanges filed an amendment no  to its proposed rule change the proposed rule changes each as amended by an amendment no  were published for comment in the federal register on november   on december   each of the exchanges filed an amendment no  to its proposed rule change on december   each of the exchanges submitted a comment letter on its proposed rule change each of which included a redline showing the changes made by their amendments no  no other comments on the proposed rule changes have been received however similar proposed rule changes were filed with the commission by the exchanges earlier this year and subsequently withdrawn  three start printed page comment letters were received in response to two of those proposed rule changes the commission is publishing this notice and order to solicit comment on the amendments no  and to approve each of the proposed rule changes as modified by amendments nos  and  on an accelerated basis ii description of the proposals the exchanges propose to establish a new market data product called the bats one feed which would be offered by each of the exchanges the bats one feed would be a consolidated data feed based on market data derived from underlying data feeds offered by each of the exchanges specifically the exchanges would use the following data feeds which are also available to other vendors to create the proposed bats one feed the edgebook depth feed for edgx the edgebook depth feed for edga the byx pitch feed and the bats pitch feed the exchanges have represented that they will continue to make these individual underlying feeds available and that as a result the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed bats one feed would be the same as the source available to other vendors as described more fully below the bats one feed would be a data feed that disseminates on a realtime basis the aggregate best bid and offer “bbo” of all displayed orders for securities traded on the exchanges and for which the exchanges report quotes under the consolidated tape association “cta” plan or the nasdaqutp plan the bats one feed would also contain the individual last sale information for each of the exchanges in addition the bats one feed would include messages from the exchanges about trading on their markets finally the bats one feed would contain an optional functionality that would enable recipients to elect to receive aggregated twosided quotations from the exchanges for up to five  price levels description of the bats one feed the bats one feed would contain the aggregate bbo of the exchanges for all securities that are traded on the exchanges and for which the exchanges report quotes under the cta plan or the nasdaqutp plan the aggregate bbo would include the total size of all orders at the bbo available on all exchanges the bats one feed would also disseminate last sale information for each of the individual exchanges the last sale information would include the price size time of execution and the individual exchange on which the trade was executed the last sale message would also include the cumulative number of shares executed on all exchanges for that trading day the exchanges have represented that they would disseminate the aggregate bbo of the exchanges and last sale information through the bats one feed no earlier than each individual exchange provides its bbo and last sale information to the processors under the cta plan or the nasdaqutp plan the bats one feed would also include symbol summary market status retail liquidity identifier on behalf of byx trading status and trade break messages the symbol summary message would include the total executed volume across all of the exchanges the market status message would be disseminated to reflect a change in the status of one of the exchanges for example the market status message would indicate whether one of the exchanges is experiencing a systems issue or disruption and quotation or trade information from that market is not currently being disseminated via the bats one feed as part of the aggregated bbo the market status message would also indicate when an exchange is no longer experiencing a systems issue or disruption to properly reflect the status of the aggregated bbo the retail liquidity identifier indicator message would be disseminated via the bats one feed on behalf of the byx only pursuant to byxs retail price improvement “rpi” program the retail liquidity identifier indicates when rpi interest priced at least  better than byxs protected bid or protected offer for a particular security is available in the system the exchanges propose to disseminate the retail liquidity indicator via the bats one feed in the same manner as it is currently disseminated through consolidated data streams ie pursuant to the consolidated tape association planconsolidated quotation plan or ctacq for tape a and tape b securities and the nasdaq utp plan for tape c securities as well as through proprietary byx data feeds the retail liquidity identifier reflects the symbol and the side buy or sell of the rpi interest but does not include the price or size of the rpi interest in particular like cq and utp quoting outputs the bats one feed would include a field for codes related to the retail price improvement identifier the codes indicate rpi interest that is priced better than byxs protected bid or protected offer by at least the minimum level of price improvement as required by the program the trade break message would indicate when an execution on one of the exchanges has been broken in accordance with the individual exchanges rules the trading status message would indicate the current trading status of a security on each individual exchange for example a trading status message would be sent when a short sale price restriction is in effect pursuant to rule  of regulation sho “short sale circuit breaker” or the security is subject to a trading halt suspension or pause declared by the listing market a trading status message would be sent whenever a securitys trading status changes optional functionality for aggregate depth of book the bats one feed would also offer an additional optional functionality that would enable recipients to receive twosided quotations from the exchanges for five  price levels for all securities that are traded on the exchanges the option for start printed page receiving the bats one feed with this depth of book functionality is referred to as the “bats one premium feed” the option for receiving the bats one feed without this functionality is referred to as the “bats one summary feed” for each price level on one of the exchanges the bats one premium feed option of the bats one feed would include a twosided quote and the number of shares available to buy and sell at that particular price level distribution of the bats one feed the exchanges represent that they have taken into consideration their affiliated relationships in the design of the bats one feed to assure that vendors would be able to offer a similar product on the same terms as the exchanges both from the perspective of latency and cost the exchanges have stated that they propose to offer the bats one feed voluntarily in response to demand from vendors and subscribers that are interested in receiving the aggregate bbo and last sale information from the exchanges as part of a single data feed the exchanges assert that the bats one feed can be used by industry professionals and retail investors looking for a cost effective easytoadminister high quality market data product with the characteristics of the bats one feed the exchanges also assert that the bats one feed would help protect a free and open market by providing vendors and subscribers additional choices in receiving this type of market data thus promoting competition and innovation with respect to latency the exchanges have represented that the path for distribution by the exchanges of bats one feed would not be faster than the path for distribution that would be used by a vendor to distribute an independently created a bats onelike product accordingly the exchanges have stated the proposed bats one data feed is a data product that a competing vendor could create and sell without being in a disadvantaged position relative to the exchange in recognition that the exchanges are the source of their own market data and affiliated with one another the exchanges have represented that the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed bats one feed is available to other vendors specifically the exchanges have represented that they would use the following data feeds to create the proposed bats one feed each of which is available to other vendors the edgebook depth feed for edgx the edgebook depth feed for edga the byx pitch feed and the bats pitch feed the exchanges have also represented that they will continue to make available these individual underlying feeds and that as a result the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed bats one feed is the same as the source available to competing vendors the exchanges have also made the following representations regarding the latency of the bats one feed and any consolidated feed to be offered by a competing vendor in order to create the bats one feed the system creating and supporting the bats one feed would need to receive the individual data feeds from each exchange and in turn aggregate and summarize that data to create the bats one feed and then distribute it to end users this is the same process a competing vendor would undergo should it create a market data product similar to the bats one feed to distribute to its end users in addition a competing vendor could locate its servers in the same facilities as the system creating and supporting the bats one feed and could therefore receive the individual data feeds from each exchange at the same time as the system creating and supporting the bats one feed thus the exchanges have stated that they would not have any unfair advantage over competing vendors with respect to obtaining data from the individual exchanges because the technology supporting the bats one feed would similarly need to obtain the underlying data feeds and because this connection would be on a level playing field with a competing vendor located at the same facility as the exchanges likewise the bats one data feed would not have a speed advantage visàvis competing vendors with respect to access to end user customers whether those end users are also located in the same data center or not with regard to cost the exchanges have represented that they will file a separate rule filing with the commission to establish fees for bats one feed and that these fees would be designed to ensure that vendors could compete with the exchanges by creating a similar product to ensure a vendor can compete with the exchanges by creating the same product as the bats one feed and selling it to their clients the exchanges have also represented that they would charge their clients for the bats one feed an amount that is no less than the cost to a market data vendor to obtain all the underlying feeds plus an amount to be determined that would reflect the value of the aggregation and consolidation function thus the pricing for the bats one feed would enable a vendor to receive the underlying data feeds and offer a similar product on a competitive basis and with no pricing disadvantage relative to the exchanges implementation date the exchanges have represented that they anticipate making the bats one feed available as soon as practicable after approval of the proposed rule changes by the commission and the effectiveness of rule filings to establish the fees for the bats one feed iii summary of comments as noted above the commission received three comment letters on previous versions of the proposed changes filed by some of the exchanges in their current proposals the exchanges have responded to the points raised by these commenters the three commenters generally oppose the proposed bats one feed the shatto letter expressed general concerns about the transparency of order flow information to regulators the themis letter expressed objections to the proposed bats one feed on the grounds that it would introduce a new proprietary data feed and expressed concerns generally about the complexity arising from the proliferation of new data technologies in their response to the commenters the exchanges argued that the themis letter and shatto letter are not responsive to the issues raised in the proposal or are aimed at existing elements of us market structure that have been previously approved by the commission the sifma letter primarily argues that the fees for the proposed bats one feed do not meet the requirements of the act including the requirement that such fees be “fair and reasonable” under section acc of the act sifma also contends that bats has circumvented the requirement to receive commission approval for this product by offering and marketing the bats one feed since august   in their response to the sifma letter the exchanges noted that the thrust of the sifma letter is aimed at the initially proposed fees which have now been removed from the proposed rule changes and are to be filed with the commission via separate rule filings start printed page the exchanges also noted that while the sifma letter correctly states that bats has marketed the bats one feed since august   the sifma letter incorrectly asserts that bats has offered the bats one feed since that same date the exchanges have represented that all of their marketing materials have included statements that the bats one feeds implementation was pending to commission approval and at no point have the exchanges offered the bats one product for any use other than for testing and certification iv discussion and commission findings after carefully considering the proposals and the comments submitted the commission finds that the proposed rule changes as modified by amendments nos  and  are consistent with the requirements of the act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges in particular the commission finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with the requirements of section acc of the act  and with rule a of regulation nms thereunder which requires that any national securities exchange national securities association broker or dealer that distributes information with respect to quotations for or transactions in an nms stock to a securities information processor broker dealer or other persons shall do so on terms that are not unreasonably discriminatory the commission also finds that the proposed rule changes are consistent with section b of the act which requires that the rules of an exchange be designed to promote just and equitable principles of trade remove impediments to and perfect the mechanisms of a free and open market and a national market system and in general to protect investors and the public interest and section b of the act which requires that the rules of an exchange not impose any burden on competition that is not necessary or appropriate in furtherance of the purposes of the act the commission notes that to create the bats one feed the exchanges would use underlying data feeds that belong to the exchanges the edgebook depth feed for edgx the edgebook depth feed for edga the byx pitch feed and the bats pitch feed accordingly the commissions review of the exchanges proposals has focused in particular on whether the proposals would result in affiliated exchanges—which are separate selfregulatory organizations under the act—making their data products or services available to one another at terms eg content pricing or latency that are more favorable than those available to unaffiliated market participants the exchanges have represented that the bats one feed would be created using underlying data feeds that are available for subscription by vendors in recognition that the exchanges are the source of their own market data and that they are affiliated with one another the exchanges have also represented that they will continue to make available all of the individual underlying feeds and that the source of the market data they would use to create the proposed bats one feed is the same as the source available to competing vendors with respect to latency the exchanges have represented that competing vendors could locate their servers in the same facilities as the system creating and supporting the bats one feed and therefore could receive the underlying data feeds at the same time as the system creating and supporting the bats one feed therefore the exchanges have contended that a competing vendor could obtain the underlying data feeds from the exchanges on the same latency basis as the system that would be performing the aggregation and consolidation of the proposed bats one feed and could provide the same kind of product to its customers with the same latency they could achieve by purchasing the bats one feed from the exchanges the exchanges have also represented that they have designed the bats one feed so that they would have no advantages over a competing vendor with respect to the speed of access to the underlying feeds with respect to pricing although specific fees to be charged for the bats one feed are not part of the proposed rule changes the exchanges have represented that they will assess a fee that is at least equal to the aggregate cost of the underlying feeds ie at least as much as the cost to a vendor of subscribing to each of the underlying data feeds plus an additional amount to be determined that would reflect the value of the aggregation and consolidation function performed to create the bats one feed based on the exchanges representations with respect to the content latency and pricing of the bats one feed—which are central to the commissions analysis of the proposal—the commission finds that the exchanges proposals are consistent with the act and the rules and regulations thereunder applicable to national securities exchanges the commission believes that these representations are designed to ensure that bats byx edga and edgx which are separate selfregulatory organizations do not because of their relationship as affiliates offer one another products or services on a more favorable basis than that available to other competing market participants for the foregoing reasons the commission finds that the proposed rule changes as amended are consistent with section acc of the act and rule a of regulation nms start printed page thereunder and sections b and b of the act v accelerated approval of proposed rule changes as modified by amendments no  the amendments no  revised the proposed rule changes to i clarify how the bats one feed would be created ii make additional clarifying statements with respect to the latency and cost of the bats one feed and iii bring together the discussion of key aspects of the description of the proposal in the same section accordingly the commission does not believe that the amendments no  raises any novel regulatory issues and therefore finds that good cause exists to approve the proposals as modified by amendments nos  and  on an accelerated basis vi solicitation of comments interested persons are invited to submit written data views and arguments concerning the foregoing including whether amendments no  to the proposed rule changes are consistent with the act comments may be submitted by any of the following methods electronic comments use the commissions internet comment form httpwwwsecgovrulessroshtml or send an email to
