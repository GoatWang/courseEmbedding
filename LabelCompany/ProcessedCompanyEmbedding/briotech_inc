cause    mad    cow    chronic    wasting    and    creutzfeldt–jakob    disease    and    are    now implicated in alzheimer’s and other chronic brain diseases woodinville   wash   september         briotech   inc   today   announced   that   a study   published   in   the   current   issue   of   plos   pathogens       proves   that   briotech’s   unique formulation   of   pure   hypochlorous   acid   hocl   inactivates   infectious   proteins   known as prions that cause chronic brain diseases in humans and animals  investigators   at   the   us   national   institute   of   allergy   and   infectious   diseases   niaid rocky   mountain   laboratories   made   the   discovery   in   collaboration   with   researchers   at the    university    of    washington    uw    bothell    uw    seattle    the    university    of    verona italy   and   briotech   inc   their      findings   demonstrate   that   briotech’s   patentpending solution   briohocl tm    quickly   and   safely   destroys   prions   the   most   resistant   infectious agents known to medical science hocl   is   made   naturally   in   human   white   blood   cells   as   a   key   part   of   the   body’s   internal defense   system   it   works   as   the   first   line   of   defense   at   wound   sites   to   fight   infection briotech’s   proprietary   electrochemical   activation   eca   technology   enables   large scale     production     of     this     powerful     natural     compound     for     use     in     consumer     and professional healthcare settings “we’ve   been   able   to   synthesize   the   same   pure   substance   that   the   body   creates   to defend   itself   as   a   new   weapon   in   the   fight   against   infectious   disease   and   it’s   a   game changer   for   human   health”   said   dan   terry   founder   and   ceo   of   briotech   “with   broad adoption   of   briohocl tm    we   can   help   stop   the   spread   of   many   infectious   diseases even   those   caused   by   the   most   highly   resistant   agents   ever   discovered — prions — and use   the   product   to   save   lives   and   improve   the   health   of   entire   communities   around   the world    we’re    excited    to    have    this    research    published    in    plos    pathogens     and    look forward   to   our   continued   collaboration   with   the   nih   on   the   effects   of   briohocl tm    on emerging infectious pathogens that threaten global health and safety” destroying prions prions    are    abnormal    misfolded    body    proteins    that    go    out    of    control    and    begin    to multiply   themselves   spreading   throughout   the   body   and   invading   the   brain      prions are   most   commonly   transmitted   orally   but   can   also   contaminate   medical   and   surgical instruments   transplanted   tissues   and   equipment   used   in   food   processing   a   new   fast convenient   and   safe   method   for   decontamination   of   medical   instruments   surfaces and     tissues — by     simple     immersion     in     an     aqueous     solution     of     briotech’s     pure briohocl tm — can   overcome   a   critically   important   deficiency   in   infection   control   today it   can   mitigate   risks   and   limit   liabilities   related   to   healthcare   procedures   and   hospital acquired diseases prion   diseases   are   most   widely   known   as   the   cause   of   mad   cow   disease   bse   prions also   cause   creutzfeldtjakob   disease   cjd   in   humans   a   fatal   dementia   with   a   long incubation   period   recently   research   has   shown   that   most   other   chronic   degenerative diseases   that   lead   to   dementia   including   alzheimer’s   result   from   prions   currently untreatable      and      inevitably      fatal      controversy      swirls      around      their      possible transmissibility   as   referenced   in   nature     naturecomnewstheredhotdebateabout transmissiblealzheimers  prions    are    uniquely    resistant    to    the    disinfection    and    sterilization    procedures    in common    use    in    healthcare    practice    today    extreme    measures    are    needed    current prion   decontamination   protocols   are   hazardous   to   people   damaging   to   instruments and     surfaces     and     therefore     impractical     for     transmission     control     “briotech     has developed   an   enabling   technology   one   that   offers   for   the   first   time   a   practical   and   safe way   of   destroying   infectious   prions   the   disease   agents   at   the   very   top   of   the   food chain   when   it   comes   to   resistance   to   disinfection   measures”   said   jeff   williams   phd bvsc   chief   scientific   officer   at   briotech   “we   believe   we’ve   just   exposed   the   tip   of   the iceberg   when   it   comes   to   revealing   the   full   potential   of   the   pure   hocl   in   controlling and   preventing   many   transmissible   diseases   that’s   so   important   today   when   rampant antibiotic    resistance    is    challenging    established    approaches    to    infectious    disease management   all   over   the   world   the   discovery   reported   in   plos   pathogens    has   opened new   avenues   for   researchers   to   explore   in   understanding   the   relationship   between the   hocl   made   in   the   brain   its   possible   involvement   in   prion   inactivation   there   and the   disease   processes   that   lead   to   dementia   understanding   those   processes   is   one   of the most urgent priorities facing biomedical science at this time” how it works briohocl tm     is    easy    to    handle    safe    for    both    users    and    treated    surfaces    and    is environmentally   safe   pure   hocl      used   in   the   plos   pathogens    report   is   reliably   stable in    its    formulation    and    powerfully    effective    against    a    wide    range    of    conventional microbial    disease    agents    the    solution    can    be    applied    directly    to    skin    and    mucous membranes   hard   surfaces   instruments   or   safely   aerosolized   to   decontaminate   entire rooms briotech

september         briotech   inc today   announced   that   a   study   published   in   the   current   issue of   plos   pathogens       proves   that   briotech’s   unique   formulation of     pure     hypochlorous     acid     hocl     inactivates     infectious proteins   known   as   prions   that   cause   chronic   brain   diseases in humans and animals  investigators    at    the    us    national    institute    of    allergy    and infectious    diseases    niaid    rocky    mountain    laboratories made   the   discovery   in   collaboration   with   researchers   at   the university      of      washington      uw      bothell      uw      seattle            the    university    of    verona    italy    and    briotech    inc    their findings       demonstrate       that       briotech’s       patentpending solution   briohocl tm    quickly   and   safely   destroys   prions   the most resistant infectious agents known to medical science hocl    is    made    naturally    in    human    white    blood    cells    as    a                key   part   of   the   body’s   internal   defense   system   it   works   as the    first    line    of    defense    at

compound    for    use    in    consumer    and    professional healthcare settings “we’ve    been    able    to    synthesize    the    same    pure    substance          that   the   body   creates   to   defend   itself   as   a   new   weapon   in   the fight   against   infectious   disease   and   it’s   a   game   changer   for human   health”   said   dan   terry   founder   and   ceo   of   briotech “with   broad   adoption   of   briohocl tm    we   can   help   stop   the spread   of   many   infectious   diseases   even   those   caused   by   the most    highly    resistant    agents    ever    discovered — prions — and use   the   product   to   save   lives   and   improve   the   health   of   entire communities    around    the    world    we’re    excited    to    have    this research   published   in   plos   pathogens    and   look   forward   to our   continued   collaboration   with   the   nih   on   the   effects   of briohocl tm    on   emerging   infectious   pathogens   that   threaten global health and safety” destroying prions prions    are    abnormal    misfolded    body    proteins    that    go    out                of     control     and     begin     to     multiply     themselves     spreading throughout   the   body   and   invading   the   brain      prions   are   most commonly     transmitted     orally     but     can     also     contaminate medical   and   surgical   instruments   transplanted   tissues   and equipment   used   in   food   processing         a   new   fast   convenient and       safe       method       for       decontamination       of       medical instruments   surfaces   and   tissues — by   simple   immersion   in an    aqueous    solution    of    briotech’s    pure    briohocl tm — can overcome     a     critically     important     deficiency     in     infection control   today   it   can   mitigate   risks   and   limit   liabilities   related to healthcare procedures and hospital acquired diseases prion   diseases   are   most   widely   known   as   the   cause   of   mad cow    disease    bse    prions    also    cause    creutzfeldtjakob disease    cjd    in    humans    a    fatal    dementia    with    a    long incubation   period   recently   research   has   shown   that   most other   chronic   degenerative   diseases   that   lead   to   dementia including

a commitment to our customers that has made us the vanguard of the industry for over  years as a result of our success bio tech now covers the continental united states and canada creating innovative disciplines for our treatment program at home and abroad bio tech has the rd assets personnel and equipment to research and develop innovative new solutions previously untried in the industry and to ramp up wherever new solutions are needed and business requirements dictate paraffin asphaltene emulsion scale corrosion srbapb algae refineries meor water quality bioremediation the microorganisms that are utilized in bio techs paraffin control products are chosen for their ability to use hydrocarbons specifically alkanes as their sole carbon source for growth metabolizing these hydrocarbons c through c results in the microbial �cracking� of longchain molecules into shortchain compounds metabolic products produced by the microorganisms such as ketones alcohols organic acids and aldehydes function similarly to oilfield chemicals used as wax dispersants and pour point depressants the microbial cracking in conjunction with the secretion of these metabolic products result in reduced viscosity increased api gravity reduced cloud point and reduced pour point the facultative anaerobic microbes used to treat asphaltenes are selected by bio tech for their acute biosurfactantproducing properties these biosurfactants control select asphaltenes enhance flow properties of asphaltic oils and prevent paraffin deposition the microbes break apart organic deposits in perfs pumps and tubing we also offer a natural solvent used in conjunction with our microbial blends that enhances the process of asphaltene elimination this organic dispersant removes and bioremediates hydrocarbons by decreasing the surface tension thus forming microscopic spherical droplets which are quickly bioremediated by the bacteria due to their increased surface area digestion begins upon application and continues after the product is washed from surfaces bio techs microbes can demulsify both oilinwater and waterinoil emulsions the activity is related to the bacterial cell acting as a wetting bridge between droplets in the continuous phase the various products of bacterial metabolism such as biosurfactants organic acids and alcohols also contribute to the demulsification process bio techs marinebased facultative anaerobic microbes are very efficient at preventing scale formation our microbes produce various substances that mimic many of the properties of scale inhibitors organic acids produced by the microbes act as chelating agents for divalent cations such as calcium iron magnesium and barium the microbes also produce extra cellular substances such as polysaccharides polyphosphates lipopolysaccharides phospholipids glycolipids and proteins that have chelating antiprecipitation filming and biosurfactant activities these substances bind cations restricting their capacity to form mineral deposits and also coat surfaces to prevent nucleation sites for potential scale growth the marinebased facultative anaerobic microbes utilized in bio techs corrosion control products protect the formation face as well as downhole and surface equipment from corrosion this is achieved through the process of sequestering filming and removing solids that cause underdeposit corrosion byproducts produced by these microorganisms such as organic acids and ketones are polarizing agents that inhibit the corrosion process these filming agents act as passivating agents to control corrosion of metal surfaces by coating passivating surfaces the interaction between corrosive compounds like carbonic acids and sulfides is mitigated and the corrosive process is reduced this is accomplished by neutralizing the cathodic portion of the metal breaking the �circuit� of the corrosion cell bio techs proprietary microbial cultures in oilfield applications create a decrease in the number and activity of sulfate reducing bacteria srb and acid producing bacteria apb through the process of biocompetitive exclusion bio techs microbes compete with srbapb for nutrients in the aqueous environment thus starving out these harmful bacteria our microbes outcompete the srbapb for nutrients in the aqueous environment ie iron and small molecule fatty acids overwhelming them and reducing their populations microbially induced corrosion mic is corrosion caused or promoted by microorganisms known as chemoautotrophs chemoautotrophs use inorganic compounds such as sulfate to survive to derive their energy bio tech products are chemoheterotrophs which use organic compounds to survive bio techs microbes do not respire or metabolize sulphates therefore we do not share them as an energy source our microbes dramatically reduce the nutrient load of the water outcompeting other microbes and the algae for the existing food sources bio tech uses a wide range water clarifying microbial blend containing a proprietary combination of natural facultative anaerobic species selected for their heavy biosurfactantsbyproducts production byproducts such as alcohols ketones organic acids and biosurfactants inhibit a wide range of water borne scale such as calcium carbonate and sulfate scales as well as iron sulfide through their metabolic processes chelation and sequestering bio techs microbes are ideal for achieving tertiary recovery microbes degrade skin damage increasing fluid entry injectivity into the reservoir by keeping ions in suspension reservoir rock acts as a bioreactor to address compounds released from formations microbial activity lowers injection pressures and increases injection rates microbial activity and bio surfactants lower the interfacial tension between the water and oil interface releasing residual oil mobility ratio is improved wettability driven towards strongly water wet residual oil is imbibed into pore channels resulting in enhanced ultimate oil recovery meor bio tech offers the industrial community an environmentally safe and cost effective method for the cleanup of contaminated andor hazardous wastes our naturally

little more normal a little more normal share tweet link email print “my entire world sort of clicked off i didnt hear anything i didnt see anything and the only thing that i could think of was im going to be dead in six months” this is james looking back at  the year the dow closed above  the hubble space telescope was turned on and james was diagnosed with hiv “im a survivor of domestic violence child molestation depression” he says with some pride even so james knew he was about to enter the toughest fight of his life  after all while hivaids awareness was still relatively new in  james was seeing growing evidence of something much bigger “first there would be the fever and then there was the immense weight loss along with the kaposi’s sarcoma lesions that would appear on the body” james says “a person would die and sometimes it would happen over a week”  james also explained that since doctors had just begun researching hiv there were almost no treatment options available “the medication at the time was fairly nonexistent” he recalls of the side effects he says “the medication that they had at the time was even worse than the disease itself”  thanks to years of investment and hard work by america’s biopharmaceutical companies and other health care stakeholders things have changed dramatically – and patients likes james who can look back  years in neardisbelief are proof  brian a researcher developing hivaids medications for nearly  years is astounded by how far treatment has come “the progress is actually quite miraculous” he says “in the early days the goal was just keeping patients alive as long as possible  resistance was rampant and the regimens were not tolerable for many patients but the alternative was death  frankly both options were horrible  fast forward  years and now we have several onepill onceaday treatment options for patients and their physicians to choose from”   “they can live a normal life – a healthy successful life”  today the outlook has never been more promising with more than  medicines and vaccines in development to treat prevent or help with the disease impact of hivaids  as brian explains treatment is no longer simply about survival but enabling individuals to regain the quality of life they once had “it is extremely motivating when we hear that a physician has a patient who is benefiting that the new medicines weve brought forward have allowed the patient to regain weight reverse the progression of their disease and essentially have a new life ahead of them” james understands the sentiment personally – and recognizes the network that helped him back “my family my doctors who were trying to make sure that i got the right medications to keep me going” he says “the programs that helped me find housing sent me back to school and helped me to better myself”   “i have a great doctor most of doctors that ive had have been very good and this last one has been just fantastic  we have gotten me to a point now where my numbers are just fantastic”  james’s experience motivated him to help others he began volunteering at san francisco city hall by taking calls helping around the office and any job in between this volunteer work led to hiv community activism – and a run for office while he may not have won his election james continued to give back to others providing the same kind of support he is so thankful to have received  james recently lost his partner to aids and his brother to cancer still he knew he had to keep moving forward  “the thing that gives me hope is just being able to wake up every day” he says “i will get back up”  brian knows there’s still a long way to go “there are people who are alive today because of the work that we do” he acknowledges “the work is often very quiet very slow moving very frustrating but over time it has a major impact on thousands of people” and brian sees even greater hope ahead “i dont take no for an answer” he says “the power of imagination and innovation is incredible and i see it every day in the eyes of my colleagues”  “science is real and the key to solving problems we just need to find the right people to bring together collaborate and find a solution”   james is grateful for brian’s – and many other researchers’ – tenacity “im not sure how to explain it any better” he says “than it just makes me feel a little more normal” related news living with hiv eric’s journey how one patient’s journey is educating and inspiring others to get tested for hiv read more do not go gentle

granted we cannot take progress for granted share tweet link email print we are in a new era of medical discovery and have the potential to revolutionize the treatment of costly and debilitating diseases but we must not take this progress for granted  to ensure medical innovation continues for the benefit of patients we need public policies that reward the investment and time it takes to develop lifesaving treatments and cures in order to enhance competition and improve affordability for patients our country must     make medicines more affordable by rewarding value  today america’s biopharmaceutical companies are partnering with health insurers to improve how we pay for medicines prices for medicines may vary based on how well an individual responds to treatment or agreements may lower copays if patients achieve better health outcomes while these partnerships will vary they are helping to ensure we get the right medicine to the right patient at the right time – improving care and lowering costs across the health care system yet outdated regulations prevent wider use of these new payment arrangements  government rules and regulations should not prevent the private sector from developing better ways to pay for medicines rather we must ensure health plans can cover more of the newest medicines and give patients more choices – improving care and lowering health care costs for americans     ensure patients get the best deal on medicines america’s biopharmaceutical companies often negotiate large rebates for prescription medicines with insurers and pharmacy benefit managers pbms those rebates are growing every year and now exceed  billion per year – helping to hold down health care costs for patients and taxpayers but we can do more to ensure patients benefit directly from these negotiated savings and put an end to an unfair practice that requires patients to buy medicines at full price even when their insurers get a rebate in fact patients with large deductibles can end up paying more than their insurer pays for their medicine  that’s wrong health insurance companies should share with patients the discounts they receive this could lower outofpocket costs for some patients by hundreds – if not thousands – of dollars every year     make new breakthroughs accessible and promote competition we need to make it make it easier for patients to get access to breakthrough medicines it simply takes too long to get new medicines approved – over  years and over one billion dollars on average  outdated regulations and approaches for evaluating drugs can slow things down even more to get medicines approved faster while ensuring safety we need to modernize the fda with new technologies and expertise to keep up with st century science modernizing the fda will bring down the time and cost of developing new medicines which will bring medicines to patients faster and enhance competition in the market we also need to reduce the backlog of applications for generic medicines at the us food and drug administration fda  this will ensure that patients benefit as less expensive generic medicines replace higher cost treatments that have lost patent protection  at the same time we must avoid policies that deter risktaking or siphon funding away from the research and development of new medicines for patients learn more about our plan
