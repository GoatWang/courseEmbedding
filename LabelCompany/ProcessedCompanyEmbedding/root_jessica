whether i’m in the office or with my kids all day i need products that really work and if i have a spontaneous date night i need products that smell good and can quickly transform me from day to night because i have so many sensitivities they also can’t have synthetic fragrances and on busy days i need products that hold a style all day from the office to photo shoots to the red carpet without making me compromise between looking and feeling good” formulating her the line wasn’t easy “it’s incredibly difficult to formulate with botanical ingredients and get the performance you expect from conventional ingredients it took us a long time to get the formula to be exactly what i had envisioned i believe that what we use on our hair is equally as important as what we put onto our skin and i

week jessica alba introduced the world to what might be the cutest diapers ever the new honest company baby basics are anything but basic decorated with images of macarons and the eiffel tower the diapers could actually be called chic but i didnt attend the launch event for these products because im on the baby beat i went because i wanted to grill cofounder jessica alba about every aspect of her beauty routine what i ended up with however was the inside scoop on the companys forthcoming line of honest beauty hair products—for grownups of coursewhen i asked alba if this was on the record—it was the first i was hearing about it—she said i think people know were coming out with hair care she went on to list seasalt spray conditioning milk hair oil and root lift as the products shes been experimenting with and loving from the lineyou may also likehairthe best haircare routine according to your hair concernhairshould i shave my head to make my hair grow back healthieras for

like a mist she said she recently put them all to the test at the dior show at paris fashion week and for the vanity fair oscar party the hairdresser used our root lift and all the other products and it held the whole time they really work they really hold and they smell amazing as with most of the other scents in the line the fragrances of the hair products are inspired by albas favorite vacation spots and the familiar scents of her childhoodi tried digging for more information but thats all she would divulge when i reached out to her team for a comment they could only confirm that the line
