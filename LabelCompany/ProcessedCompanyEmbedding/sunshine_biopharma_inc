street th floor montreal quebec ha t canada phone    interview conducted by lynn fosse senior editor ceocfointerviewscom published  march   ceocfo dr slilaty what is your main focus at sunshine biopharma dr slilaty sunshine biopharma is focused on the research development and commercialization of drugs for the treatment of various forms of cancer ceocfo what kind of drug are you working on and what is different about it dr slilaty at present our lead compound is a topoisomerase ii inhibitor  topoisomerase ii is one of the most important targets for treating aggressive cancer ceocfo how are you attacking the problem dr slilaty topoisomerase ii is an enzyme that aggressive cancer cells make too much of when the cell is able to make a lot of the topoisomerase ii enzyme it becomes able to proliferate and metastasize so if you can inhibit or destroy the activity of topoisomerase ii you would then be able to prevent cancer cells from spreading ceocfo are there other treatments now or is this a new way of looking at the problem dr slilaty there are treatments there is a drug that is considered to be a topoisomerase ii inhibitor but it actually doesnt work as such our drug advaa is ten times more effective than any drug on the market for treating aggressive cancer ceocfo where are you in the process of development dr slilaty we have done a lot of preclinical testing and we are now positioned to begin doing animal studies and immediately after begin stage i clinical trials ceocfo is there a particular type of cancer that you are targeting first and why dr slilaty initially we are working on the socalled multidrug resistant breast cancer in a certain group of breast cancer patients as well as over time in a lot of cancer patients the tumor becomes resistant to all treatment and at that point there is not much to do by way of existing therapy our drug works extremely well in killing multidrug resistant breast cancer cells that is our first indication ceocfo how did you come about the drug dr slilaty we developed it ourselves in collaboration with a government research lab in france ceocfo where is testing being done dr slilaty we have done testing in france and now we are carrying out testing at the binghamton university in new york ceocfo what is the financial picture like for sunshine biopharma dr slilaty we are in good shape we have sufficient funds to operate and we are planning to apply for support through granting agencies in the us through our collaboration with binghamton university ceocfo has the medical community started to pay attention or is it a bit early for that dr slilaty it is a bit early because we have not publicized what we have yet ceocfo are you looking to partner or at what point would you perhaps go from doing it on your own to adding some other sources dr slilaty we imagine that at the end of phase i once we publish the results of human trials we expect that large pharmaceutical companies will want to probably step in and buy it from us at that point ceocfo are there other indications that you are considering dr slilaty another indication we are looking to study is prostate cancer and as with breast cancer our drug has proven to be very effective in treating aggressive forms of prostate cancer that would be a second indication ceocfo is here a similarity between the two types of cancer dr slilaty the similarity is that different types of cancer cells make different amounts of this topoisomerase ii enzyme the more topoisomerase ii the cell makes the more effective our drug is at killing that cell what that means is when prostate cancer become metastatic which is when the cell starts making a lot of topoisomerase ii is when our drug becomes very effective in treating that cancer there are other types of cancer like small cell lung cancer where initially or right at the point of diagnosis of this type of cancer the cell is already making a lot of topoisomerase ii and it is very aggressive at the onset in fact patients that are diagnosed with small cell lung cancer only have three to six months to live we have already shown in the lab that our drug works extremely well in terms of killing this type of lung cancer cells ceocfo what is the timetable dr slilaty we believe that we will be able to begin the human trials optimistically about twelve months from now but more realistically within the next eighteen months ceocfo why should potential investors choose sunshine biopharma out of the crowd dr slilaty our technology is unique we are the only company that has a topoisomerase ii inhibitor we have two patents covering our lead compound and our technology so from the intellectual property side we are very well protected and no one can enter the area we are in we are not developing anything that is a socalled metoo drug our technology is unique ceocfo so there is a potential real breakthrough here dr slilaty absolutely if our drug proves to do in humans exactly what we think it will be worth over a billion dollars ceocfo final thoughts what should people remember most when they read about sunshine biopharma dr slilaty we are a very serious group of oncologists who are trying to provide therapy to save lives and bring value to our shareholders disclaimers any reproduction or further distribution of this article without the express written consent of ceocfointerviewscom is prohibited   topoisomerase ii is an enzyme that aggressive cancer cells make too much of when the cell is able to make a lot of the topoisomerase ii enzyme it becomes able to proliferate and metastasize so if you can inhibit or destroy the activity of topoisomerase ii you would then be able to prevent cancer cells from spreading  dr steve n slilaty     ceocfointerviewscom
