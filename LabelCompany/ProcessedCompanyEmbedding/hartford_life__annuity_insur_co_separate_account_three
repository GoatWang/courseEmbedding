or both  at the end of the accumulation period the contract owner elects whether to receive a “lumb sum” payment of the contracts accumulated value or to receive that value under one of several other payment options that hartford offers while some of these payment options provide payments for a period that includes the life of an “annuitant” others do not  the contracts incorporate many other features including several “death benefit” options partial and full surrender rights transfer privileges and other optional rider benefits  in addition to any charges associated with the underlying mutual funds the charges under the contracts are as follows a contingent deferred sales charge “cdsc” may be assessed against each premium payment withdrawn or surrendered from a contract the length of time from receipt of the premium payment to the time of withdrawal or surrender determines the amount of the cdsc during the first seven contract years withdrawals or surrenders are deemed to be withdrawn first from premiums paid in the order in which such premiums were received and then from earnings after the seventh contract year all withdrawals or surrenders are deemed to be withdrawn first from earnings then from premium payments in the order in which such premiums were received the cdsc is applied to premiums withdrawn in the percentage shown in the following table length of time in years from premium paymentsurrender charge percent or more each contract year an amount equal to a specific percentage of total premium payments paid as of the date of the withdrawal “annual withdrawal amount” may be withdrawn without being subject to any otherwise applicable cdsc the annual withdrawal amount under a contract is currently  an annual contract maintenance charge of  is assessed on each contract anniversary date or when applicable the date on which the contract is fully surrendered this fee will be waived if the contracts account value exceeds  on the contracts anniversary date an administrative charge is assessed on a daily basis at an annualized rate of  of the contracts account value invested in the separate accounts a mortality and expense risk charge is assessed on a daily basis at an annualized rate of  of the contracts account value invested in the separate accounts an optional death benefit rider is available for an additional charge assessed on a daily basis at an annualized rate of  of the contracts account value invested in the separate accounts a charge corresponding to any applicable state premium taxes  hartford now proposes to offer a longevity reward rider the “lrr” to owners of certain existing contracts the additional benefits under the lrr include a reduced mortality and expense risk charge assessed on a daily basis at an annualized rate of  of a contracts account value invested in the separate accounts and a new cdc schedule with a lower maximum percentage  and of shorter duration  years applies to the withdrawal or surrender of any premium payments made after the lrr is added to the contract  after the lrr is added to a contract “rider date” a new fiveyear cdsc schedule “new schedule” applies to all withdrawals or surrenders made after the rider date and supplants the original cdsc schedules for the contacts under the new schedule withdrawals or surrenders made during the first five years from the rider date are taken first from premiums paid in the order such premiums were received and then from earnings after the fifth year from the rider date all withdrawals or surrenders are taken first from earnings then from premium payments in the order such payments were received  the new schedule applies to all premium payments withdrawn or surrendered whether made before or after the rider date as shown in the following table for premium payments made after the rider date the fiveyear period runs from the date of that premium payments for premium payments made before the rider date the fiveyear period runs from the rider date length of time in years from premium paymentsurrender charge percent  the same exceptions that apply to the contracts basic cdsc will also apply to the new schedule specifically no cdsc will be imposed a at the time an annuity payment option commences b upon the death of a contract owner or annuitant c upon amounts withdrawn to satisfy any applicable minimum distribution requirements under the internal revenue code or d for amounts withdrawn which are within the limits of the annual withdrawal amount the annual withdrawal amount is currently   if withdrawn or surrendered after the rider date premium payments made before the rider date are subject to a cdsc for an additional five years even if they were no longer subject to a cdsc under the contracts for example if the lrr were purchased in the eighth contract year the initial premium would no longer be subject to a cdsc under the contract however upon purchase of the lrr the initial premium becomes subject to a cdsc for five years after the rider date moreover until withdrawals or surrenders are taken first from “earnings” and then from premiums ie five years after the rider date more of the amount withdrawn or surrendered may be subject to a cdsc that would be the case under contracts without the lrr because the surrender is deemed to be withdrawn first from premiums and then from earnings  except for the new schedule the lrr will not result in any increase in or imposition of any charge except for the potential application of the new schedule to premium made before the rider date to which no cdsc would apply under the contracts absent the lrr every aspect of a contract will be at least as favorable after the lrr is added as it was before  further adding the lrr to a contract will have no adverse tax consequences to contract owners  the lrr will only be available to contract owners who a have maintained their contracts for at least seven years and either b have not start printed page made any premium payments within the previous two years or c have a cdsc less than or equal to two percent of current contract value for those contract owners electing the lrr who made premium payments prior to the rider date that remain subject to a cdsc on the rider date that charge will be waived and the new schedule will apply contract owners will not be permitted to elect for the lrr to apply to part of a contract and not to the rest any election of the lrr must apply to the whole contract  after an initial notification of the offer in prospectuses for the contracts or other communication to contract owners the lrr will be offered by providing eligible owners who express an interest in learning the details of the offer in addition to such prospectus a separate document explaining the offer “the offering document”  the offering document will advise contract owners that the offer is specifically designed for those contract owners who intend to continue to hold their contracts as longterm investment vehicles the offering document will state that the offer is not intended for all contract owners and that it is not appropriate for any contract owner who anticipates surrendering all or a significant part of his or her contract within the next five years the offering document will encourage contract owners to carefully evaluate their personal financial situation when deciding whether to accept or reject the offer of the lrr in addition the offering document will explain that the new schedule will not apply to amounts withdrawn in a contract year that do not exceed the annual withdrawal amount or to premium payments maintained until expiration of the new schedule in this regard the offering document will state in plain english that if a significant amount of the contracts value is surrendered or withdrawn during the five years following the rider date a the lrrs benefits may be more than offset by the new schedule and b a contract owner may be worse off than if he or she had rejected the offer  to accept the lrr an owner must complete an election form this election form will include the disclosure set forth in condition no  under “conditions” below applicants legal analysis  section a of the act makes it unlawful for any registered openend company or any principal underwriter for such a company to make or cause to be made an offer to the holder of a security of such company or of any other openend investment company to exchange that security for a security in the same or another such company on any basis other than the relative net asset values of the respective securities unless the terms of the offer have first been submitted to and approved by the commission  section c of the act in pertinent part effectively requires that any offer of exchange of the securities of a registered unit investment trust for the securities of any other investment company be approved by the commission regardless of the basis of the exchange  congress enacted section  to prevent “switching” ie “the practice of inducing security holders of one investment company to exchange their securities for those of a different investment company ‘solely for the purpose of exacting additional selling charges’ ” according to the commission “investors in ‘fixed trusts’ now known as unit investment trusts were found to be particularly vulnerable to switching operations in order to earn another sales commission a uit sponsor would often pressure unit holders into exchanging their units for those of another of the sponsors trusts”  applicants assert that the lrr would not involve “switching” rather the purpose of the lrr as with other optional riders is to enable contract owners to enhance their contracts without having to purchase a new variable annuity contract in addition because the lrr offers benefits to contract owners as described above applicants believe it cannot fairly be argued that the lrrs sole purpose is to exact additional selling charges or any other type of charge  further applicants assert that election of the lrr will not result in any duplicative charges and that the limited cdsc provided under the lrr is reasonable in relation to the benefits that the rider provides and the costs that applicants will incur in providing those benefits applicants represent that those costs will include costs of developing and administering the lrr the direct dollar costs of the charges that will be waived or reduced the benefits that will be paid under the lrr and the costs of distributing the lrr to contract owners and educating them about it  applicants note that the new schedule imposes a lower maximum cdsc and is shorter in duration than the schedules under the contracts without the lrr if the contract owner makes no surrenders during the five years after the rider date there is no possibility that a cdsc will be deducted that exceeds what would have been deducted absent the lrr moreover even if premium payments are withdrawn during that fiveyear period the new schedule will apply only if the amount withdrawn exceeds the annual withdrawal amount  applicants argue that the lrr will be offered only to contract owners who already have demonstrated an ability to maintain their contracts for substantial periods of time the income taxes that are generally payable when earnings are withdrawn from a contract as well as the potential tax penalties that may apply to withdrawals made prior to an owner reaching age  serve as additional motivations that encourage most owners to hold their contracts for a substantial number of years any cdsc will be waived with respect to any amounts necessary to meet the minimum distribution requirements applicable to the contract under federal tax law  applicants assert that given the conditions described above few contract owners who add the lrr to their contracts will ever be assessed any additional cdsc  applicants state that the primary benefit of the lrr is the  reduction in mortality and expense risk charge to contract owners which benefit is guaranteed and cannot be reduced or withdrawn  further applicants state that additional premium payments made after the lrr is added to a contract will be subject only to the year new schedule rather than the contracts regular year cdsc schedule that would have applied to those same premium payments under the contracts if the lrr had not been added to the contract applicants assert that this is a substantial benefit to any contract owner—including a surviving spouse of the contract owner who is eligible to continue the contract after the contract owners death—who may have an interest in making further premium payments  in light of these considerations applicants assert that there is not any public policy or purpose under section  or otherwise that would preclude offering the lrr under the terms and conditions stated hereinfund applicants conditions applicants have consented to the following conditions  the offering document will contain concise plain english statements that a the lrr is suitable only for contract owners who expect to hold their contract as long term investments and b if a significant amount of the contracts value is start printed page surrendered or withdrawn during the first five years after the rider date the lrrs benefits may be more than offset by that charge and a contract owner may be worse off if he or she had rejected the lrr  the offering document will disclose in concise plain english the only aspect in which adding the lrr rider could disadvantage a contract owner ie through the possible imposition of the new schedule of cdsc  a contract owner choosing to add the lrr will complete and sign the election form which will prominently restate in concise plain english the statements required in condition no  and return it to hartford if the election form is more than  pages long hartford will use a separate document to obtain the contract owners acknowledgement of the statements referred to in condition no  above  applicants will maintain and make available the following separately identifiable records for the time

no indication of future performance when a subaccount advertises its standardized total return it will usually be calculated for one year five years and ten years or some other relevant periods if the subaccount has not been in existence for at least ten years total return is measured by comparing the value of an investment in the subaccount at the beginning of the relevant period to the value of the investment at the end of the period and assumes that the optional death benefit has not been elected the separate account may also advertise nonstandard total returns that predate the inception date of the separate account these nonstandardized total returns are calculated by assuming that the subaccounts have been in existence for the same periods as the underlying portfolios and by taking deductions for charges equal to those currently assessed against the subaccounts these nonstandardized returns must be accompanied by standardized total returns if applicable the subaccounts may advertise yield in addition to total return the yield will be computed in the following manner the net investment income per unit earned during a recent one month period divided by the unit value on the last day of the period this figure reflects the recurring charges at the separate account level including the annual maintenance fee the money market portfolio subaccount may advertise yield and effective yield the yield of a subaccount is based upon the income earned by the subaccount over a sevenday period and then annualized ie the income earned in the period is assumed to be earned every seven days over a week period and stated as a percentage of the investment effective yield is calculated similarly but when annualized the income earned by the investment is assumed to be reinvested

to the net investment return of the subaccounts supporting the variable annuity payments less an adjustment to neutralize the selected air dividing what would otherwise be the annuity unit value by the air factor is necessary in order to adjust the change in the annuity unit value resulting from the net investment factor so that the annuity unit value only changes to the extent that the net investment factor represents a rate of return greater than or less than the air selected by you without this adjustment the net investment factor would decrease the annuity unit value to the extent

the annuity payment for the prior period to the extent that such net investment return exceeds an annualized rate of return of  for a payment period the annuity payment for that period will be greater

governs the taxation of annuities in general  nonnatural persons corporations etc code section  contains provisions for contract owners which are not natural persons nonnatural persons include corporations trusts limited liability companies partnerships and other types of legal entities the tax rules for contracts owned by nonnatural persons are different from the rules for contracts owned by individuals for example the annual net increase in the value of the contract is currently includible in the gross income of a nonnatural person unless the nonnatural person holds the contract as an agent for a natural person there are additional exceptions from current inclusion for  certain annuities held by structured settlement companies  certain annuities held by an employer with respect to a terminated qualified retirement plan and  certain immediate annuities a nonnatural person which is a taxexempt entity for federal tax purposes will not be subject to income tax as a result of this provision if the contract owner is a nonnatural person the primary annuitant is treated as the contract owner in applying mandatory distribution rules these rules require that certain distributions be made upon the death of the contract owner a change in the primary annuitant is also treated as the death of the contract owner  other contract owners natural persons a contract owner is not taxed on increases in the value of the contract until an amount is received or deemed received eg in the form of a lump sum payment full or partial value of a contract or as annuity payments under the settlement option elected the provisions of section  of the code concerning distributions are summarized briefly below also summarized are special rules affecting distributions from contracts obtained in a taxfree exchange for other annuity contracts or life insurance contracts which were purchased prior to august   a distributions prior to the annuity commencement date i total premium payments less amounts received which were not includable in gross income equal the investment in the contract under section  of the code ii to the extent that the value of the contract ignoring any surrender

insurance company   iii any amount received or deemed received prior to the annuity commencement date eg upon a partial surrender is deemed to come first from any such income on the contract and then from investment in the contract and for these purposes such income on the contract shall be computed by reference to any aggregation rule in subparagraph c below as a result any such amount received or deemed received  shall be includable in gross income to the extent that such amount does not exceed any such income on the contract and  shall not be includable in gross income to the extent that such amount does exceed any such income on the contract if at the time that any amount is received or deemed received there is no income on the contract eg because the gross value of the contract does not exceed the investment in the contract and no aggregation rule applies then such amount received or deemed received will not be includable in gross income and will simply reduce the investment in the contract iv the receipt of any amount as a loan under the contract or the assignment or pledge of any portion of the value of the contract shall be treated as an amount received for purposes of this subparagraph a and the next subparagraph b v in general the transfer of the contract without full and adequate consideration will be treated as an amount received for purposes of this subparagraph a and the next subparagraph b this transfer rule does not apply however to certain transfers of property between spouses or incident to divorce b distributions after annuity commencement date annuity payments made periodically after the annuity commencement date are includable in gross income to the extent the payments exceed the amount determined by the application of the ratio of the investment in the contract to the total amount of the payments to be made after the annuity commencement date the exclusion ratio i when the total of amounts excluded from income by application of the exclusion ratio is equal to the investment in the contract as of the annuity commencement date any additional payments including surrenders will be entirely includable in gross income ii if the annuity payments cease by reason of the death of the annuitant and as of the date of death the amount of annuity payments excluded from gross income by the exclusion ratio does not exceed the investment in the contract as of the annuity commencement date then the remaining portion of unrecovered investment shall be allowed as a deduction for the last taxable year of the annuitant iii generally nonperiodic amounts received or deemed received after the annuity commencement date are not entitled to any exclusion ratio and shall be fully includable in gross income however upon a full surrender after such date only the excess of the amount received after any surrender charge over the remaining investment in the contract shall be includable in gross income except to the extent that the aggregation rule referred to in the next subparagraph c may apply c aggregation of two or more annuity contracts contracts issued after october   by the same insurer or affiliated insurer to the same contract owner within the same calendar year other than certain contracts held in connection with a taxqualified retirement arrangement will be treated as one annuity contract for the purpose of determining the taxation of distributions prior to the annuity commencement date an annuity contract received in a taxfree exchange for another annuity contract or life insurance contract may be treated as a new contract for this purpose hartford believes that for any annuity subject to such aggregation the values under the contracts and the investment in the contracts will be added together to determine the taxation under subparagraph a above of amounts received or deemed received prior to the annuity commencement date withdrawals will first be treated as withdrawals of income until all of the income from all such contracts is withdrawn as of the date of this prospectus there are no regulations interpreting this provision d  penalty tax  applicable to certain withdrawals and annuity

code section  provides that a variable annuity contract will not be treated as an annuity contract for any period during which the investments made by the separate account or underlying fund are not adequately diversified if a contract is not treated as an annuity contract the contract owner will be subject to income tax on annual increases in cash value the treasury departments diversification regulations require among other things that  no more than  of the value of the total assets of the segregated asset account underlying a variable contract is represented by any one investment  no more than  is represented by any two investments  no more than  is represented by any three investments and  no more than  is represented by any four investments in determining whether the diversification standards are met all securities of the same issuer all interests in the same real property project and all interests in the same commodity are each treated as a single investment in the case of government securities each government agency or instrumentality is treated as a separate issuer a separate account must be in compliance with the diversification standards on the last day of each calendar quarter or within  days after the quarter ends if an insurance company inadvertently fails to meet the diversification requirements the company may still comply within a reasonable period and avoid the taxation of contract income on an ongoing basis however either the company or the contract owner must agree to pay the tax due for the period during which the diversification requirements were not met we monitor the diversification of investments in the separate accounts and test for diversification as required by the code we intend to administer all contracts subject to the diversification requirements in a manner that will maintain adequate diversification  ownership of the assets in the separate account in order for a variable annuity contract to qualify for tax deferral assets in the separate accounts supporting the contract must be considered to be owned by the insurance company and not by the contract owner it is unclear under what circumstances an investor is considered to have enough control over the assets in pbposth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th hartford life and annuity insurance company   the separate account to be considered the owner of the assets for tax purposes the irs has issued several rulings discussing investor control these rulings say that certain incidents of ownership by the contract owner such as the ability to select and control investments in a separate account will cause the contract owner to be treated as the owner of the assets for tax purposes in its explanation of the diversification regulations the treasury department recognized that the temporary regulations do not provide guidance concerning the circumstances in which investor control of the investments of a segregated asset account may cause the investor rather than the insurance company to be treated as the owner of the assets in the account the explanation further indicates that the temporary regulations provide that in appropriate cases a segregated asset account may include multiple subaccounts but do not specify the extent to which policyholders may direct their investments to particular subaccounts without being treated as the owners of the underlying assets guidance on this and other issues will be provided in regulations or revenue rulings under section d relating to the definition of variable contract the final regulations issued under section  did not provide guidance regarding investor control and as of the date of this prospectus guidance has yet to be issued we do not know if additional guidance will be issued if guidance is issued we do not know if it will have a retroactive effect due to the lack of specific guidance on investor control there is some uncertainty about when a contract owner is considered the owner of the assets for tax purposes we reserve the right to modify the contract as necessary to prevent you from being considered the owner of assets in the separate account d federal income tax withholding any portion of a distribution that is or is deemed to be current taxable income to the contract owner will be subject to federal income tax withholding and reporting under the

principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the

determining the liability for aggregate reserves for future benefits and the liability for premium and other deposit funds although some variability is inherent in these estimates management believes the amounts provided are adequate statutory accounting practices versus gaap statutory accounting practices and generally accepted accounting principles gaap differ in certain significant respects these differences principally involve  treatment of policy acquisition costs commissions underwriting and selling expenses etc which are charged to expense when incurred for statutory purposes rather than on a prorata basis over the expected life and gross profit stream of the policy for gaap purposes  recognition of premium revenues which for statutory purposes are generally recorded as collected or when due during the premium paying period of the contract and which for gaap purposes for universal life policies and investment products generally only consist of charges assessed to policy account balances for cost of insurance policy administration and surrenders when policy charges received relate to coverage or services to be provided in the future the charges are recognized as revenue on a prorata basis over the expected life and gross profit stream of the policy also for gaap purposes premiums for traditional life insurance policies are recognized as revenues when they are due from policyholders  development of liabilities for future policy benefits which for statutory purposes predominantly use interest rate and mortality assumptions prescribed by the naic which may vary considerably from interest and mortality assumptions used under gaap  providing for income taxes based on current taxable income only for statutory purposes rather than establishing additional assets or liabilities for deferred federal income taxes to recognize the tax effect related to reporting revenues and expenses in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes or required under gaap  excluding certain assets designated as nonadmitted assets eg negative interest maintenance reserve and past due agents balances from the balance sheet for statutory purposes by directly charging surplus  the calculation of post retirement benefits obligation which for statutory accounting excludes nonvested employees whereas gaap liabilities include a provision for such employees statutory and gaap accounting permit either immediate recognition of the liability or straightline amortization of the liability over a period not to exceed  years for gaap the hartfords

and ten years or other periods nonstandardized total return is measured in the same manner as the standardized total return described above except that the annual maintenance fee is not deducted therefore nonstandardized total return for a subaccount is higher than standardized total return for a subaccount these nonstandardized returns must be accompanied by standardized total returns if applicable the subaccounts may advertise yield in addition to total return the yield will be computed in the following manner the net investment income per unit earned during a recent one month period

purchase the type of contract you purchased and your age how is the value of my contract calculated before the annuity commencement date the contract value is the sum of all accounts there are two things that affect your subaccount value  the number of accumulation units and  the accumulation unit value the subaccount value is determined by multiplying the number of accumulation units by the accumulation unit value therefore on any valuation day your contract value reflects the investment performance of the subaccounts and will fluctuate with the performance of the underlying funds when premium payments are credited to your subaccounts they are converted into accumulation units by dividing the amount of your premium payments minus any premium taxes by the accumulation unit value for that day the more premium payments you put into your contract the more accumulation units you will own you decrease the number of accumulation units you have by requesting surrenders transferring money out of an account settling a death benefit claim or by annuitizing your contract to determine the current accumulation unit value we take the prior valuation days accumulation unit value and multiply it by the net investment factor for the current valuation day the net investment factor is used to measure the investment performance of a subaccount from one valuation day to the next the net investment factor for each subaccount equals  the net asset value per share of each fund held in the subaccount at the end of the current valuation day divided by  the net asset value per share of each fund held in the subaccount at the end of the prior valuation day minus  the daily mortality and expense risk charge adjusted for the number of days in the period and any other applicable charge

selling distributing and administering the contract although variable annuity payouts will fluctuate with the performance of the underlying fund selected your annuity payouts will not be affected by a

for contracts owned by individuals for example the annual net increase in the value of the contract is currently includible in the gross income of a nonnatural person unless the nonnatural person holds the contract as an agent for a natural person there are additional exceptions from current inclusion for  certain annuities held by structured settlement companies  certain annuities held by an employer with respect to a terminated qualified retirement plan and  certain immediate annuities a nonnatural person which is a taxexempt entity for federal tax purposes will not be subject to income tax as a result of this provision if the contract owner is a nonnatural person the primary annuitant is treated as the contract owner in applying mandatory distribution rules these rules require that certain distributions be made upon the death of the contract owner a change in the primary annuitant is also treated as the death of the contract owner  other contract owners natural persons a contract owner is not taxed on increases in the value of the contract until an amount is received or deemed received eg in the form of a lump sum payment full or partial value of a contract or as annuity payments under the settlement option elected the provisions of section  of the code concerning distributions are summarized briefly below also summarized are special rules affecting distributions from contracts obtained in a taxfree exchange for other annuity contracts or life insurance contracts which were purchased prior to august   a distributions prior to the annuity commencement date i total premium payments less amounts received which were not includable in gross income equal the investment in the contract under section  of the code ii to the extent that the value of the contract ignoring any surrender charges except on a full surrender exceeds the investment in the contract such excess constitutes the income on the contract iii any amount received or deemed received prior to the annuity commencement date eg upon a partial surrender is deemed to come first from any such income on the contract and then from investment in the contract and for these purposes such income on the contract shall be computed by reference to any aggregation rule in subparagraph c below as a result any such amount received or deemed received  shall be includable in gross income to the extent that such amount does not exceed any such income on the contract and  shall not be includable in gross income to the extent that such amount does exceed any such income on the contract if at the time that any amount is received or deemed received there is no income on the contract eg because the gross value of the contract does not exceed the investment in the contract and no aggregation rule applies then such amount received or deemed received will not be includable in gross income and will simply reduce the investment in the contract iv the receipt of any amount as a loan under the contract or the assignment or pledge of any portion of the value of the contract shall be treated as an amount received for purposes of this subparagraph a and the next subparagraph b v in general the transfer of the contract without full and adequate consideration will be treated as an amount received for purposes of this subparagraph a and the next subparagraph b this transfer rule does not apply however to certain transfers of property between spouses or incident to divorce b distributions after annuity commencement date annuity payments made periodically after the annuity commencement date are includable in gross income to the extent the payments exceed the amount determined by the application of the ratio of the investment in the contract to the total amount of the payments to be made after the annuity commencement date the exclusion ratio i when the total of amounts excluded from income by application of the exclusion ratio is equal to the investment in the contract as of the annuity commencement date any additional payments including surrenders will be entirely includable in gross income ii if the annuity payments cease by reason of the death of the annuitant and as of the date of death the amount of annuity payments excluded from gross income by the exclusion ratio does not exceed the investment in the contract as of the annuity commencement date then the remaining portion of unrecovered investment shall be allowed as a deduction for the last taxable year of the annuitant iii generally nonperiodic amounts received or deemed received after the annuity commencement date are not entitled to any exclusion ratio and shall be fully includable in gross income however upon a full surrender after such date only the excess of the amount received after any surrender charge over the remaining investment in the contract shall be includable in gross income except to the extent that the aggregation rule referred to in the next subparagraph c may apply c aggregation of two or more annuity contracts contracts issued after october   by the same insurer or affiliated insurer to the same contract owner within the same calendar year other than certain contracts held in connection with a taxqualified retirement arrangement will be treated as one annuity contract for the purpose of determining the taxation of distributions prior to the annuity commencement date pth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th  hartford life and annuity insurance company  an annuity contract received in a taxfree exchange for another annuity contract or life insurance contract may be treated as a new contract for this purpose hartford believes that for any annuity subject to such aggregation the values under the contracts and the

life insurance contracts purchased prior to august   if the contract was obtained by a taxfree exchange of a life insurance or annuity contract purchased prior to august   then any amount received or deemed received prior to the annuity commencement date shall be deemed to come  first from the amount of the investment in the contract prior to august   pre investment carried over from the prior contract  then from the portion of the income on the contract carried over to as well as accumulating in the successor contract that is attributable to such pre investment  then from the remaining income on the contract and  last from the remaining investment in the contract as a result to the extent that such amount received or deemed received does not exceed such pre investment such amount is not includable in gross income in addition to the extent that such amount received or deemed received does not exceed the sum of a such pre investment and b the income on the contract attributable thereto such amount is not subject to the  penalty tax in all other respects amounts received or deemed received from such post exchange contracts are generally subject to the rules described in this

 years after such death and  if the contract owner is not an individual then for purposes of  or  above the primary annuitant under the contract shall be treated as the contract owner and any change in the primary annuitant shall be treated as the death of the contract owner the primary annuitant is the individual the events in the life of whom are of primary importance in affecting the timing or amount of the payout under the contract ii alternative election to satisfy distribution requirements if any portion of the interest of a contract owner described in i above is payable to or for the benefit of a designated beneficiary such beneficiary may elect to have the portion distributed over a period that does not extend beyond the life or life expectancy of the beneficiary distributions

or contingent annuitant is living such spouse shall be treated as the contract owner of such portion for purposes of section i above this spousal continuation shall apply only once for this contract  diversification requirements the code requires that investments supporting your contract be adequately diversified code section  provides that a variable annuity contract will not be treated as an annuity contract for any period during which the investments made by the separate account or underlying fund are not adequately diversified if a contract is not treated as an annuity contract the contract pst page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust st hartford life and annuity insurance company   owner will be subject to income tax on annual increases in cash value the treasury departments diversification regulations require among other things that  no more than  of the value of the total assets of the segregated asset account underlying a variable contract is represented by any one investment  no more than  is represented by any two investments  no more than  is represented by any three investments and  no more than  is represented by any four investments in determining whether the diversification standards are met all securities of the same issuer all interests in the same real property project and all interests in the same commodity are each treated as a single investment in the case of government securities each government agency or instrumentality is treated as a separate issuer a separate account must be in compliance with the diversification standards on the last day of each calendar quarter or within  days after the quarter ends if an insurance company inadvertently fails to meet the diversification requirements the company may still comply within a reasonable period and avoid the taxation of contract income on an ongoing basis however either the company or the contract owner must agree to pay the tax due for the period during which the diversification requirements were not met we monitor the diversification of investments in the separate accounts and test for diversification as required by the code we intend to administer all contracts subject to the diversification requirements in a manner that will maintain adequate diversification  ownership of the assets in the separate account in order for a variable annuity contract to qualify for tax deferral assets in the separate accounts supporting the contract must be considered to be owned by the insurance company and not by the contract owner it is unclear under what circumstances an investor is considered to have enough control over the assets in the separate account to be considered the owner of the assets for tax purposes the irs has issued several rulings discussing investor control these rulings say that certain incidents of ownership by the contract owner such as the ability to select and control investments in a separate account will cause the contract owner to be treated as the owner of the assets for tax purposes in its explanation of the diversification regulations the treasury department recognized that the temporary regulations do not provide guidance concerning the circumstances in which investor control of the investments of a segregated asset account may cause the investor rather than the insurance company to be treated as the owner of the assets in the account the explanation further indicates that the temporary regulations provide that in appropriate cases a segregated asset account may include multiple subaccounts but do not specify the extent to which policyholders may direct their investments to particular subaccounts without being treated as the owners of the underlying assets guidance on this and other issues will be provided in regulations or revenue rulings under section d relating to the definition of variable contract the final regulations issued under section  did not provide guidance regarding investor control and as of the date of this prospectus guidance has yet to be issued we do not know if additional guidance will be issued if guidance is issued we do not know if it will have a retroactive effect due to the lack of specific guidance on investor control there is some uncertainty about when a contract owner is considered the owner of the assets for tax purposes we reserve the right to modify the contract as necessary to prevent you from being considered the owner of assets in the separate account d federal income tax withholding any portion of a distribution that is or is deemed to be current taxable income to the contract owner will be subject to federal income tax withholding and reporting under the code generally however a contract owner may elect not to have income taxes withheld or to have income taxes withheld at a different rate by filing a completed election form with us election forms will be provided at the time distributions are requested e general provisions

under the heading performance related information the yield of a money market subaccount for a seven day period the base period will be computed by determining the net change in value calculated as set forth below of a hypothetical account having a balance of one accumulation unit of the subaccount at the beginning of the period subtracting a hypothetical charge reflecting deductions from contract owner accounts and dividing the difference by the value of the account at the beginning of the base period to obtain the base period return and then multiplying the base period return by  with the resulting yield figure carried to the nearest hundredth of one percent net changes in value of a hypothetical account will include net investment income of the account accrued daily dividends as declared by the underlying funds less daily expense charges of the account for the period but will not include realized gains or losses or unrealized appreciation or depreciation on the underlying fund shares the effective yield is calculated by compounding the base period return by adding  raising the sum to a power equal to  divided by  and subtracting  from the result according to the

results could differ from those estimates the most significant estimates include those used in determining the liability for aggregate reserves for future benefits and the liability for premium and other deposit funds although some variability is inherent in these estimates management believes the amounts provided are adequate statutory accounting practices versus gaap statutory accounting practices and generally accepted accounting principles gaap differ in certain significant respects these differences principally involve  treatment of policy acquisition costs commissions underwriting and selling expenses etc which are charged to expense when incurred for statutory purposes rather than on a prorata basis over the expected life and gross profit stream of the policy for gaap purposes  recognition of premium revenues which for statutory purposes are generally recorded as collected or when due during the premium paying period of the contract and which for gaap purposes for universal life policies and investment products generally only consist of charges assessed to policy account balances for cost of insurance policy administration and surrenders when policy charges received relate to coverage or services to be provided in the future the charges are recognized as revenue on a prorata basis over the expected life and gross profit stream of the policy also for gaap purposes premiums for traditional life insurance policies are recognized as revenues when they are due from policyholders  development of liabilities for future policy benefits which for statutory purposes predominantly use interest rate and mortality assumptions prescribed by the naic which may vary considerably from interest and mortality assumptions used under gaap  providing for income taxes based on current taxable income only for statutory purposes rather than establishing additional assets or liabilities for deferred federal income taxes to recognize the tax effect related to reporting revenues and expenses in different periods for financial reporting and tax return purposes or required under gaap  excluding certain assets designated as nonadmitted assets eg negative interest maintenance reserve and past due agents balances from the balance sheet for statutory purposes by directly charging surplus  the calculation of post retirement benefits obligation which for statutory accounting excludes nonvested employees whereas gaap liabilities include a provision for such employees statutory and gaap accounting permit either immediate recognition of the liability or
