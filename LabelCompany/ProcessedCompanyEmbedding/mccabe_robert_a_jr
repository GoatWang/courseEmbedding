donation specialist dies at  by william yardleysept  3 continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story the clock was ticking the kidneys of a yearold girl who had died in a virginia hospital had been removed from her body with her parents’ consent in the hope that the organs might extend the life of others but with only a rudimentary computer network available to help them in  officials at the hospital norfolk general could not find a suitable recipient for one of the kidneys and they knew they had only  hours at most to do soso they reached out to st luke’s hospital center in new york where dr robert e mccabe jr an early specialist in kidney transplantation was head of the renal preservation laboratory he began scouring the new york area for potential recipients but found none nationally not a single compatible recipient could be found among  or so people awaiting a transplant he called colleagues in italy and kuwait no luckthen cutting through the cold war tensions of the time he called the soviet embassy in washington and told them to relay a message to dr valery i shumakov a prominent transplant surgeon he had met that april a kidney was on the way — please find it a homethe girl who had suffered head trauma in a traffic accident had died shortly after noon on a tuesday in june the next day working with the embassy st luke’s put the kidney on a soviet aeroflot flight to moscow out of kennedy international airport after fending off security officials who wanted to check the storage container for explosives the kidney arrived safely and dr shumakov soon reported that he had successfully transplanted the organ into a 3yearold man that thursday afternoon the girl’s other kidney was implanted in a yearold man in newark advertisement continue reading the main story in the worlds of medicine and international politics dr mccabe’s determination to link donors with recipients had brought about a rare collaboration with the soviets but for dr mccabe who died at  on aug  the episode underscored the shortcomings in the american system of kidney donations continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story “we should have been able to use those kidneys at home but we weren’t organized adequately in new york city to use them all locally or in the states themselves” he said in a recent interview on the web site of the american society of transplant surgeons of which he was a founding member “we shouldn’t have had to go that far”the first successful kidney transplant was conducted in  and the procedure was rapidly adopted around the world but by the late s hospitals faced challenges in preserving an organ during the outofbody interim and in matching donors with recipientsdr mccabe who performed transplants at st luke’s taught himself to become a specialist in organ preservation using cold storage as well as a machine developed by the transplant surgeon dr folkert o belzer the process known as machine perfusion uses a blend of fluids to simulate a kidney’s natural function until the kidney is transplanted dr mccabe helped refine the blend photo dr robert mccabe jr  credit fred r conradthe new york times but even with these preservation efforts a kidney could be kept functional outside the body only for up to  hoursthe  episode was not the first kidney transplant between the united states and the soviet union — there had been at least two others — but it exemplified the improvisational nature of transplant surgery and organ donation at the timedr mccabe’s photograph showing him helping to push free a police car that had become stuck in the mud while transporting a kidney into manhattan had once appeared in the daily news in new york on another occasion he delivered a kidney to italy using a perfusion machine the fluid inside frothing as the car in which he transported it through rome bumped along cobblestone streets newsletter sign up continue

historian for the transplant society “this was cowboy time”but the new yorktomoscow episode had a positive effect in generating publicity for the transplant program — the account appeared on the front page of the new york times — and that in turn led to a noticeable rise in kidney donations advertisement continue reading the main story over time databases of kidney donors and recipients became more sophisticated as did preservation methods enabling transplants to be accomplished far more speedily in  to prevent entrepreneurs from profiting from transplantation and hospitals from moving wealthy patients to the top of the waiting list congress passed the national organ transplant act which outlawed the sale of organs and established a regulatory framework for donationsdr mccabe said that one benefit of tighter regulations was a more efficient process of determining when an organ donor was dead so that the organ could be harvested“we’d hear about a donor on tuesday or wednesday and we couldn’t get the neurologist to declare brain death” he said in the online interview “they were some of the skeptics too frankly and they would not declare brain death until friday afternoon at  when they were tired of caring for the patient and wanted us to take over so we would be busy every weekend”robert emmet mccabe jr was born on feb   in charleston wva his father robert was a lawyer and his mother the former margaret ward was a homemaker he graduated from williams college in  and received his medical degree in 3 from cornell university medical college in manhattan he served as a surgeon
