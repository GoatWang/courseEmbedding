electrical design process for cars aircraft and other complex products has grown dramatically within the past decade driven by several factors functionality has increased as the increased use of electronics has driven down the cost of providing functions that were once only available on premium products configuration complexity has increased as oems seek to offer a wider range of customer options to widen their market offering the burden of design data management has increased with the introduction of regulatory mandates and standards that ensure bestpractice design the risk of litigation is demanding ever more intensive testing  most effectively achieved via virtual prototyping these factors are driving many companies to redefine their design processes moving away from a series of compartmentalized activities towards a more integrated process where data can flow automatically and where more parts of the process can be automated capital’s design tools – capital logic capital integrator and capital harnessxc – provide design functionality for the major steps in the design process and is underpinned by a “datacentric highway” that allows data to flow between applications the datacentric highway is a key element in optimizing the design process because it ensures that engineering changes can be automatically communicated and validated without the need for designers to manually transcribe data between each of the design steps process management controls are integral to the tools allowing companies to predefine key design data and processes minimizing the effort to create high quality designs capital logic capital logic is a graphical and designmanagement tool for authoring both logical connectivity circuit designs signals and physical wiring
