gantt chart in smartsheet history of gantt charts the first gantt chart was created in the mid s by karol adamiecki a polish engineer who was interested in management ideas and techniques he named it a harmonogram and only published the chart in polish which limited widespread use it wasn’t until  years later that henry gantt devised his own version of adamiecki’s project schedule and published it in english making it available to a vastly larger population one of the first highprofile applications was by the united states during world war i since then gantt charts have been used in many large projects such as the construction of the hoover dam and the us interstate highway network originally gantt charts required preparation by hand  meaning that whenever there was a project change the chart needed to be edited or redrawn completely since projects often see dramatic change from start to finish the usefulness of a gantt was limited in the s with the invention of the personal computer widespread creation of complex and elaborate charts was finally possible by the end of the s the advent of the internet as well as high rates of collaboration over networks encouraged gantt charts to become a popular feature of many webbased applications and tools tips for choosing the right gantt chart software choose a tool that integrates with your daily workflowmake sure your gantt chart
