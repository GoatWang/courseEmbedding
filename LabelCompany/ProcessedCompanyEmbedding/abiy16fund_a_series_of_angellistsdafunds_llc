disrupt posted sep   by jonathan shieber jshieber  shares next story a run through the chinese pavilion at techcrunch disrupt sf angellist is expanding globally and launching new vehicles for accredited investors to back what amounts to indexed angellist syndicate funds for the top deals on the platform that’s the latest from angellist cofounder naval ravikant and angel investor gil penchina from the stage of disrupt sf  as the angels who along with crunchfund investor and techcrunch founder michael arrington held the audience rapt the angellist platform has grown increasingly robust and through the syndicate vehicles can now invest in — and lead — series a rounds according to navikant “once my first fund got to  million there were people who weren’t able to get into every deal” says penchina “so we launched the saas syndicate… the bitcoin syndicate which is doing two deals the iot syndicate and a late stage syndicate which is going to compete with late stage investors” both penchina and ravikant see angellist as a way to democratize the venture model from top to bottom with the latestage fund the latest shot from angellist across the bow of traditional investors at issue is the dilution that earlystage investors suffer in the highpriced laterstage rounds that have become the norm in silicon valley and beyond in recent years thanks andreessen horowitz as the angellist syndicates grow larger they’re also professionalizing penchina has eight fulltime staff working on his syndicate fund along with another  “volunteers” so far penchina has deployed  million across his syndicates but expects that number to soar to  million over the next  months” ravikant envisions a system that allows an investor’s fund to grow as his experience and track record evolves “it’s a smooth path up to a fund” from angel investment says ravikant “you can add backers as you go” angellist is a way to add leverage to an investor’s checkbook it’s additional firepower to compete against the more established and wellheeled investors in the venture community and he argues it’s a better deal for the limited partners that invest in funds “institutional lps go into individual funds now” he says now that angellist has managed to embed itself in the us ecosystem it’s casting its eye on markets around the world the investment platform is in the process of obtaining regulatory clearance in the uk with plans to move into canadian and australian markets shortly thereafter the only problem with the angellist model is the problem of overtaxing resources both men said “i’m in too many deals now” ravikant said  shares advertisement advertisement crunchbase angellist founded  overview angellist is a community of startups and investors who make fundraising efficient started
