   next page    this sample marketing plan was created with marketing plan pro software marketing strategy the enchanted vineyard bed  breakfast has a threepronged strategy association membership and advertising a large number of visitors will look to regional bb associations for information about the different bbs in the area  most associations publish a guide to the local bbs and the enchanted vineyard bed  breakfast wants to be in this guide  one of the other perks of membership is visibility on the associations website with a link to ours   additionally we will be a member of the chamber of commerce because people typically inquire with the local chamber when planning a vacation website the enchanted vineyard bed  breakfast will have a fullservice website that allows the visitor to view the bb read details about what it has to offer provide information on regional activities even allow the visitor to book a reservation  with the growing use of the internet the web has become an indispensable tool people have for planning vacation to areas that are not close enough to check out in person strategic relationship with the university of oregon the enchanted vineyard bed  breakfast will develop a partnership with the university so when the school is in need of finding rooms for guests they will use the enchanted vineyard bed  breakfast  we will also be advertising with

with booking a reservation sight unseen because of the trust bond they have formed with the university getting ready to create a marketing plan get practical ideas and good models with dozens of examples of successful marketing plans with sales and marketing pro finish your own marketing plan mission the mission of the enchanted vineyard bed  breakfast is to provide the finest bb experience  we exist to attract and maintain customers  when we adhere to this maxim everything else will fall into place our services will exceed the expectations of our customers marketing objectives maintain positive steady growth each quarter experience a growth in new customers who are turned into longterm customers realize an increase in occupancy each subsequent year financial objectives a double digit growth rate for each future year reduce the variable costs per guest continue to decrease the fixed costs target marketing our customers can be broadly divided into three groups please note that it is possible to divide the customers into much smaller groups but we have chosen not to weekend getaway customers these people are from the region and are looking to get away so they come to the enchanted vineyard bed  breakfast to be pampered and escape travelers these people are passing through eugene and prefer to stay in a bb instead of a hotelmotel university of oregon travelers the university brings a large number of people through eugene and the enchanted vineyard bed  breakfast believes that a good portion of their business will be from the university  occassions include parents weekend orientation parents visiting and graduation  lastly the university will often set up rooms for administrative visitors positioning the enchanted vineyard bed  breakfast will position itself as an upscale bb with a gorgeous facility and unmatched customer attention  the enchanted vineyard bed  breakfast will leverage their competitive edge attention to personalized servicewhile anyone at a bb should reasonably expect good service there are ways of setting yourself apart from this already high level of service  this will be done through the unrelenting pursuit of personal attention  in the eugene area there are several larger more than six room bbs that offer outstanding service but it is not personal  what is meant by that is that the service is provided by employees not the owner  at the enchanted vineyard bed  breakfast all interactions with the customer will be with missy or john who see it as their duty to do whatever it takes to make the customer feel at home  the feeling of personal attention or more accurately defined as a sense of personal concern not just mere personal attention really adds a very positive dimension to the bb experience  not only will the stewarts be offering personal concern but they will be providing the concern not some employee uniqueness and beauty of the facilitythe enchanted vineyard bed  breakfast will be housed in the stewarts home  the stewarts will be renovating their farm house to accommodate their new guests they will be building two more bedrooms with private baths building a patio and enlarging the common area  one unique aspect of the enchanted vineyard bed  breakfast is the setting within the lorane valley region known for its outstanding wine production housing both vineyards and wineries  to compliment this setting the enchanted vineyard bed  breakfast will have a large outside patio allowing guests to spend time relaxing outside with a nice view of the valley  the guests also have the option to wander through the enchanted vineyard bed  breakfasts own vineyard  each room in the bb is  glass overlooking the hill side and vineyard  basically there is not a room in the house that doesnt have a breathtaking view strategy pyramids the single objective is to position the enchanted vineyard bed  breakfast as the upscale bb located in eugene reaching generally full occupancy within the first three years  the marketing strategy will seek to first create customer awareness regarding the services offered develop that customer base and work building customer loyalty and strategic relationships with the university the message that the enchanted vineyard bed  breakfast will seek to communicate is that the enchanted vineyard is the premier bb in the eugene area with the finest facilities  the message will be communicated through a variety of methods  the first will be advertising in the bb association newsletter  the next method will be a robust website with a comprehensive amount of information  the last method will be developing strategic relationships with the university  while this will require a budget for assorted activities these activities are basically networking activities taking people out to lunch and schmoozing marketing mix the enchanted vineyard bed  breakfasts marketing mix is comprised of the following approach to pricing distribution advertising and promotion and customer service pricing the pricing scheme is based on a room rate  the rate is arrived at in terms of by its market value distribution all services will be provided at the bb advertising and promotion the most successful traditional advertising will be with the bb association  developing strategic alliances with the university is a nontraditional method of marketing but it will be quite efficient  the website will also be used in marketing activities customer service obsessive customer attention is the mantra  the enchanted vineyards philosophy is what ever needs to be done to make the customer happy must occur even at the expense of shortterm profits  in the long run this investment will pay off with fierce customer loyalty marketing research during the initial phases of the marketing plan development several focus groups were held to gain insight into a variety of bb patrons  these focus groups provided useful information into the decision making processes of consumers an additional source of dynamic market research is a feedback mechanism based on a suggestion card system  the suggestion card has several statements that patrons are asked to rate in terms of a given scale  there are also several open ended questions that allow the customer to freely offer constructive criticism or praise  the enchanted vineyard will work hard to implement reasonable suggestions in order to improve their services as well as show their committment to the customer that their suggestions are valued page                     previous page      next page

innkeepers in the news pillows tipsbed and breakfast supplies hospitality supplies innkeeper products microfiber microfiber linens microfiber table linens sheets wholesale table linens wrinkle free sheetsisadmin microfibers are used in a variety of fabrics but most commonly in dress and blouse weight garments they are very fine fibers compared to more conventional forms − half the diameter of a fine silk fiber onethird the diameter of cotton onequarter the diameter of fine wool and one hundred times finer than human hair although fine and lightweight microfiber is anything but flimsy what is microfiber in order to be classified “microfiber” the fiber must be less than one denier a denier is the weight in grams of a meter length of fiber or yarn the higher the number − the thicker the fiber the many tiny fibers of microfiber are able to slide back and forth and maneuver around within the yarns of the fabric allowing the fabric to flow and drape freely yet still possess body and shape microfiber fabrics are generally lightweight resilient or resistant to wrinkling and have a luxurious drape and body retain shape and resist pilling they are also relatively strong and durable in relation to other fabrics of similar weight how microfibers are manufactured manmade fibers are formed by forcing a liquid through tiny holes in a device called a spinneret in microfiber the holes are finer than with conventional fibers potentially any manmade fiber can be made into a microfiber but are most commonly found in polyester and nylon micros can be used alone blended with conventional denier manmade fibers or natural fibers such as cotton wool and silk benefits of microfiber since these fine yarns can be packed tightly together microfibers are especially useful in garments that require water repellency and wind resistance yet the spaces between the yarns are porous enough to breathe and wick moisture away from the body microfibers seem less “clammy” to wear and is the perfect choice for warm weather and athletic clothing caring for microfibers garments made of microfiber can usually be cared for similar to garments made of conventional fabrics fabrics made from regular polyester and nylon fibers can be machinewashed and tumble dried use of paper dryer sheets is not recommended because temporary spotting from the heat of the dryer may occur liquid fabric softener use is not a problem viscose rayons perform best when drycleaned however as a general rule fiber properties not the fineness of the fiber usually dictate recommended care it is important that one follow the care instructions on a particular garment a few precautions should be observed when caring for microfibers because the fibers are so fine heat penetrates the fabric more quickly than conventional fabric as a result glazing melting or scorching can occur quickly if pressing is necessary use only a cool iron and do not leave the iron on the fabric too long as with any fine garments avoid use of jagged jewelry that may cause pulls snags or creates general abrasion the future of microfiber garments the strength of microfibers make them particularly adaptable to suede or sandwashed finishes such as polyester and nylon because of their extensive fiber surfaces and use of strong fibers as such suit jackets and bottom weights are becoming increasingly available in microfiber micros are becoming increasingly the fabric of choice in clothing such as lingerie rainwear outdoor fleeces windresistant sportswear track and jogging suits many microfibers simulate the appearance of sandwashed silk and are excellent for use in utility fabrics for use in tents and sleeping bags microfiber garments are generally durable and provide longlasting wear despite their fine silklike feel

products wholesale beddingisadmin canopies are a symbol of lavishness but this romantic accessory had a decidedly utility birth in the th century the canopy which was suspended over the bed by cords from the heirloom canopies beams above from which curtains were hung was introduced out of necessity   houses had thatched roofs and there was nothing to stop things from falling into the house this posed a real problem in the bedroom where bugs and other droppings could mess up a nice clean bed hence a bed with big posts and a sheet hung over the top afforded some protection from dirt and cold canopies also had functionality outside the bedroom according to bedcanopycom “a cloth canopy called a baldachin would cover an altar or throne to distinguish religious authorities or the emperor” canopies can be as luxurious as goldentwined fabric or as simple as sheer mosquito netting to protect people from insects canopies once served as protection from the chill bugs droppings and other environmental annoyances of the past but as modern home heating technology has evolved and roofs are no longer in imminent danger of collapse canopies have shed any utilitarian meaning and have become synonymous with romance the history of canopies may be functional but a canopy from innstyle is anything but strictly utility innstyle carries handtied canopies that are flat or arched with six

luxurious than highquality terry cloth towels through innstyle microcotton® hotel collection towels how lavish it feels to wrap ones self in a soft absorbent fluffy bath towel right after a long hot soak or shower but not all towels are created equal here’s how to find the right one for you   terry cloth is a fabric with uncut loops or pile deliberately standing away from its ground base terry cloth is woven using two warp beams the ground warp which forms the base of the towel and the pile warp which creates the loops of thread that give the fabric its texture and function these loops effectively increase the surface area of the fabric enhancing its absorbency while maintaining a soft feel terry cloth is traditionally made from cotton but it can also be made from different materials such as silk linen or other natural and artificial fibers most manufacturers choose cotton because unlike other materials that get weaker in water cotton’s absorbent fiber gets stronger when wet in fact cotton can absorb  to  times its own weight in water the loop pile acts as a sponge while withstanding squeezing pulling rubbing twisting and turning because of its absorbency attributes terry cloth is commonly used for towels bathrobes beach coverups athletic warmups and headbands terry cloth can easily be dyed or printed as well as decoratively embroidered terry cloth towels from

sic code  by peter c morales the bed and breakfast is a niche segment of the travel industry as part of this industry bed and breakfasts are identified as a private residence that provides a room and a breakfast while the terms “b and b’s” and “inns” are often used interchangeably the professional association of innkeepers international paii differentiates between the two in that the former offers only breakfasts while the latter may also offer lunch and dinner the two most important factors of bed and breakfasts are their uniqueness and sense of social environment highlights of the eighth biennial bedandbreakfast  country inns paii industry study of operations marketing and finance for  show the following average number of rooms for a bed and breakfast is  up from  rooms in   of respondents offer rooms with private baths  –  of innsbed and breakfasts are nonsmoking responding inns employ  people  of bed and breakfasts have meeting rooms size of business most bed  breakfasts are operated by a family and thus have no employees for this reason limited data is available through the us census county business patterns report data on establishments with paid employees only according to the us census bureau county business patterns there were  bed  breakfast inns with paid employees  these bed  breakfasts employed  employees in  in the united states according to a survey conducted by the paii there were some  licensed inns in the united states in  bed and breakfast advertising as bed and breakfasts are shifting their attention to the business traveler so to have they have shifted the focus of their advertising to a more visible web presence ray coll president of the pittsburgh bed  breakfast association states in an article published in the pittsburgh business times that about  percent of business travelers find out about inns online this is in keeping with a survey published in  by cnnmoney online and conducted by bb getaways the survey asked how guests find out about bed and breakfasts and reported the following results  internet  word of mouth  print advertising and travel guides the survey also found that onethird of bed and breakfasts charge more than  a night characteristics of bed and breakfast operators one common characteristic of bed and breakfast operators is that the motivation for starting a bed and breakfast is their love of people another trait operators share is that most do not rely solely on the bed and breakfast as the primary source of income a paii survey revealed a national trend that  of owners surveyed depend on additional outside income impact of  among the many industries impacted by  the travel industry was probably the most affected the subsequent economic recession further hampered the industry as there was a sharp decline in the number of people traveling interestingly enough however paii reports that while most hotels suffered a  decline in occupancy bed and breakfasts only saw a decline of  despite the drop in demand there was an increase in the average daily rate paid by guests that had a net result of  growth in total revenues bed and breakfasts and the business traveler traditionally bed and breakfasts were seen as the prefect place for the weekendgetaway however this only accounted in occupancy for three nights of the week with business travelers accounting for  of the lodging industry bed and breakfasts are shifting their attention to these weekday travelers adding amenities such as inroom data ports highspeed internet connections dvd and many other trappings sought by business travelers more and more bed and breakfasts are adding meeting room space to their facilities use of these facilities is often complimentary as bed and breakfasts are becoming preferred locations for retreats a recent survey conducted by paii found  of  respondents had meeting room space in  compared to  in  bed and breakfasts with meeting rooms                       rural v urban bed and breakfasts   rural bed and breakfasts get most of their business on the weekends and in the vacation season of april through september oftentimes the rural bbs serve as a weekend getaway there are also rural bbs that are situated on wineries or operating ranches where guests may have access to wine tasting or offered horse rides in addition bed and breakfasts often partner with nearby attractions to offer vacation packages in comparison urban locales may be fully operational year round a comparable advantage for urban bbs is partnering with local chambers of commerce and companies to offer meeting room space as shown above the number of bbs offering meeting rooms is growing and to meet business peoples’ needs may offer videoconferencing capacity considerations while there is no specific governing body regulating the bed and breakfast industry they are often required to comply with federal state and local regulations of particular consideration are zoning regulations and local health and building codes additionally as many of these bed and breakfasts are located in historic areas and buildings it would behoove the operator to inquire with local historical associations

the bed  breakfast bb market “ key needs that must be met for people staying at bed and breakfast style accommodation include pampering and personalised service in an attractive location in an attractive house opposed to more standard hotelrooms the following attributes are also appealing homely or wholesome atmosphere older segments or luxuriousheritage surrounds home style meals area for conversing with other guests ability to tap into local knowledge of attractions and activities in local area guests at bbs were asked to identify the features and factors which motivated them to choose the establishment they were staying at the friendliness of the host was the most important factor followed by easy access to other places the site being the most appealing place in the region usually b  b´s are privately owned therefore very different from standard commercial hotels bed  breakfasts provide mutual benefits for both the visitor and the operator visitors have the opportunity for a relaxing break in a homely environment operators have the opportunity to develop a profitable business make new friends and contacts understand the cultures and lifestyles of others and to educate guests about their way of life income and leisure time have changed so that shorter breaks with greater choice of leisure activities are sought by travellers changing work patterns have increased the popularity of shorter breaks that minimize the absence from work and the effect of absences on workflow and involvement bed  breakfast holidays tend to be short break holidays and could benefit from the increased popularity of short breaks sought by people who aim for authenticity and personal service ” michigan state university studyedit according to a study by michigan state university “ the profile of bb guests confirms widely held impressions that this is a middleaged welleducated moderately high income professional market on the last reported bb trip couples comprised two thirds of the travel parties eightytwo percent of those sampled are married and about half  percent have children living at home average age for a travel party respondent and spousepartner ages are merged is  years with  percent under this age this indicates that many bb guests are at a midpoint in the traditional family cycle when raising children is a primary activity newlyweds and empty nesters account for a smaller proportion in fact only  percent of the market is attributed to adults over  years of age education levels are high with the largest response category being completion of a college degree  percent in addition another one third had some graduate school or an advanced degree it follows that the occupational profile is dominated by professionals and managers note that several categories such as business health education and science are large enough for bbs to consider promotion aimed specifically at these segments the unique touches that distinguish a bb are clearly a primary reason for selecting this lodging option words like charm ambience quaintness and atmosphere were often used by respondents to describe this intangible appeal the importance of the getaway aspect demonstrates that bbs have been well positioned to take advantage of shorter more frequent weekend trips preferred by many twoincome families the lure of bbs as a more personal alternative to the standard hotelmotel experience was reconfirmed by the  percent who called this the single most important reason for staying at a bb the most frequent response to this openended question customers were for the most part satisfied with their most recent bb experience with  percent giving the experience an  excellent rating and another  percent calling it good over  percent would both consider a return visit and recommend the bb to friends and family ” according to this study many bed and breakfast visitors make use of evaluations given by other guests this system of independent reviews is one of the fastest growing consumer content oriented sites on the net comscore studyedit another study suggests that people trust online reviews posted by previous guests “ people are willing to pay up to  percent more for services after reading positive online reviews about them according to new research the study conducted in october by comscore and the kelsey group found that online consumercreated reviews have a big impact on prospective buyers the researchers said  percent of those who eventually pay for local services  such as restaurants bed  breakfasts and automotive shops  read online reviews before making a choice the study showed consumers were so trusting of online reviews they were willing to pay at least  percent and up to  percent more if a company was rated excellent or fivestar than if a business received a good or fourstar rating the study was based on  survey respondents including  who used online consumer reviews professional critics and owners of companies that receive lessthanexcellent online reviews by laypersons might question the ability of regular people to adequately judge a service however the comscorekelsey group study found that  percent of the people who trusted consumerwritten reviews found the critiques to be accurate in fact noted the researchers reviews generated by fellow consumers had a greater influence than those generated by professionals the study included specific bed  breakfasts among others services at least  percent of those using online reviews for nearly every category of business included in the study said the amateur field reports significantly impacted their decision eightyseven percent of those in search of hotels said the reviews played a big part in their choice the takeaway message for service providers according to a statement issued by the kelsey groups research director steve marshall with such a large percentage of review users subsequently purchasing its vital that local service providers have a positive presence on these review sites the fact that oneinfour of those contacted said they use reviews should come as good news for those in the online consumer review space said brian jurutka senior director at comscore marketing solutions thats a sizeable chunk he said this helps them in having discussions with folks looking to advertise it says a sizeable portion of the online population is going to be visiting these sites ” journal of travel research studyedit a study by the journal of travel research stated “ while the hedonic price model has been used to evaluate willingness to pay in a variety of markets its use in the tourism industry is limited this research note highlights the usefulness of the hedonic price technique in this industry by evaluating willingness to pay for specific characteristics of bed and breakfast accommodations heterogeneity in price and amenities offered by bed and breakfast accommodations enables us to generate estimates of willingness to pay for specific characteristics using data on price and amenities collected from bed and breakfast accommodations the findings show a willingness to pay for specific characteristics such as sunny balconies a five star champagne breakfast and a room furnished with antique treasures ” prince edward island studyedit a  study on prince edward island “ the

review›  people found this helpful  out of  starsskip itbyanonon october  probable spoilers because im crankyga hausers books are always kind of weak but this one was exceptionally so many books in this genre are light fast reads and ive got no problem with that if i wanted reality id deal with my own life however bed  breakfast tries to deal with serious subjects death of a partner coming out to religious parents and just failsthere were the common mistakes like changes in verb tense punctuation issues and inconsistencies in the story for instance rons partner died less than a year ago but then its noted that his pattern of working himself ragged in the summer and retreating for the winter to drink and mourn has been the same every year since his partners death those problems are annoying yet forgivable a bad story is not every step in the plot is implausible and the whole thing adds up to crap the kid of a hyperreligious couple staying at the bb sexually assaults the  year old ron who hasnt even masturbated since his partner of  years died a year ago and ron lets him this guy has been running a business for  years and is still mourning his partner dreaming of him almost every night and hes going to let this twink who refuses to show him id but assures him that hes of age have sex with him no way and then after knowing each other for a day and a half the kid decides hes in love and people believe him other guests encourage this hes on vacation with his parents looks  yet other guests and ron are going to consider this a real relationship hell no i read it all the way to its painful chichefilled ending thinking it couldnt possibly remain so trite all the way to the end but surprise it did dont waste your time or money read more sort by topmost recenttopfilter

comments right now please try again later out of  starsi really enjoyed this bookbyrob k monteroon april  format paperbackverified purchasei really enjoyed this book it was entertaining interesting sad playful warm and funny what more could you ask for can i editorialize for a minute one reviewer said ga hausers books are all pretty weak then shy is he or she reading them a review of another book gave that book  star because they ordered it by mistake and did not read it i suspect because it had a gay theme which they had a problem with why would you rate a book you never even read  star or even bother rating it all unless you had a homophobic agenda but i digress i liked bed and breakfast and ron and ricky i found rickys parents to be a little cliche but i suppose there are parents out there who love the idea of what they think their children shoud be rather than loving them for who they are unimaginable that any parent could disown their own child and tell him to never contact them again having said all that i found this book comfortable and warm and will be rereading itcomment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abusecommentinsert
