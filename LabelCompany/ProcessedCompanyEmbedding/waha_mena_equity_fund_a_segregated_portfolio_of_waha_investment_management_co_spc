impressive returns this year aercap acquired international lease finance corporation ilfc from american international group inc aig creating significant value   aercap is now the largest aircraft leasing firm in the world with a total of  aircraft leased managed or under contract and around  billion worth of orders on its books the transaction resulted in a strong increase in earnings per
