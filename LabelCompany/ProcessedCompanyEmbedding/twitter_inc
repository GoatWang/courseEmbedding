object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate

information timeline of twitter creation and initial reaction a sketch c  by jack dorsey envisioning an smsbased social network twitters origins lie in a daylong brainstorming session held by board members of the podcasting company odeo jack dorsey then an undergraduate student at new york university introduced the idea of an individual using an sms service to communicate with a small group the original project code name for the service was twttr an idea that williams later ascribed to noah glass inspired by flickr and the fivecharacter length of american sms short codes the decision was also partly due to the fact that domain twittercom was already in use and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to twitter the developers initially considered  as a short code but later changed it to  for ease of use and memorability work on the project started on march   when dorsey published the first twitter message at  pm pacific standard time pst just setting up my twttr dorsey has explained the origin of the twitter title we came across the word twitter and it was just perfect the definition was a short burst of inconsequential information and chirps from birds and thats exactly what the product was the first twitter prototype developed by dorsey and contractor florian weber was used as an internal service for odeo employees and the full version was introduced publicly on july   in october  biz stone evan williams dorsey and other members of odeo formed obvious corporation and acquired odeo together with its assets—including odeocom and twittercom—from the investors and shareholders williams fired glass who was silent about his part in twitters startup until  twitter spun off into its own company in april  williams provided insight into the ambiguity that defined this early period in a  interview with twitter it wasnt clear what it was they called it a social network they called it microblogging but it was hard to define because it didnt replace anything there was this path of discovery with something like that where over time you figure out what it is twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning which we described as status updates and a social utility it is that in part but the insight we eventually came to was twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network the tipping point for twitters popularity was the  south by southwest interactive sxswi conference during the event twitter usage increased from  tweets per day to  the twitter people cleverly placed two inch plasma screens in the conference hallways exclusively streaming twitter messages remarked newsweeks steven levy hundreds of conferencegoers kept

selfpromotion –  spam –  news –  despite jack dorseys own open contention that a message on twitter is a short burst of inconsequential information social networking researcher danah boyd responded to the pear analytics survey by arguing that what the pear researchers labelled pointless babble is better characterized as social grooming andor peripheral awareness which she justifies as persons wanting to know what the people around them are thinking and doing and feeling even when copresence isnt viable similarly a survey of twitter users found that a more specific social role of passing

gladlycast exists for mobile phone users in singapore and malaysia the tweets were set to a largely constrictive character limit for compatibility with sms messaging introducing the shorthand notation and slang commonly used in sms messages the character limit also increased the usage of url shortening services such as bitly googl and trim and contenthosting services such as twitpic memozucom and

topic these topics help twitter and their users to understand what is happening in the world and what peoples opinions are about it trending topics are sometimes the result of concerted efforts and manipulations by preteen and teenaged fans of certain celebrities or cultural phenomena particularly musicians like lady gaga known as little monsters justin bieber beliebers rihanna rih navy and one direction directioners and novel series twilight twihards and harry potter potterheads twitter has altered the trend algorithm in the past to prevent manipulation of this type with limited success the

verified account a verified twitter account formally validates the identity of the person or company that owns the account—the aim of the verified status is to prove that a realworld person or company is not being impersonated through the placement of a small blue checkmark by the topright corner of a users page or next to the username in the platforms search function twitter is responsible for assigning the blue checkmark and it is frequently applied to the accounts of notable people in politics music movies business fashion government sports media and journalism the owners of verified accounts can also access additional features that are not available to standard twitteraccount holders these features include the ability to choose how their notifications and mentions are presented

their followers and their involvement on twitter the ability to receive direct messages from all followers or only selected followers verified status does not imply that twitter continuously checks whether such accounts have been hacked the account of tesla motors for example was impersonated briefly in  some users have tried to impersonate verified accounts without hacking them by placing the checkmark in their background images twitter referred to this as a breach of their rules and introduced a design update to make this more difficult in july  twitter began allowing anyone to apply for

– requests per second per host this boost was greater than the x improvement that twitters engineers envisioned when starting the switch the continued development of twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls individual tweets are registered under unique ids using software called snowflake and geolocation data is added using rockdove the url shortner tco then checks for a spam link and shortens the url next the tweets are stored in a mysql database using gizzard and the user receives acknowledgement that the tweets were sent tweets are then sent to search engines via the firehose api the process itself is managed by flockdb and takes an average of  ms on august   twitters vice president of platform engineering raffi krikorian shared in a blog post that the companys infrastructure handled almost  tweets per second during that week setting a

advertisers can target users based on their history of tweets and may quote tweets in ads directed specifically to the user a security vulnerability was reported on april   by nitesh dhanjani and rujith since twitter used the phone number of the sender of an sms message as authentication malicious users could update someone elses status page by using sms spoofing the vulnerability could be

kinugawa who was using it to create coloured tweets kinugawa a japanese developer reported the xss vulnerability to twitter on august  later when he found it was exploitable again he created the account rainbowtwtr and used it to post coloured messages delphin says he exposed the security flaw by tweeting a javascript function for onmouseover and holm later created and posted the xss worm

competition with some of its most wellknown rdparty developers and in  twitter introduced strict usage limits for its api completely crippling some developers while these moves successfully increased

connected as they grapple with checkin messages at odd hours higher cellphone bills and the need to tell acquaintances to stop announcing what theyre having for dinner the following year john c dvorak described twitter as the new cb radio emergency use a practical use for twitters realtime functionality is as an effective de facto emergency communication system for breaking news it was neither intended nor designed for highperformance communication but the idea that it could be used for emergency communication was not lost on the creators who knew that the service could have widereaching effects early on when the company used it to communicate during earthquakes another practical use that is being studied is twitters ability to track epidemics and how they spread in addition twitter has acted as a sensor for automatic response to natural disasters such as bush fires education twitter has been adopted as a communication and learning tool in educational and research settings mostly in colleges and universities it has been used as a backchannel to promote student interactions especially in largelecture courses research has found that using twitter in college courses helps students communicate with each other and faculty promotes informal learning allows shy students a forum for increased participation increases student engagement and improves overall course grades

products and political agendas by automatically generating mass amounts of tweets through imitating human communication the new york times states they have sleepwake cycles so their fakery is more convincing making them less prone to repetitive patterns that flag them as mere programs the tweets generated vary anywhere from a simple automated response to content creation and information sharing all of which depends on the intention of the person purchasing or creating the bot the social implications these twitterbots potentially have on human perception are sizeable according to a study published by the sciencedirect journal looking at the computers as social actors casa paradigm the journal notes people exhibit remarkable social reactions to computers and other media treating them as if they were real people or real places the study concluded that twitterbots were viewed as credible and competent in communication and interaction making them suitable for transmitting information in the social media sphere while the technological advances have enabled the ability of successful humancomputer interaction the implications are questioned due to the appearance of both benign and malicious bots in the twitter realm benign twitterbots may generate creative content and relevant product updates whereas malicious bots can make unpopular people seem popular push irrelevant products on users and spread misinformation spam andor slander in addition to content generating bots users can purchase followers favorites retweets and comments on various websites that cater to expanding a users image through accumulation of followers with more followers users profiles gain more attention thus increasing their popularity generating web traffic is a valuable commodity for both individuals and businesses because it indicates notability with twitterbots users are able to create the illusion of buzz on their site by obtaining followers from services such as swenzy and underground suppliers who operate bot farms or click farms the companies that facilitate this service create fake twitter accounts that follow a number of people some of these twitter accounts may even post fake tweets to make it seem like they are real this practice of obtaining mass amounts of twitterbots as followers is not permitted on twitter the emphasis on followers and likes as a measure of social capital has urged people to extend their circle to weak and latent ties to promote the idea of popularity for celebrities politicians musicians public figures and companies alike according to the new york times bots amass significant influence and have been noted to sway elections influence the stock market public appeal and attack governments gchq according to documents

twitter creation and initial reaction a sketch c  by jack dorsey envisioning an smsbased social network twitters origins lie in a daylong brainstorming session held by board members of the podcasting company odeo jack dorsey then an undergraduate student at new york university introduced the idea of an individual using an sms service to communicate with a small group the original project code name for the service was twttr an idea that williams later ascribed to noah glass inspired by flickr and the fivecharacter length of american sms short codes the decision was also partly due to the fact that domain twittercom was already in use and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to twitter the developers initially considered  as a short code but later changed it to  for ease of use and memorability work on the project started on march   when dorsey published the first twitter message at  pm pacific standard time pst just setting up my twttr dorsey has explained the origin of the twitter title we came across the word twitter and it was just perfect the definition was a short burst of inconsequential information and chirps from birds and thats exactly what the product was the first twitter prototype developed by dorsey and contractor florian weber was used as an internal service for odeo employees and the full version was introduced publicly on july   in october  biz stone evan williams dorsey and other members of odeo formed obvious corporation and acquired odeo together with its assets—including odeocom and twittercom—from the investors and shareholders williams fired glass who was silent about his part in twitters startup until  twitter spun off into its own company in april  williams provided insight into the ambiguity that defined this early period in a  interview with twitter it wasnt clear what it was they called it a social network they called it microblogging but it was hard to define because it didnt replace anything there was this path of discovery with something like that where over time you figure out what it is twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning which we described as status updates and a social utility it is that in part but the insight we eventually came to was twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network the tipping point for twitters popularity was the  south by southwest interactive sxswi conference during the event twitter usage increased from  tweets per day to  the twitter people cleverly placed two inch plasma screens in the conference hallways exclusively streaming twitter messages remarked newsweeks steven levy hundreds of conferencegoers kept tabs on each other via

been compared to a webbased internet relay chat irc client in a  time essay technology author steven johnson described the basic mechanics of twitter as remarkably simple as a social network twitter revolves around the principle of followers when you choose to follow another twitter user that users tweets appear in reverse chronological order on your main twitter page if you follow  people youll

selfpromotion –  spam –  news –  despite jack dorseys own open contention that a message on twitter is a short burst of inconsequential information social networking researcher danah boyd responded to the pear analytics survey by arguing that what the pear researchers labelled pointless babble is better characterized as social grooming andor peripheral awareness which she justifies as persons wanting to know what the people around them are thinking and doing and feeling even when copresence isnt viable similarly a survey of twitter users found that a more specific social role of passing along messages that include a hyperlink is an expectation of reciprocal linking by followers format retweet and twitter hashtag redirect here for more about hashtags see hashtag further information mention blogging §  at sign users can group posts together by topic or type by use of hashtags – words or phrases prefixed with a  sign similarly the  sign followed by a username is used for

for the united states canada india new zealand and an isle of manbased number for international use there is also a short code in the united kingdom which is only accessible to those on the vodafone o and orange networks in india since twitter only supports tweets from bharti airtel an alternative platform called smstweet was set up by a user to work on all networks a similar platform called gladlycast exists for mobile phone users in singapore and malaysia the tweets were set to a largely constrictive character limit for compatibility with sms messaging introducing the shorthand notation and slang commonly used in sms messages the character limit also increased the usage of url shortening services such as bitly googl and trim and contenthosting services such as twitpic memozucom and notepub to accommodate multimedia content and text longer than  characters since june  twitter has used its own tco domain for automatic shortening of all urls posted on its website making other link shorteners superfluous for staying within the  character limit on may   twitter announced that media such as photos and videos and the persons handle would not count against the  character limit a user photo post used to count for about  characters attachments and links will also no longer be part of the character limit on july   twitter launched a new way for advertisers to target users that have tweeted with a certain emoji or engaged with tweets with a certain emoji trending topics countries and cities with local trending topics in twitter a word phrase or topic that is mentioned at a greater rate than others is said to be a trending topic trending topics become popular either through a concerted effort by users or because of an event that prompts people to talk about a specific topic these topics help twitter and their users to understand what is happening in the world and what peoples opinions are about it trending topics are sometimes the result of concerted efforts and manipulations by preteen and teenaged fans of certain celebrities or cultural phenomena particularly musicians like lady gaga known as little monsters justin bieber beliebers rihanna rih navy and one direction directioners and novel series twilight twihards and harry potter potterheads twitter has altered the trend algorithm in the past to prevent manipulation of this type with limited success the twitter web interface displays a list of trending topics on a sidebar on the home page along with sponsored content see image twitter often censors trending hashtags that are claimed to be abusive or offensive twitter censored the thatsafrican and thingsdarkiessay hashtags after users complained that they found the hashtags offensive there are allegations that twitter removed namoinhyd from the

applications based on an analysis of  million tweets by sysomos verified accounts the official twitter profile of twitter inc the blue check mark right of the profile name confirms that it is a verified account a verified twitter account formally validates the identity of the person or company that owns the account—the aim of the verified status is to prove that a realworld person or company is not being impersonated through the placement of a small blue checkmark by the topright corner of a users page or next to the username in the platforms search function twitter is responsible for assigning the blue checkmark and it is frequently applied to the accounts of notable people in politics music movies business fashion government sports media and journalism the owners of verified accounts can also access additional features that are not available to standard twitteraccount holders these features include the ability to choose how their notifications and mentions are presented since verified accounts typically receive a lot of followers account holders can filter these notices based on whether or not they are from verified accounts the ability to view information about their followers and their involvement on twitter the ability to receive direct messages from all followers or only selected followers verified status does not imply that twitter continuously checks whether such accounts have been hacked the account of tesla motors for example was impersonated briefly in  some users have tried to impersonate verified accounts without hacking them by placing the checkmark in their background images twitter referred to this as a breach of their rules and introduced a design update to make this more difficult in july  twitter began allowing anyone to apply for

and a customizable hashtag technology implementation twitter places great reliance on opensource software the twitter web interface uses the ruby on rails framework deployed on a performance enhanced ruby enterprise edition implementation of ruby in the early days of twitter tweets were stored in mysql databases that were temporally sharded large databases were split based on time of posting after the huge volume of tweets coming in caused problems reading from and writing to these databases the company decided that the system needed reengineering as of april   twitter engineers confirmed they had switched away from their ruby on rails search stack to a java server they call blender from spring  to  the messages were handled by a ruby persistent queue server called starling but since  implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in scala the switch from ruby to scala and the jvm has given twitter a performance boost from – requests per second per host to around – requests per second per host this boost was greater than the x improvement that twitters engineers envisioned when starting the switch the continued development of twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls individual tweets are registered under unique ids using software called snowflake and geolocation data is added using rockdove the url shortner tco then checks for a spam link and shortens the url next the tweets are stored in a mysql database using gizzard and the user receives acknowledgement that the tweets were sent tweets are then sent to search engines via the firehose api the process itself is managed by flockdb and takes an average of  ms on august   twitters vice president of platform engineering raffi krikorian shared in a blog post that the companys infrastructure handled almost  tweets per second during that week setting a

advertisers can target users based on their history of tweets and may quote tweets in ads directed specifically to the user a security vulnerability was reported on april   by nitesh dhanjani and rujith since twitter used the phone number of the sender of an sms message as authentication malicious users could update someone elses status page by using sms spoofing the vulnerability could be

an attack on the westgate shopping mall in nairobi in september  in january  twitter was sued by the widow of a us man killed in the amman shooting attack claiming that allowing the islamic state of iraq and the levant isil to continually use the platform including direct messages in particular constituted the provision of material support to a terrorist organization which is illegal under us federal law twitter disputed the claim stating that violent threats and the promotion of terrorism deserve no place on twitter and like other social networks our rules make that clear the lawsuit was dismissed by the united states district court for the northern district of california upholding the section  safe harbor which dictates that the operators of an interactive computer service are not liable for the content published by its users the lawsuit was revised in august  providing comparisons to other telecommunications devices on may   twitter suspended multiple parody accounts that

started a hashtag critical of clintons fundraising from wealthy donors impact instant short and frequent communication in may  the wall street journal wrote that social networking services such as twitter elicit mixed feelings in the technologysavvy people who have been their early adopters fans say they are a good way to keep in touch with busy friends but some users are starting to feel too connected as they grapple with checkin messages at odd hours higher cellphone bills and the need to tell acquaintances to stop announcing what theyre having for dinner the following year john c dvorak described twitter as the new cb radio emergency use a practical use for twitters realtime functionality is as an effective de facto emergency communication system for breaking news it was neither intended nor designed for highperformance communication but the idea that it could be used for emergency communication was not lost on the creators who knew that the service could have widereaching effects early on when the company used it to communicate during earthquakes another practical use that is being studied is twitters ability to track epidemics and how they spread in addition twitter has acted as a sensor for automatic response to natural disasters such as bush fires education twitter has been adopted as a communication and learning tool in educational and research settings mostly in colleges and universities it has been used as a backchannel to promote student interactions especially in largelecture courses research has found that using twitter in college courses helps students communicate with each other and faculty promotes informal learning allows shy students a forum for increased participation increases student engagement and improves overall course grades public figures tech writer bruce sterling commented in  that using twitter for literate communication is about as likely as firing up a cb radio and hearing some guy recite the iliad in september  the journalist clive thompson mused in a new york times magazine editorial that the service had expanded narcissism into a new supermetabolic extreme—the ultimate expression of a generation of celebrityaddled youths who believe their every utterance is fascinating and ought to be shared with the world one of the earliest documented forms of celebrityrelated twitterlike disclosures dates from  when real estate mogul william desmond ryan made roundtheclock press releases about his relationship with comedian phyllis diller even revealing what she was making him for dinner on a nightly basis conversely vancouver sun columnist steve dotto opined that part of twitters appeal is the challenge of trying to publish such messages in tight constraints and jonathan zittrain professor of internet law at harvard law school said that the qualities that make twitter seem inane and halfbaked are what makes it so powerful the novelist rick moody wrote a short story for electric literature called some contemporary characters composed entirely of tweets in  nielsen online reported that twitter had a userretention rate of forty percent many people stop using the service after a month therefore the site may potentially reach only about ten percent of all internet users in  twitter won the breakout of the year webby award during a february  discussion on national public radios weekend edition the journalist daniel schorr stated that twitter accounts of events lacked rigorous factchecking and other editorial improvements in response andy carvin gave schorr two examples of breaking news stories that played out on twitter and said users wanted firsthand accounts and sometimes debunked stories on november   twitter was named the word of the year by the global language monitor declaring it a new form of social interaction time magazine acknowledged its growing level of influence in its  time  to determine the influence of people it used a formula based on famous social networking sites twitter and facebook the list ranges from barack obama and oprah winfrey to lady gaga and ashton kutcher the us government seeing social medias role in the  arab spring revolts covertly developed a cuban alternative to twitter called zunzuneo as part of a longterm strategy to stir unrest the service was active from  to  during the  summer olympics opening ceremony in which he appeared at the london olympic stadium in person sir tim bernerslee the founder of the world wide web tweeted this is for everyone which was instantly spelled out in lcd lights attached to the chairs of the  people in the audience world leaders world leaders and their diplomats have taken note of twitters rapid expansion and have been increasingly utilizing twitter diplomacy the use of twitter to engage with foreign publics and their own citizens us ambassador to russia michael a mcfaul has been attributed as a pioneer of international twitter diplomacy he used twitter after becoming ambassador in  posting in english and russian on october   queen elizabeth ii sent her first tweet to mark the opening of the london science museums information age exhibition a  study by website twiplomacy found that  of the  countries represented at the united nations had established government twitter accounts the same study also found that those accounts amounted to  twitter handles used by world leaders and their foreign ministers with their tweets able to reach a combined audience of over  million followers according to an analysis of accounts the heads of state of  countries and  other leading politicians have twitter accounts that have between them sent more than  tweets and have almost  million followers however only  of these do their own tweeting more than

papal conclave pope benedict xvis twitter account was set up in  as of april  his successor pope francis has  million followers of his twitter account pontifex in  astrophysicist neil degrasse tyson caused a controversy among conservative christians with a christmas tweet celebrating the birth of isaac newton twitterbot effect twitterbots are capable of influencing public opinion about culture products and political agendas by automatically generating mass amounts of tweets through imitating human communication the new york times states they have sleepwake cycles so their fakery is more convincing making them less prone to repetitive patterns that flag them as mere programs the tweets generated vary anywhere from a simple automated response to content creation and information sharing all of which depends on the intention of the person purchasing or creating the bot the social implications these twitterbots potentially have on human perception are sizeable according to a study published by the sciencedirect journal looking at the computers as social actors casa paradigm the journal notes people exhibit remarkable social reactions to computers and other media treating them as if they were real people or real places the study concluded that twitterbots were viewed as credible and competent in communication and interaction making them suitable for transmitting information in the social media sphere while the technological advances have enabled the ability of successful humancomputer interaction the implications are questioned due to the appearance of both benign and malicious bots in the twitter realm benign twitterbots may generate creative content and relevant product updates whereas malicious bots can make unpopular people seem popular push irrelevant products on users and spread misinformation spam andor slander in addition to content generating bots users can purchase followers favorites retweets and comments on various websites that cater to expanding a users image through accumulation of followers with more followers users profiles gain more attention thus increasing their popularity generating web traffic is a valuable commodity for both individuals and businesses because it indicates notability with twitterbots users are able to create the illusion of buzz on their site by obtaining followers from services such as swenzy and underground suppliers who operate bot farms or click farms the companies that facilitate this service create fake twitter accounts that follow a number of people some of these twitter accounts may even post fake tweets to make it seem like they are real this practice of obtaining mass amounts of twitterbots as followers is not permitted on twitter the emphasis on followers and likes as a measure of social capital has urged people to extend their circle to weak and latent ties to promote the idea of popularity for celebrities politicians musicians public figures and companies alike according to the new york times bots amass significant influence and have been noted to sway elections influence the stock market public appeal and attack governments gchq according to documents leaked by edward snowden and published in july  the united kingdoms gchq has a tool named birdsong for automated posting of twitter updates and a tool named birdstrike for twitter monitoring and profile collection television twitter is also increasingly used for making tv more interactive and social this effect is sometimes referred to as the second screen virtual watercooler or social television—the practice has been called chatterboxing twitter has been successfully used to encourage people to watch live tv events such as the oscars the super bowl and the mtv video music awards however this strategy has proven less effective with regularly scheduled tv shows such direct crosspromotions have been banned from french television due to regulations against secret advertising in

for quickly building momentum for say a new store location or product here are tips on how to jumpstart a new launch in  characters or less by minda zetlin minda zetlin is a business technology writer

the geek gapmindazetlin  comments credit until last year nap incs best known product line was its sleepy wrap baby carrier but when the company launched the boba baby carrier last year it focused its efforts on social media especially twitter prior to that we were just using traditional online and print advertising says ashley jewell director of social media marketing for nap we went from having one follower to selling out our whole inventory in a matter of weeks naps experience shows what some marketing experts already know twitter is an incredibly powerful tool for creating buzz and an ideal way to get customers attention for a new product service company or location  twitter today has  million active users and  new users per day thats an astonishing shift from something that used to be a niche outpost notes dallas lawrence managing director for bursonmarstellers proof integrated communications agency and he says twitter continues to evolve in the last six months weve witnessed dramatic maturation for twitter its grown from a platform driven by press releases to a true social platform that values information sharing and transparent corporate leadership so how do you make the best use of twitters astounding power to reach your customers use your peacetime wisely this motto comes from lawrences expertise in crisis communications but it applies just as well to product launches and other big announcements the point is that the launch of your new product or service should not be the first time your twitter followers hear from you instead use the quiet time before the product launch to begin tweeting regularly and develop an identity before asking anything of users online companies need to build credibility that they are committed to a sustained dialogue lawrence says how do you do that listen before speaking thats probably more important in the twittersphere than any other social media platform lawrence says this means retweeting useful or interesting information paying attention to anything being said about your company or brand and immediately responding to any problems complaints or questions anyone has about it you should also seek to provide interesting information that relates to your product or industry  or your community your dialogue has to provide value lawrence says even if youre a pizza shop you can use your twitter account to highlight good things local charities are doing or even a local boy scout troop make twitter your testing ground i really dont think i would have an online magazine if it werent for twitter says alexis wolfer founder and editorinchief of thebeautybeancom an online beauty and health magazine for women that gets about  unique visitors per month i was working in an editorial job parttime and finishing graduate school and i wrote my thesis on womens magazines and their influence on body image she explains and i started posting health beauty and nutrition tips on twitter they were much like what womens magazines would provide except i took out all the focus on weight loss it was all about healthy living and in one month i had  followers wolfer had already thought about starting an online magazine offering health and beauty tips without weight loss advice had i not received the twitter response that i did it would have been much slower to develop but the response i got from twitter in particular made me feel there were other women out there looking for healthy living information wolfer who launched thebeautybeancom this past january more recently used twitter to try out a new idea makeup free mondays which started as a tradition around thebeautybeans office it was in line with our online message to promote inner beauty while still being glamorous and a place for women to get their beauty and fashion fix wolfer says we started tweeting about it and we had a ton of people retweet about it responses came in from around the globe and when thebeautybean officially launched makeup free mondays as an online movement in may it drew a lot of attention from celebrities and the media we asked people to send pictures of themselves without makeup and our inbox was flooded wolfer says connect with influencers who can help you for every product industry or topic there are influential twitter users whose tweeting about your new product can make a big difference either because they have a large number of followers or highly influential followers represent your biggest customers such as a retail chain that might carry your product or write an influential blog start with the top  people you want to engage with lawrence advises if you follow them by and large you will follow you back which says they are willing to be engaged in a dialogue this is not the time to start a oneway marketing push he cautions instead begin a dialogue and offer something of value such as a free sample of your product for the influencers to try out or an exclusive discount they can share with their followers or blog readers you can also use invite these influencers to judge contests and host tweetups or other events were doing a twitter party for sleepy wrap and we have a mom blogger whos posted about it on her blog and invited people to rsvp when they do theyre given the details on the time and hashtag for the party jewell says the blogger will also select party attendees to receive some giveaway items that nap is providing think beyond twitter twitter though very powerful is very limiting with no opportunity to advertise at least for the moment no way to directly incorporate photos or videos and of course a draconian character limit so lawrence recommends a multipronged approach that gives you several possible points of contact with customers he particular likes directing them to facebook where you can have tiein advertising images and video integrated right into the platform and can write longer posts jewell on the other hand likes using twitter as a central place from which to leak new designs or new product news and otherwise connect with customers but customers are also encouraged to like naps product lines on facebook and like lawrence she recommends a multipronged approach that also includes both facebook and twitter either way wolfer says using twitter to connect with customers is so easy it doesnt make sense not to do it most small business owners ive met have smartphones that have twitter capabilities it doesnt take much time to write  characters if youve got a few minutes to kill before a meeting why not it can only help like

information timeline of twitter creation and initial reaction a sketch c  by jack dorsey envisioning an smsbased social network twitters origins lie in a daylong brainstorming session held by board members of the podcasting company odeo jack dorsey then an undergraduate student at new york university introduced the idea of an individual using an sms service to communicate with a small group the original project code name for the service was twttr an idea that williams later ascribed to noah glass inspired by flickr and the fivecharacter length of american sms short codes the decision was also partly due to the fact that domain twittercom was already in use and it was six months after the launch of twttr that the crew purchased the domain and changed the name of the service to twitter the developers initially considered  as a short code but later changed it to  for ease of use and memorability work on the project started on march   when dorsey published the first twitter message at  pm pacific standard time pst just setting up my twttr dorsey has explained the origin of the twitter title we came across the word twitter and it was just perfect the definition was a short burst of inconsequential information and chirps from birds and thats exactly what the product was the first twitter prototype developed by dorsey and contractor florian weber was used as an internal service for odeo employees and the full version was introduced publicly on july   in october  biz stone evan williams dorsey and other members of odeo formed obvious corporation and acquired odeo together with its assets—including odeocom and twittercom—from the investors and shareholders williams fired glass who was silent about his part in twitters startup until  twitter spun off into its own company in april  williams provided insight into the ambiguity that defined this early period in a  interview with twitter it wasnt clear what it was they called it a social network they called it microblogging but it was hard to define because it didnt replace anything there was this path of discovery with something like that where over time you figure out what it is twitter actually changed from what we thought it was in the beginning which we described as status updates and a social utility it is that in part but the insight we eventually came to was twitter was really more of an information network than it is a social network the tipping point for twitters popularity was the  south by southwest interactive sxswi conference during the event twitter usage increased from  tweets per day to  the twitter people cleverly placed two inch plasma screens in the conference hallways exclusively streaming twitter messages remarked newsweeks steven levy hundreds of conferencegoers kept tabs on each other via constant twitters panelists and speakers mentioned the service and the bloggers in attendance touted it reaction at the conference was highly positive blogger scott beale said

twitter as of march  that was about  million tweets posted daily as noted on competecom twitter moved up to the thirdhighestranking social networking site in january  from its previous rank of twentysecond jack dorsey cofounder and ceo of twitter in  twitters usage spikes during prominent events for example a record was set during the  fifa world cup when fans wrote  tweets per second in the thirtysecond period after japan scored against cameroon on june  the record was broken again when  tweets per second were posted after the los angeles lakers victory in the  nba finals on june

selfpromotion –  spam –  news –  despite jack dorseys own open contention that a message on twitter is a short burst of inconsequential information social networking researcher danah boyd responded to the pear analytics survey by arguing that what the pear researchers labelled pointless babble is better characterized as social grooming andor peripheral awareness which she justifies as persons wanting to know what the people around them are thinking and doing and feeling even when copresence isnt viable similarly a survey of twitter users found that a more specific social role of passing along messages that include a hyperlink is an expectation of reciprocal linking by followers format retweet and twitter hashtag redirect here for more about hashtags see hashtag further information

gladlycast exists for mobile phone users in singapore and malaysia the tweets were set to a largely constrictive character limit for compatibility with sms messaging introducing the shorthand notation and slang commonly used in sms messages the character limit also increased the usage of url shortening services such as bitly googl and trim and contenthosting services such as twitpic memozucom and notepub to accommodate multimedia content and text longer than  characters since june  twitter has used its own tco domain for automatic shortening of all urls posted on its website making other link

user photo post used to count for about  characters attachments and links will also no longer be part of the character limit on july   twitter launched a new way for advertisers to target users that have tweeted with a certain emoji or engaged with tweets with a certain emoji trending topics countries and cities with local trending topics in twitter a word phrase or topic that is mentioned at a greater rate than others is said to be a trending topic trending topics become popular either through a concerted effort by users or because of an event that prompts people to talk about a specific topic these topics help twitter and their users to understand what is happening in the world and what peoples opinions are about it trending topics are sometimes the result of concerted efforts and manipulations by preteen and teenaged fans of certain celebrities or cultural phenomena particularly musicians like lady gaga known as little monsters justin bieber beliebers rihanna rih navy and one direction directioners and novel series twilight twihards and harry potter potterheads twitter has altered the trend algorithm in the past to prevent manipulation of this type with limited success the

applications based on an analysis of  million tweets by sysomos verified accounts the official twitter profile of twitter inc the blue check mark right of the profile name confirms that it is a verified account a verified twitter account formally validates the identity of the person or company that owns the account—the aim of the verified status is to prove that a realworld person or company is not being impersonated through the placement of a small blue checkmark by the topright corner of a users page or next to the username in the platforms search function twitter is responsible for assigning the blue checkmark and it is frequently applied to the accounts of notable people in politics music movies business fashion government sports media and journalism the owners of verified accounts can also access additional features that are not available to standard twitteraccount holders these features include the ability to choose how their notifications and mentions are presented since verified accounts typically receive a lot of followers account holders can filter these notices based on whether or not they are from verified accounts the ability to view information about their followers and their involvement on twitter the ability to receive direct messages from all followers or only selected followers verified status does not imply that twitter continuously checks whether such accounts have been hacked the account of tesla motors for example was impersonated briefly in  some users have tried to impersonate verified accounts without hacking them by placing the checkmark in their background images twitter referred to this as a breach of their rules and introduced a design update to make this more difficult in july  twitter began allowing anyone to apply for

ruby enterprise edition implementation of ruby in the early days of twitter tweets were stored in mysql databases that were temporally sharded large databases were split based on time of posting after the huge volume of tweets coming in caused problems reading from and writing to these databases the company decided that the system needed reengineering as of april   twitter engineers confirmed they had switched away from their ruby on rails search stack to a java server they call blender from spring  to  the messages were handled by a ruby persistent queue server called starling but since  implementation has been gradually replaced with software written in scala the switch from ruby to scala and the jvm has given twitter a performance boost from – requests per second per host to around – requests per second per host this boost was greater than the x improvement that twitters engineers envisioned when starting the switch the continued development of twitter has also involved a switch from monolithic development of a single app to an architecture where different services are built independently and joined through remote procedure calls individual tweets are registered under unique ids using software called snowflake and geolocation data is added using rockdove the url shortner tco then checks for a spam link and shortens the url next the tweets are stored in a mysql database using gizzard and the user receives acknowledgement that the tweets were sent tweets are then sent to search engines via the firehose api the process itself is managed by flockdb and takes an average

advertisers can target users based on their history of tweets and may quote tweets in ads directed specifically to the user a security vulnerability was reported on april   by nitesh dhanjani and rujith since twitter used the phone number of the sender of an sms message as authentication malicious users could update someone elses status page by using sms spoofing the vulnerability could be

malicious subscriptions in response to twitters security breaches the us federal trade commission ftc brought charges against the service the charges were settled on june   this was the first time the

developers built upon the public api to create the first twitter mobile phone clients as well as the first url shortener between  and  however twitter made a number of decisions that were received unfavorably by the developer community in  twitter mandated that all developers adopt oauth authentication with just  weeks of notice later that year twitter launched its own url shortener in direct competition with some of its most wellknown rdparty developers and in  twitter introduced strict usage limits for its api completely crippling some developers while these moves successfully increased

iraq and the levant isil to continually use the platform including direct messages in particular constituted the provision of material support to a terrorist organization which is illegal under us federal law twitter disputed the claim stating that violent threats and the promotion of terrorism deserve no place on twitter and like other social networks our rules make that clear the lawsuit was dismissed by the united states district court for the northern district of california upholding the section  safe harbor which dictates that the operators of an interactive computer service are not liable for the content published by its users the lawsuit was revised in august  providing comparisons to other telecommunications devices on may   twitter suspended multiple parody accounts that

started a hashtag critical of clintons fundraising from wealthy donors impact instant short and frequent communication in may  the wall street journal wrote that social networking services such as twitter elicit mixed feelings in the technologysavvy people who have been their early adopters fans say they are a good way to keep in touch with busy friends but some users are starting to feel too connected as they grapple with checkin messages at odd hours higher cellphone bills and the need to tell acquaintances to stop announcing what theyre having for dinner the following year john c dvorak described twitter as the new cb radio emergency use a practical use for twitters realtime functionality is as an effective de facto emergency communication system for breaking news it was neither intended nor designed for highperformance communication but the idea that it could be used for emergency communication was not lost on the creators who knew that the service could have widereaching effects early on when the company used it to communicate during earthquakes another practical use that is being studied is twitters ability to track epidemics and how they spread in addition twitter has acted as a sensor for automatic response to natural disasters such as bush fires education twitter has been adopted as a communication and learning tool in educational and research settings mostly in colleges and universities it has been used as a backchannel to promote student interactions especially in largelecture courses research has found that using twitter in college courses helps students communicate with each other and faculty promotes informal learning allows shy students a forum for increased participation increases student engagement and improves overall course grades public figures tech writer bruce sterling commented in  that using twitter for literate communication is about as likely as firing up a cb radio and hearing some guy recite the iliad in september  the journalist clive thompson mused in a new york times magazine editorial that the service had expanded narcissism into a new supermetabolic extreme—the ultimate expression of a generation of celebrityaddled youths who believe their every utterance is fascinating and ought to be shared with the world one of the earliest documented forms of celebrityrelated twitterlike disclosures dates from  when real estate mogul william desmond ryan made roundtheclock press releases about his relationship with comedian phyllis diller even revealing what she was making him for dinner on a nightly basis conversely vancouver sun columnist steve dotto opined that part of twitters appeal is the challenge of trying to publish such messages in tight constraints and jonathan zittrain professor of internet law at harvard law school said that the qualities that make twitter seem inane and halfbaked are what makes it so powerful the novelist rick moody wrote a short story for electric literature called some contemporary characters composed entirely of tweets in  nielsen online reported that twitter had a userretention rate of forty percent many people stop using the service after a month therefore the site may potentially reach only about ten percent of all internet users in  twitter won the breakout of the year webby award during a february  discussion on national public radios

social networking sites twitter and facebook the list ranges from barack obama and oprah winfrey to lady gaga and ashton kutcher the us government seeing social medias role in the  arab spring revolts covertly developed a cuban alternative to twitter called zunzuneo as part of a longterm strategy to stir unrest the service was active from  to  during the  summer olympics opening ceremony in which

becoming ambassador in  posting in english and russian on october   queen elizabeth ii sent her first tweet to mark the opening of the london science museums information age exhibition a  study by

caused a controversy among conservative christians with a christmas tweet celebrating the birth of isaac newton twitterbot effect twitterbots are capable of influencing public opinion about culture products and political agendas by automatically generating mass amounts of tweets through imitating human communication the new york times states they have sleepwake cycles so their fakery is more convincing making them less prone to repetitive patterns that flag them as mere programs the tweets generated vary anywhere from a simple automated response to content creation and information sharing all of which depends on the intention of the person purchasing or creating the bot the social implications these twitterbots potentially have on human perception are sizeable according to a study published by the sciencedirect journal looking at the computers as social actors casa paradigm the journal notes people exhibit remarkable social reactions to computers and other media treating them as if they were real people or real places the study concluded that twitterbots were viewed as credible and competent in communication and interaction making them suitable for transmitting information in the social media sphere while the technological advances have enabled the ability of successful humancomputer interaction the implications are questioned due to the appearance of both benign and malicious bots in the twitter realm benign twitterbots may generate creative content and relevant product updates whereas malicious bots can make unpopular people seem popular push irrelevant products on users and spread misinformation spam andor slander in addition to content generating bots users can purchase followers favorites retweets and comments on various websites that cater to expanding a users image through accumulation of followers with more followers users profiles gain more attention thus increasing their popularity generating web traffic is a valuable commodity for both individuals and businesses because it indicates notability with twitterbots users are able to create the illusion of buzz on their site by obtaining followers from services such as swenzy and underground suppliers who operate bot farms or click farms the companies that facilitate this service create fake twitter accounts that follow a number of people some of these twitter accounts may even post fake tweets to make it seem like they are real this practice of obtaining mass amounts of twitterbots as followers is not permitted on twitter the emphasis on followers and likes as a measure of social capital has urged people to extend their circle to weak and latent ties to promote the idea of popularity for celebrities politicians musicians public figures and companies alike according to the new york times bots amass significant influence and have been noted to sway elections influence the stock market public appeal and attack governments gchq according to documents leaked by edward snowden and published in july  the united kingdoms gchq has a tool named birdsong for automated posting of twitter updates and a tool named birdstrike for twitter monitoring and profile collection television twitter is also increasingly used for making tv more interactive and social this effect is sometimes referred to as the second screen virtual watercooler or social television—the practice has been called chatterboxing twitter has been successfully used to encourage people to watch live tv events such as the oscars the super bowl and the mtv video music awards
