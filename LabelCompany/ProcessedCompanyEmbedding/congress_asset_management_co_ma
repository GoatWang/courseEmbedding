private equity insights investment blog resources contact us wholesaler map learn about our mutual funds you are now leaving the congress asset management company web site and will be entering the congress mutual funds site yes i understand portfolio construction framework conviction in diversification   when crafting portfolios we employ techniques that are traditionally utilized by sophisticated investors such as the pensions endowments and other institutions that we have managed assets on behalf of for thirty years  the goal of our approach is to build an optimized efficient portfolio in simple terms one that seeks to maximize the amount of potential return for a given level of risk to accomplish this we employ a philosophy known as the core and satellite approach to portfolio construction core investments provide a broad foundation comprised of us stocks us fixed income and developed market international equities the core is then augmented by investing in satellite asset classes view chart such as emerging market equity and debt real estate securities and high yield bonds   using this approach investors and their advisors may lower the volatility of their portfolio by diversifying its sources of risk broaden the opportunity set for potential portfolio returns increase the likelihood of meeting specific financial goals   the core is designed to deliver efficient exposure to asset classes that are broadly representative of traditional stock and bond markets much of this market representation comes in the form of equity and interest rate risk while implementation strategies can vary we believe that a combination of active and passive strategies can be used to develop a solid core for most investors   satellite strategies generally deliver higher levels of alpha risk adjusted returns over global market benchmarks or exotic beta exposure to risk factors with low correlation to global markets and can enhance expected returns while lowering overall portfolio volatility   managing risk our approach to asset allocation   at congress asset management llc experience has shown us that the greatest threat to investors achieving their goals are extreme portfolio losses over a short period of time or drawdowns   in the years following the global financial crisis of  both retail and institutional investors have had to face the following realities   drawdowns can derail even the most carefully crafted financial plans and spending policies   more traditional methods of asset allocation may not deliver an optimal riskreturn profile to investors   to help mitigate drawdowns we employ an institutionalquality asset allocation framework that is focused on spreading risk across asset classes we prefer to view portfolios not as a collection of stocks and bonds but rather collections of asset classes that are either returngenerating or riskmanaging in nature                               it is our belief that separating exposures by “returngenerating” and “riskmanaging is a more effective approach than the more widely used method of labeling them as either equities” or fixed income using this process advisors and investors can   distinguish between and manage various sources of portfolio risk to improve portfolio structure and efficiency incorporate return generating opportunities andor volatilityreducing asset classes to a portfolio increase the likelihood of meeting their specific financial goals       ► our step portfolio construction process   year forward looking proprietary capital market assumptions are established the coresatellite asset allocation framework is applied a comprehensive evaluation of risk systematic and idiosyncratic and return capital appreciation and income is considered     ► a deeper dive on our approach   our asset allocation approach is less sensitive to expected return assumptions because it places greater emphasis on risk forecasts   the risk allocation for a given portfolio is broken down by each individual investment exposure optimal risk exposure divides risk among asset classes producing lowcross correlation   we consider a very broad range of potential asset classes to allocate to   we separate the portfolio into returngenerating assets and riskmitigating assets and allocate to these pools in accordance with investorspecific constraints and objectives   the riskmitigating portion of the portfolio is customized according to an investorinstitutions specific goals   we seek to incorporate asset classes that have an imperfect correlation to the core holdings ie public developed large cap equity lower correlation is better and that have an independent source of returns   we have conducted extensive research on how to optimally model and size satellite exposures in client portfolios which we consider a competitive advantage conviction in diversification managing risk our approach to asset allocation portfolio
