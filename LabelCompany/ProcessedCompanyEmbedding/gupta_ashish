roles is an asset for any company as policybazaar’s chief digital officer he is the cto cpo and head of digital marketingyourstory spoke to ashish to know more about his evolution as a techie and as a leader in his year careerrelated read – how a smalltown commerce graduate became cto of a multibilliondollar companya reasonably uncomplicated and straightforward kind of personashish’s childhood photoashish’s father and grandfather served in the indian air force and indian army respectively he was born in an army hospital in udhampur in jammu  kashmir and moved to different locations owing to his father’s transfers his mother was a schoolteacher which is why there was a lot of focus on education before settling in delhi when his father got transferred to the ministry of defence in  ashish spent his early days in kasauli mt abu and gwalior where he was exposed to a variety of cultures he says i’m a reasonably uncomplicated and straightforward kind of person i wasn’t a fussy kid in fact my mother tells me i was quite a delighthe recalls wanting to become a doctor when he was in class ix but giving up on that dream upon realising the amount of studying it involved however the thought of working hard didn’t deter him when it came to preparing for iitjee and he made his way to iit delhi to study chemical engineeringthe interviewashish recalls his college days as the most eventless years of his life it was like one nonstop party he says “we would start playing billiards at eight in the morning till late evening followed by basketball and even a bit of tennis we even took the keys of the billiards room from its maintenance person since we spent more time there than him” ashish with his classmates during his school daysexcept for his fourthyear btech project college for ashish was never about studies and it was only in his final year that he started thinking about his future since he wasn’t keen on pursuing further education in engineering he was left with two options—doing an mba or getting a job as luck would have it he got into iim lucknow and simultaneously received a job offer from ici paints brand dulux he soon realised he wasn’t ready to sit in a classroom and let somebody tell him what to do making his further course of action quite clear his parents were furious with his decision they counselled him shouted at him and told him he was ruining his life but ashish wouldn’t listen he sayswhen i make a decision i don’t think much after that i don’t secondguess myself i get decisions wrong at times but i don’t blame anyonehe recalls his interview at ici paints as one of the highlights of his college days “ici paints used to come only to recruit chemical engineering toppers i was hopeless as except for my degree nothing about me qualified as a chemical engineer even when i cleared all the rounds and made it to the final interview i didn’t have any expectations” his interview was an absurd experience he adds “the interviewer wrote a digit number on a piece of paper and asked me to recall it after showing it for  seconds i did that then he gave me another number and asked to keep subtracting a number from there till we reached zero and then continued till  i was doubtful as to why he was testing my ability to add and subtract when it was a core chemical engineering job i thought may be he had had a long day and was having fun with me”he couldn’t believe his luck when he found out about his selection but not until he had joined that he was able unravel the mystery of the strange questions it was only when he was assigned to the company’s product management and marketing division that it occurred to him that the company was looking at a nonengineering role and generally looking for smart people ashish with his chemical engineering batchmates at iit delhirelated read – meet mitesh agarwal—the ‘brain’ of bits who’s heading technology at oracle indiathe first hour of the first jobashish believes the first year of the job made him who he is he says “after working for  years being part of three startups exited two i feel my first year was the most important time of my career”ashish attributes much of his learning to his boss jaideep mahajan within a few minutes of their first conversation jaideep asked ashish to work on the design of the silicon wax container packaging that would go out to the consumer caught up in hr processes ashish couldn’t start the work he says “he jaideep blasted me it was literally my first working hour he gave a minute lecture in the middle of the office on how this generation is useless and how we’d achieve nothing with this level of seriousness” this could have shaken any other person but ashish simply said sorry and got going and jaideep soon explained everything to him ashish says “i owe a lot to him because he’s the guy who taught me to do everything on my own to be selfreliant frank honest and straightforward”to get anything done ashish had to fight with jaideep as both had strong opinions he adds “he taught me it’s not compulsory to say ‘yes boss’ all the time”also read – meet krishnan narayanan the techie who moved to mountains to code‘it didn’t matter what i knew and what i didn’t’ in his six years at ici paints automotive division ashish went from being a management trainee to an area sales head delhi he took the contribution of the products from  percent of the division’s turnover to almost  percent and about  percent of the division’s gross margin he was a oneman army supported by jaideep he says “i’ve physically produced paint myself in rd units gone to garages and done product trials painted panels of cars to convince painters that it was a good product i purchased raw material planned logistics designed packaging and got pamphlets and instruction manuals printed” he saysit didn’t matter what i knew and what i didn’t know whatever i didn’t know i would learn on the way that gave me confidenceashish was very clear that he wasn’t meant for sales even though he was good at it he says “it never gave me any sense of pride or achievement in life” so he moved back to the head office and later decided to explore options outside ici paints which better suited his interestsashish and tekriti team at an offsiteentry to the startup worldashish was introduced to amitabh nagpal by a mutual friend already a successful entrepreneur amitabh was looking for a cofounder to start up with in india ashish didn’t know about startups but wasn’t scared of anything either when amitabh asked ashish to join as the cofounder of studyplaces ashish went with his gut he recalls i thought it looked extremely interesting it was something i had no clue about so i thought it would be fun i felt it would be like my first year at work all over againashish was responsible for the company’s operations in terms of lead management building the site and digital marketing he got in touch with tekriti a startup founded by his batchmates from iit delhi to build the website for studyplaces the company then raised  million from a group of investors and realigned their vision to further the suit the market in a few months’ time ashish realised that his ideas for the future of the business did not match with those of his cofounder and studyplaces was eventually acquired by educomp you may also like – from assembling computers to aggregating networks how srix sriramkumar is solving india’s connectivity problembetter late than neverashish’s tryst with technology started at tekriti where he was initially responsible for business development and client engagementhe recalls his first time coding “it was for a project which was almost done but the guys got stuck with a bug for a few days finally i asked the tech team to help me understand the problem so that i could explain it to the clientluckily it was in php which was relatively easy to understand i went through the code and in the next three hours we solved the problem” that broke the glass ceiling of technology for him later he also realised that  percent of the projects at tekriti were getting done fast but the remaining  percent took a lot of time owing to earlier mistakeseventually he started reviewing all projects before they were begun ashish saysthe world of technology keeps evolving fast so my inexperience actually helped me i learnt things from scratchhe had a lot of suggestions for the tech team but in order to break the barrier of acceptance he first learnt drupal he says “when you haven’t written a line of code yourself and try to have this conversation with the senior techies there’s a lot of resistance” he went through the drupal tutorials made a website built a few modules and then went up to themin  tekritiwas acquired by kelton technologies ashish was then asked to move back to a formal business development role to build a bd and sales team unfortunately it wasn’t what he was looking for and he decided to move on ashish with his familycouponvoodoo  mysmartprice and couponduniyaashish started couponvoodoo in  the company had raised some amount from a seed fund since the founders didn’t have the budget to buy a premium domain they went with couponvoodoo ashish says “we didn’t want an obvious brand ‘voodoo’ wasn’t known to a lot of people so it offered a mystery element as well”couponvoodoo’s algorithm was a marriage of mysmartprice and couponduniya ashish explained “for example you could have a product that is priced at rs  on flipkartwith no coupon and the same thing at rs  on infibeamwith a coupon which made the effective price rs couponvoodoo helped you give that information” the tech stack had two halves—one was to get all the data and algorithms in place and the other to show the data to the customer the founders went with drupal as the frontend to get more speed and simplicity at the backend they settled with phantom and casperjs for getting all the data in amazon cloud was used for rooting  servers every nightto get the information for price comparison and to run the scripts in parallel the glue layer was php which tied in the data mapped it and made it available for the drupal front endcouponvoodoo started making rs  lakh revenues and became profitable there was some interest from partners potential acquihire as well but after two years ashish realisedthat it wouldn’t scale much so he decided to shut down ashish then met sameer maheshwari cofounder of healthkart through his friend prashant tandon healthkart’s other cofounder who was then running mg healthkart was undergoing a transformation at that stage and sameer needed a cto ashish joined him at healthkart and helped in the transformation from a pureplay widespread health portal to a nutrition supplementfocused platform it was more of a strategy role in the beginning and there were a lot of open discussions as well he recalls “a lot of my work at healthkart was breaking the barrier between technology and operations or catalogue or management team”he made the interaction between different divisions seamless after his brief stint in the company ashish started looking for a more techfocused role which unfortunately healthkart wasn’t offering at that stage related read – sandipan chattopadhyay — the statistician behind the x growth of justdialmaking of the ‘chief digital

says “policybazaar started as leadgeneration business which moved to an interactionbased fintech model there was still a lot to figure out and there was a large enough team that needed to be restructured and aligned to tech”ashish at policybazaar officein his role at policybazaar ashish is involved in operations business and marketing discussions as well he has even acquired a reputation for being a person who mercilessly shuts down projects  he says “if there’s no impact there’s no point running the project i wanted to move technology from just building stuff to actually having business impact so each of my teams had valuecreation goals” when he joined  percent of the company’s traffic and  percent of their leads were coming from mobile now almost  percent of traffic and almost  percent of the leads are coming via mobile from zero contribution to business the app now accounts for almost  percent of the leads and boasts more than a million downloads as well it’s interesting to know that policybazaar offers no exclusive incentives for app usersbeing the cto cpo and head of digital marketing doesn’t create any bandwidth issues for ashish he believes that his background as a partner cofounder and even his stint at ici have made him comfortable contributing to every aspect of the division he works for in fact he thinks it would have been difficult if marketing productand technology were separate he says i don’t get burdened by these multiple responsibilities in fact if someone asks me to take operations i’ll happily add that as well i’ve never had a bandwidth issue in my lifealso read – baishampayan ghose — the agartala boy who is all set to become a farmer after cofounding  startupswelcoming challenges and building for the futurethe biggest challenge for ashish at policybazaar is to migrate the culture from being an assisted business to a selfserved business he believes it’s not just a technical challenge but a mindset and cultural challenge as well in his opinion while it’s great to respond to the requests raised by the sales team it needs to get to the next level now because a sales guy cannot be expected to think about chatbots or automated dialling ashish shared some of the company’s plans for near future build a chatbot offer a oneclick experience where users can buy a policy without ever using a keyboard voice analytics the company receives more than  million minutes of talk time via its call centres every month ashish says “this is a massive repository of phenomenal intelligence we’re working to see if we can transcribe it and run sentimental analysis to get meaningful data to advise customers” the biggest hurdle is that  percent of the calls take place in hindi and the world of nlp and voice recognition hasn’t evolved to include hindi yet policybazaar is now involved in a lot of advisory work for insurance companies where they tell them how to make their product better and more suited to customersbased on their interactions and feedback from customers ashish says “we are an advisor but we don’t want a broken experience for a customer when we take the customer to the partner now for – percent of sales you don’t need to go to the partner site and can buy it on policybazaar itself” the company plans to add claim support and the early release of the instaclaim feature is a step in that direction using machine learning and nlp on the available data ashish is looking to automate a lot of the work so that the agent can focus on the call he’s keen to automate consumer experience as well for both those who want to get on a call and for those who don’tashish in his officetech stack and hiring  policybazaarpolicybazaar’s upcoming chatbot is being built on nodejs the company is also building optical character recognition which is a combination of node ms sql and mongodb some of its analytics is based on rprogramming language but now moving to python they moved from basic html to angular js in the past and are now working in reactjs ashish says “at the end people should not be net or java developersthey should all just be technologists understanding quality and standards” the company has widely used ms sql net and java and is now exploring new technologiesashish has also kickstarted policybazaar labs which demands a different work culture where the team members have to focus more on architectural flexibility and modular aspectsthe only thing ashish sees in a person before hiring is hunger he’s not a big believer in formal education and experience he saysin my startup journey i’ve seen that experience is detrimental in most of the cases and incremental in very fewhe gives importance to being transparent as well he adds “if you’re transparent then i can at least go through your mind and intervene else you’ll continue to make mistakes and i won’t be able to intervene” decisions and guiding principlesafter joining policybazaar he got rid of hierarchy first and created a culture where any fresher can walk in and speak directly to him or the foundershe has now created an alignment between tech and business which gives a clear direction to the tech team with an ability to think and make decisions he has instilled the belief in the tech team that a stable smoothly functioning platform is not the end and you’ve got to be pushing the status quo and challenging yourselfashish with his parentsashish doesn’t follow a methodology or philosophy to back his decisions he says my biggest guiding principle is that there shouldn’t be any guiding principles in life somewhere i think that a structured approach to decision making is just something that some people have come up with to make themselves sound intelligenthe adds “you just have to be brutally honest you should be humble enough to review what you’ve built and not be defensive”ashish is a very quick decision maker he sayssomewhere in my mind i know that i don’t know anything about this and thinking too much won’t make any differencebacking his instincts and avoiding overthinking saves him a lot of energy time and bandwidth for ashish technology is a medium to bring idea to life and to turn visions into realityhe says “i don’t get emotionally attached to what i’ve done if something made sense yesterday and doesn’t make sense today i’ll dump it in my books the only thing that makes sense today is what you want to do tomorrow”ashish has been known for having the ability to deliver he saysto me what matters most is that for every role i’ve taken up if  people can stand up and say i made their lives betterany aspect or made them capable of running their lives better my mission is complete  you can connect with ashish on linkedin  shares calling all tech startups to
