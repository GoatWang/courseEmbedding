information about about us why choose us testimonials contact dashboard login incorporate now is a c corporation right for your business what you need to know about forming a c corporation what is a c corporation a c corporation is one of several ways to legally recognize a business for tax regulatory and official reasons a c corp is simply a way to structure ownership of a business and contrasts with other popular business structures including limited liability companies llcs s corporations sole proprietorships and others generally a c corporation structure is better for larger businesses this is particularly true if they intend to publicly trade shares through having an initial public offering or ipo a c corporation is much more attractive to potential investors including venture capitalists and shareholders because it allows wider ownership of the corporation the majority of larger businesses in the united states are structured as c corporations although a c corp could theoretically consist of just one person the information below will help you decide if a c corporation structure is right for your business how is a c corporation formed a c corp also known as a corporation is a type of business entity that is formed and regulated on a state level the corporation is formed by filing “articles of incorporation” with the secretary of state in the state of incorporation the policies articles cost and regulations for forming a c corp vary from statetostate details on exactly how to form a c corporation can be found at the end of this article the corporation is the oldest form of business entity it has long been a successful way to do business and allows groups of individuals to pool their resources and capital to pursue a common purpose with their risk limited solely to the amount of stock they own although a c corp is a popular business structure there are other options for forming businesses in the us the advantages of c corporations forming a c corporation does have several benefits  a c corporation has limited liability because a c corp is a separate legal entity the liabilities of the business are separate from the liabilities of the directors investors and shareholders generally the owners of a c corporation are protected from being liable for the business’s obligations this does not apply in all cases for example if corporate funds are misused there is wilful fraud or if certain rules and regulations are not followed  a c corporation exists independently of its owners a c corporation can have “perpetual existence” — this is in contrast to sole proprietorships or partnerships where a business only exists for as long as the proprietors or owners are alive and in the business  ownership of c corporations can be fluid and transferred ownership in a c corporation is decided by who holds the stocks it issues these stocks can be bought and sold between investors and if the company’s shares are publicly traded on a stock exchange institutions and members of the public can own stock in the company  ease of access to funding through issuing stock if a c corporation want to raise money it can hold an “initial public offering ipo” where it “goes public” and offers shares for sale on a stock exchange this can bring significant money into a business they can also choose to issue shares periodically to raise further funding although this can dilute the value of existing shares  enhanced business or corporate credibility most of the businesses that are household names are c corporations incorporating as a c corp demonstrates to others that you expect to see significant growth and can enhance the business’s credibility and authority the disadvantages of a c corporation a c corporation does have some disadvantages briefly they are a different tax structure to other types of businesses double taxation for investors when dividends are paid to them legal rules regulations formalities and compliance they have to meet we cover these in more detail below what are the differences between an s corp c corp and llc two other popular business entity structures in the us are the s corp and the llc they provide many of the same protections offered by a c corp but have less formal rules on taxation governance and compliance this can mean more flexibility in how an llc or s corp is owned and funded one of the main differences between c corps and s corps  llcs are how income from the different types of businesses are taxed for llcs and s corps any income earned by the business “flows through” to the business owners’  shareholders’  members’ tax returns where it is taxed as part of their overall income the company does not have to file a separate tax return s corps and c corps can pass on some of their profits to shareholders as dividends s corps are limited to having a maximum of  shareholders a c corp is taxed at the corporate level — that means it has to file a separate tax return as a business entity and will need to pay corporation tax on any profits earned how are profits and taxes handled with a c corp a c corporation is taxed as a separate business entity unlike individuals c corporations have to file a designated tax form with the irs which is called irs form  additionally c corporations have their own tax rates corporations can retain some of their profits and earnings as part of their operating capital this can shelter some of the profits from taxation c corporation tax rates the tax rates levied on c corporations are as follows profit up to  —     —     —     —     —     —     —  more than  —  stock dividends from c corporations a c corporation may choose to distribute some of the profits of the company as dividends which are distributed to shareholders the percentage of dividends that each shareholder is entitled to depends on how many shares they own dividends that are distributed to shareholders are taxed twice doubletaxed they are taxed first at the corporate level as profit on the corporation’s form  and again at the individual level as stock dividends on the shareholders form  what are a c corporations legal requirements a c corporation must meet certain requirements  hold an annual general meeting agm for the shareholders and the board of directors the annual meetings are used to discuss and decide important information strategic decisions opportunities risks and issues that the corporation will need to deal with  issue shares to investors as ownership of the business ownership in a corporation is expressed through the issuance of shares the management of the corporation is governed by a board of directors who are elected by the shareholders  appoint a board of directors the board of directors select officers who manage the day to day activities of the corporation the board of directors also drafts bylaws for the corporation these are written protocols that state the way that the corporation will be governed  assign certain positions in the corporation a c corporation will need to have all of the following positions in a small c corp one person could hold multiple of these positions shareholders they own the companys stock and are responsible for electing directors amending the bylaws and articles of incorporation and approving major actions taken by the corporation

whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information private is a corporation right for me it depends on many

 off your federal tax id view more continue ask away we have answers common questions whats the difference between a c corporation and an s corporation the irs allows corporations to choose to be taxed as either a c corporation or an s corporation income from c corporations are subject to double taxation that is the corporation pays taxes on its net income and then the shareholders also pay taxes on the income that they receive from the corporations corporations have only one level of taxation the shareholders still have to pay taxes on money that they receive from the corporation but an s corporation does not pay taxes on its net income while the s corporation is popular among small business owners c corporations have greater tax planning flexibility how does a corporation protect my personal assets if a business operates as a corporation the business owners called shareholders are not personally liable for debts or other claims against the corporation thats because the corporation is a separate legal entity from its owners if a corporation complies with the formalities required for it to be treated as a separate legal entity then anyone seeking to collect a debt from or enforce a claim against a corporation would not be able to collect from the shareholders themselves they would only be able to pursue the assets held in the name of the corporation why do many people choose to form their corporation in delaware delaware is a very popular place in which to form corporations however the primary benefits apply to larger public corporations or those planning to go public delawares laws provide heightened protection for board members against lawsuits brought by shareholders and delaware has a court exclusively dedicated to resolving corporate disputes these benefits dont mean much to smaller corporations keep in mind that if a corporation forms in delaware and does business in another state the corporation would be required to file additional paperwork and pay any taxes andor fees required to do business in that state given those factors many smaller corporations keep it simple and form in the state in which they plan to do business what is an ein an employer identification number ein also known as a federal tax identification number is used to identify a business entity for tax purposes its like a social security number but for a business in general most businesses need an ein the only reason a business would not get an ein is if it has only one owner elects to be treated as a sole proprietor for tax purposes and does not want to open a separate business bank account in this case the owner would use their social security number as the business identifier however there are disadvantages to this approach namely the risk of liability how are llcs taxed unlike a corporation llcs have some flexibility in how theyre taxed depending on how many members and the type of tax treatment the owner selects the llc can be taxed as either a corporation partnership or as part of the owners personal tax return called a disregarded entity by default an llc with two or more members are taxed as a partnership unless they file an irs form  to elect to be treated as a corporation if the llc has only one owner it will be taxed as a sole proprietor unless the owner files form  its not necessary to decide which tax treatment until after your business is formed you have up to  months to decide and can speak to an accountant if you need help making this decision what is a registered agent a registered agent sometimes called a resident agent or statutory agent is a person or business authorized to accept important legal documents on behalf of a business states require businesses to provide the name of their registered agent at the time they form their business entity while you can be your own registered agent there are disadvantages you have to be available during regular business hours and your information goes on the public record if you miss a filing deadline you risk being fined or shut down our registered agent service can ensure you receive important business documents sort through junk mail and keep your information
