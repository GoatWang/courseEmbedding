diseases brigham  women’s hospital boston ma dennis j selkoe md the vincent and stella coates professor of neurologic diseases harvard medical school codirector  center for neurologic diseases department  of neurology brigham and women’s hospital dennis selkoe the vincent and stella coates professor of neurologic diseases at harvard medical school and brigham and women’s hospital has devoted his career to the use of molecular approaches to study alzheimers disease ad parkinson’s disease and related basic biological questions  he is a graduate of columbia university and the university of virginia school of medicine  after initial research training at the national institutes of health ninds he completed a residency in neurology at the harvardlongwood program and a postdoctoral fellowship in neuronal cell biology and neurochemistry in the department of neuroscience hms  in  he founded a laboratory applying biochemical and cell biological techniques to the study of human neurodegeneration   selkoe and coworkers broke new ground in  when they developed a method to isolate the abnormal neurofibrillary tangles that are a hallmark of ad and described their unusual chemical properties  with other labs they identified the microtubuleassociated protein tau as the principal component of tangles  selkoe then turned his attention to the other hallmark lesion of ad  the amyloid plaque  and has conducted extensive experiments on the amyloid ßprotein aß and its precursor app  the results led him to formulate a theory  the amyloid or aß hypothesis  about the pathogenic cascade that causes ad  in  selkoe and collaborators discovered that aß is continuously produced by normal cells throughout life  this unexpected finding initiated the dynamic study of aß formation in cultured cells and has enabled the identification of aß production inhibitors  the lab showed that inherited mutations in app and later the presenilin genes cause ad by increasing the generation of aß  in  selkoe and colleagues identified presenilin as the longsought gammasecretase an unprecedented intramembrane aspartyl protease that processes app notch and many other proteins  recently the selkoe lab conducted a series of studies showing that small soluble oligomers of aß are responsible for synaptic injury and interfere with memory these advances have led to numerous awards including the potamkin prize shared with george g glenner the metropolitan life foundation award and the ah heineken price for medicine  selkoe is a member of the institute of medicine of the national academies and a fellow of the american association for the advancement of science  he cofounded and codirects the center for neurologic diseases at brigham and womens hospital  selkoe was the principal founding scientist of athena neurosciences now elan pharmaceuticals  he has served on the editorial boards of several scientific journals the neuroscience review committee of the howard hughes medical institute and the national advisory council on aging nih  with hms dean joseph p martin he founded the harvard center for neurodegeneration and repair in                 selkoe

welcome to the selkoe laboratory at brigham and womens hosptial and harvard medical school our laboratory is part of the center for neurologic diseases a group of multidisciplinary biomedical research laboratories which has its central objective in the application of a wide range of current biological methods to the elucidation of the pathogenesis and treatment of certain chronic unsolved neurological diseases our laboratory is interested in the biochemistry and molecular and cell biology of neuronal degeneration during aging of the mammalian brain particularly in alzheimers ad and parkinsons pd diseases the laboratory originally developed methods for the purification and analysis of the intraneuronal paired helical filaments and extra cellular amyloid fibrils that are the hallmarks of the neuropathology of ad extensive studies of the trafficking and processing of the betaamyloid precursor protein app a type  integral membrane glycoprotein critically involved in ad have been undertaken and continue the laboratory discovered that aß is constitutively produced from app during normal cellular metabolism enabling dynamic cell biologically studies of the mechanism of aß production and its pharmacological inhibition the function of app and the toxic properties of various aß assemblies on cultured neurons and in relevant mouse models are being examined the central role of presenilin in app and notch signaling and the mechanism by which presenilin mutations produce ad are also under study finally a similar approach is being applied to the function and dysfunction of gene products implicated in pd particularly asynuclein and pink a wide range of methods is employed including cell culture protein biochemistry recombinant dna studies immunohistochemistry light and

monitor such as the amyloidbeta levels in the cerebrospinal fluid csf and plasma to gain a better understanding of the explanatory power of these biomarkers we formulate and analyze a compaxtmental mathematical model for the amyloidbeta accumulation in the brain csf and plasma throughout the course of alzheimers treatment our analysis reveals that the total amyloidbeta burden in the brain is dictated by a unitless quantity called the polymerization ratio which is the product of the production and elongation rates divided by the product of the fragmentation and loss rates in this ratio the production rate and loss rate include a source and sink term respectively related to the intercompaxtmental transport our results suggest that production inhibitors are likely to reduce the amyloidbeta levels in all three compartments in contrast agents that ingest monomers off of polymers or that increase fragmentation or block elongation may also reduce amyloidbeta burden in the brain

molecular and cell biology of neuronal degeneration during aging of the mammalian brain and particularly in alzheimer’s ad and parkinson’s pd diseases the laboratory originally developed methods for the purification and analysis of the intraneuronal paired helical filaments and extracellular amyloid fibrils that are the hallmarks of the neuropathology of ad extensive studies of the trafficking and processing of the βamyloid precursor protein app a membrane glycoprotein critically involved in ad have been undertaken and continue the lab discovered that aβ is normally produced from app throughout life enabling dynamic cell biological studies of the mechanism of aβ production and its pharmacological inhibition the function of app and the toxic properties of various aβ assemblies on cultured neurons and in relevant mouse models are being examined we discovered that presenilin is the active site of γsecretase and study its role in app and notch proteolysis finally a similar approach is bring applied to the function and dysfunction of gene products implicated in pd particularly αsynuclein we recently discovered that αsynuclein exists normally as αhelically folded tetramers and that their destabilization may lead to pd we use a wide range of methods including cell culture protein biochemistry molecular biology immunohistochemistry confocal and electron
