 under a retirement program adopted in july  and modified in november  and november  each noninterested trustee who retired before december   may receive payments from a fidelity fund during his or her lifetime based on his or her basic trustee fees and length of service the obligation of a fund to make such payments is neither secured nor funded a trustee became eligible to participate in the program at the end of the calendar year in which he or she reached age  provided that at the time of retirement he or she had served as a fidelity fund trustee for at least five years under a deferred compensation plan adopted in september  and amended in november  the plan noninterested trustees must defer receipt of a portion of and may elect to defer receipt of an additional portion of their annual fees amounts deferred under the plan are treated as though equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in shares of a crosssection of fidelity funds including funds in each major investment discipline and representing a majority of fidelitys assets under management the reference funds the amounts ultimately received by the trustees under the plan will be directly linked to the investment performance of the reference funds deferral of fees in accordance with the plan will have a negligible effect on a funds assets liabilities and net income per share and will not obligate a fund to retain the services of any trustee or to pay any particular level of compensation to the trustee a fund may invest in the reference funds under the plan without shareholder approval as of december   the noninterested trustees terminated the retirement program for trustees who retire after such date in connection with the termination of the retirement program each thenexisting noninterested trustee received a credit to his or her plan account equal to the present value of the estimated benefits that would have been payable under the retirement program the amounts credited to the noninterested trustees plan accounts are subject to vesting and are treated as though equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in shares of the reference funds the amounts ultimately received by the trustees in connection with the credits to their plan accounts will be directly linked to the investment performance of the reference funds the termination of the retirement program and related crediting of estimated benefits to the trustees plan accounts did not result in a material cost to the funds  to ratify the selection of coopers  lybrand llp as independent accountants of the trust by a vote of the noninterested trustees the firm of coopers  lybrand llp has been selected as independent accountants for each fund to sign or certify any financial statements of each fund required by any law or regulation to be certified by an independent accountant and filed with the securities and exchange commission sec or any state pursuant to the  act such selection requires the ratification of shareholders in addition as required by the  act the vote of the trustees is subject to the right of e ach fund  by vote of a majority of its outstanding voting securities at any meeting called for the purpose of voting on such action to terminate such employment without penalty coopers  lybrand llp has advised e ach fun d that it has no direct or material indirect ownership interest in e ach fund the independent accountants examine annual financial statements for the funds and provide other audit and taxrelated services in recommending the selection of the funds  accountants the audit committee reviewed the nature and scope of the services to be provided including nonaudit services and whether the performance of such services would affect the accountants independence representatives of coopers  lybrand llp are not expected to be present at the meeting but have been given the opportunity to make a statement if they so desire and will be available should any matter arise requiring their presence on september   coopers  lybrand llp and price waterhouse llp announced plans to merge their practices world wide coopers  lybrand llp and price waterhouse llp expect the merger which is subject to approval by the partners of both organizations and by the regulators to become effective in early   to amend the trust instrument to provide dollarbased voting rights for shareholders of the trust the board of trustees has approved and recommends that shareholders of the trust approve a proposal to amend article vii section  of the trust instrument the amendment would provide voting rights based on a shareholders total dollar interest in a fund dollarbased voting rather than on the number of shares owned for all shareholder votes for a fund as a result voting power would be allocated in proportion to the value of each shareholders investment background connecticut municipal money market fund spartan connecticut municipal money market fund spartan florida municipal money market fund and new jersey municipal money market fund are funds of fidelity court street trust ii an openend management investment company organized as a delaware business trust currently there are four funds in the trust shareholders of each fund vote separately on matters concerning only that fund and vote on a trustwide basis on matters that affect the trust as a whole such as electing trustees or amending the trust instrument currently under the trust instrument each share is entitled to one vote regardless of the relative value of the shares of each fund in the trust the original intent of the oneshare onevote provision was to provide equitable voting rights to all shareholders as required by the  act in the case where a trust has several series or funds such as fidelity court street trust ii voting rights may have become disproportionate since the net asset value per share nav of the separate funds generally diverge over time the staff of the securities and exchange commission sec has issued a noaction letter permitting a trust to seek shareholder approval of a dollarbased voting system the proposed amendment will comply with the conditions stated in the noaction letter reason for proposal if approved the amendment would provide a more equitable distribution of voting rights for certain votes than the oneshare onevote system currently in effect the voting power of each shareholder would be commensurate with the value of the shareholders dollar investment rather than with the number of shares held under the current voting provisions an investment in a fund with a lower nav may have significantly greater voting power than the same dollar amount invested in a fund with a higher nav currently since there are only money market funds in the trust the proposal will not affect the voting rights of fund shareholders on votes requiring trustwide participation since money market funds are managed to maintain a  nav however if additional funds with fluctuating navs are added to the trust relative voting rights would be changed under the proposal to illustrate the potentially disproportionate calculation of voting power currently in place the table below shows a hypothetical example of a trust with funds with fluctuating navs fund net asset value  investment in terms of number of shares a    b    c    d    for example fund d shareholders would have ten times the voting power of fund a shareholders because a  investment in fund d would buy ten times as many shares as a  investment in fund a accordingly a oneshare onevote system may provide certain shareholders with a disproportionate ability to affect the vote relative to shareholders of other funds in the trust if dollarbased voting had been in effect each shareholder would have had  voting shares their voting power would be proportionate to their economic interest which fmr believes is a more equitable result and which is the result with respect to a typical corporation where each voting share generally has an equal market price on matters requiring trustwide votes where all funds are required to vote shareholders who own shares with a lower nav than other funds in the trust would be giving other shareholders in the trust more voting power than they currently have on matters affecting only one fund only shareholders of that fund vote on the issue in this instance under both the current trust instrument and an amended trust instrument all shareholders of the fund would have the same voting rights since the nav is the same for all shares in a single fund amendment to the trust instrument article vii section  sets forth the method of calculating voting rights for all shareholder votes for the trust if approved article vii section  will be amended as follows material to be added is  underlined  and material to be deleted is bracketed article vii shareholders voting powers and meetings voting powers section  the s hareholders shall have power to vote    on any matter submitted to a vote of the shareholders all shares shall be voted separately by individual series except i when required by the  act shares shall be voted in the aggregate and not by individual series and ii when the trustees have determined that the matter affects the interests of more than one series then the shareholders of all such series shall be entitled to vote thereon the trustees may also determine that a matter affects only the interests of one or more classes of a series in which case any such matters shall be voted on by such class or classes each whole share shall be entitled to one vote as to any matter on which it is entitled to vote and each fractional share shall be entitled to a proportionate fractional vote  a shareholder of each series shall be entitled to one vote for each dollar of net asset value number of shares owned times net asset value per share of such series on any matter on which such shareholder is entitled to vote and each fractional dollar amount shall be entitled to a proportionate fractional vote  there shall be no cumulative voting in the election of trustees shares may be voted in person or by proxy or in any manner provided for in the bylaws a proxy may be given in writing the bylaws may provide that proxies may also or may instead be given by any electronic or telecommunications device or in any other manner notwithstanding anything else herein or in the bylaws in the event a proposal by anyone other than the officers or trustees of the trust is submitted to a vote of the shareholders of one or more series or of the trust or in the event of any proxy contest or proxy solicitation or proposal in opposition to any proposal by the officers or trustees of the trust shares may be voted only in person or by written proxy until shares are issued the trustees may exercise all rights of shareholders and may take any action required or permitted by law this trust instrument or any bylaws of the trust to be taken by shareholders conclusion the board of trustees has concluded that the proposal will benefit the trust and its shareholders the trustees recommend voting for the proposal the amended trust instrument will become effective upon shareholder approval if the proposal is not approved by shareholders of the trust article vii section  of the trust instrument will remain unchanged  to approve an amended management contract for fidelity connecticut municipal money market fund the board of trustees including the trustees who are not interested persons of the trust or of fmr the independent trustees has approved and recommends that shareholders of the fund approve a proposal to adopt an amended management contract with fidelity management  research company fmr the amended contract the amended contract modifies the management fee that fmr receives from the fund to provide for lower fees when fmrs assets under management exceed certain levels the amended contract will result in a management fee that is the same as or lower than the fee payable under the present management contract the present contract proposed amendments to the present management contract a copy of the amended contract marked to indicate the proposed amendments is supplied as exhibit  on page  except for the modifications discussed above it is substantially identical to the present contract for a detailed discussion of the funds present contract refer to the section entitled present management contracts beginning on page  if approved by shareholders the amended contract will take effect on january   or if later the first day of the first month following approval and will remain in effect through may   and thereafter but only as long as its continuance is approved at least annually by i the vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of a majority of those trustees who are not interested persons of the trust or fmr the independent trustees and ii the vote of either a majority of the trustees or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the fund if the amended contract is not approved the present contract will continue in effect through may   and thereafter only as long as its continuance is approved at least annually by i the vote cast in person at a meeting called for the purpose of a majority of the independent trustees and ii the vote of either a majority of the trustees or by the vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the fund the management fee is an annual percentage of the funds average net assets the management fee rate calculated and paid monthly the management fee rate is the sum of two components a group fee rate which varies according to assets under management by fmr and a fixed individual fund fee rate the amended contract modifies the group fee rate by providing for lower fee rates if fmrs assets under management remain above  billion modification to group fee rate the group fee rate varies based upon the monthly average of the aggregate net assets of all registered investment companies having management contracts with fmr assets under management by fmr for example as assets under management by fmr increase the group fee rate declines the amended contract would not change the group fee calculation for assets under management by fmr of  billion or less above  billion in assets under fmrs management the group fee rate declines under both the present contract and the amended contract but under the amended contract it declines faster group fee rates that are lower than those contained in the funds present contract have been voluntarily implemented by fmr on january   november   august   and january   the group fee rate is calculated according to a graduated schedule providing for different rates for different levels of assets under management by fmr the rate at which the group fee rate declines is determined by fee breakpoints that provide for lower fee rates when assets increase the amended contract adds  new fee breakpoints for assets under fmrs management above  billion as illustrated in the following table for an explanation of how the group fee rate is used to calculate the management fee see the section entitled present management contracts beginning on page  group fee rate breakpoints present contract amended contract group group present average group amended assets contract assets contract  billions  billions over                                                   over   the result at various levels of group net assets is illustrated by the table below effective annual group fee rates group net present amended assets contract contract  billions                             does not reflect voluntary adoption of extended group fee rate schedules by fmr on january   november   august   and january   assets under fmrs management for august   were approximately  billion comparison

brokersdealers the fund may execute portfolio transactions with brokerdealers who provide research and execution services to the fund or other accounts over which fmr or its affiliates exercise investment discretion the selection of such brokerdealers is generally made by fmr to the extent possible consistent with execution considerations in accordance with a ranking of brokerdealers determined periodically by fmrs investment staff based upon the quality of research and execution services provided if fmr grants investment management authority to a subadviser pursuant to a subadvisory agreement the subadviser is authorized to place orders for the purchase and sale of portfolio securities and will do so in accordance with the policies described below the receipt of research from brokerdealers that execute transactions on behalf of the fund may be useful to fmr in rendering investment management services to the fund and to its other clients and conversely such research provided by brokerdealers who execute transaction orders on behalf of other fmr clients may be useful to fmr in carrying out its obligations to the fund the receipt of such research has not reduced fmrs normal independent research activities however it enables fmr to avoid additional expenses that could be incurred if fmr tried to develop comparable information through its own efforts subject to applicable limitations of the federal securities laws brokerdealers may receive commissions for agency transactions that are in excess of the amount of commissions charged by other brokerdealers in recognition of their research and execution services in order to cause the fund to pay such higher commissions fmr must determine in good faith that such commissions are reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided by such executing brokerdealers viewed in terms of a particular transaction or fmrs overall responsibilities to the fund and its other clients in reaching this determination fmr will not attempt to place a specific dollar value on the brokerage and research services provided or to determine what portion of the compensation should be related to those services the fund has already been authorized by the board of trustees consistent with the federal securities laws and the rules and regulations of the securities and

the independent trustees considered the benefit to shareholders of investing in a fund that is part of a large family of funds offering a variety of investment disciplines and providing for a large variety of fund and shareholder services with regard to the section of the proposed contract describing the changes to portfolio transactions the trustees considered the value of research provided by the brokerdealers the quality of the execution services provided and the level of commissions paid while the fund does not generally purchase securities through a brokerdealer by paying commissions the board of trustees determined that amending the management contract to expressly recognize the authority of fmr to use affiliated brokerdealers and brokerdealers who provide research services furthers the goal of standardizing management contracts for fidelity funds and that explicitly permitting all fidelity funds to utilize certain brokerdealers is beneficial to the fund conclusion based on their evaluation of all material factors and assisted by the advice of independent counsel the trustees concluded i that the existing management fee structure is fair and reasonable and ii that the proposed modifications to the management fee structure that is the reduction of the group fee rate schedule and the addition of the discussion of fmrs ability to use brokers and dealers to execute portfolio transactions are in the best interest of the funds shareholders the board of trustees including the independent trustees voted to approve the submission of the amended contract to shareholders of the fund and recommends that shareholders of the fund vote for the amended contract adoption of standardized investment limitations the primary purpose of proposals  and  is to revise certain of the funds investment limitations to conform to limitations which are standard for similar types of funds managed by fmr the board of trustees asked fmr to analyze the various fundamental and nonfundamental investment limitations of the fidelity funds and where practical and appropriate to a funds investment objective and policies propose to shareholders adoption of standard fundamental limitations and elimination of certain other fundamental limitations generally when fundamental limitations are eliminated fidelitys standard nonfundamental limitations replace them by making these limitations nonfundamental the board of trustees may amend a limitation as they deem appropriate without seeking shareholder approval the board of trustees would amend the limitations to respond for instance to developments in the marketplace or changes in federal or state law the costs of shareholder meetings called for these purposes are generally borne by a fund and its shareholders it is not anticipated that these proposals will substantially affect the way a fund is currently managed however fmr is presenting them to you for your approval because fmr believes that increased standardization will help to promote operational efficiencies and facilitate monitoring of compliance with fundamental and nonfundamental investment limitations although adoption of a new or revised limitation is not likely to have any impact on the current investment techniques employed by a fund it will contribute to the overall objectives of standardization  to amend fidelity connecticut municipal money market funds and fidelity new jersey municipal money market funds fundamental investment limitation concerning the issuance of senior securities each funds current fundamental investment limitation regarding the issuance of senior securities states the fund may not issue bonds or any other class of securities preferred over shares of the fund in respect of the funds assets or earnings provided that fidelity court street trust ii may issue additional series of shares in accordance with the trust instrument the trustees recommend that shareholders vote to replace this limitation with the following fundamental investment limitation governing the issuance of senior securities the fund may not issue senior securities except as permitted under the investment company act of  the primary purpose of the proposal is to revise each funds fundamental senior securities limitation to conform to a limitation that is expected to become standard for all funds managed by fmr see adoption of standardized investment limitations on page  if the proposal is approved the new fundamental senior securities limitation cannot be changed without the approval of shareholders adoption of the proposed limitation on senior securities is not expected to affect the way in which each fund is managed the investment performance of each fund or the securities or instruments in which each fund invests however the proposed limitation clarifies that each fund may issue senior securities to the extent permitted under the  act although the definition of a senior security involves complex statutory and regulatory concepts a senior security is generally thought of as an obligation of a fund which has a claim to the funds assets or earnings that takes precedence over the claims of the funds shareholders the  act generally prohibits mutual funds from issuing senior securities however mutual funds are permitted to engage in certain types of transactions that might be considered senior securities as long as certain conditions are satisfied for example a transaction which obligates a fund to pay money at a future date eg the purchase of securities for settlement on a date that is further away than the normal settlement period may be considered a senior security a mutual fund however is permitted to enter into this type of transaction if it maintains a segregated account containing liquid securities in an amount equal to its obligation to pay cash for the securities at a future date each fund utilizes transactions that may be considered senior securities only in accordance with applicable regulatory requirements under the  act conclusion the board of trustees has concluded that the proposal will benefit each fund and its shareholders the trustees recommend voting for the proposal upon shareholder approval the amended fundamental limitation will become effective when the disclosure is revised to reflect the changes if the proposal is not approved by the shareholders of a fund that funds current limitation will remain unchanged  to amend fidelity connecticut municipal money market funds fidelity new jersey municipal money market

not purchase the securities of any issuer other than securities issued or guaranteed by the us government or any of its agencies instrumentalities territories or possessions or issued or guaranteed by a state government or political subdivision thereof if as a result more than  of the value of its total assets would be invested in securities of companies having their principal business activities

by a us territory or possession or a state or local government or a political subdivision of any of the foregoing if as a result more than  of the funds total assets would be invested in the securities of companies whose principal business activities are in the same industry the trustees recommend that shareholders of each fund vote to replace this fundamental investment limitation with the following amended fundamental investment limitation governing concentration the fund may not purchase the securities of any issuer other than securities issued or guaranteed by the us government or any of its agencies or instrumentalities or taxexempt obligations issued or guaranteed by a us territory or possession or a state or local government or a political subdivision of any of the foregoing if as a result more than  of the funds total assets would be invested in the securities of companies whose principal business activities are in the same industry the primary purpose of the proposal is to revise each funds fundamental concentration limitation to conform to a limitation which is expected to become standard for all municipal funds managed by fmr see adoption of standardized investment limitations on page  for spartan connecticut municipal money market fund the impact of the change in the investment limitation is that certain private purpose municipal securities that are municipal securities but not taxexempt obligations under the taxreform act of  are no longer excluded from the concentration limits if the proposal is approved the new fundamental concentration limitation could not be changed without the approval of shareholders adoption of the proposed amended limitation on concentration is not expected to affect the way each fund is managed the investment performance of each fund or the securities or instruments in which each fund invests the proposed amended limitation is not substantially different from the current policy and is not likely to have any impact on the investment techniques employed by each fund conclusion the board of trustees has concluded that the proposal will benefit each fund and its shareholders the trustees

approved by the shareholders of a fund that funds current limitation will remain unchanged other business the board knows of no other business to be brought before the meeting however if any other

please read the full text of the proxy statement below is a brief overview of the proposals to be voted upon your vote is important we appreciate you placing your trust in fidelity and look forward to helping you achieve your financial goals q what am i being asked to vote on a the board of trustees of the fidelity funds with the support of fidelity management  research co fmr has decided to create a twoboard structure in connection with this decision you are being asked to elect a board of trustees to oversee the funds you own in addition shareholders of funds in fidelity advisor series ii and fidelity court street trust are being asked to amend the declaration of trust for their funds and trusts to reduce the required quorum for future shareholder meetings q what do you mean by a twoboard structure a historically the board of each fidelity fund has consisted the same group of individual trustees who serve as trustees for all other fidelity funds in effect the fidelity funds have been overseen by a single board of trustees the trustees of the fidelity funds  with the support of fmr  have made a decision to reorganize themselves into two separate groups and thereby create two boards one board will oversee fidelity s equity and high income funds currently  funds with approximate assets of  billion while the second board will oversee fidelitys investmentgrade bond money market and asset allocation funds currently  funds with approximate assets of  billion q why did the board decide to create a twoboard structure a the decision was based on three specific factors fidelitys mutual fund business continues to diversify into new asset classes and product types for example over the past few years fidelity has expanded its product line of multiasset class funds that invest in a variety of asset classes such as preferred stocks reits inflationprotected securities floatingrate securities and commodities in addition lifecycle funds and other types of packaged solutions continue to grow in popularity as greater numbers of individuals continue to save for and transition into retirement the trustees and fmr expect an increased demand for innovative products as the securities marketplace has evolved increasingly complex investment strategies are available to fidelitys mutual funds for example the fixed income marketplace has significantly expanded with new types of securities including different types of futures options and swaps and that trend is likely to continue given prevailing demographic and business trends the trustees expect that fidelitys mutual fund business will continue to expand in recent years fidelity has made efforts to position the firm as the most trusted provider of lifetime investment solutions in the us at the same time the amount of assets held by americans over age sixty is projected to increase dramatically between now and  as the baby boomer generation nears and enters retirement the trustees and fmr believe this provides a significant growth opportunity for fidelitys business and for the mutual fund industry as a whole increased interest in principal preservation and income distribution is expected to drive asset growth in fidelitys fixed income funds and asset allocation products in particular q what is involved in creating a twoboard structure a some existing trustees and advisory board members are proposed to serve on the board overseeing the equity and high income funds while the others are proposed to serve on the board overseeing the fixed income and asset allocation funds in some cases the two boards can be created by having an existing trustee resign and the remaining trustees fill the vacancy in the majority of cases however the investment company act of   act requires that a shareholder meeting be held to elect trustees q when and how will the twoboard structure be implemented a the twoboard structure will be implemented at the same time for all fidelity funds on august   or if later immediately after the last election is held for any fidelity fund scheduled to elect trustees in connection with implementing the twoboard structure the following will occur current trustees will remain on the boards to which they have been elected or appointed and resign from the boards on which they will no longer serve former advisory board members that have been elected or appointed as trustees will join the boards on which they will serve going forward the size of the board that will oversee the equity and high income funds will be fixed at  trustees and the size of the board that will oversee the fixed income and asset allocation funds will be fixed at eight trustees q what is the affiliation of the board and fidelity a currently there are two interested trustees and nine independent trustees under the twoboard structure it is expected that there initially will be  interested trustees on each board  independent trustees on the equity and high income board and  independent trustees on the fixed income and asset allocation board trustees are determined to be interested by virtue of among other things their affiliation with the funds trusts or various other entities under common control with fmr interested trustees are compensated by fmr independent trustees have no affiliation with fmr and are compensated by each individual fund each of the new boards is expected to have  percent or more independent trustees q will the trustees that currently oversee my funds change a trustees on both boards will continue to be experienced executives who will meet throughout the year to oversee the funds activities review contractual arrangements with companies that provide services to the funds and review fund performance however certain changes in board membership are proposed depending on which board a trustee expects to join the current board consists of  trustees dennis j dirks albert r gamper george h heilmeier james h keyes marie l knowles ned c lautenbach cornelia m small william s stavropoulos and kenneth l wolfe are independent trustees and edward c johnson d and james c curvey are interested trustees arthur e johnson no relation to edward c johnson d alan lacy joseph mauriello david m thomas and michael e wiley currently serve on the advisory board at the time that the twoboard structure is implemented the size of the equity and high income funds board will be fixed at  trustees and the size of the fixed income and asset allocation funds board will be fixed at eight trustees dennis j dirks alan lacy ned c lautenbach joseph mauriello cornelia m small william s stavropoulos david m thomas michael e wiley james c curvey and edward c johnson d are proposed to serve on the board overseeing the equity and high income funds albert r gamper george h heilmeier arthur e johnson james h keyes marie l knowles kenneth l wolfe james c curvey and edward c johnson d are proposed to serve on the board overseeing the fixed income and asset allocation funds biographical information for each nominee for the fixed income and asset allocation board is included in the proxy statement the trustees fully expect that the environment of strong governance of the funds and protection of the interests of fund shareholders will continue under the new structure q why are you proposing to reduce the required quorum for future shareholder meetings for certain funds and trusts a lowering the quorum requirement will facilitate holding shareholder meetings to approve important matters necessary for the conduct of the trusts business when not enough shareholders vote a trust may be forced to adjourn meetings multiple times and incur the expense of additional shareholder solicitations and proxy solicitors in order to obtain the shareholder vote necessary to hold a meeting the reduced quorum requirement is not prohibited by massachusetts or federal law although the lower quorum requirement will allow for the approval of some matters by shareholders constituting less than a majority of the outstanding shares certain other proposals will still require a higher number of shares to be voted to meet the threshold required to approve the proposal for example the  act requires that certain items such as management contracts and b plans be approved by a majority of a funds outstanding voting securities under the  act the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities means the affirmative vote of the lesser of a  or more of the voting securities present at a shareholder meeting or represented by proxy if the holders of more than  of the outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or b more than  of the outstanding voting securities the reduced quorum requirement will not affect such matters q what role does the board play generally a the trustees serve as the fund shareholders representatives members of the board are fiduciaries and have an obligation to serve the best interests of shareholders including consideration of policy changes in addition the trustees review fund performance oversee fund activities and review contractual arrangements with companies that provide services to the fund q are board members paid a each independent trustee receives a fee for his or her service on the board and participates in a deferred compensation plan you can find the compensation table which details fees that have been paid to the trustees in the proxy statement q has the funds board of trustees approved the proposals a yes the board of trustees has unanimously approved each of the proposals and recommends that you vote to approve them q who is df king  co inc a df king is a third party proxy vendor that fidelity hires to call shareholders and record proxy votes in order to hold a shareholder meeting quorum must be reached  which currently is a majority of the shares entitled to vote in person or by proxy at the shareholder meeting if quorum is not attained the meeting must adjourn to a future date fidelity attempts to reach shareholders via multiple mailings to remind them to cast their vote as the meeting approaches phone calls may be made to clients who have not yet voted their shares so that the shareholder meeting does not have to be postponed voting your shares immediately will help minimize additional solicitation expenses and prevent the need to make a call to you to solicit your vote q who is paying for this proxy mailing and for the other solicitation costs associated with this shareholder meeting a the expenses in connection with preparing this proxy statement and its enclosures and all solicitations will be paid by each fund and class as applicable provided the expenses do not exceed any existing expense caps expenses exceeding an expense cap will be paid by fmr q how many votes am i entitled to cast a as a shareholder you are entitled to one vote for each dollar of net

a plurality of such shares is sufficient to elect trustees pursuant to proposal  with respect to proposal  votes to abstain and broker nonvotes will have the same effect as votes cast against the proposal with respect to proposal  votes to abstain and broker nonvotes will have no effect the following table summarizes the proposals applicable to each fund  to amend the declaration of trust of each of fidelity advisor series ii and fidelity court street trust to reduce the required quorum for future shareholder meetings the declaration of trust currently provides that a majority of the shares entitled to vote shall be a quorum for the transaction of business at a shareholders meeting as amended the declaration of trust article viii section  would reduce the quorum required to onethird of the shares entitled to vote lowering the quorum requirement will facilitate holding shareholder meetings to approve important matters necessary for the conduct of a trusts business such as the election of trustees when not enough shareholders vote a trust may be forced to adjourn meetings multiple times and incur the expense of additional shareholder solicitations and proxy solicitors in order to obtain the shareholder vote necessary to hold a meeting the reduced quorum requirement is not prohibited by massachusetts or federal law although the lower quorum requirement will allow for the approval of some matters by shareholders constituting less than a majority of the outstanding shares certain other proposals will still require a higher number of shares to be voted to meet the threshold required to approve the proposal for example the investment company act of   act requires that certain items such as management contracts and b plans be approved by a majority of a funds outstanding voting securities under the  act the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities means the affirmative vote of the lesser of a  or more of the voting securities present at a shareholder meeting or represented by proxy if the holders of more than  of the outstanding voting securities are present or represented by proxy or b more than  of the outstanding voting securities the reduced quorum requirement will not affect such matters shareholders have the right to vote on any declaration of trust amendment affecting their right to vote or on any matter submitted to the shareholders by the trustees on may   the trustees approved the proposed amendment and also authorized its submission to each trusts shareholders for their approval at this meeting if approved article viii section  of each declaration of trust will be amended as follows new language is underlined language to be deleted is bracketed article viii shareholders voting powers and meetings quorum and required vote section  except when a higher quorum is required by any provision of this declaration of trust or the bylaws onethird a majority of shares entitled to vote in person or by proxy shall be a quorum for the transaction of business at a shareholders meeting except that where any provision of law or of this declaration of trust permits or requires that holders of any series or class shall vote as a series or class then onethird a majority of the aggregate number of shares of that series or class entitled to vote shall be necessary to constitute a quorum for the transaction of business by that series or class any lesser number shall be sufficient for adjournments any adjourned session or sessions may be held within a reasonable time after the date set for the original meeting without the necessity of further notice except when a larger vote is required by applicable law or by any provision of this declaration of trust or the bylaws if any a majority of the shares voted in person or by proxy shall decide any questions and a plurality shall elect a trustee provided that where any provision of law or of this declaration of trust permits or requires that the holders of any series or class shall vote as a series or class then a majority of the shares of that series or class voted on the matter shall decide that matter insofar as that series or class is concerned shareholders may act by unanimous written consent actions taken by a series or class may be consented to unanimously in writing by shareholders of that series or class conclusion the board of trustees of each trust has concluded that the proposal will benefit the trust and its shareholders the trustees recommend voting for the proposal the amended declaration of trust will become effective upon shareholder approval if the proposal is not approved by shareholders of a trust the declaration of trust will remain unchanged  to elect a board of trustees the purpose of this proposal is to elect a board of trustees in connection with creating a twoboard structure for the fidelity family of funds you have received this proxy statement because you own one or more fidelity fixed income funds and you are being asked to elect a board of trustees to oversee your funds fidelitys mutual fund business and the broader mutual fund marketplace continue to expand and evolve as a result the trustees of the fidelity funds together with fmr have been considering ways to structure the board for each fidelity fund in order to ensure that fidelitys mutual fund shareholders continue to be well served by trustees in the years ahead historically the board of each fidelity fund has consisted of the same group of individual trustees who serve as trustees for all other fidelity funds in effect the fidelity funds have been overseen by a single board of trustees the trustees of the fidelity funds  with the support of fmr  have made a decision to reorganize themselves into two separate groups and thereby create two boards one board will oversee fidelitys equity and high income funds currently  funds with approximate assets of  billion while the second board will oversee fidelitys investmentgrade bond money market and asset allocation funds currently  funds with approximate assets of  billion in connection with creating two boards a slate of trustees must be put in place to oversee each group of funds the funds and trusts were aligned by investment discipline in june  some existing trustees and advisory board members are proposed to serve on the board overseeing the equity and high income funds while the others are proposed to serve on the board overseeing the fixed income and asset allocation funds in some cases the two boards can be created by having one existing trustee resign and the remaining trustees fill the vacancy in the majority of cases however the  act requires that a shareholder meeting be held to elect trustees the trustees with the support of fmr made the decision to create a twoboard structure in order to plan for the future and based their decision on three specific factors first fidelitys mutual fund business continues to diversify into new asset classes and product types for example over the past few years fidelity has expanded its product line of multiasset class funds that invest in a variety of asset classes such as preferred stocks reits inflationprotected securities floatingrate securities and commodities in addition lifecycle funds and other types of packaged solutions continue to grow in popularity as greater numbers of individuals continue to save for and transition into retirement the trustees and fmr expect an increased demand for innovative products second as the securities marketplace has evolved in recent years increasingly complex investment strategies are available to fidelitys mutual funds for example the fixed income marketplace has significantly expanded with new types of securities including different types of futures options and swaps and that trend is likely to continue finally given prevailing demographic and business trends the trustees and fmr expect that fidelitys mutual fund business will continue to expand in the future in recent years fidelity has made efforts to position the firm as the most trusted provider of lifetime investment solutions in the us at the same time the amount of assets held by americans over age sixty is projected to increase dramatically between now and  as the baby boomer generation nears and enters retirement the trustees and fmr believe this provides a significant growth opportunity for fidelitys business and for the mutual fund industry as a whole increased interest in principal preservation and income distribution is expected to drive asset growth in fidelitys fixed income funds and asset allocation products in particular the twoboard structure will be implemented at the same time for all fidelity funds on august   or if later immediately after the last election is held for any fidelity fund scheduled to elect trustees in connection with implementing a twoboard structure the following will occur current trustees will remain on the boards to which they have been elected or appointed and resign from the boards on which they will no longer serve former advisory board members that have been elected or appointed as trustees will join the boards on which they will serve going forward the size of the board that will oversee the equity and high income funds will be fixed at  trustees and the size of the board that will oversee the fixed income and asset allocation funds will be fixed at  trustees the trustees fully expect that the environment of strong governance of the funds and protection of the interests of fund shareholders will continue under the new structure except for james c curvey and arthur e johnson all nominees for the fixed income and asset allocation board are currently trustees of the trusts and have served in that capacity continuously since originally elected or appointed james c curvey is currently a trustee of fidelity advisor series ii fidelity colchester

section a of the act defines “control” as the “power to exercise a controlling influence over the management or policies of a company” but excludes circumstances in which “such power is solely the result of an official position with such company” because the funds share a common investment adviser or have an investment adviser that is under common control with those of the other funds
