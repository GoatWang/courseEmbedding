sample in some records b  d  sep  david and clarinda had four children john b abt  daniel b  benjamin t b  d bef  and margaret here is a picture of david o denny and his third wife elizabeth thompson dulin denny information from denny scholar audrey moran ramoranquikcom  and ron bachman see below picture from my uncle leland burnett more denny information from a new correspondent my fifth cousin once removed ron bachman osbacherolscom elizabeth thompson dulin denny is my greatgreat grandmother her son benjamin franklin dulin was the stepson of david o denny benjamin grew up with your ancestor margaret denny i know quite a lot about the denny family and am continuing to research it margaret denny burnett was the second cousin once removed of my greatgrandmother sarah denny dulin my sarah met her future husband benjamin franklin dulin while working in the household of david o denny her second cousin the dennys and dulins were impossibly intertwined  beginning back in pickaway county ohio and getting even more so in vigo county indiana the woman in the photograph above is the mother of benjamin franklin dulin she was born in  in pennsylvania and died in terre haute on january   i have a copy of her death certificate she was the third and last of david o dennys wives david o denny was killed in a boiler explosion on thanksgiving day november   this was a doubly tragic event as his grandson david denny was killed along with him even though david o denny and his third wife my ancestor had no children together they had grandchildren together david the boy killed in the explosion was the son of davids son james b denny and elizabeths daughter frances jane dulin who were married in vigo county on january   i wont go into all the other incredible interconnections of the dennys and dulins as a descendant of david o denny you have two denny immigrant forbears who undoubtedly were brothers william denny the elder born february  in ulster died october   in uwchlan township chester county pa is the closest ancestor you and i share i have visited his grave in forks of brandywine church near downington pa he and some of his sons and numerous other relatives are buried near the beautiful presbyterian church there and the tombstones are in superb condition william the elder had at least one brother who came to america and his name was david your greatgreat grandfather david o denny was descended from this immigrant too as a matter of fact david o denny was the product of three generations of david dennys who married cousins named margaret denny this is the truth so you are much more of a denny than i am most of the information i have on the earliest dennys comes from the threevolume work titled denny genealogy by margaret collins denny dixon and elizabeth chapman denny vann the earliest information is probably the most accurate in the trilogy  it is based on family papers bibles tax records etc in the later generations especially in vigo county the authors made some major mistakes apparently they ran out of steam because they failed to discover the  pension records of my ancestor william r denny and the civil war records of my greatgrandfather benjamin f dulin which present a clear picture of the dulindenny relationship  from ron bachman greatgrandson of benjamin f dulin and sarah ann denny william burnetts father was named
