conference call with management scheduled for  pm eastern time tustin calif feb   globe newswire  peregrine pharmaceuticals inc nasdaqpphm nasdaqpphmp a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing therapeutics to stimulate the bodys immune system to fight cancer today announced that it is discontinuing the companys phase iii sunrise trial of bavituximab in patients with previously treated locally advanced or metastatic nonsquamous nonsmall cell lung cancer nsclc the decision to stop the trial was based on the recommendation of the studys independent data monitoring committee idmc following a prespecified interim analysis performed after  of targeted overall events patient deaths in the study were reached results of the analysis demonstrated that the bavituximab plus docetaxel group did not show a sufficient improvement in overall survival as compared to the docetaxel group to warrant continuation of the study the interim analysis showed that the bavituximab combination group is performing as expected according to the original trial assumptions in terms of overall survival while the docetaxel group is dramatically outperforming overall survival expectations based on the original trial assumptions and as compared to recently published studies let me start by taking this opportunity to thank all of the patients their families and the physicians who participated in the sunrise trial while we are deeply disappointed by this early outcome from the sunrise trial we plan to take a deliberate and detailed approach in reviewing and verifying all available data from the trial in order to understand what subgroups or other patient characteristics may have impacted the performance of the study while we perform this analysis we plan to put our other chemotherapy combination studies on hold until we have a clear understanding of the sunrise study results said steven w king president and chief executive officer of peregrine while this is an unexpected and disappointing setback for the bavituximab chemotherapy combination clinical program we have not seen anything in this trial result that diminishes our enthusiasm for advancing our immunooncology io combination trials the io combination studies are based on different mechanistic synergies that are clearly separate from the chemotherapy combination being evaluated in the sunrise study in addition it is important to note that in no way do these results have any impact on our contract manufacturing business conducted through our wholly owned subsidiary avid bioservices this business has shown consistent revenue growth and has been instrumental in maintaining a strong cash position and our plan is to continue growing this business as of february   avid bioservices had a revenue backlog in excess of  million under committed contracts from existing clients in addition peregrine had  million in cash and equivalents as of january   conference call today peregrine will host a conference

webcast please visit httpirperegrineinccomeventscfm about bavituximab a targeted investigational immunotherapy bavituximab is an investigational chimeric monoclonal antibody that targets phosphatidylserine ps signals from ps inhibit the ability of immune cells to recognize and fight tumors bavituximab is believed to override ps mediated immunosuppressive signaling by blocking the engagement of ps with its receptors as well as by sending an alternate immune activating signal ps targeting antibodies have been shown to shift the functions of immune cells in tumors resulting in multiple signs of immune activation and robust antitumor immune responses  about peregrine pharmaceuticals inc peregrine pharmaceuticals inc is a biopharmaceutical company focused on developing
