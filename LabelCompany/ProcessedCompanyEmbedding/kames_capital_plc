this is not guaranteed in any wayproperty income fund where funds are invested in property or indirectly into property investors may not be able to switch or cash in their investment when they want because investments in direct property and indirect property in the fund may not always be readily realisable if this is the case and in accordance with the fund’s prospectus we may defer a request to switch or cash in units whilst property valuations are conducted by an independent expert any such valuation is a matter of the valuers opinion the spread between the price to buy and sell is likely to be wider than for other less specialist funds and may vary there is no guarantee that investments in property will increase in value or that rental growth will take place there is a risk that a property held in the fund’s portfolio could default on its rental payments there is the possibility that a portion of the portfolio will be held in cash if the supply of new investment opportunities is limited which if the situation persists may restrict the performance of the fund funds that invest mainly in one type of asset are more vulnerable to market sentiment we reserve the right to change the pricing basis of the funds and any change will mean an increase or decrease in the price at which you may deal references to tax are based on current regulations which may be subject to change for

investments in direct property and indirect property in the fund may not always be readily realisable if this is the case and in accordance with the fund’s prospectus we may defer a request to switch or cash in units whilst property valuations are conducted by an independent expert any such valuation is a matter of the valuers opinion the spread between the price to buy and sell is likely to be wider than for other less specialist funds and may vary there is no guarantee that investments in property will increase in value or that rental growth will take place there is a risk that a property held in the fund’s portfolio could default on its rental payments there is the possibility that a portion of the portfolio will be held in cash if the supply of new investment opportunities is limited which if the situation persists may restrict the performance of the fund funds that invest mainly in one type of asset are more vulnerable to market sentiment we reserve the right to change the

cash in their investment when they want because investments in direct property and indirect property in the fund may not always be readily realisable if this is the case and in accordance with the fund’s prospectus we may defer a request to switch or cash in units whilst property valuations are conducted by an independent expert any such valuation is a matter of the valuers opinion the spread between the price to buy and sell is likely to be wider than for other less specialist funds and may vary there is no guarantee that investments in property will increase in value or that rental growth will take place there is a risk that a property held in the fund’s portfolio could default on its rental payments there is the possibility that a portion of the portfolio will be held in cash if the supply of new investment opportunities is limited which if the situation persists may restrict the performance of the fund funds that invest mainly in one type of asset are more vulnerable to

any way investment professionals must ensure that they meet their obligations in relation to their understanding of this product and the risks involved and the extent to which this product meets the needs of their clients property income fund where funds are invested in property or indirectly into property investors may not be able to switch or cash in their investment when they want because investments in direct property and indirect property in the fund may not always be readily realisable if this is the case and in accordance with the fund’s prospectus we may defer a request to switch or cash in units whilst property valuations are conducted by an independent expert any such valuation is a matter of the valuers opinion the spread between the price to buy and sell is likely to be wider than for other less specialist funds and may vary there is no guarantee that investments in property will increase in value or that rental growth will take place there is a risk that a property held in the fund’s portfolio could default on its rental payments there is the possibility that a portion of the portfolio will be held in cash if the supply of new investment opportunities is limited which if the situation persists may restrict the performance of the fund funds that invest mainly in one type of asset are more vulnerable to market sentiment we reserve the right to change the pricing basis of the funds and any change will mean an increase or decrease in the price at which you may deal references to tax are based on current regulations which may be subject to change for
