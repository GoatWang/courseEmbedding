things to know about hotel financing in  written by live oak bank adequate hotel financing continues to be a major resource for us hoteliers new construction and renovation projects are typically complex and expensive so here are ten things you need to know about your funding options and industry trends as we move into  usda loans department of agriculture loans are a viable funding option depending upon property location they offer competitive interest rates as opposed to conventional rates and allow for higher leverage check with your lender to see if you’re eligible sba loans small business administration loans continue to be great options for hoteliers that have never had this type of loan and meet the requirements some sba loans offer longer amortization periods and interest only periods that help ease cash flow during the rampup period conventional loans conventional capital for new development and construction is likely to continue decreasing even if you’re a highly experienced and solvent borrower due to fears of an overbuilt marketplace conventional banks will continue to shy away from these projects creative lending in some cases conventional capital can be layered into a comprehensive loan package with other types of loan proceeds this innovative method is used by some lenders to achieve adequate project funding pip loans property improvement plans can be financed using conventional or sba capital these loans allow hoteliers to maintain their liquidity by keeping more capital while completing necessary renovations refinance with the continuing pullback of cmbs and life companies from the hotel lending market it’s important to work with a trusted lender who understands the marketplace and various loan structures consider a lender who is committed to providing viable refinance options that meet your goals flexibility flexible payment options inclusion of closing costs and sufficient working capital in the final financing package are huge benefits not all lenders have the capacity to offer this but hoteliers should seek these advantages interest rates the continued suppression of interest rates could be artificially inflating real estate values which may lead to tightened underwriting standards thus hoteliers may find that financial institutions are lowering loan to value thresholds and increasing minimum debt service coverage standards construction costs these will likely continue to rise as they have in the recent past making accessible financing even more valuable for hoteliers preparedness most lenders will require a franchise comfort letter and want your loan terms to match your franchise agreement maximize your readiness for financing by obtaining the proper documents and organizing all required information

bank in the competitive hospitality industry every hotel company is looking for ways to stand out from the crowd the ability to boast a beautiful new lobby reimagined guest rooms or innovative amenities is a pivotal step in attracting customers—benefitting both the franchisor and franchisee when completing a property improvement plan pip required by a franchisor hotel franchisees should give careful consideration to certain components and deadlines included in the agreement five key areas to take into account include financing construction legal regulatory and negotiation paying close attention to these elements can help you maximize the advantages of a pip and avoid potentially costly mistakes of course the details of these concerns will vary on a hotelbyhotel basis your specific franchise or membership the scope of your project available hotel financing packages branding and other unique components may prove significant however in general getting advice from wellqualified professionals in each of these five areas will serve you well during a major renovation financing simplify the process property improvement plans are frequently very capitalintensive projects with complex financial implications seeking the best available loan programs for your particular project can be vital to meeting your obligations to the franchise it can also facilitate the process and greatly benefit your business by wrapping up the renovations as quickly as possible and maintaining positive cash flow financing helps you maintain your liquidity which is usually cheaper than raising equity on your own from investors the best route is to talk to a lender or bank that specializes in hotel financing loan programs like the small business administration sba in addition to conventional loans are viable options and can be customized to meet your specific needs often these lenders can close and fund your project in less time than traditional banks because the process is streamlined for the hotel industry another common option is leasing leasing the furniture fixtures and equipment ffe means that the lender owns the ffe until the end of the lease contract then the hotel owner purchases it from the lender this option and other creative banking solutions are becoming increasingly popular alternatives that make pips easier to execute construction managing the details will the franchisor select a qualified project manager or will your business bear most of this responsibility have you prepared and submitted a timetable for meeting project goals who will draft publicize gather and review subcontractor bids before a major renovation most franchisees will need to work closely with an assigned project manager to clarify in detail project goals and schedules such careful advance planning can help prevent cost overruns many hotel industryfocused banks can now assist you with the tasks involved in the construction phase there are as many reasons for construction schedule delays as there are pillows in hotels even when an authorized setback occurs you still may find yourself contractually obligated to serve effective notice about anticipated completion dates consulting closely with your project manager helps ensure that everyone involved in your hotel renovation fully understands the expectations legal stick to the contract gathering trusted legal advice at an early stage from an attorney who understands contract law and how the hotel industry operates can help you move forward efficiently if you do experience a disruption in the course of implementing a property improvement plan you’ll want to discuss performance obligations and deadline issues for example what if one of your major suppliers experiences a significant operational outage and can’t deliver your new ffe on time a modified time frame usually requires you to notify the franchisor about specific delays also consider that many franchises invest significant sums promoting hotel renovations and upgraded facilities should holdups occur even for legitimate reasons the documents underlying the plans for hotel renovations may require you to notify a specific office or individual in advance especially if your franchisor promotes thousands of hotels domestically or internationally scheduling issues can figure prominently in maintaining a smooth business relationship even changing your brand within a single franchise often entails extensive planning so make sure you understand and adhere closely to contractual provisions regulatory from ecology to cocktails depending upon the extent of your project and the location of your hotel you could encounter some regulatory issues as you prepare for renovations to begin these concerns run the gamut from environmental factors—such as proposed refurbishments that impact environmentally fragile zones or endangered species of plants and animals—to the provision of public facilities labor laws and other bureaucratic matters if you plan to install a new upscale dining venue owned and operated directly by the hotel you may need to check into local regulations relating to the sale and provision of alcoholic beverages typically your franchisor will serve as a useful source of preliminary information about this issue since many chains possess extensive experience building and managing restaurants as well look to them as a valuable resource negotiation accomplishing goals together seeing eyetoeye with the franchisor is normally a fluid process because you both have a sizable stake in the success of your business it makes sense for both parties to come to a reasonable mutual plan no two hotel properties are the same your hotel offers unique features values and challenges clearly communicate those to your franchise representatives while understanding that they have a brand to preserve and promote renovations should be viewed by both of you as an important and momentous step in the life of your hotel success from start to finish carefully addressing the financing construction legal and regulatory issues of your pip then negotiating a fair plan with your

live oak bank is your hotel property located in a rural or suburban community if so then your new development could be eligible for financing through the us department of agriculture’s usda business and industry bi guaranteed loan program purpose the purpose of the bi program is to enhance and expand economic growth opportunities available to business owners in rural communities this is achieved by extending additional credit through guaranteed loans which allows lenders more flexibility when offering terms and amounts to rural borrowers hotels are often ideal projects for this type of development financing depending upon location and other prerequisites basic criteria to be eligible a hotel borrower must have or propose a business that resides in a usda eligible area – check property address here positively impacts the local environment or economy produces new employment opportunities for local citizens focuses on and emphasizes water conservation or promotes the construction and use of renewable energy systems like solar ideal hotel borrowers have previous and extensive hotel ownership experience as well as fico credit scores of  or higher all owners

fee of  and then a  renewal fee each subsequent year dependent on the outstanding guaranteed principle balance most traditional banks and lenders don’t offer the usda’s bi program because of its unique process and standards unless you specialize in originating these loans offering them can be more trouble than it’s worth for banks live oak is one of the few that is committed to understanding and actively participating in this program for eligible hoteliers also the usda lending process is frontloaded with more documentation and research than most other business loans this makes the process more stringent at the beginning but easier to close on the backend of the process if borrowers successfully survive the early gauntlet getting started live oak is laser focused on innovation in financing and technology within niche industries like hotels therefore we have streamlined the process as much as possible for borrowers looking to leverage the usda bi loan program this translates to supreme confidence and transparency for our customers view our usda lending process diagram live oak’s first step begins with project sizing and due diligence which generally results in a project proposal letter to the borrower from there we support usda environmental scoping and order appraisal ipr and phase i next our team completes the underwriting and submits a full application to the usda the usda’s first step starts with a preapplication review that hopefully results in preapproval once live oak’s application is processed the usda oversees environmental scoping of the project site and any potential impacts due to development they then submit a full application to an internal committee for further review the goal of this phase of the process is to produce a conditional commitment from the usda which also triggers live oak to deliver a commitment letter to the borrower meanwhile during this phase you as the customer should provide both the lender and the usda with full project details and a good faith deposit the borrower will also concurrently support environmental scoping along with the lender the borrower must obtain complete construction plans and provide any necessary support to the lender for the appraisal ipr and phase  furthermore any other required documents must be sent to the lender for underwriting the result of this phase is an equity obligation by the borrower via an executed commitment letter closing and groundbreaking once live oak has delivered your commitment letter we will begin completing our closing checklist and introduce our construction loan department to the process this specialized hotel construction team supports the usda’s guarantee issuance process and helps you make plans with your contractor architect and any other construction vendors meanwhile the usda will start processing live oak’s commitment and closing package with the end goal of a full guarantee issuance in mind at this point you as the borrower should

renovation projects are typically complex and expensive so here are ten things you need to know about your funding options and industry trends as we move into  usda loans department of agriculture loans are a viable funding option depending upon property location they offer competitive interest rates as opposed to conventional rates and allow for higher leverage check with your lender to see if you’re eligible sba loans small business administration loans continue to be great options for hoteliers that have never had this type of loan and meet the requirements some sba loans offer longer amortization periods and interest only periods that help ease cash flow during the rampup period conventional loans conventional capital for new development and construction is likely to continue decreasing even if you’re a highly experienced and solvent borrower due to fears of an overbuilt marketplace conventional banks will continue to shy away from these projects creative lending in some cases conventional capital can be layered into a comprehensive loan package with other types of loan proceeds this innovative method is used by some lenders to achieve adequate project funding pip loans property improvement plans can be financed using conventional or sba capital these loans allow hoteliers to maintain their liquidity by keeping more capital while completing necessary renovations refinance with the continuing pullback of cmbs and life companies from the hotel lending market it’s important to work with a trusted lender who understands the marketplace and various loan structures consider a lender who is committed to providing viable refinance options that meet your goals flexibility flexible payment options inclusion of closing costs and sufficient working capital in the final financing package are huge benefits not all lenders have the capacity to offer this but hoteliers should seek these advantages interest rates the continued suppression of interest rates could be artificially inflating real estate values which may lead to tightened underwriting standards thus hoteliers may find that financial institutions are lowering loan to value thresholds and increasing minimum debt service coverage standards construction costs these will likely continue to rise as they have in the recent past making accessible financing even more valuable for hoteliers preparedness most lenders will require a franchise comfort letter and want your loan terms to match your franchise agreement maximize your readiness for financing by obtaining the proper

resource center  five keys to a smooth hotel pip renovation five keys to a smooth hotel pip renovation written by live oak bank in the competitive hospitality industry every hotel company is looking for ways to stand out from the crowd the ability to boast a beautiful new lobby reimagined guest rooms or innovative amenities is a pivotal step in attracting customers—benefitting both the franchisor and franchisee when completing a property improvement plan pip required by a franchisor hotel franchisees should give careful consideration to certain components and deadlines included in the agreement five key areas to take into account include financing construction legal regulatory and negotiation paying close attention to these elements can help you maximize the advantages of a pip and avoid potentially costly mistakes of course the details of these concerns will vary on a hotelbyhotel basis your specific franchise or membership the scope of your project available hotel financing packages branding and other unique components may prove significant however in general getting advice from wellqualified professionals in each of these five areas will serve you well during a major renovation financing simplify the process property improvement plans are frequently very capitalintensive projects with complex financial implications seeking the best available loan programs for your particular project can be vital to meeting your obligations to the franchise it can also facilitate the process and greatly benefit your business by wrapping up the renovations as quickly as possible and maintaining positive cash flow financing helps you maintain your liquidity which is usually cheaper than raising equity on your own from investors the best route is to talk to a lender or bank that specializes in hotel financing loan programs like the small business administration sba in addition to conventional loans are viable options and can be customized to meet your specific needs often these lenders can close and fund your project in less time than traditional banks because the process is streamlined for the hotel industry another common option is leasing leasing the furniture fixtures and equipment ffe means that the lender owns the ffe until the end of the lease contract then the hotel owner purchases it from the lender this option and other creative banking solutions are becoming increasingly popular alternatives that make pips easier to execute construction managing the details will the franchisor select a qualified project manager or will your business bear most of this responsibility have you prepared and submitted a timetable for meeting project goals who will draft publicize gather and review subcontractor bids before a major renovation most franchisees will need to work closely with an assigned project manager to clarify in detail project goals and schedules such careful advance planning can help prevent cost overruns many hotel industryfocused banks can now assist you with the tasks involved in the construction phase there are as many reasons for construction schedule delays as there are pillows in hotels even when an authorized setback occurs you still may find yourself contractually obligated to serve effective notice about anticipated completion dates consulting closely with your project manager helps ensure that everyone involved in your hotel renovation fully understands the expectations legal stick to the contract gathering trusted legal advice at an early stage from an attorney who understands contract law and how the hotel industry operates can help you move forward efficiently if you do experience a disruption in the course of implementing a property improvement plan you’ll want to discuss performance obligations and deadline issues for example what if one of your major suppliers experiences a significant operational outage and can’t deliver your new ffe on time a modified time frame usually requires you to notify the franchisor about specific delays also consider that many franchises invest significant sums promoting hotel renovations and upgraded facilities should holdups occur even for legitimate reasons the documents underlying the plans for hotel renovations may require you to notify a specific office or individual in advance especially if your franchisor promotes thousands of hotels domestically or internationally scheduling issues can figure prominently in maintaining a smooth business relationship even changing your brand within a single franchise often entails extensive planning so make sure you understand and adhere closely to contractual provisions regulatory from ecology to cocktails depending upon the extent of your project and the location of your hotel you could encounter some regulatory issues as you prepare for renovations to begin these concerns run the gamut from environmental factors—such as proposed refurbishments that impact environmentally fragile zones or endangered species of plants and animals—to the provision of public facilities labor laws and other bureaucratic matters if you plan to install a new upscale dining venue owned and operated directly by the hotel you may need to check into local regulations relating to the sale and provision of alcoholic beverages typically your franchisor will serve as a useful source of preliminary information about this issue since many chains possess extensive experience building and managing restaurants as well look to them as a valuable resource negotiation accomplishing goals together seeing eyetoeye with the franchisor is normally a fluid process because you both have a sizable stake in the success of your business it makes sense for both parties to come to a reasonable mutual plan no two hotel properties are the same your hotel offers unique features values and challenges clearly communicate those to your franchise representatives while understanding that they have a brand to preserve and promote renovations should be viewed by both of you as an important and momentous step in the life of your hotel success from start to finish carefully addressing the financing construction legal and
