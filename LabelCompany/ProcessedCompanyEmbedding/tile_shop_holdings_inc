highlights close window coverage initiation tile shop holdings inc kenneth j defranco jr  june    value line has initiated coverage of tile shop holdings inc tts in its flagship product the value line investment survey the company is a specialty retailer of manufactured and natural stone tiles setting and maintenance materials and related accessories in the united states it offers a wide selection of products at competitive price levels while providing customer service in an extensive showroom setting presently the business retails over  products from around the world including ceramic porcelain glass and stainless steel manufactured tiles and marble granite quartz sandstone travertine slate and onyx natural tiles primarily under its proprietary rush river and fired earth brands moreover tile shop makes it a point to buy tile goods and accessories directly from producers which aids in cost efficiency and quality control too tts manufactures its own setting and maintenance materials such as thin set grout and sealers under the superior brand name lastly the company currently operates  stores in  states with an average size of  square feet per location while also selling items on its website the retail tile market is highlyfragmented therefore tile shop competes directly with large national home centers that offer a wide range of home improvement products in addition to tile such as the home depot hd  free home depot stock report and lowe’s low regional and local specialty retailers of tile including tile america world of tile century tile floor and décor factorydirect stores like daltile and florida tile as well as a large number of privatelyowned singlesite stores in addition it squares off indirectly with businesses that offer other types of floor coverings namely wood floors carpet and vinyl sheets the barriers to entry for the retail tile industry are relatively low and new or existing tile retailers could enter tile shop’s markets and increase competition fairly easily furthermore it is important to note that many of its competitors enjoy advantages over tts most notably wider name recognition longer operating histories and greater financial technical and other resources that said the company believes it can compete with respect to each of these factors by providing an extensive product portfolio with attractive prices as well as convenient retail store locations with solid customer service and onsite instructional guidance what’s more while some larger factorydirect entities manufacture their own products most of its peers purchase their tile from domestic manufacturers or distributors when they receive an order from a customer thus it takes these retailers longer than tts to deliver goods to customers and their prices tend to be higher this stock has been surging upward of late indeed following an initial public offering in november of  the issue began trading on the nasdaq exchange in august of  since then these shares have jumped more than  compared to just a  advance in the sp  index all told the ongoing housing market recovery augurs well for this company as it ought to strengthen demand for its offerings too a healthier economy should allow tile shop to open additional store fronts and invest in a wider array of products and services all in all subscribers interested in this specialty retailer of

stores for increased efficiency enlarge chris homeister of the tile shop nancy kuehn since  the tile shop nasdaq tts has increased its store count from about  locations to over  today homeister wants to continue growing that number by  to  percent annually homeister spoke with the business journal recently about how he plans to continue company growth the companys online showroom and the importance of its smallerformat locations the conversation was edited for length and clarity how does the tile shop plan to continue growing we continue to make investments in our online experience we have customers experience the tile shop through the online brand and they can also look at how they can do a room through our digital design studio we’ve already opened seven new physical stores this year and we’d be looking at  to  next year we feel that we can have between  to  stores across the country where have you opened new stores recently we’ve already opened in new jersey and maryland were opening another store in arizona and will enter the houston market later this year with our first store there texas is another big market for us regarding future growth what is the digital design studio that you mentioned earlier one of the things a customer needs help with in many cases is the ability to visualize what tile will look like when it goes into their home so we’ve implemented this design studio it’s an online tool that can be used outside the store and it’s free to use what many consumers are doing is starting a project online in their home and then they come to the store a store associate can then bring up their saved project to work with them further many brickandmortar retail stores are closing partially due to more online shopping what makes the tile shop different great retailers have experiential store environments and you couple that with a strong customerservice element we want to have high customer service coupled with great products and have it come alive in an inspirational showroom i think consumers are constantly telling retailers that in order for me to come to your store you have to give me an experience that i can’t experience elsewhere are you still focusing on smaller tile shop stores when i came to the company the stores were around  square feet we changed the store size to be more of a boutique model if you can use boutique and  square feet in the same sentence it’s allowed us to be flexible in the retail real estate market across the country it allows us to also go into more metropolitan areas to operate efficiently even though the store size shrunk by about  percent we still have the same amount of assortment we’ve had to be smarter with our store products and displays chris homeister age  education bachelor of business
