and exchange commission  f street ne washington dc    revirtus etf trust ii file nos  and    ladies and gentlemen   we are submitting this correspondence on behalf of our client the virtus etf trust ii the “trust” ms anu dubey of the staff the “staff” of the securities and exchange commission the “commission” provided oral comments on september   regarding the abovereferenced registration statement the “registration statement” on form na under the securities act of  the “securities act” and the investment company act of  the “ act” to register common shares of the virtus newfleet dynamic credit etf formerly the virtus newfleet high yield income etf the “fund” a series of the trust the following are the comments provided and the trust’s response to each   prospectus fees and expenses of the fund please confirm that the expense limitation agreement between the trust and virtus etf advisers llc the “adviser” with respect to the fund will remain in place for at least one year from the effective date of the registration statement see instruction e to item  of form na response the trust confirms that the fund’s expense limitation agreement will remain in place for at least one year from the effective date of the registration statement principal investment strategy the disclosure states that “the fund will invest not less than  of its assets in high yield securities” please describe the high yield securities in which the fund will invest as part of its principal investment strategy including whether the fund will invest in assetbacked securities eg mortgagebacked securities collateralized loan obligations please add the corresponding risks of the applicable types of high yield securities to the “principal risks” section in addition if the fund will invest in collateralized loan obligations “clos” or other collateralized debt obligations “cdos” that rely on sections c or c of the investment company act of  “ act” please disclose supplementally whether there are any limits on the amount the fund can invest in such investments and whether the fund treats these investments as illiquid response as indicated above the trust has changed the fund’s name to the virtus newfleet dynamic credit etf in light of this change the fund has made appropriate changes to the description of the fund’s principal investment strategies to reflect the fund’s focus on credit     instruments generally as opposed to a singular focus on high yield securities consistent with the foregoing the the description of the fund’s principal investment strategies including the fund’s  investment limitation has been deleted and replaced with the following changes are indicated below “in seeking to achieve the fund’s investment objective newfleet asset management llc the “subadviser” applies a timetested approach to credit research to capitalize on opportunities across undervalued areas of the credit high yield fixed income ie “junk bond” markets high yield fixed income securities are those that are rated “below investment grade” which the subadviser defines as being rated lower than the four highest rating categories of a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or if unrated determined to be of comparable quality by the subadviser  under normal market conditions the fund will invest not less than  of its total assets in high yield securities “credit investments” which the subadviser defines as including i corporate and sovereign bonds ii loans including without limitation through loan participations and assignments iii securitized instruments including without limitation mortgagebacked securities collateralized loan obligations and other securities backed by pools of assets such as mortgages loans or other receivables iv interest rate futures including without limitation us treasury futures and v exchangetraded funds “etfs” that are linked to or provide investment exposure to any of the foregoing types of securities the fund may invest in credit investments of any credit quality without limitation including without limitation high yield credit investments ie “junk bonds” high yield credit investments are those that are rated “below investment grade” which the subadviser defines as being rated lower than the four highest rating categories of a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or if unrated determined to be of comparable quality by the subadviser the fund is an actively managed etf and thus does not seek to replicate the performance of a specified passive index of securities instead it uses an active investment strategy that seeks to meet its investment objective”   additionally the trust has added the following disclosure to the “principal risks” section   “exchange traded funds the fund may invest in actively managed or indexbased etfs through its positions in etfs the fund will be subject to the risks associated with such vehicles’ investments including the possibility that the value of the securities or instruments held by an etf could decrease or increase investments in etfs are also subject to the following additional risks   ·market value risk the market value of an etf’s shares may differ from its nav this difference in price may be due to the fact that the supply and demand in the market for etf shares at any point in time is not always identical to the supply and demand in the market for the underlying basket of securities accordingly there may be times when an etf trades at a premium creating the risk that the fund pays more than nav for an etf when making a purchase or discount creating the risks that the fund’s nav is reduced for undervalued etfs it holds and that the fund receives less than nav when selling an etf   ·tracking risk indexbased etfs in which the fund invests may not be able to replicate exactly the performance of the indices they track because the total     return generated by the etf’s underlying securities will be reduced by transaction costs incurred in adjusting the actual balance of the securities in addition indexbased etfs in which the fund invests may incur expenses not incurred by their applicable indices certain securities comprising the indices may from time to time temporarily be unavailable which may further impede an etf’s ability to track its applicable index or match its performance   ·investment limitation under the investment company act of  act as amended “ act” the fund may not acquire shares of an etf if immediately after such acquisition the fund and its affiliated persons would hold more than  of the etf’s total outstanding shares unless i the etf or the fund has received an order for exemptive relief from the  limitation from the securities and exchange commission that is applicable to the fund and ii the etf and the fund take appropriate steps to comply with any conditions in such order accordingly the  limitation may prevent the fund from allocating its investments in the manner the subadviser considers optimal or cause the subadviser to select an investment other than that which the subadviser considers optimal   ·expenses to the extent the fund invests in etfs your cost of investing in the fund will generally be higher than the cost of investing directly in etfs because you will bear the fund’s direct fees and expenses in addition to the fees and expenses charged by the underlying etfs in which the fund invests furthermore the fund’s investments in etfs could affect the timing amount and character of the fund’s distributions and therefore may increase the amount of your tax liability   ·sampling risk the indexbased etfs in which the fund invests may utilize a representative sampling approach to track their respective underlying indices etfs that utilize a representative sampling approach are subject to an increased risk of tracking error because the securities selected for the etf in the aggregate may vary from the investment profile of the underlying index additionally if using a representative sampling approach an etf will typically hold a smaller number of securities than the underlying index and as a result an adverse development to an issuer of securities that the etf holds could result in a greater decline in nav than would be the case if the etf held all of the securities in the underlying index   futures contracts  a futures contract is a bilateral agreement to buy or sell a security or deliver a cash settlement price in the case of a contract relating to an index or otherwise not calling for physical delivery at the end of trading in the contracts for a set price in the future  an interest rate future is a futures contract with an interestbearing instrument as the underlying asset such as a us treasury bond or us treasury note the fund will be required to deposit with its custodian in a segregated account cash us government securities suitable money market instruments or liquid highgrade fixed income securities known as “initial margin” in an amount required for the particular futures contract as set by the exchange on which the contract is traded  this margin amount may be significantly modified from time to time by the exchange during the term     of the contract  if the price of an open futures contract changes by increase in the case of a sale or by decrease in the case of a purchase so that the loss on the futures contract reaches a point at which the margin on deposit does not satisfy margin requirements the broker will require an increase in the margin the fund will incur brokerage fees when it purchases and sell futures contracts positions taken in the futures markets are not normally held until delivery or cash settlement is required but are instead liquidated through offsetting transactions which may result in a gain or a loss while futures positions taken by the fund will usually be liquidated in this manner the fund may instead make or take delivery of underlying securities whenever it appears economically advantageous for the fund to do so”   the fund does not intend to invest in companies that rely on the exclusions from the definition of an investment company in sections c and c of the  act as a principal investment strategy such as clos and cdos nevertheless there is no formal limit on the fund’s ability to invest in such investments other than applicable liquidity or other limits imposed by the  act or the rules thereunder the fund will consider illiquid those securities that cannot be sold or disposed of in the ordinary course of business within seven days at approximately the value ascribed to them by the fund to the extent that clos or cdos meet the foregoing definition they will be considered illiquid by the fund   in connection with the fund’s potential investments in clos and cdos the trust has added the following disclosure to the “other investment policies” section of the fund’s statement of additional information “sai”   “collateralized debt obligations “cdos” the fund may invest in cdos a cdo is a security backed by a pool of bonds loans or other debt obligations cdos are not limited to investing in one type of debt and accordingly a cdo may own corporate bonds commercial loans assetbacked securities residential mortgagebacked securities commercial mortgagebacked securities or emerging market debt the cdo’s securities are typically divided into several classes or bond tranches that have differing levels of investment grade or credit tolerances most cdo issues are structured in a way that enables the senior bond classes and mezzanine classes to receive investmentgrade credit ratings credit risk is shifted to the most junior class of securities if any defaults occur in the assets backing a cdo the senior bond classes are first in line to receive principal and interest payments followed by the mezzanine classes and finally by the lowest rated or nonrated class which is known as the equity tranche similar in structure to a collateralized mortgage obligation described above cdos are unique in that they represent different types of debt and credit risk   collateralized loan obligations the fund may invest in clos which are debt instruments backed solely by a pool of other debt securities the risks of an investment in a clo depend largely on the type of the collateral securities and the class of the clo in which the fund invests some clos have credit ratings but are typically issued in various classes with various priorities normally clos are privately offered and sold that is they are not registered under the securities laws and may be characterized by the fund as illiquid securities however an active dealer market may exist for clos that qualify for rule a transactions in addition to the normal interest rate default and other risks of fixed income securities clos carry additional risks     including without limitation the possibility that distributions from collateral securities will not be adequate to make interest or other payments the quality of the collateral may decline in value or default the fund may invest in clos that are subordinate to other classes values may be volatile and disputes with the issuer may produce unexpected investment results” additionally the trust has added the following disclosure to the “other investment policies” section of the sai   “credit default swaps the fund may invest in credit default swaps “cdss” including without limitation contracts on individual securities and index credit default swaps which are contracts on baskets or indices of securities the economic return of cdss depends upon the performance of the reference obligations andor the reference entities exposure to the credit risk of such types of assets through the purchase of cdss presents risks in addition to those resulting from direct purchases of such types of assets as the related reference obligations for instance an active market may not exist for any of the cdss in which the fund invests as a result the fund’s ability to maximize returns or minimize losses on such cdss may be impaired in addition the fund will usually have a contractual relationship only with the counterparty offering the cds and not the reference obligors on the reference obligations as a result the fund generally will have no right directly to enforce compliance by the reference obligors with the terms of the reference obligations no rights of setoff against the reference obligors or any voting or other rights of ownership with respect to the reference obligations the fund will not directly benefit from any collateral supporting such reference obligations and will not have the benefit of the remedies that would normally be available to a holder of such reference obligations even if in the case of physically settled cdss the fund obtains such rights upon delivery of the defaulted reference obligations the fund’s ability to “workout” effectively the defaulted reference obligations may be significantly diminished   cdss also expose the fund to counterparty risk in the event of the insolvency of the counterparty the fund will be treated as a general creditor of such counterparty and will not have any claim with respect to the reference obligations consequently the fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to defaults by such counterparty as well as by the reference obligors   when the fund enters into a short unfunded cds upon the occurrence of a credit event the fund has an obligation to either deliver the defaulted reference obligation or an equivalent cash payment similarly when the fund enters into a long unfunded cds upon the occurrence of a credit event the fund has an obligation to deliver a cash payment related to such credit event to the extent the fund lacks adequate funds to satisfy these delivery requirements the fund will be required to liquidate other fund investments in a manner which may be inconsistent with its original investment intent and the fund’s return may be adversely affected   to the extent a cds requires the fund to settle physically the defaulted reference obligation the fund may be adversely affected by the purchase price of the defaulted reference obligation similarly cds cash settlement mechanics may not accurately     reflect the related credit loss and may be subject to the discretion of the party performing the calculation in addition there can be losses under a cds without a related default with respect to the referenced obligation this occurs when the definition of a credit event in the cds contains events that are not truly credit related and is called credit basis risk also the size of the structured notes underlying a funded cds in relation to the size of the reference obligation affects the severity of the losses in general as the size of the structured notes decreases in relation to the size of the reference obligation the fund’s exposure to credit risk with respect to the cds increases   other risks of cdss include the cost of paying for credit protection if there are no credit events pricing transparency when assessing the cost of a credit default swap and the need to fund the delivery obligation either cash or the defaulted bonds depending on whether the fund enters into a long or short swap respectively the fund’s position in cdss is also subject to liquidity risk market risk structural risk legal risk and interest rate risk the fund may also invest in certificates which represent an undivided interest in a pool of high yield fixed income securities “underlying securities” such securities pay principal and interest to the extent the underlying securities pay principal and interest the fund may subject to certain restrictions optionally redeem its certificates for the related pro rata interest in the underlying securities   exposure to the credit risk of such types of assets through the purchase of such certificates presents risks in addition to those resulting from direct purchases of the underlying securities until the fund redeems its certificates the fund will not have a direct contractual relationship with the issuers of the underlying securities and will not have a right directly to enforce compliance by such issuers with the terms of the underlying securities a right of setoff against such issuers or any direct rights of ownership with respect to the underlying securities the fund’s ability to exercise voting rights with respect to the underlying securities may also be limited until it redeems its certificates the fund’s yield on such securities is dependent upon a number of factors including without limitation the purchase price of such securities and the occurrence of any early or mandatory redemption with respect thereto the fund’s investments in such certificates are also subject to prepayment risk credit risk liquidity risk market risk structural risk legal risk and interest rate risk”   the third bullet point on page  states that the subadviser attempts to maintain the duration of the fund at a level similar to that of the barclays us highyield  issuer capped bond index the “index” in plain english please disclose what the index measures and the duration of the index as of a recent date response the trust has added the following disclosure to the third bullet point in the “principal investment strategy” section new language is underlined ·“the subadviser attempts to maintain the duration of the fund at a level similar to that of the barclays us highyield  issuer capped bond index an index comprised of dollar denominated and nonconvertible fixed rate noninvestment grade debt securities with a maximum allocation of  to any single issuer as of december   the barclays us highyield  issuer capped bond index had a modified adjusted duration of  years duration measures the     interest rate sensitivity of a fixed income security by assessing and weighting the present value of the security’s payment pattern generally the longer the maturity the greater the duration and therefore the greater effect interest rate changes have on the price of the security” principal risks inasmuch as “loan participation and assignment risk” is a principal risk of the fund as disclosed on page  please add disclosure relating to loan participations and loan assignments to the “principal investment strategy” section response please see the trust’s response to comment  the trust has added disclosure relating to loan participations and assignments to the “principal investment strategy” section if the fund intends to invest in debt of countries that are experiencing economic uncertainty eg greece or may be subject to sanctions eg russia as part of its principal investment strategy please disclose such investments in the “principal investment strategy” section and add appropriate risk disclosure in the “principal risks” section under “foreign securities risk” “emerging markets risk” or in a separate risk factor response the trust has added the following disclosure to the “principal investment strategy” section new language is underlined “although the fund will primarily invest in the securities of us issuers the fund may also invest in securities of foreign issuers including those in emerging markets or in countries experiencing economic uncertainty” additionally the trust has added the following disclosure to the “foreign securities” risk disclosure under “principal risks” new language is underlined “countries experiencing economic uncertainty issuers in countries experiencing economic uncertainty which includes countries subject to sanctions or experiencing ongoing political tension market turmoil or other conditions that could potentially have an adverse impact on the country’s economy may experience a reduced ability to repay debt and investments in such issuers may reduce the value of the fund’s investments”   under “sectorindustry risk” the disclosure states that “to the extent the fund is concentrated in one or more sectors this may make the fund particularly susceptible to adverse economic political or regulatory occurrences and changes affecting utilities and companies in these sectors” if the fund expects to invest a significant amount of assets in utilities or any other sectors please identify these sectors in the “principal investment strategy” section and disclose the relevant risks of each sector in the “principal risks” section response the trust has reviewed the disclosure and determined that references to investing a significant amount of assets into “industries” was incorrect as the fund will not invest a significant amount of assets in any particular industries as a principal investment strategy rather the fund may invest a significant amount of its assets into different bond market sectors accordingly the trust has revised the relevant disclosure in the “principal investment strategy” section as follows changes are indicated below     “the subadviser considers credit research an integral component of its high yield investment process which emphasizes issue selection bond sector and industry selection and opportunistic trading in this regard ·the subadviser evaluates market conditions in the context of broad macroeconomic trends and will typically seek to cause the fund to be overweight invest in those bond sectors and industries that the subadviser believes contain provide exposure to wellvalued companies whose business profiles and credit measures are expected to improve” in addition the trust has deleted the “sectorindustry risk” risk factor from the “principal risks” section because the trust does not believe that “sectorindustry risk” is a principal risk of the fund   under “no assurance of active trading market” or in a separate risk factor please disclose the liquidity risk that in stressed market conditions the liquidity of fund shares may mirror those of its underlying portfolio holdings which can be significantly less liquid than other exchangetraded fund shares response the trust respectfully acknowledges the comment and notes that the following disclosure is already included in the “fund shares liquidity risk” section “during stressed market conditions the liquidity of fund shares may mirror the liquidity of the securities in the fund’s portfolio which may be significantly less than the liquidity of other etfs” as a result the trust believes it is not necessary to include additional disclosure inasmuch as high portfolio turnover is a principal risk of the fund as disclosed at the bottom of page  please add disclosure in the “principal investment strategy” section that the fund’s principal strategy includes active and frequent trading response the trust had added the following disclosure to the “principal investment strategy” section “the fund’s investment strategy involves active and frequent trading while there is no target portfolio turnover rate the adviser expects the fund to have a higher portfolio turnover rate than other registered investment companies the adviser expects that the fund’s turnover rate may exceed  from time to time”   investing in the fund – determination of net asset value please provide an explanation that the price of fund shares is based on market price see item a of form na response the trust respectfully acknowledges the comment and notes that the following disclosure is already included in the “purchase and sale of fund shares” section “shares of the fund will trade on the exchange at market price rather than nav” as a result the trust believes it is not necessary to include additional
