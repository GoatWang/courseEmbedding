executive july  succeeding jim mcnerney who held the position for the past  years share story by rami grunbaum seattle times deputy business editor jim mcnerney the outsider who wrenchingly transformed boeing into a bicoastal manufacturer while extracting major concessions from union members and state officials will step down july  after a decade as ceo and hand the reins to dennis muilenburg a year company man who started as an engineering intern muilenburg  has been boeing’s president chief operating officer and vice chairman since  that promotion after four years as head of boeing’s defense division in st louis had made him the clear favorite to replace mcnerney he “is quite respected in the industry and the investor community although he’s not really familiar with the commercial side” of boeing’s business said aerospace analyst richard aboulafia of the teal group despite working “almost exclusively on the defense side” muilenburg represents “a step in the right direction” because he comes from an engineering background said aboulafia dennis muilenburg age  education ba in aerospace engineering from iowa state university master’s in aeronautics and astronautics from the university of washington career engineering intern in seattle in  held numerous program management and engineering positions of increasing responsibility early in his career including on the company’s high speed civil transport f airborne laser and condor reconnaissance aircraft led boeing’s combat systems division president of the unit’s global services and support business ceo of boeing defense space and security since  boeing president vice chairman and chief operating officer since  source boeing mcnerney  will continue as boeing’s chairman and will remain a company employee until february to ensure a smooth transition and to “continue advocating on issues important to boeing’s us and global customers partners and stakeholders including ongoing washington dc engagement” the company said the largest union at boeing the machinists issued a brief statement that underscored the bitterness of its relationship with mcnerney “ceos come and ceos go” began the twosentence note from district  president jon holden it continued “we welcome boeing’s announcement that dennis muilenburg is taking over as ceo and encourage him to invest in the workforce and recognize the value of each and every employee at the boeing co” bill dugovich communications director for the society of professional engineering employees in aerospace speea said “we haven’t met with mr muilenburg … we’ll just have to wait and see” muilenburg earned a bachelor’s degree in aerospace engineering from iowa state university and a master’s in aeronautics and astronautics from the university of washington according to boeing the defense business where he made his mark has shrunk in recent years as federal military spending was reined in although it’s considered “a pretty wellrun unit” said aboulafia it was muilenburg’s “leadership characteristics” that apparently made him the candidate to succeed mcnerney said analyst adam pilarski of avitas by becoming ceo of boeing in his early s “he has quite a few years to transform it in the ways he thinks are best” pilarski said it’s not clear what changes muilenburg might pursue in boeing’s leadership ranks product lineup or labor practices because he’s played a lowkey role as chief operating officer said industry analyst scott hamilton of leehamnet little about his outlook on key issues has emerged “he really is an enigma to me and to the unions” hamilton said but some of the challenges ahead are clear boeing still has as much as  billion in deferred production costs on the  dreamliner a hole that is projected to continue deepening until next year   related video plane or rocket boeing premiered its new  airplane with a dramatic takeoff at the paris air show june   read more from the  paris air show dominic gates  the seattle times     “eventually you have to start producing planes at a profit and that’s a big big challenge” said pilarski there is also danger in the massive rampup of aircraft production planned by both boeing and airbus to meet the unprecedented orders they’ve piled up — nearly  between them even before this month’s paris air show boeing has announced it will raise  production to  per month by  while airbus aims for  singleaisle planes a month by  “i’m one of the people who believes we may have a bubble so he muilenburg better start thinking what if it’s a bubble and you have to go down in production rather than up” said pilarski he added that even a boeing ceo who shared that concern would “have to pretend” he’s planning to ramp up production or risk losing future orders to airbus hamilton said muilenburg will also face important decisions on whether to continue production of the slowselling  jumbo jet and how to proceed on a “middleofthemarket” jet that beginning in  might replace the discontinued  as a plane intermediate in size between the  singleaisle family and the  on the defense side said aboulafia the company’s future in combat aircraft will be decided by an upcoming pentagon contract award for a major new stealth bomber if a boeinglockheed martin partnership loses to northrop grumman boeing’s only option for staying in that business may be to buy the winner he said mcnerney legacy almost a year ago mcnerney told investment analysts he didn’t plan to retire upon turning  the following month because “the heart will still be beating the employees will still be cowering” that remark quickly drew outrage from boeing employees and mcnerney apologized for it within days calling it an inept joke mcnerney who will be  in august was a disciple of longtime general electric chief jack welch before leaving to run m he is widely regarded as a financial disciplinarian who despite running ge’s engine division had less grounding in the airplane business than most of his boeing predecessors at boeing he proved polarizing but stayed unscathed through the troubled rollout of the  and tuesday’s announcement comes during a year when boeing’s stock is at alltime highs he inherited the scheme of building major chunks of the  at outsourced plants in south carolina but when those factories proved unreliable he took control of them and turned the operation into a fullfledged second production site for boeing’s most advanced twinaisle jet the same playbook was used when it came time to choose a site for the company’s newest airliner the x under mcnerney’s guidance boeing threatened to take the plane elsewhere unless machinists agreed to end the company’s pension contributions and the legislature extended aerospace tax breaks for two more decades after sealing those deals and putting the x plants in everett boeing surprised labor and government officials by revealing that several thousand engineering jobs would be moved to new sites in other states aboulafia said mcnerney’s handling of the unions risked losing valuable skills and crucial collaboration at a time when boeing really needed them — “kind of a worstcase scenario from a labormanagement perspective” “i can only think that any change will be for the better on that front so that’s good news” he said pilarski said that when it comes to ceos “obviously everyone wants wall street and investors to be happy” but speaking of muilenburg he continued “i don’t think his priority will be as strongly aligned with them as jim’s is” pay package muilenburg will receive a base salary of  million and target bonus of  million a year in his new post boeing said in a regulatory filing in addition he’ll get  restricted shares that vest in three years and are worth nearly

to ceo w james mcnerney as his successor dennis muilenburg takes over duties as ceo of boeing today muilenburg’s takeover happens to coincide with a few milestones this year marks muilenburg’s thirty year anniversary with boeing during which he ran the military branch of the company and served as president and coo additionally boeing is gearing up to celebrate its centennial next year mcnerny described muilenburg as wellrespected and passionate he also has the reputation for being dynamic focused and hypercompetitive loren thompson of forbes writes “he shares former boeing ceo mcnerney’s affinity for sports and exercise often bicycling dozens of miles in a day but there is an intensity to his personality that one seldom encounters elsewhere in the buttondown aerospace sector” here are other fun facts that you might not have known about muilenburg he’s an avid cyclist the wall street journal piece on muilenburg entitled “boeing’s incoming ceo is engineer with swagger” notes that the new ceo spends a lot of time on his bicycle and is “on pace for riding  miles this year” he apparently rides about  miles per week around the chicago area where boeing is headquartered he began working at boeing as an intern yearold muilenburg has spent the better part of his life as a boeing employee he started off as an engineering intern with the company in  and worked his way up to the top position over  years he’s a huge fan of diet mountain dew according to jon ostrower and doug cameron of the wall street journal those who have worked with muilenburg say that he gets his jolt from

and his master’s degree in aeronautics and astronautics from the university of washington christopher drew of the new york times writes “richard l aboulafia an aviation analyst with the teal group in fairfax va said boeing’s engineers would cheer the return in mr muilenburg of an engineer to the chief executive’s suite” previous ceo mcnerney had a lackluster reputation for fostering positive labor relations and some think that muilenburg’s engineering background could make him a better fit for navigating those issues related reads boeing talks air force one costs with trump team boeing vote
