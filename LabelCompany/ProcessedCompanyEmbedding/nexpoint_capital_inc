described more fully in the prospectus annual expense ratio calculated as set forth in the prospectus and based on public offering price in effect on such date please consult the prospectus and read it carefully you should not expect to be able to sell your shares of common stock regardless of how we perform if you are able to sell your shares of common stock you will likely receive less than your purchase price we do not intend to list our shares of common stock on any securities exchange during or for what may be a significant time after the offering period and we do not expect a secondary market in the shares of common stock to develop because our common stock will not be listed on a securities exchange you may be unable to sell your shares and as a result you may be unable to reduce your exposure on any market downturn we intend to implement a share repurchase program but we do not expect to repurchase more than  of the weighted average number of shares that were outstanding in the prior calendar year in addition any such repurchases will be at a  discount to the current offering price in effect on the date of repurchase our distributions may be funded from

be distributed after payment of sales load fees and expenses and such amounts will not be recoverable by our stockholders you should consider that you may not have access to the money you invest for an indefinite period of time an investment in our shares of common stock is not suitable for you if you need access to the money you invest see “share repurchase program” “suitability standards” and “liquidity strategy” the lack of experience of our investment adviser operating under the constraints imposed on us as a business development company and ric may hinder the achievement of our investment objective we intend to finance our investments with borrowed money which will magnify the potential for gain or loss on amounts invested and may increase the risk of investing in us we are subject to risks associated with middlemarket healthcare companies including competition extensive government regulation and commercial difficulties our clo investments may be riskier and less transparent to us and our stockholders than direct investments in the underlying companies our investments in equity and mezzanine tranches of clos will likely be subordinate to the other debt tranches of such clos and are subject to a higher degree of risk of total loss there are significant potential conflicts of interest that could affect our investment returns press releases  nexpoint
