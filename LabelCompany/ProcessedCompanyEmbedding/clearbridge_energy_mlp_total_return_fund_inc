securities are subject to unique risks the fund’s concentration of investments in energy related mlps subject it to the risks of mlps and the energy sector including the risks of declines in energy and commodity prices decreases in energy demand adverse weather conditions natural or other disasters changes in government regulation and changes in tax laws leverage may result in greater volatility of nav and the market price of common shares and increases a shareholder’s risk of loss the fund may invest in small capitalization or illiquid securities which can increase the risk and volatility of the fund the fund may make significant investments in derivative instruments derivative instruments can be illiquid may disproportionately increase losses and have a potentially large impact on fund performance mlp cash distributions are generally tax deferred noncash expenses such as depreciation or depletion usually offset income derived from an mlp’s operations to the extent that these expenses exceed income cash distributions are considered return of capital under tax law as such they are not taxed when received instead the distribution in the form of return of capital reduces a unit holder’s cost basis this adjusted cost basis in turn results in a higher capital gain or lower capital loss when the units are sold of course there can be no assurances that distributions from an mlp will be tax deferred the fund will be treated as a regular corporation for us federal income tax purposes and as a result unlike most investment companies is subject to corporate income tax to the extent the fund recognizes taxable income any taxes paid by the fund will reduce the amount available to pay distributions to investors and therefore investors in the fund will likely receive lower
