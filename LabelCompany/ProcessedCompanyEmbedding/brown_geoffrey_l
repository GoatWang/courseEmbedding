job with the smallest of budgets options instantly cease to exist but creativity can then be allowed to fly without fear of consequences in this case a four star hotel room was needed to be created inside of an empty home in reseda ca that was up for sale with no choice but to find used furniture i spent a day at a local outlet searching for hotel furniture knowing filming would focus on the entirety of the room i focused on the key set pieces to bring the idea to life including a floating headboard telescoping wall sconces salvaged hotel drapery which coordinated with a matching chair and ottoman and individual hospitality essentials out of money and still without the rest of the furniture i negotiated with the previous owner to release left behind bedroom items meant for craigslist the color of these items was straight out of the east coast in the s pale cream i needed a cheap but luxurious looking solution i decided upon a rich espresso spray paint capable of hiding imperfections yet creating a modern feel hired painters came in and rolled out a warm white with a hint of gold to compliment the strong green and brown earth tones established within the room with a borrowed flat screen office chairs bedding and found carpet the room eventually came together and we ended up with one of my favorite sets ive designed this set is a case of knowing that having virtually no budget doesnt have to mean an empty room” lost coast tapes  drybecks cabin partnered with chris davis production designer we travelled up and into the redwoods of upper northern california and the towns of arcata eureka and ferndale we were given just a week to source real wood items and supporting set pieces needed for a cabin interior home to a slightly off hunter and woodsman our search was concentrated around local antique stores and secondhand shops on a hunch we walked into a gold store with an attached antique room for show the room turned out to be a goldmine of its own revealing buffets tables a bankers desks and a mail cabinet the small shop also held a key find a vintage tabletop display case which would be used in the film to house a key hero prop we negotiated with the gold stores owner who was more than hesitant to rent out these one of a kind items eventually i was able to negotiate a fair rental cost with the request to us that he would be allowed to visit the set for a day in addition to the furniture we really needed to show off how accomplished a local game hunter this character in the film was with the assistance of the wildlife department located at cal state university humboldt we made a donation to their foundation and in exchange they released a group of beautiful local taxidermy to be displayed proudly by the film’s most unique character please see black and white photos in portfolio on this site this set turned out to be better than we imagined after an exhaustive search of local resources backwoods pawn pilot  exterior i was brought on to do a pilot in the town of london kentucky an hour north of the smokey mountains my vision was to redesign and update the exterior of the towns popular pawn shop with elements from the region’s history the most important need was replacement of old vinyl signage with a new painted surface in my design i went with a university of kentucky blue prior to leaving la i called around to local paint stores to find a scenic painter who could turn my sketchup design into real life the property sits at the bottom of a hill onequarter of a mile from a major local interstate offramp as a result a block san serif font was the logical choice for maximum readability making pawn easily seen along with the front reading highway 9 pawn i incorporated a regional highway 9 sign into the garage facade reflecting the local pride the people have for their highway that runs down into tennessee during my online research i discovered a company two hours from london that builds and sells original whiskey barrels often purchased in volume by hollywood studios and disney resorts this find was meant to be we braved a long drive into the mountains where signs and road markers ceased to exist after finally finding the home business without an address or cell service we purchased three barrels and enjoyed the strong aroma in the van ride back the barrels were placed in a pyramid formation to discourage those interested in free barrels we dumped  pounds of sand into each barrel and  pounds of cement into the top barrel sealing the flag pole with an attached state flag the group sits proudly outside with a series of heavy duty rail road ties as parking blocks and a large american flag flying produly above the entrance the genuine hospitality i experienced working in the area made this job one i will always remember geoffrey l brown  salem or  intelius sign in we found geoffrey l brown in salem or geoffrey l brown intelius found that geoffrey l brown is

pathsauthor infobrown geoffrey lsocial media view available files permalink httpraveohiolinkeduetdcviewaccnumosu997 year and degree  master of science ohio state university mechanical engineering abstract most humans use walking as the primary form of locomotion for short distances however many scientific questions remain regarding how and why we walk the way we do this thesis explores the energetics of “nonlinear” or curved path locomotion both by using computer simulations and optimization techniques as well as human subject experiments specifically we  measure the metabolic cost of human walking around circular paths at various speeds and radii  explain the trends in the metabolic cost data qualitatively using d trajectory optimization of a simple biped model  use metabolic cost data to explain the observation that people walk slower around tighter curves and faster while walking around straight lines or bigger curves and  use metabolic cost data to derive optimal locomotor paths for human walking committee manoj srinivasan phd advisoralison sheets phd committee memberjunmin wang phd committee member pages 8 p subject headings biomechanics keywords walking circles
