composed of five hundred  selected stocks all of which are listed on national stock exchanges and spans over  separate industry groups important risk information risk associated with equity investing include stock values which may fluctuate in response to the activities of individual companies and general market and economic conditions derivative investments may involve risks such as potential illiquidity of the markets and additional risk of loss of principal companies with large market capitalizations go in and out of favor based on market and economic conditions larger companies tend to be less volatile than companies with smaller market capitalizations in exchange for this potentially lower risk the value of the security may not rise as much as companies with smaller market
