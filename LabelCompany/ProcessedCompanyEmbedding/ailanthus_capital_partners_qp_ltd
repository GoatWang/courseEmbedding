english and james passeri will be keeping readers up to date with the latest news from wednesdays annual sohn investment conference with the market outlook of some of wall streets most influential investors highlights from the mornings next wave segment included a presentation by david rosen a former investor with sac capital on his firms long position in kraton performance polymers kra nick danaher founder of domando capital and precocity capitals nick tiller presented their bull takes on tripadvisor trip and royal dutch shell rdsa respectively meanwhile genevieve kahr of ailanthus capital management went short on inflight internet provider gogo gogo citing mounting competitive headwinds and characterizing the company as a minnow swimming with sharks the first session of the new york conference kicks off at noon and will include glenview capitals larry robbins muddy waters capitals carson block and john khoury founder of long pond capital the second session beginning at  pm will include starboard value ceo jeffrey smith vr capitals richard deitz duquesne family offices stanley druckenmiller and doubleline capital ceo jeffrey gundlach the final round of speakers kicks off at  pm and includes pointstate capitals zachary schreiber commonwealth capitals adam fisher and david einhorn founder and president of greenlight capital and the day will wrap up with a presentation by kynikos associates james chanos the sohn conference is often a hub of marketmoving intelligence such as last years presentation by david einhorn in which his bearish take on the fracking industry helped send shares of pioneer natural resources pxd into a  slide on the day  pm et robbins checking up on last years picks in his opening remarks larry robbins of glenview capital management warned that his presentation which he entitled get a grip was not going to include anything actionable or tweetable instead robbins made the distinction between investors and traders and urged investors to stay the course despite eight months of bumpy returns throughout the broader market robbins also took a quick swipe at billionaire investor warren buffett and others who have been critical of hedge funds saying if youre going to criticize hedge funds for being short term you cant criticize us for our shortterm performance despite robbins warning that his presentation wasnt going to be actionable he revisited his choices at last years sohn conference his long cases for abbvie abbv which is down  over the last year and brookdale senior living bkd which is down  over the same period despite the drops he still believes there is tremendous opportunity in those plays given the fundamentals of both companies in fact he says that entering at the depressed stock price makes the investment in both companies all the more compelling in the case of abbvie robbins points out that the drugmaker was able to grow earnings  the only thing that has gone wrong is the slight drop in the stock price as for brookdale robbins acknowledged difficulty in the industry and changes to management but says the fundamentals are sound and do not merit the  drop in stock price despite a difficult environment robbins offers the following advice to investors whats the lesson just hang on tight  pm et block is short bank of the ozarks ozrk shares of bank of the ozarks are falling in midday trading after muddy waters carson block stepped up at sohn and revealed his funds short position in the company it is cracking right now  their balance sheet is under severe pressure block says highlighting the banks difficulties in funding its rapidly expanding loan book they are getting pushed into making bigger and bigger acquisitions he adds the other scary part of this model is the loan book itself according to muddy waters the little rock ark bank has  of its loan portfolio in construction loans which are really risky block says as developers have a habit of drawing excessive cash and leaving banks with unfinished projects this is especially true because the banks loantovalue projections on its construction lending are inordinately weighted on finished projects and not bets which often do not require personal guarantees from contractors block says ozarks may also be running into a headwind with basel iii regulations in how it weights its risktovalue metrics in estimates to investors block says its getting harder for them to grow earnings he said funding costs have gone up forcing the company to pay about x the book value of banks that it is acquiring to stave off the balancesheet pressure of its expanding loan book he says by muddy waters estimates bank of the ozarks has too great a lending concentration in real estate and construction and will be unable to adjust to its unsustainable earnings growth  pm et khoury is high on hyatt hotels h theres a lot of talk about the decline of the hotel industry as airbnb continues to take travelers dollars but john khoury of long pond capital sees things differently while some hotels may be on the decline there is tremendous value elsewhere which is why he spoke of the growth potential he sees in hyatt hotels the stock which currently trades in the s could go as high  khoury says khoury refutes the notion that hotels are out of favor and points out that there is tremendous variability in the hotel space  yet they all trade the same hyatt khoury says has highquality assets and represents the higher end of leisure of business travel which should be wellinsulated from threats from airbnb lowerquality hotels will not fare as well also not hurting hyatt it is significantly less levered  by more than   than its lowend peers khoury declined to name names on stage but said hed be happy to talk about the weaker competition offstage looking to the fundamentals khoury points out that the company has grown ebitda by  over the last six years the company owns several trophy properties but it also gets revenue from third parties to be part of the hyatt system on this last point khoury invokes warren buffett saying the ideal business is one that takes no capital and grows and if investors needed any other reason to invest in the hotel operator khoury points to the famed pritzker family which founded the hotel chain under their leadership the company does not give guidance which means that it is managed for the long term khoury also notes that the family has been buying back stock and that the public float of the company has decreased by   pm et palihapitiya gushes about amazon amzn venture capitalist chamath palihapitiya presents his bullish take on amazon amzn suggesting the ecommerce giant has formed somewhat of a monopolistic position in silicon valley as startups gravitate toward its many services based largely on amazons proprietary cloud technology amazon web services palihapitiya says a multitrillion monopoly could be being overlooked in ceo jeff bezos sprawling empire the founder and ceo of social capital projects  a year in growth of units sold over next  years meanwhile amazon web services or aws essentially represents a tax on the internet says palihapitiya because tech companies are becoming increasingly forced to use the cloud to compete with rivals he is going to invent things he says of bezos grasp on two socalled monopoly customers amazons retail shoppers and aws clients bezos has been telling us in as many ways possible that he is building the most durable company in the world he says emphasizing the ceos revamping process is just beginning if you believe in the internet you have to believe in amazon he says in closing the conference went into intermission until the next session which is scheduled to resume at  pm et get an email alert each
