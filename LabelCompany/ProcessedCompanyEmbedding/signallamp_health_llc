electrolytes are involved in every physiological process in the horses body  they conduct electricity and manage all bodily fluids among other things  all bodily functions depend on conductivity of fluids in and around cells and since an adult horses body is composed of roughly 0 water the horses body is mostly fluids good health however not only depends on electrolyte levels but also on electrolyte activity on those electrolytes working properly to maintain optimum electrolyte balance in the body to make sure all that water is more than just wet and researchers have found that simply providing electrolytes doesnt guarantee theyll work properly thanks to our highly evolved understanding of electrolyte activity a viable solution to restore that optimal electrolyte balance is now available its not about feeding more electrolytes  its about making them work properly equiwinner is a patented nontransdermal patch  it serves as a natural electrolytebalancing system  safe effective and easy to use  simple 0day treatment costs less than constantly trying to treat or manage symptoms  one single treatment can be effective for months even up to one full year when used as directed equiwinner patches contain only natural balanced electrolytes  nothing goes into the horses body  it simply recognizes the electrolytes in the patches and responds to them  no side effects  and equiwinner will never test positive in any competition race event or sport horses with health issues make us worry cost us more and underperform  equiwinner will change all that since electrolytes are
