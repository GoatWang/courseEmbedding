communications at  extension  a representative will be available to answer your questions from monday through friday from  am to  pm eastern standard time q how will the acquisition of voyageur fund managers impact my investments a we believe this acquisition will be very positive for our fund shareholders delaware management company  an indirect subsidiary of lincoln national corporation  currently offers a broad variety of retail openend mutual funds and two closedend funds with assets under management of approximately  billion shareholders should benefit from this extended product line which will allow choices through exchanges at net asset value from a wider variety of mutual funds also by combining the assets of these two fund families it is anticipated that certain efficiencies may be gained through the coordination of administrative marketing and trading functions q will the investment advisory fees stay the same a yes under the terms of the proposed investment advisory agreements the investment management fees paid by your fund will remain the same however certain expense limitation provisions contained in your current advisory agreements have not been included in the proposed agreements delaware management company has nevertheless agreed to comply with these limitations for two years q will the management of my voyageur fund investments change dramatically a no for most voyageur funds the portfolio managers will remain the same a number of voyageur employees have entered into employment agreements with lincoln national corporation this includes two of voyageurs senior portfolio managers elizabeth h howell and andrew m mccullagh who will continue to manage the majority of the voyageur tax free funds from their offices in minneapolis and denver for certain funds experienced delaware personnel will provide investment advice in a manner that is generally consistent with prior management delaware management has a conservative longterm investment philosophy consistent with that of voyageur some of the changes to the management of voyageurs funds are summarized as follows  it is proposed that voyageur national tax free national insured tax free national limited term tax free and voyageur international equity funds be liquidated if the liquidations are approved shareholders will have the opportunity to move their assets at net asset value nav into any of the delaware funds including funds with comparable investment objectives for a period of one year following the liquidation  it is proposed that growth and income fund approve a plan of reorganization which would in essence cause it to become a series of a different corporate entity growth and income fund is not participating in the acquisition and the reorganization is required to separate growth and income fund from the other funds that are series of the same corporation and are participating in the acquisition the reorganization will not result in any other changes to growth and income fund shareholders management of the fund through segall bryant and hamill will remain essentially unchanged  voyageur florida tax free florida insured tax free florida limited term tax free national high yield municipal bond and new york tax free funds will be comanaged by delaware vice presidents and senior portfolio managers mitchell l conery and patrick p coyne and voyageur vice president and senior portfolio manager andrew m mccullagh will assist with the management of the florida funds  senior voyageur portfolio manager elizabeth h howell will assume portfolio management responsibility for the voyageur wisconsin tax free and voyageur iowa tax free funds  for the voyageur growth stock fund delaware management will retain the services of james c king the funds current portfolio manager through a subadvisory arrangement  aggressive growth fund will be comanaged by delaware vice presidents and senior portfolio managers edward n antoian and gerald s frey q why is a shareholder vote necessary a the investment company act of  as amended generally requires that shareholders approve a new investment advisory agreement whenever there is a change in control of the investment adviser the proposed acquisition of the holding company of voyageur fund managers by lincoln national corporation will result in a change in control of voyageur fund managers and therefore requires a shareholder vote on a new investment advisory agreement for each fund other than those being asked to liquidate or reorganize q is the fund board changing a the current voyageur fund board of directors has nominated a slate of directors which includes one current voyageur fund board member thomas f madison the six members of the current board of the delaware group of funds and one additional individual from lincoln national corporation the delaware fund board currently contains five independent directors q who will pay for the cost associated with the acquisition the shareholder meeting and this proxy solicitation a lincoln national corporation  not the funds  will bear the costs associated with consideration of the proposals being presented to shareholders including the costs of the joint meetings of shareholders and the proxy solicitation q how do the fund board members suggest i vote a after careful consideration the board members of the voyageur funds unanimously recommend that you vote for all the items on the enclosed proxy card q who should i contact about this proxy vote a shareholder communications corporation at  extension  they are a professional proxy solicitation firm retained by voyageur fund managers and delaware management holdings to assist in answering shareholders questions about the proxy vote and soliciting shareholder votes q who will answer questions about my voyageur fund investments a during this transition period it will be business as usual shareholders should call voyageur client services at  to obtain information about their voyageur fund investments q are all of the voyageur funds covered by the enclosed proxy statement a no all of the voyageur funds are affected by the proposed acquisition however because different funds are affected differently there are three separate proxy statements as a result depending on which voyageur fund you own you may receive more than one proxy statement

organizational continuity that would follow the merger noting in particular that the majority of the funds would continue to be managed by their current portfolio managers they also discussed the capabilities of delaware distributors and delaware service and described the transition services agreement referred to above that was designed to help provide continuity with respect to shareholder servicing fund accounting and dividend disbursing and transfer agency services dmh representatives summarized other benefits that the merger in their opinion could bring to fund shareholders including

to the boards as to the appropriateness of the proposed transactions those directors who are members of the special committee are james w nelson and thomas f madison on february   the special committee traveled to dmhs headquarters and met with senior management representatives of dmc delaware distributors and delaware service to review various aspects of the proposed merger the background of dmc and its affiliates dmcs operational capabilities and compliance functions and future plans for the funds the special committee also met with outside counsel to the funds in the delaware group a

accountants for the companies a final meeting of the boards was held on february   for the purpose of approving the funds new agreements at such meeting each companys board recommended that the shareholders of each fund that is a series of such company approve the funds new agreement to become effective as of the closing of the merger during its deliberations the boards noted in particular the following  each funds new agreement contains substantially the same material terms and conditions as are contained in the funds current agreement except that as discussed above the new agreements do not contain contractual expense limitation provisions they allow the adviser to retain one or more subadvisers and they contain explicit standards of care  dmc has committed for a period of two years following the date of closing to voluntarily waive fees andor pay fund expenses to the same extent if any as would have been necessary to comply with the contractual expense limitations in the current agreements  the funds will not bear any costs or expenses in connection with the merger including the costs of this proxy solicitation  no change in any funds investment objectives or fundamental policies are currently contemplated in connection with the merger  the merger is expected to result in a number of benefits to shareholders including access through a net asset value exchange privilege to all of the openend mutual funds in the delaware group  the merger is not expected to cause any change in the investment personnel managing the majority of the funds the board also considered section f of the  act during its deliberations section f provides a safe harbor from the  case of rosenfeld v black in which the us court of appeals for the second circuit held that an investment adviser is prohibited from benefitting financially in connection with the sale or assignment of its advisory office to another investment adviser under the rosenfeld analysis any compensation received by an investment adviser or an affiliate thereof in connection with the transfer or assignment of an investment advisory agreement arguably would be prohibited if all or any portion of such compensation constitutes consideration for the assistance by such investment adviser or affiliate thereof in facilitating the transfer of the investment advisory office to the successor adviser the section f safe harbor is available if two conditions are met first for a period of three years after the transaction at least  of the board members of the investment company must not be interested persons within the meaning of the  act of the new or predecessor investment adviser the board of directors which shareholders are being asked to elect in proposal one above consists of eight directors two of whom jeffrey j nick and wayne a stork are interested persons of lnc and none of whom are interested persons of vfm accordingly the composition of the proposed board of directors would be in compliance with this provision of section f second an unfair burden must not be imposed upon the investment company as a result of such transaction or any express or implied terms conditions or understandings applicable thereto the term unfair burden is defined in section f to include any arrangement during a twoyear period after the transaction whereby the investment adviser or any interested person of any such adviser receives or is entitled to receive any compensation directly or indirectly from the investment company or its shareholders other than fees for bona fide investment advisory or other services or from any person in connection with the purchase or sale of securities or other property to from or on behalf of the investment company other than bona fide ordinary compensation as principal underwriter for such investment company in connection therewith lnc represented to the board that it will use its best efforts to assure that the funds do not execute any portfolio transactions through an affiliate of lnc for a period of at least two years following consummation of the merger lnc has represented in the merger agreement that neither lnc nor any of its affiliates has any express or implied understanding or arrangement which would impose an unfair burden on any of the funds or would in any way violate section f of the  act as a result of the transactions contemplated by the merger agreement vote required the boards of directors recommend that shareholders of each fund vote in favor of approval of such funds new agreement approval of the proposal for a fund requires the favorable vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of such fund as defined in the  act which means the lesser of the vote of a  of the shares of the fund present at a meeting where more than  of the outstanding shares are present in person or by proxy or b more than  of the outstanding shares of the fund unless otherwise instructed the proxies will

closing of the merger dmc believes that it has the capacity among its existing investment personnel to manage growth stock fund without the assistance of a subadviser but has at this point determined

agreement intends to be actively involved in the management of growth stock fund at such time as dmc determines that it would be prudent to manage the growth stock fund without the assistance of a

the articles of incorporation of such funds company required to effect the liquidation plan background in connection with the merger described at the beginning of this proxy statement under background lnc and vfm determined that neither vfm nor dmc would act as investment adviser to the liquidating funds after consummation of the merger lncs and vfms determination was based primarily upon the small size of each of the liquidating funds the fact that each of the liquidating funds is duplicative of a fund offered within the delaware group and the cost of and amount of time available to complete a merger of each liquidating fund into its corresponding delaware group fund prior to or at the time of closing the liquidating funds had the following net asset values as of december   fund net assets   international equity fund   national insured tax free fund   national limited term tax free fund   national tax free fund   shareholders of the liquidating funds will be given the opportunity to invest their redemption or liquidation proceeds in class a shares of any openend mutual fund in the delaware group including the voyageur funds that become members of the delaware group as a result of the merger at net asset value without the imposition of any frontend sales charge for a period of one year following the liquidation of the shareholders fund the boards considerations at the meeting of the boards of directors held on february   vfm reviewed lncs conclusion with the boards vfm noted that vam llc has decided that it will not manage the liquidating funds after the merger on a continuing basis since vam llc intends to retain generally only those assets related to the management of private accounts and certain nonretail mutual funds vfm also expressed its opinion that given the small size of each of the liquidating funds it would be difficult to find an alternative investment adviser interested in managing such funds vfm then reviewed the tax consequences of a liquidation with the boards explaining that the payment of liquidation distributions will be a taxable event to shareholders finally vfm informed the boards that shareholders of the liquidating funds would be given the opportunity to invest their redemption or liquidation proceeds in class a shares of any openend mutual fund in the delaware group including the voyageur funds that become members of the delaware group at net asset value without the imposition of any frontend sales charge on february   the boards of directors including all of the independent directors unanimously approved for each liquidating fund its liquidation plan and determined to recommend that shareholders of each liquidating fund approve its respective liquidation plan if shareholders of a fund do not approve liquidation the board of directors will meet to determine an alternative course of action liquidation of the funds is contingent upon consummation of the merger summary of the liquidation plans and related transactions for each liquidating fund such funds liquidation plan will become effective upon consummation of the merger the effective date from the effective date through the completion of liquidation vam llc will act on an interim basis as the investment adviser for each liquidating fund as soon as practicable after the effective date of a liquidating funds liquidation plan such fund will complete the sale of its portfolio securities in order to convert its assets to cash after the effective date such fund will not engage in any business activity except for the purpose of winding up its business and affairs preserving the value of its assets and distributing such assets to shareholders after the payment to or reservation of assets for payment to all creditors of the fund all contracts entered into by or on behalf of a liquidating fund will terminate upon consummation of the transactions contemplated by such funds liquidation plan after the effective date of a liquidating funds liquidation plan and in any event within  days thereafter such fund will mail to each shareholder of record who has not redeemed such shareholders shares a liquidating distribution equal to the

liquidation plan and applicable provisions under minnesota law the liquidation plans provide that the boards of directors may authorize such variations from or amendments to the provisions of the liquidation plans as may be necessary or appropriate to effect the complete liquidation and termination of the liquidating funds in accordance with the purposes to be accomplished by the liquidation plans the adoption of the liquidation plan by a liquidating fund will not affect the right of shareholders of such fund to redeem shares of such fund at their then current net asset value per share any day prior to the day the liquidating distribution is made federal income tax consequences payment by a liquidating fund of liquidation distributions to shareholders will be a taxable event because the income tax consequences for a particular shareholder may vary depending on individual circumstances each shareholder is urged to consult his or her own tax adviser concerning the federal state and local tax consequences of receipt of a liquidating distribution each liquidating fund currently qualifies and intends to continue to qualify through the end of the liquidation period for treatment as a regulated investment company under the internal revenue code of  as amended so that it will be relieved of federal income tax on any investment company taxable income or net capital gain the excess of net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss from the sale of its assets the payment of liquidation distributions will be a taxable event to shareholders each shareholder will be viewed as having sold his or her fund shares for an amount equal to the liquidation distributions he or she receives each shareholder will recognize gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between a the shareholders adjusted basis in the fund shares and b such liquidation distributions the gain or loss will be capital gain or loss to the shareholder if the fund shares were capital assets in the shareholders hands and generally will be longterm if the fund shares were held for more than one year before the liquidation distribution is received immediately prior to declaring the liquidating distribution national insured tax free fund national limited term tax free fund and national tax free fund will declare a dividend of all current but undistributed taxexempt interest income shareholders will be entitled to treat this amount as an exemptinterest dividend ie as taxexempt interest income in their hands this taxexempt dividend will be paid at the same time as the liquidating distribution and shareholders will be notified of the portion of the total distribution that constitutes the taxexempt interest dividend the balance of the liquidating distribution will be treated as an amount realized from the sale of fund shares as discussed above each liquidating fund generally will be required to withhold tax at the rate of  with respect to any liquidation distribution paid to individuals and certain other noncorporate shareholders who fail to certify to the fund that their social security number or taxpayer identification number provided to the fund is correct and that the shareholder is not subject to backup withholding the foregoing summary is generally limited to the material federal income tax consequences to shareholders who are individual united states citizens and who hold shares as capital assets it does not address the federal income tax consequences to shareholders who are corporations trusts estates taxexempt organizations pension plans individual retirement accounts or nonresident aliens this summary does not address state or local tax consequences shareholders are urged to consult their own tax advisers to determine the extent of the federal income tax liability they would incur as a result of receiving a liquidation distribution as well as any tax consequences under any applicable state local or foreign laws vote required each liquidating funds board of directors unanimously recommends that shareholders vote in favor of approval of such funds liquidation plan for each liquidating fund the affirmative vote of a majority of the outstanding shares of the fund is required to approve the liquidation plan proposal five proposal for growth and income fund to approve an agreement and plan of reorganization introduction shareholders of growth and income fund for purposes of this proposal five the fund are being asked to consider and vote upon an agreement and plan of reorganization dated as of february   the reorganization plan by and between voyageur mutual funds iii inc voyageur iii on behalf of the fund and vam institutional funds inc vam funds on behalf of a newly formed series of vam funds which is also called growth and income fund the new fund pursuant to the reorganization plan all of the assets of the fund would be acquired by new fund which prior to such time would have no assets and shareholders of the fund would become shareholders of new fund and would receive shares in new fund equal to the value of their holdings in the fund on the date of such transaction the transactions described above are referred to as the fund reorganization the shares to be issued by new fund pursuant to the fund reorganization new fund shares will be issued at net asset value without a sales charge each fund shareholder will receive new fund shares that are of the same class as such shareholders fund shares ie class a class b or class c a vote in favor of the reorganization plan will be considered a vote in favor of an amendment to the articles of incorporation of voyageur iii required to effect the fund reorganization as contemplated by the reorganization plan the fund reorganization is not contingent upon consummation of the merger background the fund is currently a series of voyageur iii aggressive growth fund growth stock fund and international equity fund are also series of voyageur iii as described above in connection with the merger shareholders of aggressive growth fund and growth stock fund are being asked to approve new investment advisory agreements with dmc and shareholders of international equity fund are being asked to approve such funds liquidation in addition shareholders of each series of voyageur iii including the fund are being asked to approve a new board of directors for voyageur iii that will consist principally of individuals who currently serve on the board of directors of the investment companies in the delaware group in negotiating the terms of the merger the owners of vfm and dfg determined that they would prefer to maintain any current rights their companies have to provide investment advisory or distribution services to the fund however in order to do this the fund must be separated out of the corporate entity of which aggressive growth fund growth stock fund and international equity fund are series in order to accomplish this the fund reorganization is being recommended if the reorganization plan is approved it will in essence cause the fund to become as the new fund a series of a different corporate entity vam funds however this corporate entity will like voyageur iii be a minnesota corporation and will have the same board of directors as voyageur iii the provisions of the articles of incorporation of vam funds and the rights of shareholders determined thereunder are substantially the same as those of voyageur iii and its shareholders the reorganization plan will not result in any other material changes to shareholders management of the fund will remain essentially unchanged because vam llc the successor to this portion of vfms operations will continue to manage the fund and utilize segall bryant  hamill segall bryant as subadviser see comparison of fund and new fund the reorganization plan the terms and conditions under which the fund reorganization would be consummated are set forth in the reorganization plan and are summarized below this summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the reorganization plan a copy of which is attached as exhibit d to this

receivables to new fund at the closing time in exchange for the assumption by new fund of all of the funds liabilities including all expenses costs charges and reserves as reflected on an unaudited statement of assets and liabilities of the fund prepared by the treasurer of voyageur iii as of the valuation date in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied from the prior audited period and the delivery of new fund shares and b such new fund shares will be distributed to the shareholders of the fund at the closing time or as soon as practicable thereafter and outstanding fund shares will be canceled and retired the distribution of new fund shares and the cancellation and retirement of outstanding fund shares is to be accomplished under the reorganization plan by amending the articles of incorporation of voyageur iii in the manner provided in the amendment set forth in exhibit  to the reorganization plan for technical reasons certain of the funds existing investment limitations may be deemed to preclude the fund from consummating the fund reorganization to the extent that the fund reorganization would involve the fund holding all of its assets as shares of new fund until such shares are distributed to the funds shareholders by approving the reorganization plan the funds shareholders will be deemed to have agreed to waive each of these limitations the number of new fund shares to be delivered to the fund will have an aggregate net asset value equal to the value of the fund assets acquired by new fund net of the liabilities assumed by new fund these values will be calculated as of the close of business of the new york stock exchange on a business day not later than the fifth business day following the receipt of the requisite approval of the reorganization plan by the shareholders of the fund or at such other time as the fund and new fund may agree the valuation date these new fund shares will be distributed to the former fund shareholders with each such shareholder receiving new fund shares of the same class as and with a value equal to the value of their fund shares new fund will cause its transfer agent to credit and confirm an appropriate number of new fund shares to each fund shareholder neither the fund nor new fund issues stock certificates the reorganization plan provides that no sales charges will be incurred by fund shareholders in connection with the acquisition by them of new fund shares pursuant to the reorganization plan the reorganization plan also provides that former holders of fund shares will receive credit for the period they held such shares in determining any contingent deferred sales charge applicable upon redemption of their new fund shares and in determining the date upon which new fund class b shares convert to new fund class a shares the closing time will be  pm eastern time on the valuation date or at such other time as the fund and new fund may agree the consummation of the fund reorganization is contingent upon the approval of the reorganization plan by the shareholders of the fund and the receipt of the other opinions and certificates set forth in sections   and  of the reorganization plan and the occurrence of the events described in those sections certain of which may be waived by the fund or new fund the reorganization plan may be amended in any mutually agreeable manner except that no amendment may be made subsequent to the meeting which would detrimentally affect the value of the new fund shares to be distributed lnc will bear all direct costs associated with preparation printing filing and proxy solicitation expenses incurred in connection with obtaining requisite shareholder approval of the fund reorganization in addition vfm will pay any unamortized organizational expenses on the books of the fund immediately prior to the fund reorganization the reorganization plan may be terminated and the fund reorganization abandoned at any time before or after approval by the funds shareholders by mutual consent of the fund and new fund in addition either party may terminate the reorganization plan upon the occurrence of a material breach of the reorganization plan by the other party or if by july   any condition set forth in the reorganization plan has not been fulfilled or waived by the party entitled to its benefits shareholders of the fund will continue to be able to redeem their shares at net asset value next determined after receipt of the redemption request until the close of business on the business day next preceding the closing date redemption requests received by the fund thereafter will be treated as requests for redemption of shares of new fund tax aspects of the reorganization it is intended that the fund reorganization will qualify for federal income tax purposes as a taxfree reorganization under section af of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and that for federal income tax purposes no income gain or loss will be recognized by the funds shareholders the fund has not asked nor does it plan to ask the internal revenue service to rule on the tax consequences of the fund reorganization as a condition to the closing of the fund reorganization the two funds will receive an opinion from dorsey  whitney llp counsel to the funds based in part on certain representations to be furnished by each fund substantially to the effect that the federal income tax consequences of the fund reorganization will be as follows i the fund reorganization will constitute a reorganization within the meaning of section af of the code and new fund and the fund each will qualify as a party to the fund reorganization under section b of the code ii fund shareholders will recognize no income gain or loss upon receipt pursuant to the fund reorganization of new fund shares fund shareholders subject to taxation will recognize income upon receipt of any net investment income or net capital gains of the fund which are distributed by the fund prior to the fund reorganization iii the tax basis of new fund shares received by each fund shareholder pursuant to the fund reorganization will be equal to the tax basis of the fund shares exchanged therefor iv the holding period of new fund shares received by each fund shareholder pursuant to the fund reorganization will include the period during which the fund shareholder held the fund shares exchanged therefor provided that the fund shares were held as a capital asset on the date of the fund reorganization v the fund will recognize no income gain or loss by reason of the fund reorganization vi new fund will recognize no income gain or loss by reason of the fund reorganization vii the tax basis of the assets received by the fund pursuant to the fund reorganization will be the same as the basis of those assets in the hands of the fund immediately prior to the fund reorganization viii the holding period of the assets received by new fund pursuant to the fund reorganization will include the period during which such assets were held by the fund and ix new fund will succeed to and take into account the earnings and profits or deficit in earnings and profits of the fund immediately prior to the fund reorganization the foregoing advice is based in part upon certain representations furnished by the fund vfm and certain  shareholders of the fund of which two principal ones are a immediately following consummation of the fund reorganization the shareholders of the fund will own all of the outstanding stock of the new fund and will own such stock solely by reason of their ownership of stock of the fund immediately prior to the fund reorganization and b there is no plan or intention on the part of shareholders of the fund who own  or more of the shares of the fund and to the best knowledge of management of the fund there is no plan or intention on the part of the remaining shareholders of the fund to sell exchange or otherwise dispose of any of the shares of the new fund stock received in the fund reorganization shareholders of the fund should consult their tax advisors regarding the effect if any of the proposed fund reorganization in light of their individual circumstances since the foregoing discussion relates only to the federal income tax consequences of the fund reorganization shareholders of the fund should consult their tax advisors as to state and local tax consequences if any of the fund reorganization dissenters rights pursuant to sections a and a of the minnesota business corporation act the mbca sections record holders of fund shares are entitled to assert dissenters rights in connection with the fund reorganization and obtain payment of the fair value of their shares provided such shareholders comply with the requirements of the mbca sections notwithstanding the provisions of the mbca sections the division of investment management of the commission has taken the position that adherence to state appraisal procedures by a registered investment company issuing redeemable securities would constitute a violation of rule c under the  act this rule provides that no openend investment company may redeem its shares other than at net asset value next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption it is the view of the division of investment management that rule c preempts appraisal provisions in state statutes it should be emphasized that as usual fund shareholders may redeem their shares at net asset value at any time prior to the closing date in accordance with the redemption procedures set forth in the funds prospectus description of shares shares of new fund to be issued pursuant to the reorganization plan will when issued be fully paid and nonassessable by new fund and transferable without restrictions and will have no preemptive or conversion rights comparison of fund and new fund investment adviser and subadviser vam on behalf of new fund will enter into an investment advisory agreement with vam llc the terms of such advisory agreement will be substantially identical to the terms of the funds current investment advisory agreement with vfm as described above prior to the merger dfg will complete a reorganization whereby certain assets of dfg and its subsidiaries including certain assets of vfm will be sold by dfg to certain newly organized limited liability companies including vam llc these limited liability companies will not be acquired by lnc in the merger the ultimate ownership and control of vam llc will remain with the same individuals who currently control vfm namely michael e dougherty james o pohlad robert c pohlad and william m pohlad it is expected that those individuals who currently serve

agreement between vfm and segall bryant ralph segall managing director of segall bryant who is primarily responsible for the daytoday management of the funds portfolio will continue to act in such capacity for new fund a vote in favor of the fund reorganization will be deemed a vote to authorize the fund as the sole shareholder of new fund shares on the date of the fund reorganization to vote in favor of both a new advisory agreement between the new fund and vam llc and a new subadvisory agreement between vam llc and segall bryant the fund reorganization is not contingent upon consummation of the merger thus in the event shareholders approve the fund reorganization and the merger is not consummated the fund may enter into an advisory agreement with vfm rather than vam llc which would in turn enter into a subadvisory agreement with segall bryant investment objectives policies and restrictions the investment objectives policies and restrictions of new fund will be identical to those of

and will continue to consist of the same individuals who currently serve on the board of directors of voyageur iii d it is anticipated that the fund reorganization will constitute a taxfree
