offer by members of the master fund including for the avoidance of doubt master fund units tendered by the feeder fund is equal to  or less of outstanding master fund units as of the repurchase date the board expects to accept the tender of all units   x             the purchase of units pursuant to the offer will have the effect of increasing the proportionate interest in the feeder fund of members that do not tender units  members that retain their units may be subject to increased risks that may possibly result from the reduction in the feeder fund’s aggregate exposure to the underlying funds resulting from payment for the units tendered  these risks include the potential for greater volatility due to decreased diversification of the master fund’s investments in the underlying funds  the feeder fund believes however that this result is unlikely given the nature of the master fund’s investment program  payment for units purchased pursuant to the offer will require the feeder fund to tender a portion of its master fund units  such a tender by the feeder fund could result in ironwood being required to raise cash to accommodate the tender by liquidating the master fund’s portfolio holdings in the underlying funds earlier than ironwood would otherwise have liquidated such holdings potentially resulting in losses or increased investment related expenses for the master fund  in addition to its own operating expenses the feeder fund also bears a pro rata portion of the operating expenses of the master fund   xi             not applicable   xii           the following discussion is a general summary of the material us federal income tax considerations applicable to the purchase of units by the feeder fund for cash pursuant to the offer  this summary does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations applicable to such purchase  this summary assumes that members hold units as capital assets generally property held for investment  the discussion is based upon the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code ” us treasury regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations each as of the date of this offer and all of which are subject to change possibly retroactively which could affect the continuing validity of this discussion  the feeder fund has neither sought nor will seek any ruling from the internal revenue service or “ irs ” regarding this offer  this summary does not discuss any aspects of foreign state or local tax   the sale of units pursuant to the offer will be a taxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes either as a “sale or exchange” or under certain circumstances as a “dividend”  in general under section  of the code a redemption of units pursuant to the offer should be treated as a sale or exchange of units by a member if the redemption i is “substantially disproportionate” with respect to the member          ii results in a “complete redemption” of the member’s interest or iii is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to the member  in determining whether any of these tests has been met a member’s units are generally deemed to include units considered to be owned by the member by reason of certain constructive ownership rules set forth in section  of the code  a “substantially disproportionate” redemption generally requires a reduction of at least  in the member’s proportionate interest in the feeder fund after all repurchases of units from all members pursuant to the offer are taken into account  a “complete redemption” of a member’s interest generally requires that all units of the feeder fund actually and constructively owned by the member be disposed of  a redemption “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” requires that there be a “meaningful reduction” in the member’s proportionate interest in the feeder fund which should be the case if the member has a minimal interest in the feeder fund exercises no control over feeder fund affairs and suffers a reduction in its proportionate interest in the feeder fund   if the sale of a member’s units meets any of the tests for “sale or exchange” treatment such member will recognize gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount of cash received pursuant to the offer and the tax basis of the units sold  such gain or loss will be a capital gain or loss if the units sold have been held by such member as a capital asset  in general capital gain or loss with respect to units sold will be longterm capital gain or loss if the holding period for units is more than one year  the maximum capital gains rate currently applicable to such a sale of units by an individual in  will be  plus a  medicare contribution tax for individuals whose adjusted gross income exceeds certain thresholds   upon disposition of units the feeder fund will report the gross proceeds and for units acquired on or after january   and disposed of after that date cost basis to the member and the irs  for each disposition the cost basis will be calculated using the feeder fund’s default method of firstin firstout unless the member has instructed the feeder fund in writing to use a different calculation method permitted by the irs including average cost or specific unit lot identification  the cost basis method elected by the member or the cost basis method applied by default for each disposition of units may not be changed after the settlement date of each such disposition of units  if the member holds their units through a broker or other nominee the member should contact that broker nominee with respect to reporting of cost basis and available elections for the member’s account the member should consult with their tax advisor to determine the best irsaccepted cost basis method for their tax situation and to obtain more information about how the new cost basis reporting law applies to them   if none of the section  tests described above is met a member may be treated as having received in whole or in part a dividend return of capital or capital gain depending on i whether there are sufficient otherwise undistributed earnings and profits to support a dividend and ii such member’s tax basis in the units  in that case the tax basis in the units tendered to the feeder fund remaining after any return of capital will

members that hold units as contemplated by and in accordance with the procedures set out in the feeder fund’s prospectus dated august   the “ prospectus ” and the feeder fund’s amended and restated limited liability company agreement dated december   the “ llc agreement ”  the prospectus and the llc agreement provide that the board has the sole and absolute discretion to determine whether it will cause the feeder fund to offer to repurchase member’s units pursuant to a tender offer to repurchase  in determining whether the feeder fund should make an offer to repurchase units from members in response to repurchase requests and the number of units that will be the subject of such offer the board will consider among other things the recommendation of ironwood   because there is no

repurchase proceeds which would indirectly increase the feeder fund’s operating expenses and could adversely impact the ability of the master fund to achieve its investment objective   the purchase of units pursuant to the offer will have the effect of increasing the proportionate interest in the feeder fund of members that do not tender units  members that retain their units may be subject to increased risks that may possibly result from the reduction in the feeder fund’s aggregate exposure to the underlying funds resulting from payment for the units tendered  these risks include the potential for greater volatility due to decreased diversification of the master fund’s investments in the underlying funds  the feeder fund believes however that this result is unlikely given the nature of the master fund’s investment program  payment for units purchased pursuant to the offer will require the feeder fund to tender a portion of its master fund units  such a tender by the feeder fund could result in ironwood being required to raise cash to accommodate the tender by liquidating the master fund’s portfolio holdings in the underlying funds earlier than ironwood would otherwise have liquidated such holdings potentially resulting in losses or increased investment related expenses for the master fund  in addition to its own operating expenses the feeder fund also bears a

this summary does not purport to be a complete description of the income tax considerations applicable to such purchase  this summary assumes that members hold units as capital assets generally property held for investment the discussion is based upon the internal revenue code of  as amended the “code ” us treasury regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations each as of the

taxable transaction for us federal income tax purposes either as a “sale or exchange” or under certain circumstances as a “dividend”  in general under section  of the code a redemption of units

redemption” of the member’s interest or iii is “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” with respect to the member  in determining whether any of these tests has been met a member’s units are generally deemed to include units considered to be owned by the member by reason of certain constructive ownership rules set forth in section  of the code  a “substantially disproportionate” redemption generally requires a reduction of at least  in the member’s proportionate interest in the feeder fund after all repurchases of units from all members pursuant to the offer are taken into account  a “complete redemption” of a member’s interest generally requires that all units of the feeder fund actually and constructively owned by the member be disposed of  a redemption “not essentially equivalent to a dividend” requires that there be a “meaningful reduction” in the member’s proportionate interest in the feeder fund which should be the case if the member has a minimal

basis method for your tax situation and to obtain more information about how the new cost basis reporting law applies to you   if none of the section  tests described above is met you may be treated
