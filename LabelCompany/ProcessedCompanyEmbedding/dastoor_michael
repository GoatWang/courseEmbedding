jhhouuclaedu and yangyuclaeduabstract side chains of conjugated polymers play an important role in their properties to investigate the influence of side chains on photovoltaic properties two conjugated polymers with benzobbdithiophene bdt and dithiophenbenzothiadiazole dtbt units z and z were designed and synthesized these two polymers have identical conjugated main chains and very similar side chains in polymer z hexyl groups are linked to the thiophene units directly and in polymer z hexyloxy groups are linked to the thiophene units since the hexyloxy group exhibits a smaller steric hindrance and a stronger electron donating effect than the hexyl group properties of z and z are very different the hole mobility of the zpcbm blend film is  × − cmv s which is  orders lower than that of the zpcbm blend and photovoltaic results demonstrate that the fill factor ff of the zbased device is  while that of the zbased polymer solar cell psc device reached  these results reveal that steric hindrance of the side chain is an important issue for a new material design in order to obtain higher ff additionally thermal stability absorption spectra electrochemical pl quenching of the polymerpcbm blend and photovoltaic properties of the two polymers were investigated in detail for zbased devices a power conversion efficiency pce of ∼ was observed with an open circuit voltage
