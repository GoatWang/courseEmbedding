washington dc this is an appeal from the united states district court for the southern district of new york in a patent infringement action that scanner technologies corp “scanner” brought against icos vision systems corp “icos” in july    icos denied infringement and counterclaimed seeking a declaratory judgment of noninfringement invalidity and unenforceability   after this court reviewed the district courts markman ruling in a  interlocutory appeal scanner technologies corp v icos vision systems corp nv  fd   fedcir “scanner i ” the district court on remand held a bench trial on infringement validity and enforceability in march    the district court rendered its findings of fact and conclusions of law in a may   opinion  scanner techs corp v icos vision sys corp nv  fsuppd  sdny “scanner ii ”   the district court entered final judgment on june   finding the asserted patents unenforceable invalid for obviousness and not infringed   the final judgment also included a provision that rendered related patents derived from the same common parent application unenforceable   scanner appeals the district courts final judgment   for the reasons stated below we affirm in part reverse in part and vacate in partithis case involves semiconductor technology and specifically processes to inspect electronic components including ball array devices ball grid arrays chip scale packages and bump on wafers collectively “bgas”   bgas are mounted on circuit boards that can be found in various electronic devices and are used to conduct electrical impulses in such devices   the bgas are comprised of an array of solder balls on a plane or substrate that conduct electrical impulses   as noted in this courts opinion in scanner i  fd at  it is important that the solder balls are positioned precisely at the same height  “even a minute difference in height could render the bga and thus the device useless”  idinventors elwin m beaty “beaty” and david p mork “mork” discovered an apparatus and method for the threedimensional inspection of ball array devices in mid and filed a patent application us appl no  on the apparatus and method in january    this january  application is the “common parent application” to which the district court refers in its final judgment   from this common parent application divisional applications that would become us patent nos  “the ′ patent” and  “the ′ patent” collectively “the patents in suit” were filed on may     scanner displayed its first embodiment of the method and apparatusan inspection module called the ultra vim plus “uv”in july  at the semicon west trade show in san jose california and again in december  at the semicon japan trade showicos representatives were attendees of these trade shows and interacted with scanner representatives on at least one occasion   based at least in part on what icos observed at the trade shows icos engaged scanner in preliminary discussions regarding icoss interest in licensing or acquiring scanners bga technology   icos eventually abandoned those pursuits in light of its own progress in developing a d bga inspection system   in january  icos announced its cyberstereo d bga inspection product   the cyberstereo was an outgrowth and replacement of icoss older bga inspection product the icos projector   the projector had been on the market since  and used a twocamera system with a structured light from a projector to inspect bgas literature for the projector system explained the use of a triangulation principle to perform threedimensional measurements including the use of z calibration and bilinear interpolation   whereas the projector system measured the absolute value of the top of the balls of the bgas the cyberstereo eliminated the projector and implemented a twocamera system to measure coplanarity ie whether the balls were lying in the same plane   to accomplish this measurement the cyberstereo measures a point inside the ball rather than the top of the ballby february  scanner learned that icos had launched the competing cyberstereo d bga inspection product   in scanners view icoss new product infringed the proposed claims of scanners patent applications   consequently while the applications were pending scanner submitted a petition to make special to the commissioner of patents and trademarks at the united states patent and trademark office “pto”   the purpose of such a petition is to seek accelerated review of the pending application  in its petition scanners patent attorney george a leone “leone” submitted that the application was entitled to special handling status because of actual infringement   the petition contained all the prerequisites that the pto requires including leones statement that a “rigid comparison” of the alleged infringing method with the claims of the application had been made and that in leones opinion some of the claims are “unquestionably infringed”   the petition was accompanied by a statement from the applicant and assignee beaty describing the claimed invention his role in the invention certain interactions between scanner and icos and icoss competing system   the pto granted scanners petition and advanced the application process   literature describing the projector system was considered by the pto examiner as prior art to the patents in suit and the claims were considered patentable over the system as described in the literaturethe pto issued the patents in suit on may     the ′ patent is entitled “apparatus for three dimensional inspection of electronic components”   as the patents abstract provides the ′ patent covers a three dimensional inspection apparatus for ball array devices where the ball array device is positioned in a fixed optical system   an illumination apparatus is positioned for illuminating the ball array device   a first camera is disposed in a fixed focus position relative to the ball array device for taking a first image of the ball array device to obtain a characteristic circular doughnut shape image from a ball   a second camera is disposed in a fixed focus position relative to the ball array device for taking a second image of the ball array device to obtain a side view image of the ball   a processor applies triangulation calculations on related measurements of the first image and the second image to calculate a three dimensional position of the ball with reference to a precalculated calibration plane  ′ patent abstract   claim  of the ′ patent reads  a three dimensional inspection apparatus for ball array devices having a plurality of balls wherein the ball array device is positioned in a fixed optical system the apparatus comprisinga an illumination apparatus positioned for illuminating the ball array deviceb a first camera disposed in a fixed focus position relative to the ball array device for taking a first image of the ball array device to obtain a characteristic circular doughnut shape image from at least one ballc a second camera disposed in a fixed focus position relative to the ball array device for taking a second image of the ball array device to obtain a side view image of the at least one ball  andd a processor coupled to receive the first image and the second image that applies triangulation calculations on related measurements of the first image and the second image to calculate a three dimensional position of the at least one ball with reference to a precalculated calibration plane′ patent col  ll the ′ patent is entitled “process for three dimensional inspection of electronic components”   corresponding to the ′ patented apparatus the ′  patent covers a three dimensional inspection process for ball array devices positioned in a fixed optical system   in the claimed process of the ′  patent the ball array device is illuminated and a first image of the ball array device is taken with a first camera disposed in a fixed focus position relative to the ball array device to obtain a characteristic circular doughnut shape image from a ball   a second image of the ball array device is taken with a second camera disposed in a fixed focus position relative to the ball array device to obtain a side view image of the ball   the first image and the second image are processed using a triangulation method to calculate a three dimensional position of the ball with reference to a precalculated calibration plane′ patent abstractmork assigned his rights in the patents to beatythe ceo and majority shareholder of scanner   scanner holds an exclusive license to the patents in suit from beaty and the license includes the right to sue for infringementiiscanner filed suit against icos on july   accusing icoss cyberstereo ball grid array inspection system of infringing the patents in suit   icos filed an answer denying the substantive allegations contained in the complaint   in its counterclaim icos sought damages for unfair competition under the lanham act common law unfair competition and trade disparagement and tortious interference with advantageous business relations   icos also asked the court to declare scanners ′ and ′ patents invalid unenforceable and not infringed by icos the parties agreed that the case would rise and fall on claim  of the ′ patentin an interlocutory appeal in  scanner challenged the methodology employed by the district court in construing the terms “an illumination apparatus” and “illuminating” and its substantive constructions of those terms  scanner i  fd at    scanner further challenged the district courts entry of summary judgment of noninfringement as based upon erroneous claim constructions  id in that case this court agreed with scanner that the district court erred in limiting “an illumination apparatus” and thus “illuminating” to an apparatus containing only a single illumination source  id at    we held that “an illumination apparatus” is properly construed to encompass one or more illumination sources because the patentee had not evinced a clear intent to limit the article “an” to a single illumination source in either the claims or specification of the ′ patent  id because the district courts entry of summary judgment of noninfringement was premised upon an incorrect construction of these terms we vacated the judgment and remanded the case for further proceedings  id at iiithe case is now back before us following proceedings on remand in which the district court conducted a bench trial on the issues of infringement validity and enforceabilityaregarding inequitable conduct the district court took issue with leones statement in the petition that he had made a “rigid comparison” of the cyberstereo system with the claims of the application when the district court found based on leones deposition testimony that leone “had not actually seen the icos device as suggested”  scanner ii  fsuppd at    leones statements were not the only basis for the courts finding of inequitable conduct  the district court also found beatys statements in connection with the petition to make special to be problematic   the district court statedthe uv was not on “open display” at the december  trade show at least not in the sense that beaty tried to convey for the system was in a black sealed box and an inspection of the module would not have revealed how the calculations were performed   deproft icoss vice president did not visit the scanner booth at the july  trade show as beaty stated   contradicting what he wrote in his declaration beaty acknowledged at trial that he could not recall “anything specific” with respect to deproft at that show  tr    deproft did not take “copious notes” or make any diagrams or drawings of the uv at the japan trade show as beaty alleged as wellscanner ii  fsuppd at the district court considered the trial testimony of beaty and deproft and concluded that beatys statements  in the declaration accompanying the petition to make special suggested and “were intended to mislead the pto into believing” that icos copied the scanner device when the court found that icos developed the cyberstereo from the projector system on its own  id at bwith regard to obviousness the district court enumerated what it accepted to be well known principles in the prior art including illumination in camerabased systems twocamera systems where one camera is disposed at an angle to another use of triangulation calculations to make measurements triangulation calculations utilized with a twocamera system use of stereo vision and the idea of calibrating cameras   in view of those prior art principles the district court concluded that icoss projector system rendered scanners claims obviousthe district court explained that the projector system contained a first and second camera an illumination apparatus and a processor coupled to the cameras to receive first and second images to find the threedimensional position of at least one ball  scanner ii  fsuppd at    the court further concluded that one skilled in the art would have found it obvious at the time of the scanner invention to employ the elements of the claims to alter the projector system by removing the structured light source and employing triangulation calculations to locate the threedimensional position of balls   id based on these findings the district court entered final judgment that the claims of both patents in suit were invalidcon infringement the only element of claim  of the ′ patent in dispute was element d as the parties agreed that the icos products comprise the preamble and elements a b and c the district court observed that element d requires the use of triangulation calculations while the icos products rely on bilinear interpolation which is the process of transferring the location of a ball from the d camera into the d camera and then computing a translation offset   bilinear interpolation involves the measurement of the position of a ball in the d camera the relocation of that position in the d or top camera using a cameratocamera transfer process and a comparison of that position to the location of the ball as observed in the d camera   the difference in the two positions is proportional to the height of the ball   as the district court observed bilinear interpolation is different from triangulation as it is an algebraic operation rather than a trigonometric one   in its use of bilinear interpolation the icos system does not solve for unknown properties of a triangle and does not measure the height of the ballselement d of claim  also requires the calculation of a threedimensional position of at least one ball with reference to a precalculated calibration plane   the district court understood the icos system to locate a reference point inside the ball as opposed to locating the x y and z values for the top of a ball   because the icos products rely on coplanaritythe relative variations of each ball from a plane the district court found that icoss systems did not need to measure the height of the ball nor do they make calculations with reference to a precalculated calibration plane   absent the application of triangulation calculations on related measurements of the first image and the second image to calculate a three dimensional position with reference to a precalculated calibration plane the district court concluded that the accused device did not infringe claim  of the ′ patentivascanner contends that the district court abused its discretion by ruling that the patents in suit are unenforceable due to inequitable conduct because the court “misapplied the law relating to materiality by incorrectly concluding that any statement in a petition to make special is per se material if the petition is granted”scanner argues that the statements adjudged to be misrepresentations were neither material to patentability nor to the grant of expedited review   further scanner submits that neither beaty nor leone made false or misleading statements   scanner contends that the record and the district courts opinion are devoid of any evidence and discussion of the required intent to deceive necessary to sustain a charge of inequitable conduct the ultimate question of inequitable conduct is committed to the discretion of the district court and we review the courts determination that the patentee engaged in inequitable conduct for abuse of discretion  modine mfg co v allen group inc  fd   fedcir cert denied  us   sct   ledd     an abuse of discretion occurs when  the courts decision is clearly unreasonable arbitrary or fanciful  the courts decision is based on an erroneous construction of the law  the courts factual findings are clearly erroneous or  the record contains no evidence upon which the court rationally could have based its decision  nilssen v osram sylvania inc  fd   fedcir in order to establish inequitable conduct the party challenging the patent is required to establish by clear and convincing evidence that the patent applicant “ either made an affirmative misrepresentation of material fact failed to disclose material information or submitted false material information and  intended to deceive the us patent and trademark office”  symantec corp v computer assoc intl inc  fd   fedcir quoting cargill inc v canbra foods ltd  fd   fedcir   both intent and materiality are questions of fact and must be proven by clear and convincing evidence   young v lumenis inc  fd   fedcir   we review a district courts findings on the threshold issues of materiality and intent for clear error  pfizer inc v teva pharms usa inc  fd   fedcir   under the clear error standard the courts findings will not be overturned in the absence of a “definite and firm conviction” that a mistake has been made  id “once threshold findings of materiality and intent are established the district court must weigh them to determine whether the equities warrant a conclusion that inequitable conduct occurred”  flexrest llc v steelcase inc  fd   fedcir quoting purdue pharma  fd at  scanner argues that the district court erred in failing to assess materiality to patentability and instead applied what it considers broad dicta in this courts decision in general electro music corp v samick music corp  fd   fedcir   in general electro we stated “as a matter of law that a false statement in a petition to make special is material if ․ it succeeds in prompting expedited consideration of the application”  id at    scanner argues that in cases involving inequitable conduct since general electro the federal circuit has emphasized that a misrepresentation or omission must be material to patentability to support a charge of inequitable conduct it is true that many of our cases before and after general electro examine materiality in the context of whether the alleged inequitable conduct bore directly on patentability of the claims in suit   that fact does not undercut the continuing force of the test for materiality in the setting of a petition to make special or in other settings where an alleged misrepresentation to the patent office resulted in some action other than issuance of a patent   for example this court affirmed a district courts decision finding that all of the patents in suit were unenforceable due to inequitable conduct for improperly claiming small entity status  nilssen v osram sylvania inc  fd   fedcir stating that “it is not beyond the authority of a district court to hold a patent unenforceable for inequitable conduct in misrepresenting ones status as justifying small entity maintenance payments”  nilssen relied on ulead systems inc v lex computer  management corp  fd  fedcir   in ulead this court statedhistorically issues of unenforceability have arisen in cases involving inequitable conduct occurring in the prosecution of patents   but we see no reason why the doctrine should not extend into other contexts like the present one where the allegation is that inequitable conduct has occurred after the patent has issued and during the course of establishing and paying the appropriate maintenance fee   in this context it is equally important that the pto receive accurate information from those who practice before itid at  internal citations omitted   given the precedent cited above we must reject scanners view that inequitable conduct cannot be shown absent a misrepresentation that bears on the patentability of the claims in the application   when the setting involves a petition to make special as is the case here we reaffirm that a false statement that succeeds in expediting the application is as a matter of law material for purposes of assessing the issue of inequitable conduct in this setting the first question to address is whether the statements in question are false   if not materiality is lacking and there is no need to consider the intent prong of inequitable conduct   scanner argues that the district court failed to take the statements in scanners application to make special at face value in assessing their veracity and instead drew unwarranted inferences from the statements and deemed such inferences untruein akron polymer container corp v exxel container inc  fd  fedcir we reviewed a holding of inequitable conduct that was based on a patentees failure to disclose codependency of related applications to one examiner when the other examiner had been apprised   the district court had found that “only inferences of deceitful intent can be drawn from the joint prosecution of both applications by the same attorney”  id at    in that case we found clear error because the district court failed to give due weight to evidence of good faith that would call for inferences contrary to a finding of deceit the rule of akron polymer is as clear as it is necessary   whenever evidence proffered to show either materiality or intent is susceptible of multiple reasonable inferences a district court clearly errs in overlooking one inference in favor of another equally reasonable inference   all reasonable inferences must be drawn from the evidence and a judgment then rendered on the evidence as informed by the range of reasonable inferences  where the rule is breached no inequitable conduct may be found   the rule is necessary for without it findings of inequitable conduct with the punishment of unenforceability of the entire patent could wrongly standin this case a full review of the record shows that the district court failed to draw all reasonable inferences on the factual findings relied upon by the district court to show materiality   we will consider those findings in turn the district court first addressed leones statement that he made a “rigid comparison” of the cyberstereo “system” with the claims of the application   the court inferred that this statement “suggested” that leone had actually seen the device when in fact he had not   hence the district court deemed leone to have made a false statement to the ptowhile it is not unreasonable to infer or expect that a rigid comparison could call for a physical inspection a contrary inference of intended compliance with the ptos regulation can just as easily be drawn   the petition was accompanied with claims charts that referenced the specific source for leones beliefs as to each claimed element   most of leones citations were to icoss cyberstereo product literaturealso submitted to the pto as exhibit c to the petition   ordinary dictionary definitions  of “rigid” do not connote that the term is synonymous to a physical inspectionmoreover a physical inspection should not be an implied requirement for use of the phrase “rigid comparison” in a petition to make special in that depending on the technology and whether the claims are directed to an apparatus or a method a physical inspection may not provide any more information than what can be ascertained from review of product literature   in some cases a review of source code may be the only way to make a comparison of an accused device to proposed patent claims which cannot be accomplished by physical observation of a “black box” enclosing the hardware that stores the application generated by such source code   the district court seemed to recognize as much when in criticizing beatys use of the term “open display” to describe scanners system at a trade show the court stated “the system was in a black sealed box and an inspection of the module would not have revealed how the calculations were performed”  scanner ii  fsuppd at furthermore the district court did not credit the fact that the “rigid comparison” words are not of leones creation   the ptos rules for the contents of a petition to make special require recitation of those words   in sum the district courts inference that leone misleadingly suggested he saw the icos device when weighed against a equally reasonable inference of good faith that the plain words of his statement and supporting material engenders does not support the conclusion that the attorneys statement is misleading or false under the clear and convincing evidentiary standardthe district court also found that the uv was not on “open display” at the december  trade show “at least not in the sense that beaty tried to convey”  scanner ii  fsuppd at    the court apparently inferred from beatys statement that scanner implied that its display of the uv revealed how calculations were performed   as discussed above however even an unsealed and physically opened black box would not have necessarily revealed how scanner performed those aspects of the process that utilized a processor   one can just as reasonably infer from beatys statement that by use of the phrase “open display” scanner was communicating that the product could be viewed and demonstrated openly by visitors to the booth as opposed to a private setting or one that might require nondisclosure agreements   beaty testified that when he said scanners device was on “open display” such was to distinguish icoss closed method of display which was to “keep their modules in locked cases where people could not get to them”   trial tr at  lines beaty further testified regarding the open display that “we had ours completely open so people could move around it and see it and observe it”   id at  lines    in light of the requirement that inequitable conduct be found by clear and convincing evidence the district court erred when it adopted an unfavorable inference regarding “open display” over an equally reasonable favorable inferenceas a further example of a false statement to the pto by beaty the district court found that deproft did not visit the scanner booth at the july  trade show as the district court held that beaty had suggested   on this issue beaty testified that he had no specific recollection of which icos personnel visited the scanner booth but he affirmed his honest belief that deproft had visited the booth   deproft testified that he absolutely recalled attending the july trade show   he could not recall speaking with beaty or anyone else representing scanner at the july show   when asked if he had “any memory of seeing anything or learning of anything about scanner at that trade show in july of ” he replied “no i do not   in fact im not sure whether scanner had the booth there or had a system on display there   i just donti cannot recall that”   although deproft was sure he attended the july show he was unsure whether or not he visited the scanner booththe testimony before the district court on the issue of whether deproft visited the scanner booth at the july trade show is susceptible of at least two possibilities  either deproft did visit the booth or he did not   the memory of both witnesses was at best vague  since it is uncontested that several icos employees visited the trade show whether deproft did or did not seems inconsequential   but in any event as with the alleged false statements examined above here too the testimony is not onesided   the district court chose to infer from deprofts testimony that he had not visited the booth   but given the vague nature of the testimony it would have been equally reasonable to infer that he had in fact visited it   in the face of the clear and convincing evidence standard the district court clearly erred in favoring deprofts vague memory over beatysthe district court also concluded as a matter of fact that deproft did not take “copious notes” or make any diagrams or drawings of the uv at the japan trade show as beaty stated in his declaration   the district court credited deprofts testimony over beatys in this regard   the supreme court has instructed that “when a trial judges finding is based on his decision to credit the testimony of one of two or more witnesses each of whom has told a coherent and facially plausible story that is not contradicted by extrinsic evidence that finding if not internally inconsistent can virtually never be clear error”  honeywell intl inc v hamilton sundstrand corp  fd   fedcir quoting anderson v city of bessemer city  us    sct   ledd   emphasis added   as scanner points out there is some inconsistency in the district courts assessment of the conflicting testimony because deproft was forced to acknowledge on crossexamination that he had taken some notesat least enough to have commented about scanners system in icoss internal correspondence   thus the falsity or misleading nature of beatys statements and corresponding trial testimony comes down to whether the notes taken by deproft were indeed “copious”   what constitutes “copious” notetaking is a relative determination from which subjective inferences both favorable and unfavorable can be deduced   to the extent that the district court found that beaty made a false statement based on an unfavorable inference presumed from the adjective he used to describe the amount of notes that were taken the district court plainly erred   we fail to see how such an inference constitutes the clear and convincing evidence necessary to support a finding of inequitable conducttaking beatys statements analyzed above as a whole the district court held that those statements “were intended to mislead the pto into believing that icos had copied the scanner invention based on what it saw at the trade shows”  scanner ii  fsuppd at    when the individual facts are properly assessed with all reasonable inferences being drawn there is no clear and convincing evidence that scanner told the pto that icos had copied its invention   to be sure beatys declaration stated that he believed that icoss product met the limitations of the claims in his application   but such a belief leaves room for nothing more than the bare assertion of infringement   the limitations of the claims can be met by slavish copying or equally met by independent development of the accused products   the record when properly analyzed reveals scanner telling the pto that it believed icos to infringe   under the clear error standard scanner cannot be held to have told the pto that icos came by infringement by way of copyingwhen the record evidence in this case on the issue of whether scanner made false statements to the pto in its petition to make special is measured by the rule of akron polymer the grounds supporting the district courts ultimate finding of materiality dissolves   because we hold that the district court clearly erred in its finding of materiality the issue of intent to deceive the pto is moot   consequently we reverse the district courts determination that the patents in suit are unenforceable for inequitable conduct b scanner contends that the district court abused its discretion in awarding attorneys fees and costs to icos because the court based its finding of an exceptional case on an erroneous finding of inequitable conduct   we agree whether a case is exceptional under section  is a factual question reviewed for clear error  cybor corp v fas techs  fd   fedcir en banc   the district courts decision to award attorney fees after finding a case exceptional is reviewed for abuse of discretion  id as discussed above the district court clearly erred in finding that scanner submitted false material statements to the pto because the district courts finding of inequitable conduct served as the essential foundation of its finding that this case was exceptional the district court likewise erred in finding that this case was exceptional and therefore abused its discretion in awarding attorney fees   see molins plc v textron inc  fd   fedcirc we turn to the question of whether the district court correctly held that the claims in suit would have been obvious   scanner argues that the district court erred by first failing to consider the level of ordinary skill in the art and the evidence of objective indicia of nonobviousness and second concluding that claim  would have been obvious without making factual findings that could support a conclusion that the prior art disclosed or suggested the actual elements of claim  obviousness is a question of law based on underlying questions of fact  daiichi sankyo co ltd v apotex inc  fd   fedcir citing winner intl royalty corp v wang  fd   fedcir   we therefore review the ultimate determination of obviousness by a district court de novo and the underlying factual inquiries for clear error  id the underlying factual determinations made by the district court that this court must review for clear error include  the scope and content of the prior art  the level of ordinary skill in the art  the differences between the claimed invention and the prior art and  objective indicia of nonobviousness  graham v john deere co  us    sct   ledd   scanners arguments regarding the level of ordinary skill in the art and evidence of objective indicia of nonobviousness ring hollow   we recognize that it is icoss burden to prove invalidity by clear and convincing evidence and that that burden of proof never shifts to the patentee to prove validity   pfizer inc v apotex inc  fd   fedcir quoting hybritech inc v monoclonal antibodies inc  fd   fedcir however in this case the record shows that icos adduced certain facts which were unrebutted by scanner and accepted by the district court as the fact finder  pfizer  fd at  “once a challenger has presented a prima facie case of invalidity the patentee has the burden of going forward with rebuttal evidence” internal citations omitted  cable elec prods inc v genmark inc  fd   fedcir “if evidence is presented establishing a prima facie case of invalidity the opponent of invalidity must come forward with evidence to counter the prima facie challenge to the presumption of section ”   the district court cannot be said to have erred by not discussing those unrebutted facts the district court has the responsibility to determine whether the challenger has met its burden by clear and convincing evidence by considering the totality of the evidence including any rebuttal evidence presented by the patentee  pfizer inc v apotex inc  fd at  quoting stratoflex inc v aeroquip corp  fd   fedcir   the record shows that icoss expert dr mundy testified to the level of ordinary skill in the art   scanner points to no contrary evidence and its brief does not even dispute the level of ordinary skill that dr mundy describedfurther the district court expressly considered the insinuation that icos copied and explicitly rejected the idea   in criticizing the district courts failure to consider any other evidence introduced at trial demonstrating the existence of objective indicia of nonobviousness scanner cites in its brief to  press releases that caution the reader not to place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements such as expected contributions of the new product  an email referring to a nonspecific press release and  an excerpt from the trial testimony in which counsel for scanner sought to admit exhibits into the record going to commercial success but declining to “have discussions to make it go more quickly”   in point of fact there simply was not much evidence of secondary indicia of obviousness for the court to consider and discuss   we therefore reject scanners argument that the district court erred by failing to consider the level of ordinary skill in the art and evidence of objective indicia of nonobviousnessscanner argues that the district court erred in concluding that the icos projector system disclosed or suggested each limitation of claim  because the district court issued no findings of fact capable of supporting its conclusion   in support of its argument scanner points to the fact that the projector system was the only prior art the court considered in invalidating the patents and that the system was before the pto which found the claims to be patentable over the projector system   specifically scanner argues that the district court did not find that the prior art disclosed or suggested the limitations of claim  as they actually appear which would have required a finding that the projector system or the knowledge of those of skill in the art contained or suggested calculation of a threedimensional position of a ball with reference to a precalculated calibration planescanner further argues that prior to its invention “common sense dictated that a d calibration object not a calibration plane was needed to calibrate a d camera”   scanner then states that the “projector taught that separate calibration devices were required to calibrate the two cameras and taught away from using an xy calibration reticle to calibrate the d camera”   scanner submits that the district court also did not find that the projector system or the knowledge of those of skill in the art contained or suggested applying triangulation calculations on related measurements of the first image and the second image obtained by the first and second cameras respectively as is required by claim  therefore according to scanner “the record contains no evidence that anything in the prior art or in the knowledge of one of skill in the art would have suggested implementing stereo triangulation calculations on related images in the projector system”icos responds that the district court found that the projector system used “z calibration” a finding scanner acknowledged   icos submits that z calibration is calibration with reference to a z plane   the trial testimony supports this contention   icoss expert dr mundy was asked whether the two cameras in the projector system were calibrated using a single artifact   dr mundy replied “yes they were”   trial tr at    when asked how dr mundy explained “they had a flat glass a plate which they called a caliber something like that․ but basically it is a plane which they put under the field of view of both cameras and then carry out the calibration process that i just illustrated in my slides and in my analysis of the code”  id emphasis addedfurther icos points to dr mundys testimony as establishing that the use of two cameras in a stereovision arrangement was not new at the time of the alleged invention   specifically dr mundy testified that “․ the use of triangulation to determine information from the two cameras the side d camera and the top camera is something thats well known or was well known at that time   and actually stereo measurement of sphinx had been done by the computer vision community perhaps a decade earlier”   dr mundy was then asked “based on that at least in your opinion to one skilled in the art the concept of using stereo vision would be obvious with the existence of a projector system”   he responded “well it would have been obvious in any system that had two cameras one at an angle with respect to the other”   trial tr at  with respect to scanners point that the district court does not identify the relational aspect of claim  we agree that one of ordinary skill in the art would understand that the relationship characteristic of triangulation is an ancient greek discovery and there can be no triangulation of mere unrelated measurements   as the supreme court reaffirmed in ksr intl co v teleflex inc  us   sct    ledd   an obviousness analysis “need not seek out precise teachings directed to the specific subject matter of the challenged claim for a court can take account of the inferences and creative steps that a person of ordinary skill in the art would employ”   we recognize that claim  requires triangulation of measurements using a first image from the first camera and a second image from the second camera whereas the projector system performs triangulation calculations on related measurements from images of only one camera   however the trial testimony shows that the relatively small logical gap between the prior art and the claim in this case is closed by a person of ordinary skill in the art “pursuing known options within his or her technical grasp”   see also in re translogic tech inc  fd   fedcirscanners arguments regarding obviousness appear to take more issue with the crisp nature of the district courts opinion rather than the merits of the obviousness determination which are supported by the trial testimony of dr mundy   see stratoflex inc v aeroquip corp  fd   fedcir “we sit to review judgments not opinions”   we agree with the district courts judgment and therefore affirm its conclusion that claim  of the ′ patent would have been obvious in light of the prior art and the knowledge of one skilled in the artd scanner argues that the district court erred in holding that the cyberstereo does not infringe any claim of the patents in suit   infringement is a question of fact that after a bench trial we review for clear error  alza corp v mylan labs inc  fd   fedcir   under the clear error standard a reversal is permitted only when this court is left with a definite and firm conviction that the district court was in error  id citing medichem sa v rolabo sl  fd   fedcir according to scanner the district court applied a different and incorrect construction of the term “triangulation calculation” in its infringement analysis to conclude that the cyberstereo is not making or using triangulation calculations   however the record does support the conclusion that icos does not practice “triangulation” as the patents in suit use that term because icos relies on bilinear interpolation for measurementscanner also argues that the district court applied an incorrect construction of the claim term “precalculated calibration plane” since the district court arrived at the conclusion that the cyberstereo determines the x and y coordinates on the z world plane   the district court correctly applied the claim construction and properly determined that the coplanarity calculation in icoss system is different from the precalculated calibration plane in claim  of the ′ patent   scanner identifies no basis for this court to disturb the district courts factual findings most of which were based on crediting expert witness testimony   we therefore affirm the district courts judgment of noninfringement of claim escanner also appeals the district courts ruling on the validity of unasserted claims of the patents in suit   scanner further contends that the district court erred in concluding that no claim of either patentinsuit is infringed based on its analysis of only claim  of the ′ patent scanner first argues that the district court lacked jurisdiction to adjudicate the unasserted claims because no case or controversy existed to support subject matter jurisdiction   this argument is unpersuasive   icos responded to scanners lawsuit with a counterclaim that sought a declaratory judgment on the claims of the ′ and ′ patents   defs answer and countercl at  “count iv declaratory judgment ․ the ′  and ′ patents and each of the claims thereof are invalid andor unenforceable for one or more of the reasons set forth in paragraphs a through k above”   accordingly the district court had subject matter jurisdiction to adjudicate claims that scanner did not assert against icos scanner also argues that the district court erred in ruling on the validity of claims as to which icos presented no evidence   icos responds that the case went to trial on claim  because the parties agreed to try the case on a representative claim upon which the entire case would stand or fall   icos cites to the parties stipulation “that the case stands and falls on claim  of the ′ patent”scanner limits the import of the stipulation to claim construction   the record does not include the stipulation itself only acknowledgement by both parties that the stipulation had been made   when asked at oral argument neither party was aware of whether the stipulation was memorialized in writing or part of the record below an interpretation of the parties pretrial stipulation much like contract interpretation is a legal issue that this court reviews de novo  fuji photo film co ltd v jazz photo corp  fd   fedcir citing kearns v chrysler corp  fd   fedcir   despite the black letter law that a finding of invalidity of an independent claim does not determine the validity of claims that depend from it see  usc §   parties can stipulate to almost anything but jurisdiction   this courts decision in shelcore inc v durham indus inc  fd  fedcir is instructivewhile the rulethat where the patentability of dependent claims is not argued separately from the independent claims from which they depend the former stand or fall with the latterhas vitality prior to the issuance of a patent embodying those claims that rule has no application in a district court proceeding to determine whether the claims of an issued patent are valid   while the above rule is not applicable as a rule of procedure in a district court it has been applied on appeal from a district court judgment with respect to the claims of an issued patent as a matter of convenience   the presumption of validity does not guide our analysis on appeal   rather we review the findings and conclusions of a district court under the appropriate standards of review   that circumstance bears no relation however to the requirement at trial that a party challenging the validity of a claim absent a pretrial agreement or stipulation must submit evidence supporting a conclusion of invalidity of each claim the challenger seeks to destroyid at  emphasis added   in this case we have an unambiguously proposed finding of fact that stated simply “icos and scanner have stipulated that the case stands and falls on claim  of the ′ patent” to which scanner replied “true” the pleadings represented that “the case” constituted allegations of infringement of both patents and a declaratory judgment action seeking invalidity noninfringement and unenforceability of all the claims of the patent in suit   scanners response to icoss proposed finding of fact and conclusions of law provided no caveat to its unqualified agreement with the nature of the parties stipulation   finding no ambiguity in the parties representation of the stipulation before the district court we affirm the district courts judgment invalidating the claims of both patents in suitnotwithstanding its position regarding the stipulation as it relates to the validity of claims not tried before the district court scanner charges that the district court failed to separately consider whether the cyberstereo performed “the triangulation method” disclosed in claims   and  of the ′ patent and various asserted claims of the ′ patent   even if the stipulation was not intended to be what it plainly representsa representative claim on which the case rises or fallsthe district court could not have erred in failing to consider infringement of scanners other claims in ruling those claims not infringed because scanner failed to adduce facts to support a finding that icos infringed claims   and  of the ′ patent   accordingly we affirm the district courts judgment of noninfringementvfor the reasons discussed above we reverse the district court on its inequitable conduct finding and its judgment that the related unasserted patents are unenforceable   consequently we vacate the attorneys fee award   we affirm the district courts judgment that claim  is invalid as it would have been obvious   we also affirm the district courts judgment invalidating all claims of the patents in suit given the stipulation between the parties that the case would be tried on a representative claim   we also affirm the district courts holding that the cyberstereo does not infringe any claim of the patents in suit generally and the ′ patent specificallycostseach party shall bear its own costs for this appealaffirmed in part reversed in part and vacated in partfootnotes   petitions to make special are governed by section  of the manual of patent examining procedure mpep which provides that an application may be made special because of actual but not prospective infringement upon payment of the fee and the filing of a petition accompanied by a statement by the applicant assignee or an attorneyagent alleging the followinga that there is an infringing device or product actually on the market or method in useb that a rigid comparison of the alleged infringing device product or method with the claims of the application has been made and that in his or her opinion some of the claims are unquestionably infringed  andc that he or she has made or caused to be made a careful and thorough search of the prior art or has a good knowledge of the pertinent prior artmanual of patent examining procedure §  th ed   as the district court observed beatys statement alleged that  the uv was on “open display” at the december  trade show  deproft approached beaty for a twohour private meeting  deproft had previously inspected the uv at the july  trade show in california  deproft “took copious notes diagrams and drawings” of the uv at the japan trade show  other icos personnel “also rigorously studied the scanner display” at the japan trade show  according to a former icos employee after the july  trade show it was suggested at an icos meeting that a third party buy the uv so that icos could see how it worked  icos contacted scanner in december  about obtaining rights to the uv  and on january   icos announced the introduction of its cyberstereo system which beaty described as being “substantially identical” to the uv   we note that not all false statements or misrepresentations contained in a petition to make special are necessarily material even if the applicant succeeded in receiving expedited treatment for his or her application   rather in evaluating whether a false statement or misrepresentation in a petition to make special is material a court must determine whether the false statement was likely a butfor cause of the grant of the petition   if not a threshold level of materiality has not been established   of course a district court need not make explicit findings as to the range of reasonable inferences in every case but must do so only where it draws an inference from a statement that is also subject to an equally plausible contrary inference   see eg merriamwebsters online dictionary defining “rigid” as a  deficient in or devoid of flexibility   b  appearing stiff and unyielding    a  inflexibly set in opinion  b  strictly observed  adheres to a rigid schedule    firmly inflexible rather than lax or indulgent     precise and accurate in procedure    of an airship  having the outer shape maintained by a fixed framework   an email sent shortly after the show from one icos employee to other icos employees including deproft who did attend that show stated that “at semicon west we all noticed a potential d bga competitor scanner technologies”   this statement by an icos employee attributes to deproft as well as other icos employees at least some awareness of scanners presence at the trade show   scanner contends that the district court erred by declaring unenforceable numerous patents not in suit since it lacked jurisdiction and an evidentiary record to support such a ruling   because we hold that the district court erred in holding the patents in suit unenforceable for inequitable conduct we necessarily vacate the district courts judgment that the related patents not in suit are unenforceableclevenger senior circuit judge findlaw career center attorney corporate counsel
