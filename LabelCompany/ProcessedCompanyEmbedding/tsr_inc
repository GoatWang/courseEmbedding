that time owned only about  of the stock requested that the board of directors remove the blumes as a way of restoring financial health to the company the blumes were forced to leave the company after being accused of misusing corporate funds and accumulating large debts in the pursuit of acquisitions such as latchhook rug kits that were thought to be too broadly targeted within a year of the departure of the blumes the company was forced to post a net loss of usd  million resulting in layoffs of approximately  of the staff some of these staff members went on to form other prominent game companies such as pacesetter ltd and mayfair games or to work with colecos video game division however in an act many saw as retaliation the blumes sold their stock to lorraine williams gygax tried to have the sale declared illegal after that failed gygax sold his remaining stock to williams and used the capital to form new infinity productions williams was a financial planner who saw potential for

behind both games workshop and wizards of the coast in sales volume seeing the profits being generated by wizards of the coast with their collectible card game ccg magic the gathering tsr attempted to enter this market in  in a novel way with dragon dice similar to collectible card games each player started with a random assortment of basic dice and could improve their assortment by purchasing booster packs of more powerful dice in addition to this initiative tsr also decided to publish twelve hardcover novels in  despite a previous history of publishing only one or two hardcover novels each year sales of dragon dice through the games trade started strongly so tsr quickly produced several expansion packs in addition tsr tried to aggressively market dragon dice in massmarket book stores through random house however the game did not catch on through the book trade and sales of the expansion sets through traditional games stores were poor in addition the twelve hardcover novels did not sell as well as expected tsrs demiseedit by  tsr was experiencing numerous problems as outlined by shannon appelcline ccgs were continuing to shrink the rpg industry distributors were going out of business tsr had unbalanced their add game through a series of lucrative supplements that ultimately hurt the longtime viability of the game meanwhile they had developed so many settings – many of them popular and wellreceived – that they were both cannibalising their only sales and discouraging players from picking up settings that might be gone in a few years they may have been cannibalising their own sales through excessive production of books or supplements too david m ewalt in his book of dice and men adds that spellfire and dragon dice were both expensive to produce and neither sold very well despite total sales of  million tsr ended  with few cash reserves when random house returned an unexpectedly high percentage of unsold stock including the years inventory of unsold novels and sets of dragon dice and charged a fee of several million dollars tsr found itself in a cash crunch with no cash tsr was unable to pay their printing and shipping bills and the logistics company that handled tsrs prepress printing warehousing and shipping refused to do any more work since the logistics company had the production plates for key products such as core dd books there was no means of printing or shipping core products to generate income or secure shortterm financing despite high sales the company was deep in debt and not profitable in large part due to returns thirty staff members were laid off in december  and other staff left over disagreements about how the crisis was handled including james m ward in large part due to the need to refund random house tsr entered  over  million in debt tsr was threatened by lawsuits due to unpaid freelancers and missing royalties but tsr made enough money from products already on the shelves to pay remaining staff through the first half of  with no viable financial plan for tsrs survival lorraine williams sold the company to wizards of the coast in  before the corporate offices in lake geneva were closed some tsr employees accepted the offer of transferring to wizards of the coasts offices in washington wizards of the coast continued to use the tsr name for dd products for three years until the third

publishing novels based on their games most dd campaign settings had their own novel line the most successful of which were the dragonlance and forgotten realms lines with dozens of novels each tsr also published the  novel buck rogers a life in the future by martin caidin a standalone reimagining of the buck rogers universe and unrelated to tsrs buck rogers xxvc game tsr published quite a number of fantasy and science fiction novels unconnected with their gaming products such as l dean james red kings of wynnamyr novels sorcerers stone  and kingslayer  mary h herberts five gabria novels valorian dark horse lightnings daughter city of the sorcerers and winged magic and humorous fantasy fiction including roy v youngs count yor novels captains outrageous  and yors revenge however such projects never represented more than a fraction of the companys fiction output which retained a strong emphasis on gamederived works criticismedit after its initial success faded the company turned to legal defenses of what it regarded as its intellectual property in addition there were several legal cases brought regarding who had invented what within the company and the division of royalties including several lawsuits against gygax this included the company threatening to sue individuals supplying game material on websites in the mids this led to frequent use of the nickname tr in discussions on rpgrelated internet mailing lists and usenet as the company was widely perceived as attacking its customers increasing product proliferation did not help matters many of the product lines overlapped and were separated by what seemed like minor points even the classic troika of greyhawk the forgotten realms and dragonlance suffered in this regard the company was the subject of an urban myth stating that it tried to trademark the term nazi this was based on a supplement for the indiana jones rpg in which some figures were marked with nazi™ this notation was because of compliance with the list of trademarked character names supplied by lucasfilms legal department all such figures were marked with a trademark symbol and the nazi figures were likewise marked accidentally later references to the error would forget its origin and slowly morph into the urban myth see alsoedit lake geneva tactical studies association notesedit  a b c peterson jon  playing at

being accused of misusing corporate funds and accumulating large debts in the pursuit of acquisitions such as latchhook rug kits that were thought to be too broadly targeted within a year of the departure of the blumes the company was forced to post a net loss of usd  million resulting in layoffs of approximately  of the staff some of these staff members went on to form other prominent game companies such as pacesetter ltd and mayfair games or to work with colecos video game division however in an act many saw as retaliation the blumes sold their stock to lorraine williams gygax tried to have the sale declared illegal after that failed gygax sold his remaining stock to williams and used the capital to form new infinity productions williams was a financial planner who saw potential for

behind both games workshop and wizards of the coast in sales volume seeing the profits being generated by wizards of the coast with their collectible card game ccg magic the gathering tsr attempted to enter this market in  in a novel way with dragon dice similar to collectible card games each player started with a random assortment of basic dice and could improve their assortment by purchasing booster packs of more powerful dice in addition to this initiative tsr also decided to publish twelve hardcover novels in  despite a previous history of publishing only one or two hardcover novels each year sales of dragon dice through the games trade started strongly so tsr quickly produced several expansion packs in addition tsr tried to aggressively market dragon dice in massmarket book stores through random house however the game did not catch on through the book trade and sales of the expansion sets through traditional games stores were poor in addition the twelve hardcover novels did not sell as well as expected tsrs demiseedit by  tsr was experiencing numerous problems as outlined by shannon appelcline ccgs were continuing to shrink the rpg industry distributors were going out of business tsr had unbalanced their add game through a series of lucrative supplements that ultimately hurt the longtime viability of the game meanwhile they had developed so many settings – many of them popular and wellreceived – that they were both cannibalising their only sales and discouraging players from picking up settings that might be gone in a few years they may have been cannibalising their own sales through excessive production of books or supplements too david m ewalt in his book of dice and men adds that spellfire and dragon dice were both expensive to produce and neither sold very well despite total sales of  million tsr ended  with few cash reserves when random house returned an unexpectedly high percentage of unsold stock including the years inventory of unsold novels and sets of dragon dice and charged a fee of several million dollars tsr found itself in a cash crunch with no cash tsr was unable to pay their printing and shipping bills and the logistics company that handled tsrs prepress printing warehousing and shipping refused to do any more work since the logistics company had the production plates for key products such as core dd books there was no means of printing or shipping core products to generate income or secure shortterm financing despite high sales the company was deep in debt and not profitable in large part due to returns thirty staff members were laid off in december  and other staff left over disagreements about how the crisis was handled including james m ward in large part due to the need to refund random house tsr entered  over  million in debt tsr was threatened by lawsuits due to unpaid freelancers and missing royalties but tsr made enough money from products already on the shelves to pay remaining staff through the first half of  with no viable financial plan for tsrs survival lorraine williams sold the company to wizards of the coast in  before the corporate offices in lake geneva were closed some tsr employees accepted the offer of transferring to wizards of the coasts offices in washington wizards of the coast continued to use the tsr name for dd products for three years until the third

also published the  novel buck rogers a life in the future by martin caidin a standalone reimagining of the buck rogers universe and unrelated to tsrs buck rogers xxvc game tsr published quite a number of fantasy and science fiction novels unconnected with their gaming products such as l dean james red kings of wynnamyr novels sorcerers stone  and kingslayer  mary h herberts five gabria novels valorian dark horse lightnings daughter city of the sorcerers and winged magic and humorous fantasy fiction including roy v youngs count yor novels captains outrageous  and yors revenge however such projects never represented more than a fraction of the companys fiction output which retained a strong emphasis on gamederived works criticismedit after its initial success faded the company turned to legal defenses of what it regarded as its intellectual property in addition there were several legal cases brought regarding who had invented what within the company and the division of royalties including several lawsuits against gygax this included the company threatening to sue individuals supplying game material on websites in the mids this led to frequent use of the nickname tr in discussions on rpgrelated internet mailing lists and usenet as the company was widely perceived as attacking its customers increasing product proliferation did not help matters many of the product lines overlapped and were separated by what seemed like minor points even the classic troika of greyhawk the forgotten realms and dragonlance suffered in this regard the company was the subject of an urban myth stating that it tried to trademark the term nazi this was based on a supplement for the indiana jones rpg in which some figures were marked with nazi™ this notation was because of compliance with the list of trademarked character names supplied by lucasfilms legal department all such figures were marked with a trademark symbol and the nazi figures were likewise marked accidentally later references to the error would forget its origin and slowly morph into the urban myth see alsoedit lake geneva tactical studies association notesedit  a b c peterson jon  playing at

development making tsr the number one publisher of fantasy and science fiction novels in the usa dragonlance consisted of an entirely new game world promoted both by a series of game supplements and a trilogy of novels written by margaret weis and tracy hickman the dragons of autumn twilight the first novel in the series reached the top of the new york times best seller list encouraging tsr to a

williams ownershipedit hearing rumors that the blumes were trying to sell tsr gygax returned from hollywood and discovered the company was in bad financial shape despite healthy sales gygax who at that time owned only about  of the stock requested that the board of directors remove the blumes as a way of restoring financial health to the company the blumes were forced to leave the company after being accused of misusing corporate funds and accumulating large debts in the pursuit of acquisitions such as latchhook rug kits that were thought to be too broadly targeted within a year of the departure of the blumes the company was forced to post a net loss of usd  million resulting in layoffs of approximately  of the staff some of these staff members went on to form other prominent game companies such as pacesetter ltd and mayfair games or to work with colecos video game division however in an act many saw as retaliation the blumes sold their stock to lorraine williams gygax tried to have the sale declared illegal after that failed gygax sold his remaining stock to williams and used the capital to form new infinity productions williams was a financial planner who saw potential for rebuilding the debtplagued company into a highly profitable one however she was disdainful of the gaming field viewing herself as superior to gamers tsr released the forgotten realms campaign setting in  that year a small team of designers began work on the second edition of the add game in  tsr released a bullwinkle  rocky rpg complete with a spinner and hand puppets that same year tsr released a wargame based on tom clancys novel the hunt for red october which became one of the biggest selling wargames of all time in  the add nd edition was released with a new dungeon masters guide players handbook the first three volumes of the new monstrous compendium the complete fighters handbook the complete thiefs handbook and a new campaign setting spelljammer all released in the same year under williams direction tsr solidified its expansion into other fields such as magazines paperback fiction and comic books through her family she personally held the rights to the buck rogers license and encouraged tsr to produce buck rogers games and novels tsr would end up publishing a board game and a roleplaying game the latter based on the add nd edition rules in  the ravenloft setting was released and count strahd von zarovich soon became one of the most popular and enduring villains the west coast division of tsr was opened to develop various entertainment projects including a series of science fiction horror and actionadventure comic books in  tsr released the dark sun campaign setting tsr also released the first of three annual sets of collector cards in  in  tsr released the

behind both games workshop and wizards of the coast in sales volume seeing the profits being generated by wizards of the coast with their collectible card game ccg magic the gathering tsr attempted to enter this market in  in a novel way with dragon dice similar to collectible card games each player started with a random assortment of basic dice and could improve their assortment by purchasing booster packs of more powerful dice in addition to this initiative tsr also decided to publish twelve hardcover novels in  despite a previous history of publishing only one or two hardcover novels each year sales of dragon dice through the games trade started strongly so tsr quickly produced several expansion packs in addition tsr tried to aggressively market dragon dice in massmarket book stores through random house however the game did not catch on through the book trade and sales of the expansion sets through traditional games stores were poor in addition the twelve hardcover novels did not sell as well as expected tsrs demiseedit by  tsr was experiencing numerous problems as outlined by shannon appelcline ccgs were continuing to shrink the rpg industry distributors were going out of business tsr had unbalanced their add game through a series of lucrative supplements that ultimately hurt the longtime viability of the game meanwhile they had developed so many settings – many of them popular and wellreceived – that they were both cannibalising their only sales and discouraging players from picking up settings that might be gone in a few years they may have been cannibalising their own sales through excessive production of books or supplements too david m ewalt in his book of dice and men adds that spellfire and dragon dice were both expensive to produce and neither sold very well despite total sales of  million tsr ended  with few cash reserves when random house returned an unexpectedly high percentage of unsold stock including the years inventory of unsold novels and sets of dragon dice and charged a fee of several million dollars tsr found itself in a cash crunch with no cash tsr was unable to pay their printing and shipping bills and the logistics company that handled tsrs prepress printing warehousing and shipping refused to do any more work since the logistics company had the production plates for key products such as core dd books there was no means of printing or shipping core products to generate income or secure shortterm financing despite high sales the company was deep in debt and not profitable in large part due to returns thirty staff members were laid off in december  and other staff left over disagreements about how the crisis was handled including james m ward in large part due to the need to refund random house tsr entered  over  million in debt tsr was threatened by lawsuits due to unpaid freelancers and missing royalties but tsr made enough money from products already on the shelves to pay remaining staff through the first half of  with no viable financial plan for tsrs survival lorraine williams sold the company to wizards of the coast in  before the corporate offices in lake geneva were closed some tsr employees accepted the offer of transferring to wizards of the coasts offices in washington wizards of the coast continued to use the tsr name for dd products for three years until the third

publishing novels based on their games most dd campaign settings had their own novel line the most successful of which were the dragonlance and forgotten realms lines with dozens of novels each tsr also published the  novel buck rogers a life in the future by martin caidin a standalone reimagining of the buck rogers universe and unrelated to tsrs buck rogers xxvc game tsr published quite a number of fantasy and science fiction novels unconnected with their gaming products such as l dean james red kings of wynnamyr novels sorcerers stone  and kingslayer  mary h herberts five gabria novels valorian dark horse lightnings daughter city of the sorcerers and winged magic and humorous fantasy fiction including roy v youngs count yor novels captains outrageous  and yors revenge however such projects never represented more than a fraction of the companys fiction output which retained a strong emphasis on gamederived works criticismedit after its initial success faded the company turned to legal defenses of what it regarded as its intellectual property in addition there were several legal cases brought regarding who had invented what within the company and the division of royalties including several lawsuits against gygax this included the company threatening to sue individuals supplying game material on websites in the mids this led to frequent use of the nickname tr in discussions on rpgrelated internet mailing lists and usenet as the company was widely perceived as attacking its customers increasing product proliferation did not help matters many of the product lines overlapped and were separated by what seemed like minor points even the classic troika of greyhawk the forgotten realms and dragonlance suffered in this regard the company was the subject of an urban myth stating that it tried to trademark the term nazi this was based on a supplement for the indiana jones rpg in which some figures were marked with nazi™ this notation was because of compliance with the list of trademarked character names supplied by lucasfilms legal department all such figures were marked with a trademark symbol and the nazi figures were likewise marked accidentally later references to the error would forget its origin and slowly morph into the urban myth see alsoedit lake geneva tactical studies association notesedit  a b c peterson jon  playing at

geneva wisconsin united states parent wizards of the coast  subsidiaries greenfield needlewoman key people gary gygax ceo  kevin blume president  brian blume president of creative affairs  lorraine williams ceo  tsr inc was the american game publishing company that published dungeons  dragons historyedit tactical studies rules was formed in  as a partnership between gary gygax and don kaye as a means to formally publish and sell the rules of dungeons  dragons the partnership was subsequently joined by brian blume and temporarily by dave arneson when don kaye died of a stroke in  blume and gygax the remaining owners incorporated a new company tsr hobbies inc of which blume acquired the larger share the assets of the original company were transferred to the new one and tactical studies rules was dissolved in  the word hobbies was dropped from the name resulting in the final name of tsr inc tsr emerged as a leading developer of the modern roleplaying game rpg its flagship product dungeons  dragons served as the model for the new field dungeons and dragons proved to be a financial success and also was instrumental in developing the new rpg genre and introducing it to new market segments such as children and teens tsrs games proved extremely popular and extremely profitable gygax left for hollywood to found dungeons  dragons entertainment which attempted to license dd products to movie and television executives his work would eventually lead to only a single license for what later became the dungeons  dragons cartoon after gygaxs departure brian blume and his brother kevin blume assumed control of the company the blumes were forced to leave after being accused of misusing corporate funds and accumulating large debts in the pursuit of spinoffs such as latchhook rug kits that were thought to be too broadly targetedcitation needed within a year of the ascension of the blumes the company was forced to post a net loss of  million us dollars resulting in layoffs for approximately  of the staff some of these staff members went on to form other prominent game companies such as pacesetter games mayfair games and to work with colecos video game division gygax who at that time owned only approximately  of the stock wrote to the board of directors asking them to remove the blumes as a way of restoring financial health to the company in an act

to form new infinity productions williams was a financial planner who saw the potential for transforming the debtplagued company into a highly profitable one however she disdained the gaming field viewing herself as superior to gamers williams implemented an internal policy under which playing games was forbidden at the companycitation needed this resulted in many products being released without being playtested some were playtested on the sly and a large number of products being released that were incompatible with the existing game system through williams direction tsr solidified its expansion into other fields such as magazines paperback fiction and comic books williams controlled the buck rogers license and encouraged tsr to produce buck rogers games tsr would end up publishing a board game and a roleplaying game during this time in the early s tsr developed the dragonlance series which consisted of an entirely new game world and rules margaret weis and tracy hickman also produced a trilogy of novels set in the dragonlance universe which became the first game company fiction to reach the best seller list in the united states during the height of its success tsr made an annual profit of over one million us dollars and maintained a staff of  employeescitation needed however tsr gradually lost its ability to innovatecitation needed after the emergence of collectible card games tsr released several new collectable game lines dragon dice and spellfire neither found great success in the market place at the same time tsr began retaliating against fan fiction and other creative work derived from tsr intellectual property which angered many longtime customers and fans other new entrants into the rpg genre introduced competing fantasy worlds which fragmented the rpg community further reducing tsrs already wilting consumer base these and other factors led to tsr ending accumulating over  million in debt by  and having to endure

many dd players used alongside the tsr books among these were the arduin grimoire the manual of aurenia and variants such as warlock and tunnels  trolls tsr regarded these very warily and in cases where they felt their trademarks were being misused they issued ceaseanddesist letters more often than not this legal posturing resulted in only slight changes to competitors works but caused significant animosity in the community gygax granted exclusive rights to games workshop to distribute tsr products in the united kingdom after meeting with ian livingstone and steve jackson games

sell tsr gygax returned from hollywood and discovered the company was in bad financial shape despite healthy sales gygax who at that time owned only about  of the stock requested that the board of directors remove the blumes as a way of restoring financial health to the company the blumes were forced to leave the company after being accused of misusing corporate funds and accumulating large debts in the pursuit of acquisitions such as latchhook rug kits that were thought to be too broadly targeted within a year of the departure of the blumes the company was forced to post a net loss of usd  million resulting in layoffs of approximately  of the staff some of these staff members went on to form other prominent game companies such as pacesetter ltd and mayfair games or to work with colecos video game division however in an act many saw as retaliation the blumes sold their stock to lorraine williams gygax tried to have the sale declared illegal after that failed gygax sold his remaining stock to williams and used the capital to form new infinity productions williams was a financial planner who saw potential for rebuilding the debtplagued company into a highly profitable one

volume seeing the profits being generated by wizards of the coast with their collectible card game ccg magic the gathering tsr attempted to enter this market in  in a novel way with dragon dice similar to collectible card games each player started with a random assortment of basic dice and could improve their assortment by purchasing booster packs of more powerful dice in addition to this initiative tsr also decided to publish twelve hardcover novels in  despite a previous history of publishing only one or two hardcover novels each year sales of dragon dice through the games trade started strongly so tsr quickly produced several expansion packs in addition tsr tried to aggressively market dragon dice in massmarket book stores through random house however the game did not catch on through the book trade and sales of the expansion sets through traditional games stores were poor in addition the twelve hardcover novels did not sell as well as expected tsrs demiseedit by  tsr was experiencing numerous problems as outlined by shannon appelcline ccgs were continuing to shrink the rpg industry distributors were going out of business tsr had unbalanced their add game through a series of lucrative supplements that ultimately hurt the longtime viability of the game meanwhile they had developed so many settings – many of them popular and wellreceived – that they were both cannibalising their only sales and discouraging players from picking up settings that might be gone in a few years they may have been cannibalising their own sales through excessive production of books or supplements too david m ewalt in his book of dice and men adds that spellfire and dragon dice were both expensive to produce and neither sold very well despite total sales of  million tsr ended  with few cash reserves when random house returned an unexpectedly high percentage of unsold stock including the years inventory of unsold novels and sets of dragon dice and charged a fee of several million dollars tsr found itself in a cash crunch with no cash tsr was unable to pay their printing and shipping bills and the logistics company that handled tsrs prepress printing warehousing and shipping refused to do any more work since the logistics company had the production plates for key products such as core dd books there was no means of printing or shipping core products to generate income or secure shortterm financing despite high sales the company was deep in debt and not profitable in large part due to returns thirty staff members were laid off in december  and other staff left over disagreements about how the crisis was handled including james m ward in large part due to the need to refund random house tsr entered  over  million in debt tsr was threatened by lawsuits due to unpaid freelancers and missing royalties but tsr made enough money from products already on the shelves to pay remaining staff through the first half of  with no viable financial plan for tsrs survival lorraine williams sold the company to wizards of the coast in  before the corporate offices in lake geneva were closed some tsr employees accepted the offer of transferring to
