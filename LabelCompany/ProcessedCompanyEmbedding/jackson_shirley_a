than her husband birth records state that she was born in december  born in san francisco california to leslie and geraldine jackson jackson and her family lived in the community of burlingame california an affluent middleclass suburb that would be featured in shirleys first novel the road through the wall  her relationship with her mother who could trace her family heritage to the revolutionary war hero general nathanael greene was strained as her parents had married young and geraldine had been disappointed when she immediately became pregnant with shirley as she had been looking forward to spending time with her dashing husband jackson was often unable to fit in with other children and spent much of her time writing much to her mothers distress when she was a teenager her weight fluctuated resulting in a lack of confidence after the family relocated to rochester new york shirley attended brighton high school and received her diploma in  she then attended the nearby university of rochester where her parents felt they could keep an eye on her she was not happy in her classes there and professors often judged her writing harshly so she transferred to syracuse university where she flourished creatively and socially while a student at syracuse jackson became involved with the campus literary magazine through which she met her future husband stanley edgar hyman who would become a noted literary critic after their marriage and brief sojourns in new york city and westport connecticut jackson and hyman settled in north bennington vermont where hyman became a professor at bennington college as jackson continued to publish novels and short stories for stanley j kunitz and howard haycrafts twentieth century authors  she wrote i very much dislike writing about myself or my work and when pressed for autobiographical material can only give a bare chronological outline which contains naturally no pertinent facts i was born in san francisco in  and spent most of my early life in california i was married in  to stanley edgar hyman critic and numismatist and we live in vermont in a quiet rural community with fine scenery and comfortably far away from city life our major exports are books and children both of which we produce in abundance the children are laurence joanne sarah and barry my books include three novels the road through the wall hangsaman the birds nest and a collection of short stories the lottery life among the savages is a disrespectful memoir of my children jackson and hyman were known for being colorful generous hosts who surrounded themselves with literary talents including ralph ellison they were both enthusiastic readers whose personal library was estimated at over  books they had four children laurence laurie joanne jannie sarah sally and barry who would come to their own brand of literary fame as fictionalized versions of themselves in their mothers short stories according to jacksons biographers the marriage was plagued by hymans infidelities notably with his students he controlled most aspects of their relationship she was required to accept his infidelities he called her a fool when she expressed her intense dislike of the situation he controlled their finances meting out portions of her earnings to her as he saw fit despite the fact that after the success of the lottery and later work she earned far more than he did he insisted that she raise the children and do all the mundane household chores she felt patronized in her role as a faculty wife and ostracized by the townspeople of north bennington her dislike of this situation led to her increasing abuse of alcohol tranquilizers and amphetamines and influenced the themes of much of her later work deathedit in  jackson died of heart failure in her sleep at her home in north bennington at the age of  she was overweight and a heavy smoker who had for years suffered health issues related to the two issues near the end of her life jackson was seeing a psychiatrist for severe anxiety which had kept her housebound for nearly the whole of the previous year the doctor prescribed barbiturates at that time considered a safe harmless drug for many years prior she also had periodic prescriptions for amphetamines for weight loss which may have inadvertently aggravated her anxiety leading to a cycle of prescription drug abuse using the two medications to counteract each others effects any of these factors or a combination of all of them may have contributed to her declining health and early death workedit jacksons most famous story the lottery first published in the new yorker on june   established her reputation as a master of the horror tale the story prompted over  letters from readers many of them outraged

jackson born shirley hardie jackson december   san francisco california us died august   aged  north bennington vermont us occupation novelist short story writer genre mystery horror spouse stanley edgar hyman m  shirley hardie jackson december   – august   was an american writer she was popular during her life and her work has received increased attention from literary critics in recent years she has been cited as an influence on a diverse set of authors including neil gaiman stephen king nigel kneale joanne harris and richard matheson she is best known for the short story the lottery  which reveals a secret sinister underside to a bucolic american village and for the haunting of hill house  which is widely considered to be one of the best ghost stories ever written in her critical biography of jackson lenemaja friedman notes that when the lottery was published in the june   issue of the new yorker it received a response that no new yorker story had ever received hundreds of letters poured in that were characterized by as jackson put it bewilderment speculation and oldfashioned abuse in the july   issue of the san francisco chronicle jackson offered the following in response to persistent queries from her readers about her intentions explaining just what i had hoped the story to say is very difficult i suppose i hoped by setting a particularly brutal ancient rite in the present and in my own village to shock the storys readers with a graphic dramatization of the pointless violence and general inhumanity in their own lives jacksons husband the literary critic stanley edgar hyman wrote in his preface to a posthumous anthology of her work that she consistently refused to be interviewed to explain or promote her work in any fashion or to take public stands and be the pundit of the sunday supplements she believed that her books would speak for her clearly enough over the years hyman insisted that the dark visions found in jacksons work were not as some critics claimed the product of personal even neurotic fantasies but rather comprised a sensitive and faithful anatomy of the cold war era in which she lived fitting symbols for a distressing world of the concentration camp and the bomb jackson may even have taken pleasure in the subversive impact of her work as revealed by hymans statement that she was always proud that the union of south africa banned the lottery and she felt that they at least understood the story contents  biography  death  work  adaptations  magazines  awards and honors  literary studies  shirley jackson awards  shirley

appear younger than her husband birth records state that she was born in december  born in san francisco california to leslie and geraldine jackson jackson and her family lived in the community of burlingame california an affluent middleclass suburb that would be featured in shirleys first novel the road through the wall  her relationship with her mother who could trace her family heritage to the revolutionary war hero general nathanael greene was strained as her parents had married young and geraldine had been disappointed when she immediately became pregnant with shirley as she had been looking forward to spending time with her dashing husband jackson was often unable to fit in with other children and spent much of her time writing much to her mothers distress when she was a teenager her weight fluctuated resulting in a lack of confidence after the family relocated to rochester new york shirley attended brighton high school and received her diploma in  she then attended the nearby university of rochester where her parents felt they could keep an eye on her she was not happy in her classes there and professors often judged her writing harshly so she transferred to syracuse university where she flourished creatively and socially while a student at syracuse jackson became involved with the campus literary magazine through which she met her future husband stanley edgar hyman who would become a noted literary critic after their marriage and brief sojourns in new york city and westport connecticut jackson and hyman settled in north bennington vermont where hyman became a professor at bennington college as jackson continued to publish novels and short stories for stanley j kunitz and howard haycrafts twentieth century authors  she wrote i very much dislike writing about myself or my work and when pressed for autobiographical material can only give a bare chronological outline which contains naturally no pertinent facts i was born in san francisco in  and spent most of my early life in california i was married in  to stanley edgar hyman critic and numismatist and we live in vermont in a quiet rural community with fine scenery and comfortably far away from city life our major exports are books and children both of which we produce in abundance the children are laurence joanne sarah and barry my books include three novels the road through the wall hangsaman the birds nest and a collection of short stories the lottery life among the savages is a disrespectful memoir of my children jackson and hyman were known for being colorful generous hosts who surrounded themselves with literary talents including ralph ellison they were both enthusiastic readers whose personal library was estimated at over  books they had four children laurence laurie joanne jannie sarah sally and barry who would come to their own brand of literary fame as fictionalized versions of themselves in their mothers short stories according to jacksons biographers the marriage was plagued by hymans infidelities notably with his students he controlled most aspects of their relationship she was required to accept his infidelities he called her a fool when she expressed her intense dislike of the situation he controlled their finances meting out portions of her earnings to her as he saw fit despite the fact that after the success of the lottery and later work she earned far more than he did he insisted that she raise the children and do all the mundane household chores she felt patronized in her role as a faculty wife and ostracized by the townspeople of north bennington her dislike of this situation led to her increasing abuse of alcohol tranquilizers and amphetamines and influenced the themes of much of her later work deathedit in  jackson died of heart failure in her sleep at her home in north bennington at the age of  she was overweight and a heavy smoker who had for years suffered health issues related to the two issues near the end of her life jackson was seeing a psychiatrist for severe anxiety which had kept her housebound for nearly the whole of the previous year the doctor prescribed barbiturates at that time considered a safe harmless drug for many years prior she also had periodic prescriptions for amphetamines for weight loss which may have inadvertently aggravated her anxiety leading to a cycle of prescription drug abuse using the two medications to counteract each others effects any of these factors or a combination of all of them may have contributed to her declining health and early death workedit jacksons most famous story the lottery first published in the new yorker on june   established her reputation as a master of the horror tale the story prompted over  letters from readers many of them outraged at its conjuring of a dark aspect of human nature the critical reaction was unequivocally positive the story quickly became a standard in anthologies and was adapted for television in  her novel the haunting of hill house  is a highly regarded example of the haunted house story and was described by stephen king as one of the important horror novels of the twentieth century this contemporary updating of the classic ghost story has a vivid and powerful opening paragraph no live organism can continue for long to exist sanely under conditions of absolute reality even larks and katydids are

jackson born shirley hardie jackson december   san francisco california us died august   aged  north bennington vermont us occupation novelist short story writer genre mystery horror spouse stanley edgar hyman m  shirley hardie jackson december   – august   was an american writer she was popular during her life and her work has received increased attention from literary critics in recent years she has been cited as an influence on a diverse set of authors including neil gaiman stephen king nigel kneale joanne harris and richard matheson she is best known for the short story the lottery  which reveals a secret sinister underside to a bucolic american village and for the haunting of hill house  which is widely considered to be one of the best ghost stories ever written in her critical biography of jackson lenemaja friedman notes that when the lottery was published in the june   issue of the new yorker it received a response that no new yorker story had ever received hundreds of letters poured in that were characterized by as jackson put it bewilderment speculation and oldfashioned abuse in the july   issue of the san francisco chronicle jackson offered the following in response to persistent queries from her readers about her intentions explaining just what i had hoped the story to say is very difficult i suppose i hoped by setting a particularly brutal ancient rite in the present and in my own village to shock the storys readers with a graphic dramatization of the pointless violence and general inhumanity in their own lives jacksons husband the literary critic stanley edgar hyman wrote in his preface to a posthumous anthology of her work that she consistently refused to be interviewed to explain or promote her work in any fashion or to take public stands and be the pundit of the sunday supplements she believed that her books would speak for her clearly enough over the years hyman insisted that the dark visions found in jacksons work were not as some critics claimed the product of personal even neurotic fantasies but rather comprised a sensitive and faithful anatomy of the cold war era in which she lived fitting symbols for a distressing world of the concentration camp and the bomb jackson may even have taken pleasure in the subversive impact of her work as revealed by hymans statement that she was always proud that the union of south africa banned the lottery and she felt that they at least understood the story contents  biography  death  work  adaptations  magazines  awards and honors  literary studies  shirley jackson awards  shirley

appear younger than her husband birth records state that she was born in december  born in san francisco california to leslie and geraldine jackson jackson and her family lived in the community of burlingame california an affluent middleclass suburb that would be featured in shirleys first novel the road through the wall  her relationship with her mother who could trace her family heritage to the revolutionary war hero general nathanael greene was strained as her parents had married young and geraldine had been disappointed when she immediately became pregnant with shirley as she had been looking forward to spending time with her dashing husband jackson was often unable to fit in with other children and spent much of her time writing much to her mothers distress when she was a teenager her weight fluctuated resulting in a lack of confidence after the family relocated to rochester new york shirley attended brighton high school and received her diploma in  she then attended the nearby university of rochester where her parents felt they could keep an eye on her she was not happy in her classes there and professors often judged her writing harshly so she transferred to syracuse university where she flourished creatively and socially while a student at syracuse jackson became involved with the campus literary magazine through which she met her future husband stanley edgar hyman who would become a noted literary critic after their marriage and brief sojourns in new york city and westport connecticut jackson and hyman settled in north bennington vermont where hyman became a professor at bennington college as jackson continued to publish novels and short stories for stanley j kunitz and howard haycrafts twentieth century authors  she wrote i very much dislike writing about myself or my work and when pressed for autobiographical material can only give a bare chronological outline which contains naturally no pertinent facts i was born in san francisco in  and spent most of my early life in california i was married in  to stanley edgar hyman critic and numismatist and we live in vermont in a quiet rural community with fine scenery and comfortably far away from city life our major exports are books and children both of which we produce in abundance the children are laurence joanne sarah and barry my books include three novels the road through the wall hangsaman the birds nest and a collection of short stories the lottery life among the savages is a disrespectful memoir of my children jackson and hyman were known for being colorful generous hosts who surrounded themselves with literary talents including ralph ellison they were both enthusiastic readers whose personal library was estimated at over  books they had four children laurence laurie joanne jannie sarah sally and barry who would come to their own brand of literary fame as fictionalized versions of themselves in their mothers short stories according to jacksons biographers the marriage was plagued by hymans infidelities notably with his students he controlled most aspects of their relationship she was required to accept his infidelities he called her a fool when she expressed her intense dislike of the situation he controlled their finances meting out portions of her earnings to her as he saw fit despite the fact that after the success of the lottery and later work she earned far more than he did he insisted that she raise the children and do all the mundane household chores she felt patronized in her role as a faculty wife and ostracized by the townspeople of north bennington her dislike of this situation led to her increasing abuse of alcohol tranquilizers and amphetamines and influenced the themes of much of her later work deathedit in  jackson died of heart failure in her sleep at her home in north bennington at the age of  she was overweight and a heavy smoker who had for years suffered health issues related to the two issues near the end of her life jackson was seeing a psychiatrist for severe anxiety which had kept her housebound for nearly the whole of the previous year the doctor prescribed barbiturates at that time considered a safe harmless drug for many years prior she also had periodic prescriptions for amphetamines for weight loss which may have inadvertently aggravated her anxiety leading to a cycle of prescription drug abuse using the two medications to counteract each others effects any of these factors or a combination of all of them may have contributed to her declining health and early death workedit jacksons most famous story the lottery first published in the new yorker on june   established her reputation as a master of the horror tale the story prompted over  letters from readers many of them outraged at its conjuring of a dark aspect of human nature the critical reaction was unequivocally positive the story quickly became a standard in anthologies and was adapted for television in  her novel the haunting of hill house  is a highly regarded example of the haunted house story and was described by stephen king as one of the important horror novels of the twentieth century this contemporary

which reveals a secret sinister underside to a bucolic american village and for the haunting of hill house  which is widely considered to be one of the best ghost stories ever written in her critical biography of jackson lenemaja friedman notes that when the lottery was published in the june   issue of the new yorker it received a response that no new yorker story had ever received hundreds of letters poured in that were characterized by as jackson put it bewilderment speculation and oldfashioned abuse in the july   issue of the san francisco chronicle jackson offered the following in response to persistent queries from her readers about her intentions explaining just what i had hoped the story to say is very difficult i suppose i hoped by setting a particularly brutal ancient rite in the present and in my own village to shock the storys readers with a graphic dramatization of the pointless violence and general inhumanity in their own lives jacksons husband the literary critic stanley edgar hyman wrote in his preface to a posthumous anthology of her work that she consistently refused to be interviewed to explain or promote her work in any fashion or to take public stands and be the pundit of the sunday supplements she believed that her books would speak for her clearly enough over the years hyman insisted that the dark visions found in jacksons work were not as some critics claimed the product of personal even neurotic fantasies but rather comprised a sensitive and faithful anatomy of the cold war era in which she lived fitting symbols for a distressing world of the concentration camp and the bomb jackson may even have taken pleasure in the subversive impact of her work as revealed by hymans statement that she was always proud that the union of south africa

burlingame california an affluent middleclass suburb that would be featured in shirleys first novel the road through the wall  her relationship with her mother who could trace her family heritage to the revolutionary war hero general nathanael greene was strained as her parents had married young and geraldine had been disappointed when she immediately became pregnant with shirley as she had been looking forward to spending time with her dashing husband jackson was often unable to fit in with other children and spent much of her time writing much to her mothers distress when she was a teenager her weight fluctuated resulting in a lack of confidence after the family relocated to rochester new york shirley attended brighton high school and received her diploma in  she then attended the nearby university of rochester where her parents felt they could keep an eye on her she was not happy in her classes there and professors often judged her writing harshly so she transferred to syracuse university where she flourished creatively and socially while a student at syracuse jackson became involved with the campus literary magazine through which she met her future husband stanley edgar hyman who would become a noted literary critic after their marriage and brief sojourns in new york city and westport connecticut jackson and hyman settled in north bennington vermont where hyman became a professor at bennington college as jackson continued to publish novels and short stories for stanley j kunitz and howard haycrafts twentieth century authors  she wrote i very much dislike writing about myself or my work and when pressed for autobiographical material can only give a bare chronological outline which contains naturally no pertinent facts i was born in san francisco in  and spent most of my early life in california i was married in  to stanley edgar hyman critic and numismatist and we live in vermont in a quiet rural community with fine scenery and comfortably far away from city life our major exports are books and children both of which we produce in abundance the children are laurence joanne sarah and barry my books include three novels the road through the wall hangsaman the birds nest and a collection of short stories the lottery life among the savages is a disrespectful memoir of my children jackson and hyman were known for being colorful generous hosts who surrounded themselves with literary talents including ralph ellison they were both enthusiastic readers whose personal library was estimated at over  books they had four children laurence laurie joanne jannie sarah sally and barry who would come to their own brand of literary fame as fictionalized versions of themselves in their mothers short stories according to jacksons biographers the marriage was plagued by hymans infidelities notably with his students he controlled most aspects of their relationship she was required to accept his infidelities he called her a fool when she expressed her intense dislike of the situation he controlled their finances meting out portions of her earnings to her as he saw fit despite the fact that after the success of the lottery and later work she earned far more than he did he insisted that she raise the children and do all the mundane household chores she felt patronized in her role as a faculty wife and ostracized by the townspeople of north bennington her dislike of this situation led to her increasing abuse of alcohol tranquilizers and amphetamines and influenced the themes of much of her later work deathedit in  jackson died of heart failure in her sleep at her home in north bennington at the age of  she was overweight and a heavy smoker who had for years suffered health issues related to the two issues near the end of her life jackson was seeing a psychiatrist for severe anxiety which had kept her housebound for nearly the whole of the previous year the doctor prescribed barbiturates at that time considered a safe harmless drug for many years prior she also had periodic prescriptions for amphetamines for weight loss which may have inadvertently aggravated her anxiety leading to a cycle of prescription drug abuse using the two medications to counteract each others effects any of these factors or a combination of all of them may have contributed to her declining health and early death workedit jacksons

university where she flourished creatively and socially while a student at syracuse jackson became involved with the campus literary magazine through which she met her future husband stanley edgar hyman who would become a noted literary critic after their marriage and brief sojourns in new york city and westport connecticut jackson and hyman settled in north bennington vermont where hyman became a professor at bennington college as jackson continued to publish novels and short stories for stanley j kunitz and howard haycrafts twentieth century authors  she wrote i very much dislike writing about myself or my work and when pressed for autobiographical material can only give a bare chronological outline which contains naturally no pertinent facts i was born in san francisco in  and spent most of my early life in california i was married in  to stanley edgar hyman critic and numismatist and we live in vermont in a quiet rural community with fine scenery and comfortably far away from city life our major exports are books and children both of which we produce in abundance the children are laurence joanne sarah and barry my books include three novels the road through the wall hangsaman the birds nest and a collection of short stories the lottery life among the savages is a disrespectful memoir of my children jackson and hyman were known for being colorful generous hosts who surrounded themselves with literary talents including ralph ellison they were both enthusiastic readers whose personal library was estimated at over  books they had four children laurence laurie joanne jannie sarah sally and barry who would come to their own brand of literary fame as fictionalized versions of themselves in their mothers short stories according to jacksons biographers the marriage was plagued by hymans infidelities notably with his students he controlled most aspects of their relationship she was required to accept his infidelities he called her a fool when she expressed her intense dislike of the situation he controlled their finances meting out portions of her earnings to her as he saw fit despite the fact that after the success of the lottery and later work she earned far more than he did he insisted that she raise the children and do all the mundane household chores she felt patronized in her role as a faculty wife and ostracized by the townspeople of north bennington her dislike of this situation led to her increasing abuse of alcohol tranquilizers and amphetamines and influenced the themes of much of her later work deathedit in  jackson died of heart failure in her sleep at her home in north bennington at the age of  she was overweight and a heavy smoker who had for years suffered health issues related to the two issues near the end of her life jackson was seeing a psychiatrist for severe anxiety which had kept her housebound for nearly the whole of the previous year the doctor prescribed barbiturates at that time considered a safe harmless drug for many years prior she also had periodic prescriptions for amphetamines for weight loss which may have inadvertently aggravated her anxiety leading to a cycle of prescription drug abuse using the two medications to counteract each others effects any of these factors or a combination of all of them may have contributed to her declining health and early death workedit jacksons

interests thus i am interested in the electronic optical magnetic and transport properties of novel semiconductor systems of special interest are the behavior of magnetic polarons in semimagnetic and dilute magnetic semiconductors and the optical response properties of semiconductor quantumwells and superlattices my interests also include quantum dots mesoscopic systems and the role of antiferromagnetic fluctuations in correlated d electron systems jackson joined the theoretical physics research department at att bell laboratories in  examining the fundamental properties of various materials she began her time at bell labs by studying materials to be used in the semiconductor industry in  jackson became part of the scattering and low energy physics research department and in  she moved to the solid state and quantum physics research department at bell labs jackson researched the optical and electronic properties of twodimensional and quasitwo dimensional systems in her research jackson has made contributions to the knowledge of charged density waves in layered compounds polaronic aspects of electrons in the surface of liquid helium films and optical and electronic properties of semiconductor strainedlayer superlattices on these topics and others she has prepared or collaborated on over  scientific articles jackson served on the faculty at rutgers university in piscataway and new brunswick new jersey from  to  in addition to continuing to consult with bell labs on semiconductor theory her research during this time focused on the electronic and optical
