are many providers of rich media marketing software the market for rich media marketing software is still in its infancy stage it is ripe to develop in the next  months due to changes in technology that greatly affect advertisement such as the release of apples ipad and the growing number smart phones entering the market the need for push technology over the web through email or through mobile device applications is rapidly growing competition in the markets is likely to remain intense but is expected to increasingly center on integrated rather than standalone applications software providers are continuously looking for third party resellers to add value to their products and increase their market share as a provider of wireless solutions bookedbyus has assessed its potential competitors based primarily on their functionality of wireless product the security and scalability of their architecture and industry focus due to our strong emphasis in the application software sector we have also compared ourselves to software providers focused solely in the software design sector focused providers these are companies that have built a wireless set of tools that attempt to address the needs of a specific vertical market currently most of the competition in this sector derive their revenue from infrastructure and ongoing professional services and build to a specific device type ieblackberry palm and pocketpc for these companies to adapt their offering to next generation devices would mean rearchitecting the way they conduct business and losing the infrastructure and professional services components of their business they have to date focused on financial institutions or carriers for penetration these include aligo infowave aether  and ianywhere our difference should come from our ability to support over  device types allowing us to go after the consumer application also application specific providers there are a number of sms and mobile phone download application providers in todays market including cellectivity mfuse and airborne entertainment these companies sell their applications and content and therefore are competing with the existing software providers our difference should be that we never produce content whether it is an edrive or idrive solution we provide the frame work application we focus exclusively on delivering content on behalf of our clients or partners therefore we should never compete against the companies that have an established client base in the internet market they become our partners and introduce us to that client base systems integrators custom solutions should still consume some of the wireless market share as large organizations continually try to build groundup solutions for each client under the assumption that wireless is easy and can be built without the aid of tools and wireless platforms these companies include ibm eds accenture bearing point and bea systems however these companies may also be potential clients and value added resellers of bookedbyus suite of products with any growing and expanding market bookedbyus also expects new competitors to emerge the wireless market is not expected to be any different particularly with the prevalence of open standards although various competitors have emerged the mobile application market is still in its infancy there are no dominant players that address our target market with these types of capabilities company description bookedbyus inc was incorporated in the state of nevada as a forprofit company on december   and established

settlement of liabilities and commitments in the normal course of business the company has a loss of  for the three months period ended november   and has a working capital deficit of  at november

that the company will need to curtail operations liquidate assets seek additional capital on less favorable terms andor pursue other remedial measures these unaudited interim financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   as at november   the company was not engaged in continued business and had significant operating expenses although management is currently attempting to implement its business plan and is seeking additional sources of financing there is no assurance the activity will be successful accordingly the company must rely on its president to perform essential functions without

 andor one or more affiliated funds to enter into coinvestment transactions with each other the investors and the affiliated funds seek relief to invest in coinvestment transactions because such coinvestment transactions would otherwise be prohibited by either or both of rule d and section a this application seeks relief in order to i enable the investors and affiliated funds to avoid among

requested in individual applications with respect to each coinvestment transaction that arises in the future and ii enable the investors and the affiliated funds to avoid the significant legal and other expenses that would be incurred in preparing such individual applications     a overview potential coinvestment transactions arise as a result of certain processes in place across the breadth of the apollo platform these processes are described below the advisers manage numerous private equity creditoriented capital markets and real estate funds and separate accounts with aggregate assets of  billion as of march   in order to manage the assets of those funds and separate accounts apollo global management llc and its affiliated companies employed over  investment professionals as of march   apollo global management llc and its affiliated companies other than the affiliated funds the closedend funds the aic funds and any portfolio companies thereof are referred to collectively as  apollo global management  the apollo funds are presented with thousands of investment opportunities each year the apollo platform through the aic funds the closedend funds and the affiliated funds offers a number of financing solutions  products   to prospective issuers of debt andor equity apollo currently maintains a separate investment committee with respect to each major product area for example there are currently  investment committees for capital markets products which is the group responsible for the aic funds and closedend funds each investment committee generally meets at least weekly to discuss the pipeline for that product area and considers investment opportunities for the funds and other accounts the members of that committee oversee    in general when an investment opportunity arises the opportunity receives an initial screen by the investment team assigned to the opportunity and if the opportunity survives the initial screen is subject to diligence and analysis if the opportunity has merit the investment team prepares and distributes an investment memorandum for review all of the portfolio managers in the apollo platform whose funds are eligible to participate in the investment opportunity are simultaneously notified of the investment opportunity and have access to the materials relating to the opportunity the appropriate investment committee or committees reviews and discusses the opportunity at the investment committee meeting following distribution of the investment memorandum investment committee meetings are generally held on a weekly basis all portfolio managers across the apollo platform may participate in any investment committee meeting to discuss an opportunity after discussion at the investment committee meeting the investment committee may take one or more actions in considering the investment opportunity which may include rejecting the opportunity outright requesting more information after which the opportunity is brought back to the investment committee for review again at a later date or approving the investment after approval of an investment opportunity portfolio managers interested in the opportunity for their clients submit allocation requests and traders coordinate consolidated orders across the platform    in connection with secondary market opportunities portfolio managers analysts and traders may also communicate such opportunities through email and a dedicated online chat room if a portfolio manager challenges an allocation amount or eligibility an allocation committee reviews the circumstances and other relevant factors and makes a final decision as a check on the process portfolio managers receive trade blotters at the end of each trading day to ensure coordination on buys and sells across the platform in addition the capital markets group holds weekly meetings which include capital markets management portfolio managers and business leaders to discuss opportunities and strategies investment updates are circulated to portfolio managers and investment ideas are discussed in various meetings as well as generally on the trading floor allocations are to the extent possible based on order size from the particular manager numerous factors enter into both a portfolio managers determination of the order size he or she desires and the investment committees and allocation committees allocations in the event the opportunity is of insufficient size to satisfy all requests these factors have been established by those governing bodies which have determined that the factors should be taken into account when determining allocations the current factors include i the relative exposure of any particular fund to the type of investment opportunity in terms of its existing investment portfolio ii relative exposure of the fund to market trends iii the investment objective of the fund iv permitted leverage and available financing for the investment opportunity including without limitation taking into account the levelsrates that would be required to obtain appropriate return v likelihood of current income vi size liquidity and duration of the investment opportunity vii seniority of loan and other capital structure criteria viii with respect    to an investment opportunity originated by a third party the relationships of a particular fund or the portfolio manager to such third party ix tax planning x regulatory concerns xi supply or demand for an investment opportunity at a given price level xii a funds risk or investment concentration parameters including without limitation parameters such as geography industry issuer volatility leverage and other similar risk metrics xiii whether the investment opportunity is a followon transaction as defined below and xiv such other criteria as are reasonably related to reasonable allocation of a particular investment opportunity to one or more clients as determined by the portfolio managers investment committees and allocations committees  eg  in the case of a fund rampup period or when establishing a particular investment strategy or product in addition the advisers allocation committees review each investors allocation policies and procedures from time to time the advisers compliance team reviews all allocation decisions retroactively and each appropriate allocation committee reviews all primary allocations and a sampling of secondary allocation decisions on a quarterly basis in the case of the aic funds the chief executive officer of aic or his designee is invited to attend all of the investment committees of all product areas for capital markets the chief executive officer of aic and the chief investment officer of aim or their designees collectively referred to as the executive officers  are included in the investment committee processes applicants note that the executive officers receive all relevant investmentrelated memoranda and material investment updates submitted to each applicable investment committee an executive officer also attends the weekly meetings that are held with the portfolio managers in the capital markets group where market information and specific investment ideas are discussed in addition one or both    executive officers have access to chat rooms and other forums to review discussions on potential transactions at the end of each trading day the executive officers receive trade blotters summarizing the relevant trade activity these investment information access approval and allocation processes are referred to collectively as the procedures   the president or chief investment officer of any closedend fund is involved in the investment committee processes in the same manner and takes part in all of the procedures as set forth above with respect to the aic funds applicants believe that the procedures that are used to notify the executive officers of each aic fund and their counterparts at any closedend fund of potential coinvestment transactions that fall within the thencurrent objectives and strategies  of each aic fund and each closedend fund are reasonably designed to ensure that an executive officer is notified of all potential coinvestment transactions that fall within the then current objectives and strategies of any aic fund or closedend fund that are considered by any investment committee of the advisers in connection with the allocation process the applicable adviser to each investor each an investor adviser  will then follow the conditions with respect to considering and if applicable investing in the potential coinvestment transaction aic or a closedend fund will only participate in potential coinvestment transaction if the board after appropriate consideration under the conditions approves it       objectives and strategies means i with respect to each bdc and closedend fund its investment objectives and significant strategies as described in its registration statement on form n other filings it has made with the commission under the securities act or under the securities exchange act of  as amended and its reports to stockholders and ii with respect to the aic downstream funds as described in the applicable disclosure documents andor operating agreements because such fund do not make public filings with the commission and for purposes of the order each as further defined by the board including a required majority of the board or the independent party respectively from time to time using objective criteria to focus the investment objective    for purposes of this application approval by aics and the closedend funds boards may be effected by a majority approval of the coinvestment approval committee which will consist of a required majority as defined in section o a required majority   of the directors of the board eligible to vote on that coinvestment transaction under section o the eligible directors   for purposes of the order the closedend funds will follow section o    with respect to the aic downstream funds their respective investment managers will independently analyze and evaluate each investment opportunity available to them to the extent required under the conditions each aic downstream fund will have a transaction committee or an advisory committee consisting either of aics board or of at least one member who is not affiliated with any aic fund closedend fund or affiliated fund or who is an individual otherwise unaffiliated with the aic downstream fund any closedend fund or apollo global management as defined below generally engaged by the aic downstream fund solely for the purpose of providing an independent role aics board or such individual the independent party  with veto power over investments with affiliated entities all coinvestment transactions between an aic downstream fund and a closedend fund and an aic downstream fund and an affiliated fund must be approved by the aic downstream funds independent party thus in a coinvestment transaction if the applicable investment manager determines that the opportunity is suitable for an aic downstream fund and an affiliated fund andor a closedend fund has confirmed its desire to also participate the investment manager will forward the opportunity to the aic downstream funds independent party for consideration       with respect to any coinvestment transaction among the aic funds no relief is required because the aic funds affiliation with each other results solely from aics control of the aic downstream funds as a result coinvestment transactions among the aic funds would be exempt from the affiliated transaction prohibitions of section a pursuant to rule b    coinvestment transactions will be effected under the conditions of the order however from time to time the advisers in consultation with the board of each investor the chief compliance officers of each investor and the advisers and counsel may modify the allocation policies and procedures of the apollo platform based on changes in apollos business or the regulatory framework in which apollo operates such changes will be designed to be consistent with the principle that senior advisory personnel of the investors including their controlled funds will be aware of all relevant potential coinvestment transactions considered by advisers across the apollo platform and be able to take appropriate action with respect to such opportunities aside from typical coinvestment transactions there may also be instances where one or more investors and one or more affiliated funds find themselves holding securities of the same class that were acquired through nonnegotiated transactions in the same portfolio company  but where the respective acquisitions of those investments did not implicate the joint transaction proscriptions of rule d or section a as applicable it is possible that one or more aic funds or one or more closedend funds and one or more affiliated funds may exit the investment or complete an additional investment in that portfolio company consisting of a debt or equity investment or warrants or the exercise of conversion privileges rights offerings call options or any other rights to acquire additional securities of or interests in the issuer in a manner where such additional transaction would otherwise be prohibited by either or both of rule d and section a as applicable as modified by the exemptive rules adopted by the commission      for this purpose a nonnegotiated transaction is a transaction in which no investor or affiliated fund participating in the transaction negotiates any of the terms of the security other than price and pricerelated terms such as interest rate or exercise price including but not limited to those transactions that qualify under rule a of the securities act secondary purchases of investments and syndicated investments    under the act any such exchange followon disposition or additional investment whether following a coinvestment transaction or a nonnegotiated transaction a  followon transaction    such followon transactions must be completed pursuant to the conditions determinations regarding when the investors and the existing affiliated funds will enter into a coinvestment transaction or complete a followon transaction are made by the specific funds investment adviser or manager or investment committee thereof  eg  the affiliated advisers make determinations for the existing affiliated funds and the investor advisers

arrangement under scrutiny is consistent with provisions policies and purposes of the  act and the extent to which such participation is on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants the commission has stated that section d upon which rule d is based and upon which section a was modeled was designed to protect investment companies from selfdealing and overreaching by insiders the commission has also taken notice that there may be transactions subject to these prohibitions that do not present the dangers of overreaching    the court of appeals for the second circuit has enunciated a like rationale for the purpose behind section d the objective of section d    is to prevent    injuring the interest of stockholders of registered investment companies by causing the company to participate on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of such other participants   furthermore congress acknowledged that the protective system established by the enactment of section  is similar to that applicable to registered investment companies under section  and rules thereunder but is modified to address concerns relating to unique

different for each applicant applicants submit that the formulae and procedures set forth as conditions for the relief requested herein are consistent with the range of investor protection found in the cited orders we note in particular that the coinvestment protocol to be followed by the applicants here is substantially similar to the protocol followed by medley capital corporation and its affiliates for which an order was granted on march   the medley order   to the extent the requested relief varies from the medley order the variations reflect the specific business necessities of apollo global management the aic funds and the affiliated funds as well as the greater complexity of their organization in general  applicants believe however that the relief requested herein is consistent with the policy underlying the medley order as well as coinvestment relief granted by the commission to other bdcs and to registered closedend funds   iii statement in support of relief requested in accordance with rule d made applicable to persons subject to sections c and d as modified by rule b by section i the commission may grant the requested relief as to any particular joint transaction if it finds that the participation of the investors or any person they control in the joint transaction is consistent with the      see note  supra     the medley platform includes two affiliated advisers of the bdcs adviser and four existing funds that are prohibited from completing joint transactions with the bdc whereas in the apollo platform there are over  affiliated advisers and over  existing affiliated funds    provisions policies and purposes of the act and is not on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants applicants submit that allowing the coinvestment transactions described by this application is justified on the basis of i the potential benefits to the investors and the shareholders thereof and ii the protections found in the conditions as required by rule db the conditions ensure that the terms on which coinvestment transactions may be made will be consistent with the participation of the investors being on a basis that it is neither different from nor less advantageous than other participants thus protecting the equity holders of any participant from being disadvantaged the conditions will ensure that all coinvestment transactions are reasonable and fair to the investors and their shareholders and do not involve overreaching by any person concerned including the investor advisers     a potential benefits in the absence of the relief sought hereby in many circumstances the investors would be limited in their ability to participate in attractive and appropriate investment opportunities section d section a and rule d should not prevent bdcs and registered closedend investment companies from making investments that are in the best interests of their shareholders each investor and its shareholders will benefit from the ability to participate in coinvestment transactions the board including the independent directors or independent party as applicable of each investor has determined that it is in the best interests of the investor to participate in coinvestment transactions because among other matters i the investor should be able to participate in a larger number and greater variety of transactions ii the investor should be able to participate in larger    transactions iii the investor should be able to participate in all opportunities approved by a required majority or otherwise permissible under the order rather than risk underperformance through rotational allocation of opportunities among the investors iv the investor and any other investors participating in the proposed investment should have greater bargaining power more control over the investment and less need to bring in other external investors or structure investments to satisfy the different needs of external investors v the investor should be able to obtain greater attention and better deal flow from investment bankers and others who act as sources of investments and vi the conditions are fair to the investors and their shareholders     b protective representations and conditions the conditions ensure that the proposed coinvestment transactions are consistent with the protection of each investors shareholders and with the purposes intended by the policies and provisions of the act specifically the conditions incorporate the following critical protections i in each coinvestment transaction all investors participating in the coinvestment transactions will invest at the same time except that the settlement date for an affiliated fund in a coinvestment transaction may occur up to  business days after the settlement date for the investor and vice versa for the same price and with the same terms conditions class registration rights and any other rights so that none of them receives terms more favorable than any other ii a required majority or the independent party as applicable of each investor must approve various investment decisions with respect to such investor in accordance with the conditions and iii the investors are required to retain and maintain certain records    other than pro rata followon transactions as provided in conditions  and  and after making the determinations required in conditions  and a the investor advisers will present each potential coinvestment transaction and the proposed allocation to the eligible directors or independent party as applicable and the required majority or independent party as applicable will approve each coinvestment transaction prior to any investment by the participating investor with respect to the pro rata followon transactions provided in conditions  and  an investor may participate in a pro rata followon transaction without obtaining prior approval of the required majority or independent party as applicable if among other things i the proposed participation of each investor and any affiliated fund in such followon transaction is proportionate to its outstanding investments in the securities that are the subject of the followon transaction immediately preceding the followon transaction and ii the board or independent party as applicable of the investor has approved that investors participation in pro rata followon transactions generally as being in the best interests of the investor if the board or independent party as applicable does not approve such pro rata participation any such followon transaction will be submitted for consideration to the investors eligible directors the board of any investor may at any time rescind suspend or qualify its approval of pro rata followon transactions with the result that all followon transactions by that investor must be submitted to the eligible directors or independent party as applicable applicants believe that participation by the investors in pro rata followon transactions as provided in conditions  and  is consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and will not be made on a basis different from or less advantageous than that of other participants a formulaic approach such as pro rata followon transactions eliminates the discretionary ability to make allocation    determinations and in turn eliminates the possibility for overreaching and promotes fairness applicants note that the commission has adopted a similar pro rata approach in the context of rule c which relates to the redemption by a closedend investment company of less than all of a class of its securities indicating the general fairness and lack of overreaching that such approach provides in sum the applicants believe that the conditions would ensure that each investor that participates in a coinvestment transaction does not participate on a basis different from except that the settlement date for an affiliated fund in a coinvestment transaction may occur up to  business days after the settlement date for the investor and vice versa or less advantageous than that of such other participants as a result applicants believe that the participation of the investors in coinvestment transactions done in accordance with the conditions would be consistent with the provisions policies and purposes of the act and would be done in a manner that was not different from or less advantageous than the other participants   iv conditions applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief shall be subject to the following conditions   the advisers will maintain policies and procedures reasonably designed to ensure that each investor adviser is notified of all potential coinvestment transactions that fall within the thencurrent objectives and strategies of any investor the investor adviser manages and that are considered by any investment committee of the advisers

determination of the appropriateness of the investment for the investor in light of the investors thencurrent circumstances           a if the investor adviser deems an investors participation in any potential coinvestment transaction to be appropriate for the investor it will then determine an appropriate level of investment for the investor     b if the aggregate amount recommended by the investor adviser to be invested in the potential coinvestment transaction by the participating investors and any participating affiliated funds collectively in the same transaction exceeds the amount of the investment opportunity the amount of the investment opportunity will be allocated among them pro rata based on the amount that each such party would have invested if the amount of the

information concerning the potential coinvestment transaction including the amount proposed to be invested by each investor and each participating affiliated fund to the eligible directors or the

participation in the potential coinvestment transaction a required majority or the independent party as applicable concludes that     i the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid are reasonable and fair to the investor and its equity holders and do not involve overreaching in respect of the investor or its equity holders on the part of any person concerned      ii the transaction is consistent with     a the interests of the investors equity holders and     b the investors thencurrent objectives and strategies     iii the investment by any other investors or

thereafter or less advantageous than that of any other investors or affiliated funds provided  that if any other investor or affiliated fund but not the investor itself gains the right to nominate a director for election to a portfolio companys board of directors the right to have a board observer or any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company such

the independent party as applicable will have the right to ratify the selection of such director or board observer if any      b the investor adviser agrees to and does provide periodic reports to the investors board or the independent party as applicable with respect to the actions of such director or the information received by such board observer or obtained through the exercise of any similar right to participate in the governance or management of the portfolio company and     c any fees or other compensation that any other investor or affiliated fund or any affiliated person of any other investor or affiliated fund receives in connection with the right of another investor or an affiliated fund to nominate a director or appoint a board observer or otherwise to participate in the

participating investors in accordance with the amount of each such partys investment and     iv the proposed investment by the investor will not involve compensation or remuneration to any adviser other than one controlled by an investor or any affiliated fund or the other investors or any affiliated person of any of them other than the      parties to the coinvestment transaction except a to the extent permitted by condition  b to the extent permitted by section e or k as applicable c indirectly as a result of an interest in the securities issued by one of the parties to the coinvestment transaction or d in the case of fees or other compensation described in condition ciiic  each investor has the right to decline to participate in any potential coinvestment transaction or to invest less than the amount proposed  each investor adviser will present to the board or the independent party as applicable of each investor on a quarterly basis a record of all investments in potential
