vice chancellor i introduction plaintiff pharmaceutical product development inc  ppd  brings this suit against the former stockholders of magen biosciences inc the magen stockholders  and magen s former ceo defendant brian gallagher seeking money damages incurred as a result of alleged breaches of contract and fraud in connection with ppd s april  acquisition of magen all three of ppd s counts center on magen s lead compound known as mag a vitamin d receptor modulator  vdrm  that magen allegedly represented to ppd as being  fold more potent than a vdrm currently fdaapproved and on the market to treat psoriasis this increased potency was allegedly important because it would allow mag to treat patients psoriasis without producing the serious side effects produced by existing drugs because of mag s possible increased potency it was hoped that patients could take less and get the desired result without the adverse side effects of existing treatment under the merger agreement to which they are a party the magen stockholders are jointly and severally liable for all losses subject to certain restrictions incurred by ppd resulting from any breach or inaccuracy of a representation or warranty of the company contained in the merger agreement      this opinion addresses the magen stockholders motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim under court of chancery rule b  compl ex a agreement and plan of merger april    merger agreement  § b  defendant gallagher has answered the complaint and has not moved to dismiss  in count one of the complaint ppd alleges that magen intentionally breached § b of the merger agreement that provides that the company magen has provided to ppd all information and data known to the company relating to safety efficacy and toxicity of all company products because it intentionally withheld certain scientific data and statements by magen researchers that showed that mag contrary to the representations made by magen during the time period before the execution of the merger agreement was barely if at all more potent than existing vdrms if this was so its prospects to be a more effective treatment for psoriasis were diminished count two is a claim for breach of contract again for breach of § b of the merger agreement count three is a claim for fraud against the magen stockholders and gallagher based on statements allegedly made by gallagher and others at magen regarding mag s purported potency statements that ppd learned after executing the merger agreement through its own research were materially false count three also alleges that gallagher and magen intentionally withheld material information regarding mag s potency ii standard of review in considering the magen stockholders motion to dismiss under rule b i apply a familiar standard that is i must determine whether in accepting all wellpled factual allegations in the complaint as true and drawing all reasonable inferences in  merger agreement § b emphasis added  ppd s favor ppd would be able to recover under any reasonably conceived set of circumstances susceptible of proof  iii counts one and two breach of contract survive the motion to dismiss because counts one and two are for intentional breach of contract and breach of contract respectively and further because both causes of action have at their core the requirement that ppd plead a breach of a contractual obligation i deal with both of those counts together in other words if i determine that ppd has pled a claim for intentional breach of contract it necessarily follows that ppd has also pled a claim for breach of contract ppd meets its pleading burden on counts one and two and therefore the motion to dismiss those counts is denied in order to state a claim for breach of contract ppd must allege i the existence of a contract ii the breach of an obligation imposed by that contract and iii that as a result of that breach ppd has suffered damages in order to allege that the breach was an intentional breach ppd need only allege in addition to those elements that the defendant committed a deliberate act which act constitutes in and of itself a breach of the contract even if breaching was not the conscious object of the act   in re gen motors hughes s holder litig  ad   del  see eg bakerman v sidney frank importing co  wl  at  del ch oct   noting that the elements of a breach of contract claim are the existence of a contract the breach of an obligation imposed by that contract and the resultant damage  hexion specialty chems inc v huntsman corp  ad   del ch  a breach of contract is intentional when the defendant commits a deliberate act that was in and of itself a breach of the contract  bakerman  wl  at   hexion  ad at  emphasis added   the only element at issue here is breach that is the parties argue over whether magen s allegedly intentional failure to disclose all of the information and data known to it regarding the potency of mag is covered by the representation in § b of the merger agreement which requires that all information relating to    mag s efficacy has been provided to ppd as an initial matter i am not able to consider parol evidence where the language of the contract is clear if a contract is unambiguous i must give the language its ordinary meaning for the following reasons i find that the representation and warranty in § b is broad enough to have required that magen disclosed the information identified in the complaint relating to the potency of mag that was allegedly not disclosed or put in terms of the magen stockholders motion to dismiss i find that ppd s complaint and the language in § b supports a reasonable inference that information regarding mag s potency is related to its efficacy the magen stockholders argument in support of its motion is stark in their view the contractual term efficacy has no relationship to mag s potency it is further the magen stockholders view that it is indisputably clear that the term efficacy in § b is used in its most narrow chemical sense and does not refer at all to how efficacious a drug would be or could potentially be in actually treating a real human s condition as a matter of linguistics i am asked to conclude that the more common usage of the term as embodying something that actually works well and that has a  merger agreement § b allied capital corp v gcsun holdings lp  ad   del ch nov    id  see def op br at  arguing that ppd is seeking to impermissibly conflatee the two separate concepts of efficacy and potency   comparative aspect must be ruled out in fact the magen stockholders go so far as to argue that magen could not have provided ppd with any information relating to mag s efficacy because there was no information in existence that related to mag s efficacy at the time the merger agreement was negotiated and executed according to the magen stockholders information about a drug s efficacy can only be obtained from clinical trials performed on humans no clinical trials have been performed on mag for the simple reason that as an experimental compound it would need to pass several additional tests before expensive human trials would be conducted efficacy means the power or capacity to produce a desired effect  but in a broader more medical sense efficacy is also defined as the ability of a drug to produce the desired therapeutic effect or the ability of an intervention to produce the desired beneficial effect    under ideal circumstances  i am cognizant of the fact that a scientist might argue that in the strictest and narrowest of biological senses efficacy only refers to the ability of a given molecule such as mag to seek out bind to its target receptor in this case the vitamin d receptor and react in such a way as to alter a particular biological pathway in a manner that treats or cures a condition or in other words the scientist might say that efficacy means that if two drugs with different potencies drugs a and b both do xyz when ingested in sufficient quantities where  see merger agreement schedule of exceptions for §   no clinical studies have been performed with mag   american heritage dictionary of the english language  th ed  see also merriamwebster available at httpwwwmerriamwebstercomdictionaryefficacy defining efficacy to mean the power to produce an effect   free online medical dictionary available at httpmedicaldictionarythefreedictionarycomefficacy emphasis added  xyz are physiological responses occurring at a molecular level that may be measurable on a macro level in varying degrees drugs a and b have equal efficacies or are equally efficacious putting this in terms of the complaint mag and the leading vdrm already fdaapproved and on the market dovonex® both treat psoriasis by seeking out and binding with vitamin d receptors and thereby causing some sort of biological response at the molecular level which is visible to the human eye in the form of healthier skin in the narrow biological sense just described then a biologist as the magen stockholders appear to do might argue that mag and dovonex® are equally efficacious in treating psoriasis but that argument overlooks a reality vital to the magen s stockholders motion to dismiss that even in its most technical sense efficacy does in fact relate to potency indeed pharmacology textbooks invariably consider a drug s efficacy alongside a drug s potency the relative amount of drug needed to produce a given response  that is as much as efficacy means a drug s ability to produce a biological response by binding to certain target receptors in the body potency in scientific terms measures a drug s affinity for those same target receptors a more potent drug therefore will produce a given effect but requires less of the drug to do so because the more potent drug  see generally richard a harvey  pamela c champe pharmacology  th ed lippincott williams  wilkins  observing that two drugs that have varying potencies can nonetheless at appropriate dosages have the identical efficacy because efficacy is the ability of a drug to elicit a physiological response when it interacts with a receptor   gary c rosenfeld  david s loose pharmacology  th ed lippincott williams  wilkins  see also richard a harvey  pamela c champe pharmacology  th ed lippincott williams  wilkins   potency is a measure of the amount of drug necessary to produce an effect of a given magnitude   gary c rosenfeld  david s loose pharmacology  th ed lippincott williams  wilkins   is more attracted to the target receptors than its less potent counterpart in fact pharmacology textbooks explain that a drug s efficacy is dependent on the number of drugreceptor complexes formed  it does not take a phd in molecular biology to understand that the greater an affinity a drug has for its receptor ie the more potent the drug is the greater the number of drug molecules in a fixed set will seek out and bind their target receptors ie the more efficacious the drug will be that reality in itself makes it improper to rule for the magen stockholders now because that reality seems to imply that the two characteristics efficacy and potency are not only related but in a way integrally linked but the magen stockholders restrictive view that efficacy has no relation to potency fails at this plaintifffriendly pleading stage for another more common sense reason that is it ignores the reality that when people outside the laboratory eg a treating physician speak about a drug s efficacy and compare it to other drugs efficacies they talk about it in a way that relates not just to a given drug s ability to produce the physiological response on its most basic and molecular level but instead in a way that gives credence to a drug s many other attributes including its potency and what repercussions both positive and negative a drug s potency may have  indeed researchers themselves strive for more efficacious treatments ones that do the trick  richard a harvey  pamela c champe pharmacology  th ed lippincott williams  wilkins   id emphasis added  although it would admittedly help  cf treatment and drugs the mayo cliniccom  available at httpwwwmayocliniccomhealthmigraineheadachedsdsectiontreatmentsanddrugs explaining and recommending certain migraine medications on the basis that certain drugs are more effective and have fewer side effects   the best in fact even chemists likely do this as they seek to develop more efficacious drugs ones that have the desired effect but at the lowest cost both in terms of side effects and economics for instance it may well be that an explorer discovers a tree in the rain forest that if eaten in its entirety by an infant is effective to cure childhood leukemia of course if an infant was ever able to ingest an entire tree it would most likely die if not from the volume then from the other toxins found within the tree but the fact remains that eating the tree would be effective in curing childhood leukemia because the tree contains just enough of a miracle compound if a doctor told worried parents that eating an entire tree would be efficacious to cure their beloved child s cancer the doctor would rightly receive a rather hostile reaction the same would be true if a dermatologist offered his pimply patient a bottle of concentrated hydrochloric acid to cure his acne assuming there was a metal bottle with the anticorrosive properties to contain it these examples show that when one speaks about a new drug s efficacy efficacy usually means something more than the drug s theoretical ability to achieve the desired  see eg remington the science and practice of pharmacy  david b troy ed lippincott williams  wilkins st ed  observing that drug discovery and research is in response to either an unmet clinical need or the replacement of established therapies in favor of a newer modality that is safer and more efficacious   see eg thomas l lemke  david a williams foye s principles of medicinal chemistry  th ed lippincott williams  wilkins  observing in a discussion of drug discovery that advantages to testing certain metabolites of already known chemical compounds include the prospect of obtaining a drug with less toxicity with fewer side effects  stuart o schweitzer pharmaceutical economics and

drugs may produce the same level of benefit only one does so at a lower cost than the others   therapeutic or physiological response this case presents a typical example of how this plays out in the real world albeit in a commercial setting ppd s complaint paints a picture of a vdrm market with two players dovonex® and vectical® both topical creams both are efficacious in treating psoriasis but both also suffer from a drawback familiar to anyone who has ever been prescribed a drug they both have side effects specifically each can cause a toxic increase in blood calcium levels known as hypercalcemia ppd alleges that magen s sales pitch centered on mag s ability to treat psoriasis just like the other vdrms already on the market dovonex® and vectical® but could do so with a fraction of the amount of dosing because mag is much more potent that increased potency was important to ppd for two reasons which are understandable to even a lay person like myself the first is obvious that a more  although recourse to extrinsic evidence is generally not appropriate in interpreting an unambiguous contract that does not mean that the court must be blind to the general business context in which a given contract was negotiated given the reality that the same word can have more than one general meaning and that the commercial context can influence which meaning the parties intended the court must take cognizance of the existence of those general meanings in determining whether a contract has only one plausible meaning see usa cable v world wrestling fed n entm t inc  ad   del

amount of medicine a person has to consume or apply to one s body in order to benefit ie in order for the drug to be effective at curing or treating the ailment the second reason that increased potency is desirable as noted in the complaint is because the less medicine a person must ingest the fewer or less severe the drug s unwanted side effects will be would it be outlandish for a doctor in treating an elderly patient to recommend mag over dovonex® as being more efficacious in treating that patient s psoriasis because i the elderly patient will not have to remember to apply the cream every four hours like dovonex® but instead can apply less of the more potent mag only once a day and ii the elderly patient will not suffer or will suffer far fewer toxic side effects would it be outlandish that businesses like magen and ppd which were engaged in developing marketable pharmaceutical products would use efficacy in this broader sense more like a physician than a blinkered chemist the answer to these questions seems to be no at the pleading stage it is how we the collective term used to refer to everyone that does not wear a lab coat to work each day talk and moreover think about what it means for a drug to be effective or efficacious to treat our ailments it is the reason why we laugh when we think about drinking an entire swimming pool worth of water to cure a hangover or taking care of an unsightly wart with a rusty jigsaw those treatments may be effective but most of us would desire a less potent more efficacious alternative  by way of another example if one drug was effective at dealing with arthritis and could be taken once a week it might be in practical terms more efficacious than another drug that had to be taken four times daily the more complicated the pill regimen the more likely it is that patients eg the elderly will fail to follow that regimen  to argue as the magen stockholders here do that potency indisputably has nothing to do with efficacy ignores that reality they go as far to argue that one cannot even measure a new drug s efficacy unless and until clinical trials on humans are performed of course were that the case the representation concerning efficacy contained in § b would be entirely meaningless as no clinical studies on mag have ever been performed that is problematic for the magen stockholders for a number of reasons one is a legal reason because sophisticated contracting parties usually want the words they use to mean something courts generally do not read contracts in a way that would render portions of it meaningless the other reason is that magen knew when it was searching for a new vdrm that the drug market already had two fdaapproved drugs both vdrms that treated psoriasis it costs an enormous amount of money for a drug company to discover and then test a new drug like mag magen knew that the reason mag was worth pursuing in the sense that magen scientists conducted what seems from the complaint to have been extensive research on its potency and other characteristics was not just because mag was efficacious to treat psoriasis in the mundane and technical sense that mag treats psoriasis just as well  pharmathene inc v siga techs inc  wl  at  del ch jan   citing sonitrol holding co v marceau investissements  ad   del   according to two  studies conducted by the pharmaceutical manufacturers association of america it takes on average  years and costs an average of  million to develop a new drug remington the science and practice of pharmacy  david b troy ed lippincott williams  wilkins st ed  citing pharmaceutical manufacturers association  report increased length and complexity of the research and development process washington dc pharmaceutical manufacturers association  report incentives to discover new medicines pharmaceutical patents washington dc moreover only  in  prescription drugs generate revenues that either meet or exceed the average research and development costs of developing an fdaapproved prescription drug id  as dovonex® or vectical® we have a name for drugs that do exactly what other drugs do generics but magen did not just see mag as a generic capable of bringing about exactly the same physiological response as dovonex® or vectical® instead it researched mag extensively because it believed and allegedly represented to ppd that mag was special and had commercial value because its outstanding potency would set it apart from the already existing drugs like dovonex® in other words magen hoped that somewhere some day doctors by the thousands might reach past the tubes of dovonex® for a smaller tube of mag while explaining to their patients that due to its increased potency and reduced instance of side effects mag would be a more effective or efficacious treatment for that pesky psoriasis again the complaint supports the reasonable inference that that was also ppd s reason for acquiring magen and its mag compound buttressing my conclusion that potency does in fact relate to efficacy is the fact that our courts have considered the connector relating to to be paradigmatically broad  such that at this plaintifffriendly stage it would be imprudent to grant the motion to dismiss under the magen stockholders narrow view of what the word efficacy means in the merger agreement a view that again renders any inclusion of the term efficacy mere surplusage additionally it is not clear to me that the magen stockholders citation to judge meanor in united states v cibageigy corp helps the magen stockholders any judge meanor s lawtrained scientific ie oxymoronic   lillis v att corp  ad   del ch  united states v cibageigy corp  f supp  dnj   observation even if correct and even if applicable in all contexts including a commercial contract as here that knowledge of potency does not imply anything about efficacy  does not necessarily mean that a drug s potency has no relation to no bearing on or does not pertain to a drug s efficacy that is two independent metrics might still relate to each other for all of these reasons i find that ppd s breach of contract claims based on the representation and warranty contained in § b of the merger agreement survive the motion to dismiss in doing so i am cognizant of the fact that the phrase relating to    mag s efficacy may well be ambiguous because it could be susceptible to more than one reasonable meaning but the magen stockholders do not argue at least in their motion to dismiss that an ambiguity exists instead they argue the opposite that § b is so clear on its face that the complaint must be dismissed for failure to state a claim it is not at least in the narrow sense that the magen stockholders advocate  cibageigy

stockholders also move to dismiss count three for fraud the only viable ground for dismissal is that the magen stockholders limited their duty in the merger agreement to indemnify ppd for any fraud committed by magen and defendant gallagher to representations and warranties contained in the merger agreement ppd disclaims any intent to hold the magen stockholders responsible for fraud except to the extent that the alleged fraudulent misrepresentations and omissions also constitute a breach of the representation and warranty in § b of the merger agreement the magen stockholders based their motion to dismiss count three on the ground that the complaint does not state a claim for breach of § b of the merger agreement in other words the magen stockholders argue again that information about mag s potency does not relate to efficacy such that any alleged fraud with respect to  iv it is premature to rule on what damages ppd may recover in a procedurally interesting maneuver the magen stockholders seek to dismiss a portion of the damages claimed by ppd in its complaint ppd seeks the following damages i  million ppd paid to acquire magen ii approximately  million ppd spent on further research and development of mag before allegedly discovering the inaccurate information regarding its potency and iii approximately  million spent by ppd in winding down the acquired company formerly known as magen but renamed ppd dermatology inc the magen stockholders have not taken issue with the  million but instead focus solely on ppd s postacquisition expenditures of  million and  million the drug development costs  therefore to the extent that ppd has adequately pled damages for each of its counts which it has the only question raised by the magen stockholders attack is the ultimate amount if successful ppd will be entitled to recover the crux of the magen stockholders argument is that the merger agreement precludes recovery of certain categories of damages on any claim including claims for rescission on the basis of fraud specifically the magen stockholders point to § c which provides in all capital letters that in no event shall the indemnification mag s potency would be extracontractual and therefore outside the magen stockholders obligation to indemnify def op br at  but for purposes of the magen stockholders motion to dismiss i have found that potency may relate to efficacy and as a result that the complaint states a claim for fraud based on the falsity of the representation contained in § b of the merger agreement as such the magen stockholders motion to dismiss count three is denied  compl ¶¶     ppd seeks damages incurred as a result of the alleged breach of contract and fraud or in the alternative rescission of the merger agreement alongside restitution in the amounts noted compl at   obligations    cover or include x consequential incidental special indirect or punitive damages      in the magen stockholders view the drug development costs represent damages that are special consequential or both because even if purportedly foreseeable at the time of the alleged breach those amounts are not damages that were the necessary result of the alleged fraud and breach of contract general damages are defined as those as the law itself implies or presumes to have accrued from the wrong complained of for the reason that they are its immediate direct and proximate result or such as necessarily result from the injury or such as did in fact result from the wrong directly and proximately and without reference to the special character condition or circumstance of the plaintiff  consequential damages in turn are defined as damages that do not flow directly and immediately from the act of the breaching party but only from some of the consequences or results of such act  but were nonetheless reasonably foreseeable or contemplated by the parties at the time the contract was entered into as a probable result of a breach  special damages are similar to consequential damages in that special damages are those which are the actual but not the necessary result of the injury complained of and which in fact follow it as a natural and proximate consequence in the particular case that is by reason of special  merger agreement § c def op br at   black s law dictionary  th ed  citing myers v stephens  calrptr   cal dist ct app

circumstances or conditions  the parties and the authorities seem to agree that consequential and special damages are in large part synonymous as discussed at oral argument § c s laundry list of precluded damages might have been put in the merger agreement by lawyers who themselves were unclear on what those terms actually mean this is not surprising in light of the amorphous state of the law and its confusing efforts to clearly delineate the difference between general damages on the one hand and consequential or special damages on the other i must however endeavor to give the categories of damages in § c meaning as judge cardozo explained and is still true many years later at the root of the problem is the distinction between general and special damages as it has been developed in our law there is need to keep in mind that the distinction is not absolute but relative to put it in other words damage which is general in relation to a contract of one kind may be classified as special in relation to another  judge cardozo s observation that the distinction between general and special damages is a contextual one takes on added importance at the pleadings stage where all that

twin coach i am chary to make the contextspecific determination about the drug development costs given the necessarily limited record for one thing it is not at all obvious especially at the pleadings stage that the  million spent on further researching and developing mag is unique to ppd in the sense that it seems reasonable to infer that any acquiring drug company in ppd s position would want and most likely need to continue investing resources in the research and development of the acquired experimental compounds that were the reason the acquirer purchased the company the situation with respect to the  million allegedly spent in winding up ppd dermatology inc is similar in that it seems plausible that a close down of ppd dermatology inc was the only logical step available to ppd who
