with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since  from an investment perspective our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets we prefer equities over credit and credit over rates but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given  elevated valuations  limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and  limits to economic growth potential broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt in some respects our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into  the key difference for  revolves around four emerging transitions populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy and concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for deregulation transition will be an evolving theme in  and we will be revisiting it in our publications throughout the year in this investment outlook we highlight specific signposts we will be watching both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key investment questions three key questions is it time to derisk is it time

volatile markets create opportunities for more dynamic investment strategies view more     transitions we’re watching in  globalism to populism the biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend stagnation to inflation we expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the us monetary to fiscal policy the focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability regulation to deregulation we see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive deregulation  gdp forecasts by country region and market  we expect the prolonged expansion phase of the growth cycle to

we think growth is poised to broaden out to more countries with the global economy drawing on more sources of strength than at any point since  from an investment perspective our base case view is broadly supportive for risk assets we prefer equities over credit and credit over rates but we expect low returns from these traditional exposures given  elevated valuations  limited upside for corporate earnings from current levels and  limits to economic growth potential broadening exposure beyond conventional stocks and bonds identifying opportunities in emerging markets and deploying more dynamic asset allocation strategies are some ways to adapt in some respects our outlook represents an extension of the same long cycle we envisioned heading into  the key difference for  revolves around four emerging transitions populism is challenging globalism and creating new tail risks concerns about low growth are giving way to concerns about inflation years of focus on monetary policy are giving way to a close watch over fiscal policy and concerns about new regulation are acceding to hopes for deregulation transition will be an evolving theme in  and we will be revisiting it in our publications throughout the year in this investment outlook we highlight specific signposts we will be watching both to gauge the pace of transition and to test our base case view on the key

of underinvestment and stalled growth— socalled secular stagnation—are overdone view more where do we see opportunities where do we see opportunities in a lowreturn world we look for sources of return beyond conventional stock and bond market approaches we also think rangebound or volatile markets create opportunities for more dynamic investment strategies view more     transitions we’re watching in  globalism to populism the biggest transition in the current environment is a shift away from globalism to a rising populist trend stagnation to inflation we expect concerns around potential secular stagnation to give way to a more inflationary paradigm in the us monetary to fiscal policy the focus for stimulus is shifting toward fiscal spending as central banks are stretching toward the limits of their easing ability regulation to deregulation we see the potential for greater regulatory divergence globally and the potential for competitive deregulation  gdp forecasts by country

                   estimates only  do not use for tax reporting purposes this table provides estimates of the funds distribution sources at the time of payment and should not be relied upon or used for tax planning or tax reporting purposes a return of capital occurs when a portion of the money that you invested is paid back to you and should not be confused with “yield” or “income” the source of all distributions paid by the fund including net investment income is subject to change this is because the fund primarily invests in real estate investment trusts reits and similar companies distributions from reits are attributed to various sources including net investment income capital gains and return of capital the estimate shown above is based on the prior year breakdown of the distributions from the reit securities held by the fund the fund generally will receive from these companies a final determination as to the source of distributions early next year income as determined under federal income tax regulations differs from gaap as a result distributions are subject to recharacterization for federal income tax purposes as the fund has a capital loss carryover any distribution paid to shareholders that exceeds the total of the fund’s investment company taxable income must be characterized as ordinary income up to the amount of the fund’s net capital gain realized during the calendar year this would cause a distribution that is classified as a return of capital under gaap to be reported as ordinary income for tax purposes the final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after yearend and reported to you on form div and these final amounts may vary significantly from the estimates provided above form div which is mailed after the close of the calendar year will specify how the distributions paid by the fund during the year should be characterized and reported on your tax return eg ordinary income return of capital and capital gain important information not fdic insured • may lose value • no bank guarantee expense ratios as disclosed in the fund’s most recent annual report to stockholders dated december   expense ratios are net of waivers andor reimbursements portfolio holdings are subject to change without notice the mention of specific securities is not a recommendation or solicitation for

nyse generally  pm eastern time on each day the nyse is open for trading distribution rate is calculated dividing the last distribution paid per share annualized by the market price note that the number of income distributions is based on the fund’s distribution payment frequency ie monthly or quarterly a fund may pay distributions in excess of its net investment company taxable income and to the extent this occurs the distribution yield quoted will include a return of capital the estimated return of capital for each distribution is also available on this web site by clicking on the distributions tab on each fund’s landing page sec yield is calculated by dividing annualized net investment income per share during a day period by the maximum offering price per share as of the close of that period sec yield reflects the rate at which the fund is earning income on its current portfolio of securities since certain distributions received by the funds from real estate investment trusts reits may consist of dividend income return of capital and capital gains and the character of these distributions cannot be determined until after the end of the year the sec yield has been adjusted for the funds that invest significantly in reits based on estimates of return of capital and capital gains quarterly distribution per share is as of the most recent quarter  end the fund pays regular quarterly cash distributions to common shareholders at a level rate that may be adjusted from time to time based on the projected income of the fund the amount of quarterly distributions may vary depending on a number of factors including changes in portfolio and market conditions each fund’s distributions reflect net investment income and may also include net realized capital gains andor return of capital return of capital includes distributions paid by a fund in excess of its net investment income and such excess is distributed from the fund’s assets under federal tax regulations some or all of the return of capital distributed by a fund may be taxed as ordinary income in addition distributions for funds investing in real estate investment trusts reits may later be characterized as capital gains andor a return of capital depending on the character of the dividends reported to each fund after yearend by reits held by a fund however please note that distributions are subject to recharacterization for tax purposes and the final tax treatment of these distributions will be reported to shareholders after the close of each fiscal year on form div risks of
