future performance anchor capital is not affiliated with barron’s in any way “price always matters” —william p rice jr the goal at anchor is to provide clients with a higherthanaverage stream of current income better returns in down markets and competitive returns over the course of a market cycle   our philosophy traditional value investing based on meticulous research we believe the best way to meet our clients’ goals is through traditional value investing that is based on meticulous research and picking individual stocks rather than try to match the performance of a benchmark we build our portfolios from stocks whose prices we believe do not reflect our analysis of their intrinsic value the companies we invest in can be in any industry or market sector as long as the stock is selling at a price that is attractive to us and has what we believe to be a welldefined path to reach fair value anchor portfolios are diversified but we view our rigorous security selection and monitoring discipline as our primary risk management tool value vs growth growth of a hypothetical  investment in  academic research predicts that value will have a longterm structural advantage over growth historical data confirm it source the graph is based on the historical data for their “ portfolios formed on size and booktomarket” data source

trading we determine a company’s value by inspecting the infrastructure examining the books and asking management the tough questions from this data we calculate an actual dollar figure for both the value of the company in the current market and the potential value assuming new product and management strategies are successful we continuously monitor our holdings and top candidates and recheck our calculations to ensure our investment thesis remains valid although our process is price sensitive our preference is to make longterm investments owning companies whose growth potential consistently
