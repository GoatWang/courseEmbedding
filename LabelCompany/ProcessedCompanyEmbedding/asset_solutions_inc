is extremely high many of our established competitors have developed a brand following which would make our potential customers prefer their office chair products over ours aggressive lower pricing tactics implemented by our competitors would make it difficult for us to continue to enter the market economies of scale would make it easier for our larger established competitors to negotiate price discounts with their suppliers of office chair products which would leave us at a disadvantage the principal competitive factors in our industry are pricing and quality of goods we will be in a market where we compete with many domestic and international companies offering similar products we will be in direct competition with them many large companies will be able to provide more favorable services to the potential customers many of these companies may have a greater more established customer base than us we will likely lose business to such companies also many of these companies will be able to afford to offer better price for similar product than us which may also cause us to lose business we foresee to continue to face challenges from new market entrants we may be unable to continue to compete effectively with these existing or new competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations asset solutions inc has entered the market and have one customer who has placed two orders for our products since we have entered the market we are one of many participants in the business of distributing office chair products many established yet well financed entities are currently active in the business of distribution such products nearly all asset solutions incs competitors have significantly greater financial resources
