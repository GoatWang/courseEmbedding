president  ceo of five star senior living meet bruce mackey president and ceo of five star senior living nyse fve mackey brought a background in accounting and reit management when he joined the national senior living provider in  as cfo he later worked with management to take the provider public became ceo in  and now with  communities under his leadership has not looked back we sat down with mackey in his newton massachusetts office to hear about how a celebrity chef is changing the face of five star’s dining platform the areas where senior living needs to look to its hotel counterparts for inspiration and why you should never walk away from a challenge what is your definition of leadership my definition of leadership is rising to lead to meet a challenge overseeing a group of individuals around a common cause and driving the mission forward do you think your definition of leadership has changed over the years no not really i don’t think my definition of leadership has really changed nor my style of leadership for the most part i’m a pretty collaborative leader i like to build a really good team around me this means consensus building to some extent as the decision maker with the final say i like to elicit opinions from the cadre of personnel i’ve built around me let’s talk a little bit about your history i couldn’t find too much about you before you came to five star i first worked for the illustrious firm of arthur andersen out of chicago i was mostly in real estate as a background and i had a client an individual i became close with who came over to this company called reit management they were a reit advisory group and were growing they oversaw two reits which basically means they were a bank they really didn’t deal a lot with the tenants they were building a portfolio of office properties so it went from collecting one rent check from a number of people to all of a sudden we had one building with  tenants that we needed to bill for i came over as controller for that entity almost  years ago so that’s why you can’t find a lot about me we built that company up when i joined them i think we had  billion of assets under management and today that entity has about  billion of assets under management in  the prospective payment system changed as we all know and that pretty much eradicated the skilled nursing industry one of the three healthcare reits at the time was a reit called senior housing properties trust the reit had  skilled nursing assets at the time the operation went into bankruptcy they were left with a number of choices and one of the choices they had was to create a company take those properties back out of bankruptcy turn them around stabilize them and spin that company off that’s what we did i joined five star as a cfo that was in  we soon took the company public and i’ve been doing it ever since five star senior living ◄ back next ► picture  of  what made you want to make the jump it’s obviously a big difference going from asset management into operations no question but it’s where the excitement happens it’s exciting to build a company if i go back  years there are not many opportunities like this where you’ve got a blank slate what do you want the payroll processes to be what do you want this process to be how do you want to do this and that… it was a wild opportunity and then to take it public and go out and sell it and nurture it and at the same time know that we want to shift the priorities of the company the first part was to stabilize it then spin it off but then shift the whole focus of the company we wanted to get out of the medicaremedicaid reimbursement business and end up in the private pay business what a great opportunity do you think you called it right the shift looking back no question about it the pressures that are around for medicaremedicaid have not gone away by any extent and will probably only continue to get tougher as the years go on looking at the entitlements from the taxpayer point of view it’s a tough nut to go after it’s scary yeah it is scary what’s the biggest risk you’ve taken in your career probably joining five star at the time i was married at the time and she was supportive of taking the job it’s funny i remember the day i joined five star my son was born on august   and i got the call august  actually it was in this office this was the former chairman’s office he said “we’re doing this thing called five star” were you expecting that call no it blew my mind how long did it take you to make your decision minutes like i said i remember the day like it was yesterday i went to a mexican restaurant with my wife we talked about it and the next day i came in and said “i’m in” and i never looked back looking back did you expect it to be as big as it is today no it’s tough to say when we started this company we were losing  a day every day our longterm prospects weren’t great to be in one of the top  players in the senior living space right now based on a number of metrics is pretty crazy when we started this company we were losing  a day every day our longterm prospects weren’t great to be in one of the top  players in the senior living space right now based on a number of metrics is pretty crazy so what’s the best piece of advice you’ve received in your career don’t walk away from a challenge who said thatmore from the leadership series april  james balda ‎president  ceo of argentumread moreaugust  mark parkinson president  ceo of american health care association and the national center for read more evrett benton he was the former ceo of five star it was kind of he and i who took the company public back in  evrett had a number of great sayings when he was at five star he is a great leader a really dynamic person very charismatic and can engage with anybody he just makes you feel part of the team right away “don’t walk away from a challenge” was always one thing he said did he say that to get you to come on board no the chairman was the one who called me then evrett called me right afterward and said “let’s go let’s do this it’s going to be a lot of fun” and threw all of his sayings at me… “use every quiver in my arrow” “get across the alligatorfilled swamp…” he would just throw a thousand at you evrett’s been gone from five star now about  years but we still have a lot of evrett stories a lot of “evrettisms” who do you consider to be your mentor how did that person help your career evrett to some extent when you birth a company and you spend that much time with individuals it’s easy how they can help shape you and guide you i talk about my leadership style and it really came from evrett evrett was great about identifying good people he was not the type to come in look at something and make a decision out of the blue because that was the way he wanted it he researched the facts he got opinions he had a discussion and came to a conclusion everything is going to be subject to change that’s what’s great things do change all the time less on the private side though right yes i think with the new competition now and the construction going on in the industry and just the fact that people are coming in later in life we’re course correcting right now as the next generation of customers is going to be more discriminatory of what they want and more vocal of what they want what would you say your greatest strengths are as a leader again consensus building is a big one probably upsets my team to some extent but i have a rock solid memory i don’t forget anything i’m not good at faces and names but if you told me that x y and z was going to happen by april  i’m going to remember that one i’m very good in that area also the ability to make decisions and course correct i think some leaders say “i made this call i’m going to stick with it” if you can’t course correct and adjust while you’re going along i think to some extent you’re going to run into problems some leaders say “i made this call i’m going to stick with it” if you can’t course correct and adjust while you’re going along i think to some extent you’re going to run into problems what’s your greatest weakness as a leader i have none laughs mentoring to some extent i think i’m a decent mentor but i don’t think i’m the best mentor i’m not the type of person to sit down on an annual basis and do a good review and fill out all the little boxes meets succeeds expectations goals i like to think i do it on the fly and maybe that’s not always the best way to do it to some extent i just don’t like doing it which could be a potential weakness five star and the dining evolution one of the areas you’ve been focusing a lot on is dining correct yes dining is a big thing for us we’ve partnered with a celebrity chef brad miller it’s been a huge change for five star last year we rolled out our chef culinary school which has been good i feel like you took a big bet when you hired the first celebrity chef to the industry tell me how that came about and why were you worried we weren’t worried but we wanted to do it better and we realized that our residents want good service and a good quality meal i think about what our residents complain about when we raise rates and when the food isn’t good other than that they don’t complain about much let’s take one of those issues off of the table and really provide them with a great product why are we doing this we are a forprofit company so ultimately we need to show growth in our bottom line we want to give our sellers something to sell what sets us apart from the competition and what gives people a reason to move into a community our biggest competitor as i’m sure everyone would say is people staying at home so what makes it exciting and different to move into a five star community we thought dining was a great place to start who walked in and suggested a celebrity chef it was a combination of scott herzig our coo and—believe it or not—our cfo at the time had formerly been cfo of longtime restaurant chain friendly’s and brought a huge dining background those are the two guys who came in to pitch it to me one day were you like “are you crazy” no i did think it was unique—crazy to some extent but not off the charts crazy the overriding mission is to improve our residents’ experience in our communities which ultimately leads to more resident referrals which ultimately leads to higher occupancy it was a good thing for us to try dining is important now but it’s just going to become more important down the road it’s taking a look at your restaurant where people have three meals a day or whatever it might be—and we know that’s important but we also want to bring a bistro over and sports bars to our communities in a community that we just redid in reno we included a sports bar you don’t see this in too many senior living communities what’s cool about this—not only that it’s a great amenity—is we implemented a point of sales system to really redo the whole dining experience this is an il building where we rent out the meal allowances when you go into the restaurant in  of senior living properties you know you’ve got two choices but here we’ve got a whole menu say you want to go to the pub instead of the main dining room you’ll pay over there grab n’ go has a full starbuckstype coffee menu you can go there and spend your money the whole point was to give our residents more options and that’s really what we’re preparing for on the dining side the next generation of senior living leaders say i’m about to graduate college what’s your pitch to me on why i should be in this industry my pitch would be “do you want to change people’s lives at a meaningful time” we do great things in our communities and i think the challenge we have as an industry is having people see that from a new college graduate’s point of view it’s hard work but it’s incredibly rewarding you’re building relationships that you’ll have your entire life has five star changed its strategies on how you’re starting to go after those types of people any new initiatives you’re working on we are and one that we’re launching is a glorified administrator trainingadministratorintraining program we’re really starting to ramp that up on the senior living side they’re pretty common on the skilled side so is that an executive director in training exactly we’re probably going to open up  positions here at five star it’s interesting i don’t know if there’s a good stat out there right now…for every hundred buildings how many really qualified eds are there it’s not  we know that’s the case is it  that means you are always  short of quality eds who can really do the job so we’re all pilfering off of each other to some extent that’s a benchmark right there i think our retention rate among eds is pretty good we have a pretty good benefits package we’re a growing and dynamic company we’re a company that does attract good quality people but we need to make sure we’re doing a better job of growing that next level of talent within five star up above the ed level up above the ed as well as the ed and below it’s really in all aspects i think there’s going to be a real shortage not just of eds down the line but of caregivers all around there’s a shortage right now how many buildings are in the pipeline a couple hundred i’m not sure what the exact number isbut there’s a lot out there it’s a hard position very hard position it goes back to why do you want to be in this industry if you’re a young kid coming out of college and we give you this building you’re the ceo of that building you can start small and work your way up that’s the good thing about five star we can have people go through this edintraining program we’re going to put you geographically across the country have you start with a smaller building and work up to one of our larger buildings and ultimately that becomes our regional oversight probably half of our regionals right now are former executive directors at five star communities so i think we’ve done a pretty good job in that regard it’s just getting that next cadre of eds ready i think we’ve got a lot more room for improvement do you think you can get that from the college graduates i think it’s definitely possible but i think as an industry—i’m a member of argentum too—we have to do something to get up there and promote certification isn’t going to get new people into the industry but it’s certainly going to get us out in front of potential regulatory matters i think it’s a good thing from a customer point of view if our eds are certified we’re just starting that at the argentum level one place i think argentum can help out as well as nic is to think about the hotel industry they’ve got hrta—hotel restaurant travel administration—courses across the country to some extent senior living has got to head in that direction future of five star let’s talk about the future of five star a little bit what are your plans for the next  months we’ll probably do a few more acquisitions we’ve got a number of developments that are in the pipeline that will be coming to fruition in the next quarter or two so getting those up and ready we’ll be starting a few other new developments we’ve got good access to capital at five star so we’re always investing in our communities we’re always looking at new developments we’re looking at improving our memory care platform we’ve got a bridges to rediscovery—it’s award winning tweaking that a little making sure it’s ready for that next wave of customers rolling out new customer service initiatives i talked about our new executive directorintraining programs can you tell me about your philosophy on technology what are you guys doing in that respect and is that a big part about the next  years for you it is our investment on the ehr side is going to be substantial we don’t cut corners when it comes to technology what would be an example of that if there’s a product out there that we think makes sense from a business point of view or resident point of view we’ll invest in it and we’ll do a good job at it all of our buildings are wireless right now i think we’re one of the first to put in hotellike kiosk computers it’s pretty neat you can walk into any one of our communities and there’ll be a computer station it’s not just a computer that’s plugged into a wall picture when you go to a courtyard by marriott you hit a login it’ll login when you’re done with your session or after a certain amount of time it’ll wipe everything out from that computer so that the residents can’t—for lack of a better word—screw it up or damage it it’s the same thing for the courtyard by marriott we partner with a company on the hotel side so they do all of our resident kiosks we’re leveraging technology from an operational point of view what’s your goal with ehr are you guys ahead of the game with that at least in the senior living space i think that’s right our goal with that is to improve our resident experience numbers of studies will show you that at least better clinical care is extremely important to us one of our pillars is improving our clinical care at all times the next big thing for this industry is going to be both on the skilled side as well as the senior living side and i’m not talking about al where do we fit in that accountability with acos having the data to support the work that we do in terms of improving people from a clinical point of view is going to be huge we have to be able to show that as an industry that you come out of a hospital and you go into one of our skilled settings or one of our als as opposed to going home we’re a cheaper alternative rather than going to a hospital and we’re going to reduce hospital readmission rates so we’re an important part of that chain this system is going to be a big piece of us getting there by shnleader michael grust ceo of senior resource group by shnleader meet michael grust ceo of solana beach californiabased senior resource group with a career that
