the night do you often wake up more tired than when you went to bed does sleep medication fail to give you the sleep you crave and leave you feeling drowsy the following day importance of sleep sleeplessness is more than just a hassle it can also be life threatening the national department of transportation estimates drowsy driving to be responsible for  fatalities and  nonfatal injuries annually in the united states a good nights sleep is critical to the maintenance of good health without it you increase your susceptibility to an array of health problems such as heart disease stroke diabetes obesity and depression insufficient sleep can also compromise your entire immune system you exercise in order to keep your immune system functioning at peak efficiency up but if you arent sleeping properly all that effort can be undone as the immune system works best when you get a good nights sleep you are not alone millions of people have searched tirelessly for a treatment that works only to become discouraged by traditional therapies that offer no real cure and which only disguise the symptoms insomnia and drugs oftentimes when a doctor hears a patient say i need something to help me sleep at night they immediately turn to the failsafe of modern western medicine — drugs prescriptions for sleeping medications in the us topped  million in  — a new record according to the research firm ims health up  from  while pharmaceuticals might help some people sleep at night the effects can be temporary for others drugs might not help them sleep at all this compounded with unwanted side effects can make a persons sleep problem worsen over time for people who have been taking drugs that help them sleep at night for many years it can feel like there is no way out you might fall into this category if you find yourself feeling like your sleep patterns have come unraveled and are begging for someone to help me sleep at night it might be time to consider an option that can help you restore a healthy natural sleep pattern ces and insomnia western medicines reliance on taking something to help restore balance means the introduction of medication the truth however is that when a drug is introduced into the body it only masks the real problem throwing your balance further out of whack this is the reason drugs often work well for a time only to have sleep problems later reappear often worse than they were initially drug therapy proves insufficient because the root of the sleeping problem has not been addressed this is because the natural rhythms and chemistry of the brain have been interrupted and replaced with whatever drug was introduced into that chemistry the chemicals act as a crutch for the brain which no longer can operate to its fullest capacity subsequently dosages have to be increased when sleep again becomes problematic however dosages have limits where they become unsafe when you reach this point you are back at squareone only far worse off than you were to begin with all of which leads to the question is there anything besides drugs that can help me sleep better that is where ces enters the picture people who have exhausted other methods to help them sleep are finding that ces was the answer they were seeking from the start there are a number of reasons why ces has proven successful for people with sleep deficiencies ces treats the causes of poor sleep rather than the symptoms ces uses the natural processes of the brain to reset your sleep clock thus reestablishing your natural sleeping rhythms ces has no known side effects ces helps the brain to function naturally without introducing a chemical cocktail ces relieves the symptoms caused by insomnia anxiety and depression ces uses a gentle electrical impulse applied to the ear lobes that is anatomically transferred to the brain the unit is handheld and is designed to be used at home best of all ces is far less expensive than the ongoing costs of drug prescriptions the us food and drug administration allows the medical claims of insomnia anxiety and depression for ces use anxiety and depression are two common triggers of insomnia or sleep problems in general depression and anxiety will begin to cause sleep problems in people who havent previously experienced difficulties with sleep a vicious cycle will often begin to take place in individuals whereby the more anxious a person becomes the more they suffer from sleep disorders the more one suffers from sleep disorder the more anxious one becomes and on and on the same is true of those who suffer from depression the challenge is to restore the natural rhythm of neurological patterns is established by restoring a chemical balance when this balance is working as it should sleep comes naturally when it ceases to function normally you lie awake in bed wondering will i ever have a good nights sleep the answer by allowing the brain to reset to its normal rhythms ces

metaanalyses a metaanalysis contrasts and combines the results from many different studies rather than relying on a single study to draw particular conclusions metaanalyses yielding positive results from the use of ces have been conducted at the university of tulsa and at the harvard university school of public health the major metaanalysis of the harvard school of public health which found that ces has a statistically significant effect on alleviating anxiety focused entirely on units using the configuration in the ces ultra eightyfive percent of the independent research on the efficacy of ces is based on the configuration of the ces ultra medical device other units on the market may have the same frequency but they do not measure up to the amplitude wavelength duty cycle and frequency found only in the ces ultra that means that while other companies may cite research studies those studies are often companybased and companyfunded and hence are not truly independent and fully objective only the ces ultra has the configuration that was used in independent universitybased studies additional resources i am quite familiar with research on ces having presented a paper on it to

well  licensed psychologistcanada research on depression depression is the state in which the individual feels sad helpless and disinterested in life clinical depression affects mood mind body and behavior depression is the most frequently seen psychiatric disorder among both hospitalized inpatients and those in outpatient psychiatric care research has shown that in the united states about  million peopleone in ten adultsexperience depression each year and nearly twothirds do not get the help they need there are many kinds of depression several with deep underlying psychiatric causes short of biochemical analysis however they are usually difficult to differentiate psychological testing can rate depressive states according to intensity but cannot differentiate causative factors despite the variations in etiology of depressive states however treatments are very similar context five studies employing three different measures and  different patients suffering from depression all were in treatment facilities either psychiatric or chemical dependency each of the studies was conducted under controlled conditions one doubleblind four singleblind graphical interpretation under each set of bars is the psychological test used to measure depression in each study including a general average of all results the red bar shows patients scores before using ces  the higher the bar the greater the depression the blue bar shows the level of depression after using ces results there have been three replications of findings on the profile of mood states depressiondejection factor and two replications using the zung selfrating depression scale pomsd and zsds respectively on the graph all yielded similar results the movement on the zsds scale is less because one study was for one week and the second for ten days the studies which ran over a span of three weeks however provide evidence of an even more dramatic decline in depression all three tests yielded congruent results  an average reduction of approximately  in the depression raw scores measured before and after ces treatment all types of depression responded dramatically to ces ces showed itself to be effective in treating the lighter reactive type within a week or ten days and the deeper seated variety in three weeks because those with deepseated depression tend to view ces as a modern miracle and expect instantaneous relief they can actually become more depressed initially while using ces unless the therapist specifically tells them that at least three weeks of treatment are required with this added clinical support even the most deepseated depressions responded well the study controlled for possible placebo effects did not show any there has never been a reduction in the scores of sham ces treated controls as in the anxiety studies while some depression studies were sacrificed in the attempt to discover how much treatment was necessary to correct the various intensities of depression there has never been a controlled scientific study in which ces was not shown to significantly improve reactive depression in a week to ten days and deepseated depression within three weeks all types of depression studied so far have responded dramatically to ces treatment research on anxiety introduction anxiety is defined as mental uneasiness or distress arising from fear of what may happen it has several different manifestations individuals suffering from panic disorder experience recurrent unexpected panic attacks those with generalized anxiety disorder gad chronically worry too much about a variety of things and experience symptoms such as restlessness agitation or feeling keyed up muscle tension fatigue irritability and trouble with concentration and sleep persons suffering from social anxiety disorder experience extreme fear and avoidance of social andor performance situations anxiety disorders as a group are the most common mental illness in america more than  million american adults are affected by these debilitating illnesses each year children and adolescents can also develop anxiety disorders anxiety is currently perhaps the most fashionable idiom in the parlance of american psychiatry and medicine it is used almost synonymously with stress which in turn has been associated with everything from increased risk of heart attack and cancer to the common cold the general consensus within the medical community is that anxiety can in many instances be a causative factor in physical illness as well as exacerbate it context seven separate studies of  hospitalized psychiatric inpatients all were controlled scientific studies employing measures of anxiety with known reliability and validity there are four replications using the state anxiety scale stais and three using the tensionanxiety factor on the profile of mood states pomsta most of the studies were for fifteen daysmonday through friday over a period of three weeks the tmas taylor manifest anxiety scale study was for ten days only and the ipat institute for personality and ability testing for six studies using the stais used five or six thirty minute sessions whereas one of the pomta studies used ces for thirty minutes a day over ten days and two others at a rate of one forty minute session per day for fifteen days ssfsfsfs graphical interpretation the red bar represents the patients scores on the anxiety measure before ces treatment pre the blue bar their score after ces therapy post results the findings of all tests conducted were consistent most patients responded positively to ces treatment within the first week or ten days the more entrenched forms of anxiety within ten days to three weeks resultant post ces test scores shows improvement ranging from approximately  percent to almost  percent the variation was due to different anxiety scales measuring different facets of anxiety only some of which are shared in common in one study investigators deliberately used patients with low suggestibility levels and compared them with those with high suggestibility levels no differences were found thus ruling out a placebo effect the net result of these studies shows ces to be a predictably effective treatment for anxiety and related disorders as measured by these scales there has never been a controlled study of anxiety in which ces patients did not improve more significantly than did the controls most recent studies braverman e smith r smayda r and blum k modification of p amplitude and other electrophysiological parameters of drug abuse by cranial electrical stimulation current therapeutic research   p waves have a reduced amplitude in many alcoholics which does not revert to normal even after continued abstinence  alcohol andor drug abusers and  staff controls were selected as they entered the clinic for a computerized eeg all were given  minutes of ces between pre and post eeg there were no significant changes in the controls following the ces the patients p amplitude increased significantly p the time went from a pretreatment of  to  msec posttreatment the amplitude dv went from pretreatment of  to  posttreatment also there were significant positive shifts in alpha delta theta and beta spectra in patients who were abnormal in one or more of these areas prior to ces treatment it was concluded that ces might be a significant nondrug treatment for the underlying electrophysiological disorder of the drug abuser because the normalization of these electrophysiological parameters are characteristic of

drugs ces vs tdcsquestions for you do you have trouble falling asleep and staying asleep do you wake up several times during the night do you often wake up more tired than when you went to bed does sleep medication fail to give you the sleep you crave and leave you feeling drowsy the following day importance of sleep sleeplessness is more than just a hassle it can also be life threatening the national department of transportation estimates drowsy driving to be responsible for  fatalities and  nonfatal injuries annually in the united states a good nights sleep is critical to the maintenance of good health without it you increase your susceptibility to an array of health problems such as heart disease stroke diabetes obesity and depression insufficient sleep can also compromise your entire immune system you exercise in order to keep your immune system functioning at peak efficiency up but if you arent sleeping properly all that effort can be undone as the immune system works best when you get a good nights sleep you are not alone millions of people have searched tirelessly for a treatment that works only to become discouraged by traditional therapies that offer no real cure and which only disguise the symptoms insomnia and drugs oftentimes when a doctor hears a patient say i need something to help me sleep at night they immediately turn to the failsafe of modern western medicine — drugs prescriptions for sleeping medications in the us topped  million in  — a new record according to the research firm ims health up  from  while pharmaceuticals might help some people sleep at night the effects can be temporary for others drugs might not help them sleep at all this compounded with unwanted side effects can make a persons sleep problem worsen over time for people who have been taking drugs that help them sleep at night for many years it can feel like there is no way out you might fall into this category if you find yourself feeling like your sleep patterns have come unraveled and are begging for someone to help me sleep at night it might be time to consider an option that can help you restore a healthy natural sleep pattern ces and insomnia western medicines reliance on taking something to help restore balance means the introduction of medication the truth however is that when a drug is introduced into the body it only masks the real problem throwing your balance further out of whack this is the reason drugs often work well for a time only to have sleep problems later reappear often worse than they were initially drug therapy proves insufficient because the root of the sleeping problem has not been addressed this is because the natural rhythms and chemistry of the brain have been interrupted and replaced with whatever drug was introduced into that chemistry the chemicals act as a crutch for the brain which no longer can operate to its fullest capacity subsequently dosages have to be increased when sleep again becomes problematic however dosages have limits where they become unsafe when you reach this point you are back at squareone only far worse off than you were to begin with all of which leads to the question is there anything besides drugs that can help me sleep better that is where ces enters the picture people who have exhausted other methods to help them sleep are finding that ces was the answer they were seeking from the start there are a number of reasons why ces has proven successful for people with sleep deficiencies ces treats the causes of poor sleep rather than the symptoms ces uses the natural processes of the brain to reset your sleep clock thus reestablishing your natural sleeping rhythms ces has no known side effects ces helps the brain to function naturally without introducing a chemical cocktail ces relieves the symptoms caused by insomnia anxiety and depression ces uses a gentle electrical impulse applied to the ear lobes that is anatomically transferred to the brain the unit is handheld and is designed to be used at home best of all ces is far less expensive than the ongoing costs of drug prescriptions the us food and drug administration allows the medical claims of insomnia anxiety and depression for ces use anxiety and depression are two common triggers of insomnia or sleep problems in general depression and anxiety will begin to cause sleep problems in people who havent previously experienced difficulties with sleep a vicious cycle will often begin to take place in individuals whereby the more anxious a person becomes the more they suffer from sleep disorders the more one suffers from sleep disorder the more anxious one becomes and on and on the same is true of those who suffer from depression the challenge is to restore the natural rhythm of neurological patterns is established by restoring a chemical balance when this balance is working as it should sleep comes naturally when it ceases to function normally you lie awake in bed wondering

scientific studies on ces the ces ultra stands apart from all other devices especially in the context of metaanalyses a metaanalysis contrasts and combines the results from many different studies rather than relying on a single study to draw particular conclusions metaanalyses yielding positive results from the use of ces have been conducted at the university of tulsa and at the harvard university school of public health the major metaanalysis of the harvard school of public health which found that ces has a statistically significant effect on alleviating anxiety focused entirely on units using the configuration in the ces ultra eightyfive percent of the independent research on the efficacy of ces is based on the configuration of the ces ultra medical device other units on the market may have the same frequency but they do not measure up to the amplitude wavelength duty cycle and frequency found only in the ces ultra that means that while other companies may cite research studies those studies are often companybased and companyfunded and hence are not truly independent and fully objective only the ces ultra has the configuration that was used in independent universitybased studies additional resources i am quite familiar with research on ces having presented a paper on it to my colleagues at an annual convention showing them how effective ces is in

technology used in the ces ultra is effective ces has also been shown to reduce muscular tension i often recommend it to patients who have been injured in automobile accidents as its gentle and relaxing effects help them to overcome not only the emotional impact of the accident but reduce their perception of pain as well  licensed psychologistcanada research on depression depression is the state in which the individual feels sad helpless and disinterested in life clinical depression affects mood mind body and behavior depression is the most frequently seen psychiatric disorder among both hospitalized inpatients and those in outpatient psychiatric care research has shown that in the united states about  million peopleone in ten adultsexperience depression each year and nearly twothirds do not get the help they need there are many kinds of depression several with deep underlying psychiatric causes short of biochemical analysis however they are usually difficult to differentiate psychological testing can rate depressive states according to intensity but cannot differentiate causative factors despite the variations in etiology of depressive states however treatments are very similar context five studies employing three different measures and  different patients suffering from depression all were in treatment facilities either psychiatric or chemical dependency each of the studies was conducted under controlled conditions one doubleblind four singleblind graphical interpretation under each set of bars is the psychological test used to measure depression in each study including a general average of all results the red bar shows patients scores before using ces  the higher the bar the greater the depression the blue bar shows the level of depression after using ces results there have been three replications of findings on the profile of mood states depressiondejection factor and two replications using the zung selfrating depression scale pomsd and zsds respectively on the graph all yielded similar results the movement on the zsds scale is less because one study was for one week and the second for ten days the studies which ran over a span of three weeks however provide evidence of an even more dramatic decline in depression all three tests yielded congruent results  an average reduction of approximately  in the depression raw scores measured before and after ces treatment all types of depression responded dramatically to ces ces showed itself to be effective in treating the lighter reactive type within a week or ten days and the deeper seated variety in three weeks because those with deepseated depression tend to view ces as a modern miracle and expect instantaneous relief they can actually become more depressed initially while using ces unless the therapist specifically tells them that at least three weeks of treatment are required with this added clinical support even the most deepseated depressions responded well the study controlled for possible placebo effects did not show any there has never been a reduction in the scores of sham ces treated controls as in the anxiety studies while some depression studies were sacrificed in the attempt to discover how much treatment was necessary to correct the various intensities of depression there has never been a controlled scientific study in which ces was not shown to significantly improve reactive depression in a week to ten days and deepseated depression within three weeks all types of depression studied so far have responded dramatically to ces treatment research on anxiety introduction anxiety is defined as mental uneasiness or distress arising from fear of what may happen it has several different manifestations individuals suffering from panic disorder experience recurrent unexpected panic attacks those with generalized anxiety disorder gad chronically worry too much about a variety of things and experience symptoms such as restlessness agitation or feeling keyed up muscle tension fatigue irritability and trouble with concentration and sleep persons suffering from social anxiety disorder experience extreme fear and avoidance of social andor performance situations anxiety disorders as a group are the most common mental illness in america more than  million american adults are affected by these debilitating illnesses each year children and adolescents can also develop anxiety disorders anxiety is currently perhaps the most fashionable idiom in the parlance of american psychiatry and medicine it is used almost synonymously with stress which in turn has been associated with everything from increased risk of heart attack and cancer to the common cold the general consensus within the medical community is that anxiety can in many instances be a causative factor in physical illness as well as exacerbate it context seven separate studies of  hospitalized psychiatric inpatients all were controlled scientific studies employing measures of anxiety with known reliability and validity there are four replications using the state anxiety scale stais and three using the tensionanxiety factor on the profile of mood states pomsta most of the studies were for fifteen daysmonday through friday over a period of three weeks the tmas taylor manifest anxiety scale study was for ten days only and the ipat institute for personality and ability testing for six studies using the stais used five or six thirty minute sessions whereas one of the pomta studies used ces for thirty minutes a day over ten days and two others at a rate of one forty minute session per day for fifteen days ssfsfsfs graphical interpretation the red bar represents the patients scores on the anxiety measure before ces treatment pre the blue bar their score after ces therapy post results the findings of all tests conducted were consistent most patients responded positively to ces treatment within the first week or ten days the more entrenched forms of anxiety within ten days to three weeks resultant post ces test scores shows improvement ranging from approximately  percent to almost  percent the variation was due to different anxiety scales measuring different facets of anxiety only some of which are shared in common in one study investigators deliberately used patients with low suggestibility levels and compared them with those with high suggestibility levels no differences were found thus ruling out a placebo effect the net result of these studies shows ces to be a predictably effective treatment for anxiety and related disorders as measured by these scales there has never been a controlled study of anxiety in which ces patients did not improve more significantly than did the controls most recent studies braverman e smith r smayda r and blum k modification of p amplitude and other electrophysiological parameters of drug abuse by cranial electrical stimulation current therapeutic research   p waves have a reduced amplitude in many alcoholics which does not revert to normal even after continued abstinence  alcohol andor drug abusers and  staff controls were selected as they entered the clinic for a computerized eeg all were given  minutes of ces between pre and post eeg there were no significant changes in the controls following the ces the patients p amplitude increased significantly p the time went from a pretreatment of  to  msec posttreatment the amplitude dv went from pretreatment of  to  posttreatment also there were significant positive shifts in alpha delta theta and beta spectra in patients who were abnormal in one or more of these areas prior to ces treatment it was concluded that ces might be a significant nondrug treatment for the underlying electrophysiological disorder of the drug abuser because the normalization of these electrophysiological parameters are characteristic of pharmaceutical treatment
