chicago and hilton garden inn title partner  how long have you been on the college of business cob national advisory board i joined the cob national advisory board in   please describe your career path after graduation constant after i graduated from msu i joined da davidson and took my series  i worked in a team environment with experienced brokers where i was able to learn a great deal about the business in  my husband don and i moved to denver i continued working in the securities industry for wachovia securities where i had the opportunity to manage one of the largest personal investment accounts held by the firm as well as doing institutional trading in  we had the opportunity to purchase the old chicago franchise rights for montana northern idaho and eastern washington we knew that this would be a challenging but very rewarding business adventure and were very much looking forward to moving back to bozeman in june of  we opened the old chicago in bozeman mt in  we were presented with the opportunity to develop hilton garden inn hotels we knew that the two businesses would complement one another well we opened the bozeman hilton garden inn in  the billings old

is very different — which is one thing that i really enjoy about owning our own businesses most of my time is spent on the marketing of the various properties and businesses as well as managing our

parents of hannah  and carter   what is the best part of your job the most challenging the most rewarding aspect of my job is fostering a flat team oriented culture and watching the success it creates we have held a firm commitment in employee empowerment as we believe that if you hire the right people they need the latitude to make the right decisions the most challenging aspect of my job is balancing the various demands each business has while still staying engaged with my family  how did your education at the college of business help you in your career yes i think that having a business degree has been very beneficial to me in owning our own businesses i do not believe that i would have been able to take on these opportunities without my degree every day i have built on what i
