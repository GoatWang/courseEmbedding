receive all of the proceeds from their sales of their adss in this offering after commissions payable to the underwriters expenses of this offering will be paid by us the principal reasons for this offering are to increase our financial flexibility increase our public profile and awareness create a public market for the adss and to facilitate our future access to public equity markets we have not quantified or allocated any specific portion of the net proceeds to us or range of the net proceeds to us for any particular purpose we anticipate that we will use the net proceeds we receive from

future revenue and cash generated by operations and accordingly our management board and supervisory board will have broad discretion in deploying the net proceeds of this offering pending their use we plan to hold the net proceeds from this offering in cash and cash equivalents we operate in a highly competitive market travelers have a range of options to find and book hotel rooms and other accommodations both offline and online similarly otas hotel chains and independent hotels advertise their rooms through both offline and online channels while we face competition from offline and online channels we believe that we compete favorably due to our differentiated user and advertiser propositions competition for users we compete to attract users to our websites and apps to help them research and find hotels given our position at the top of the online hotel search funnel many companies we compete with are also our customers our principal competitors for users include • online metasearch and review websites such as kayak qunar and tripadvisor • search engines such as baidu bing google and yahoo • independent hotels and hotel chains such as accor hilton and marriott • otas such as bookingcom ctrip and expedia and • alternative accommodation providers such as airbnb and homeaway competition for advertisers we compete with other advertising channels for hotel advertisers’ marketing spend these include traditional offline media and online marketing channels in terms of user traffic we compete on the basis of the quality of referrals cpc rates and advertisers’ implied return on investment while we compete with otas hotel chains and independent hotels for user traffic these parties also represent the key contributors to our supply because we primarily refer our users to advertisers’ websites we do not believe that we compete directly with advertisers for bookings our principal competitors for advertisers’ marketing spend include • print media such as local newspapers and magazines • other traditional media such as tv and radio • search engines such as baidu bing google and yahoo • online metasearch and review websites such as kayak qunar and tripadvisor • social networking services such as facebook and twitter • websites offering display advertising • email marketing software and tools • online video channels such as youtube and • mobile app marketing company description trivago is a global hotel search platform our mission is to “be the traveler’s first and independent source of information for finding the ideal hotel at the lowest rate” we are focused on reshaping the way travelers search for and compare hotels while enabling hotel advertisers to grow their businesses by providing access to a broad audience of travelers via our websites and apps our platform allows travelers to make informed decisions by personalizing their hotel search and providing access to a deep supply of hotel information and prices in the twelve months ended september   we had  million qualified referrals and offered access to approximately  million hotels in over  countries our brand positions us as a key starting point for travelers searching for their ideal hotel our fast and intuitive hotel search platform enables travelers to find their ideal hotel by matching individual traveler preferences with detailed hotel characteristics such as price location availability amenities and ratings across a vast supply of global hotels in the twelve months ended september   comparing across all of our localized websites and apps we provided a range of prices per hotel with the cheapest advertiser offering a price on average  lower than the most expensive advertiser we believe that the number of travelers accessing our websites and apps makes us an important and scalable marketing channel for our advertisers additionally our ability to refine user intent through our search function allows us to provide advertisers with transactionready referrals hotel advertisers which include online travel agencies or otas hotel chains and independent hotels advertise their supply on our global marketplace on a “costperclick” or cpc basis whereby an advertiser is charged when a user clicks on an advertised rate for a hotel and is referred to that advertiser’s website where the user can complete the booking in the twelve months ended september   an average of ten advertisers per hotel across all our localized websites and apps placed cpc bids our cpc bidding function enables advertisers to influence their own return on investment and the volume of referral traffic we generate for them rigorous analysis and application of data and technology are critical parts of our dna we capture a large amount of data on how users search on and engage with our site and our apps enabling us to continually test new features and the effectiveness of existing ones refine our search algorithms and thereby improve our product we have built tools that capture data and calculate our return on many elements of our brand and performance marketing our application of dataled improvement and innovation also informs our marketing strategy which we believe enables us to become increasingly more effective with our marketing spend our hotel search platform can be accessed globally via  localized websites and apps in  languages users can search our platform on desktop and mobile devices but benefit from a familiar user interface resulting in a consistent user experience in june  our revenue from mobile websites and apps exceeded our revenue from our desktop websites for the first time which is consistent with an expected longer term shift towards mobile beginning in the second quarter of  management identified three

surprise prediction looks to find earnings surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a
