todays deal place an ad newspaper ads jobs weekly ads eedition contact newsletter signup how boise inc came back from the brink by bill roberts brobertsidahostatesmancom sep    in the days after boise inc was created in  its new ceo said the outlook for the paper and packaging company was strong a year later the company’s stock was trading at  cents a share a  percent decline“it was a terrifying experience at times” said ceo alexander toeldteto toeldte’s relief — and that of boise inc’s shareholders and workers — the worst is history boise inc which employs  people in the treasure valley at its corporate headquarters in boise and its packaging plant in nampa has regrown its nationwide worker base which had fallen by  people between  and  it now employs about  people up from  last year thanks to the purchase this month of a california packaging company boise inc is making money and its stock is above between the optimism of boise inc’s opening days and the growing sense three years later that the company has righted itself lies a story of a struggle for survival that was finally broken by speed a fluid called black liquor and a tax creditpart one the rise and breakup of a woodproducts empireboise cascade’s name is nearly as wellknown and closely identified with idaho as the potatothe company began in  when the payette lumber co merged with cascade lumber co and went into the paper and corrugatedcontainer business with robert hansberger at the helm“hansberger proceeded to turn the enterprise into one of the most glamorous conglomerates of the conglomeratemad s” wrote lj davis in the new york times in in the late s the company added an officesupply unit that business boise office solutions eventually transformed the company by the early s boise cascade was struggling one analyst called it “a weak player in a weak business with a weak outlook” in  under chairman george harad boise cascade sensed an opportunity in officesupply retailing it borrowed money to buy officemax then the nation’s no  officesupply retailer for  billion in cash and stockthat was the first in a series of debtfinanced business deals that ended in three companiesto help pay for the officemax purchase boise cascade sold off its paper wood products buildingmaterials and timberland assets to a chicago privateequity firm madison dearborn partners in a leveraged buyoutboise cascade changed its name to officemax and moved its headquarters to itasca ill where boise office solutions had been basedbut the boise cascade name was not destined to die madison dearborn named its newly acquired company boise cascade llc and kept its headquarters in downtown boiseto help pay the new owners’ debt boise cascade llc in  sold off  million acres of timber in idaho and five other statesin early  boise cascade llc sold its paper and packaging business to aldabra  acquisition corp a company begun by investors nathan leight and jason weiss of new york citybased terrapin partners they wanted to take the paper and packaging division public they too borrowed money to finance their  billion purchase they secured a listing on the new york stock exchangeleight and weiss named the new company boise inc and they named toeldte — who had joined boise cascade llc as executive vice president of its paper division in  — its ceoboise inc began with five paper mills five corrugatedproducts plants a corrugated sheet plant and two distribution centers in idaho it inherited corrugatedpaper plants in burley and nampa that had a combined  employees plus  corporate and transportation employees in boiseboise cascade llc kept the woodproducts manufacturing and buildingmaterials distribution businesses in idaho boise cascade retained distribution yards in boise and idaho falls and a laminatedbeam plant in emmettthe two companies operate side by side in the boise plaza building at th and jefferson streetsin the opening days of boise inc executives spoke of its strong cash flow and worldclass products“as an independent company listed on the new york stock exchange we believe we can sharpen our intense focus on customer satisfaction while offering our investors an opportunity to participate in the growth of our business” toeldte said at the timebut boise inc was born with  billion in debt that had to be servicedtoeldte wasn’t new to the paper business nor was he new to companies that struggled that experience turned out to be useful as prospects for boise inc quickly deterioratedpart two crisis and cutbackstoeldte  grew up in cologne germany and studied in german schools he did postgraduate work in montrealhe spent  years at an international consulting firm in europe and canada working with paper and pulp companies often helping turn them around to avoid bankruptcy and he ran both a paper and a building materials company in new zealand under the fletcher challenge limited group before joining boise cascade llcafter boise inc came into being in early  prices for natural gas — a key ingredient that fuels much of boise inc energy needs — shot up  percent in six monthsat almost the same time the national housing market collapsed suddenly wood chips a byproduct of lumber manufacturing and an essential ingredient in making boise inc’s paper became scarcethen the recession gained steam boise inc was staring at that billiondollar debt with only  million in earnings in  before the deduction of interest taxes and depreciation — a to ratio “that is pretty heavy” toeldte saidwhen the stock price hit bottom in early  “it was as strenuous and stressful a time as any in the recession” he saidtoeldte set up what became known as the speed plan a companywide assessment of what was working and what wasn’t what was profitable and what was costing the company money“we had to look at every element” toeldte saidat the packaging plant in nampa where  employees turn out about  million square feet of boxes a year workers found ways to trim production costs by  a month in  said dave kunz boise inc’s corrugated and container board general managerrecovery also forced painful decisions in january  boise inc shut down its pulp production at st helens ore and cut its paper production by  tons costing  jobs“you can’t make product and just store it in inventory” toeldte said “if you don’t have customers  then you’ve just got to stop making product until demand matches your product”declining demand for newsprint — which has fallen from  percent of boise inc’s business in  to  percent in  — forced the closure of a part of boise inc’s newsprint production at a plant in deridder la in spring  costing another  jobsthe nampa plant which mostly makes boxes for agricultural products such as processed potatoes and cheese avoided layoffs for that eightyear employee thomas lumbreras  is grateful“to be steady was nice” said lumbreras assistant operator on a boxmaking machine as boise inc began checking off items from the speed list the company also became “more quickly confident we could fight our way through it” toeldte said “but it was a tough fight”by early  results from the speed plan began to show signs of successand the company caught a break thanks to congress on a pulpmaking byproduct that boise inc used to fire much of its machineryconverting wood to paper pulp leaves a liquid called black liquor in  boise inc found that the product qualified for a centagallon alternativefuel tax credit the credit — which ended in december  — contributed  million to the company’s bottom line swelling net income for several quartersthe company’s net earnings in  totaled  million without special items such as the tax credit with those items added in net earnings shot up to  milliongraham mattison an analyst who follows boise inc for lazard capital markets said the credit “saved their bacon”boise inc officials see it differently“i think even without that we had taken steps and business was improving” said jason bowman boise inc’s investorrelations director “this was on top of that”the additional revenue contributed to boise inc paying down its debt which is now at  million a  percent drop from part three recovery and growththe great recession had another casualty besides jobs and corporate bottom lines paperfewer whitecollar jobs meant fewer people in offices turning out duplicates on copy machines combined with the growth in electronic storage of information that once was on paper the paper business has dropped by about  percent toeldte saidwhile paper remains the majority of boise inc’s business at  percent of sales the company is working to grow its packaging business earlier this month boise inc spent  million to buy tharco packaging inc a california company that produces packaging for sophisticated equipment such as dialysis machines“it expanded their footprint” said mattison the analyst who gives boise inc a buy recommendationmoreover tharco becomes one more companyowned outlet that will buy liner board produced by boise inc before the tharco purchase boise inc used about  percent of its liner board at its own plants a strategy that enhances margins and keeps the company from selling its product in export markets where margins are thinner toeldte said with the purchase of tharco  percent of the liner board will now go to companyowned production plantsthe purchase is also a sign that boise inc is more robust than it was in the bleak days of  had the tharco opportunity come along in  boise inc might have let it pass “we didn’t have the financial capacity” toeldte saidsome stock analysts think the company’s stock could hit  a share this year nearly a fold increase from its low pointphil gresh senior analyst in paper and packaging for jp morgan names boise inc as his top pick in the sector it’s a company flying under the radar of many investors he saidboise inc is looking for new opportunities“the intensity of capturing the opportunities is in many ways the same as fighting for survival” toeldte said “the difference is you can do it with a smile and a sense of fun” angry  sad  funny  wow  love  load
