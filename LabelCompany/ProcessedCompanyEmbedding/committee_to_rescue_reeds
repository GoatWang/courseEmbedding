the companys upcoming  annual meeting the committee issued the following statement regarding the need for change at reeds since going public reeds has been plagued by poor financial performance and serious corporate governance deficiencies  for evidence of these serious corporate governance deficiencies shareholders need to look no further than the following set of troubling facts i two of the four current members of the board include the chairman and ceo and his spouse ii one of the independent directors has been cited by institutional shareholder services for his failure to attend at least  percent of his board and committee meetings since  iii the board has allowed the other current independent director to serve despite his failure to receive majority vote support at the last two annual meetings and iv reeds received notice from the new york stock exchange for its failure to meet the standards for continued listing in recent months members of the committee have made multiple attempts to engage in good faith dialogue with chairman and ceo chris reed in order to avoid a potentially costly and time consuming proxy contest  unfortunately their efforts were met with deafening silence from mr reed  the committee is concerned that the companys exceptionally poor operating performance will continue to deteriorate and that each shareholders investment runs the risk of being entirely destroyed unless new independent voices are added in the boardroom the committee had hoped to work constructively with the board to address its concerns  unfortunately it is as if reeds does not have a functioning board to engage with  additionally mr reed has been entirely unresponsive to date  these circumstances have left us with no choice but to nominate a slate of highly qualified

the committee to rescue reeds issues statement regarding status of recent settlement discussionspr newswireoctober  reblogsharetweetsharenew york oct   prnewswire  the committee to rescue reeds the committee today commented on its recent goodfaith efforts to work with chairman and ceo chris reed to reach a mutually agreeable director slate and avoid a proxy contest at the  annual meeting of reeds inc nyse mkt reed reeds or the companythe committee issued the following statementfor the past several weeks we have been working with chris reed to see if we could arrive at a mutually agreeable board slate to avoid a costly and protracted proxy contest at the upcoming  annual meeting  we are appreciative of the efforts of two significant shareholders in mediating this process joseph grace and david robinov both of whom previously served as members on the reeds board  both the committee and mr reed encouraged and fully supported a process whereby messrs grace and robinov were to interview and properly vet candidates put forth by each party and to on the basis of the aforementioned vetting process recommend a qualified unified slate of board nominees while the independent mediators contacted interviewed and quickly vetted all five candidates put forth by the committee mr reed failed to provide the names and contact information for the companys recommended nomineesmr reed did however volunteer the name of bruce nierenberg for inclusion as a possible board nominee messrs grace and robinov were successful in their efforts to contact interview and vet mr nierenberg further according to a recent bevnet article mr reed also announced the possibility of john bello joining the board but mr bello reportedly refused to be vetted by the independent mediators  after numerous requests to mr reed and missed milestones regarding delivery of the boards proposed nominees the mediators submitted a sevenmember board recommendation consisting of the committees five nominees along with bruce nierenberg and mr reed this recommendation was unfortunately ignored and the settlement discussions have ceased as of october th  consequently the committee continues preparations for a proxy contest at the upcoming  annual meetingdespite the recent setback the committee remains hopeful that an expanded mutually agreeable slate of nominees will ultimately be agreed upon by the parties it is the sincere desire of the committee to avoid a long and potentially destructive proxy contest however chances for arriving at such a unified slate are quickly dissipating as filing deadlines loomthe committee has had discussions with several significant shareholders of reeds all of whom share our serious concerns regarding the companys poor financial performance and serious corporate governance deficiencies  we encourage any reeds shareholders who may share our concerns to contact us at the numbers listed below we look forward to your support at the  annual meeting in order to address the companys serious shortcomings the committee previously nominated a highly qualified team of director candidates including jeffrey t glidden jeffrey v hembrock edwin r
