medical applications patent number  abstract systems methods and devices for preparation of water for various uses including blood treatment are described in embodiments fluid is passed either by pump or passively by gravity feed through various filtration elements from a fluid source to a treatment fluid container the latter forms a batch that may be used during treatment methods and systems for creating multipletreatment batches are described advantages of creating a multitreatment batch include the fact that the burden of treatment preparation can be reduced and the timing of the preparation of the batch can be independent of the treatment time as described there are various tradeoffs and concerns with this approach which are addressed by the inventive embodiments type grant filed january   date of patent july   assignee nxstage medical inc inventors jeffrey h burbank dennis m treu götz friederichs brian c green christopher s mcdowell james m brugger peritoneal dialysis systems devices and methods publication number  abstract an automated peritoneal dialysis system provides various features including prescriptiondriven dialysis fluid preparation an integrated disposable fluid circuit and sensor capabilities that allow accurate filing and draining control with high safety margins features include a peritoneal fluid circuit with a pressure sensor at either end and methods and devices for using the pressure signals other features and embodiments are disclosed type application filed january   publication date june   applicant nxstage medical inc inventors jeffrey h burbank james m brugger dennis m treu mark t wyeth filtration system for preparation of fluids for medical applications patent number  abstract systems methods and devices for preparation of purified water and medicaments for various uses including blood treatment are described methods devices and systems for creating multipletreatment batches are described for example a medicament fluid circuit can include a container with an interior chamber the container can have a fluid filling port and a fluid extraction port both ports can be connected to the interior chamber the filling port can have two sterilizing filters each of which has a membrane the sterilizing filters can be connected in series the membranes are separated by a distance of at least  cm a first of the sterilizing filters can have a sealed inlet the fluid extraction port can be sealed type grant filed april   date of patent may   assignee nxstage medical inc inventors jeffrey h burbank james m brugger pressure measurement devices methods and systems publication number  abstract a pressure measurement system for use in blood circuits comprised of a pressure sensing pod and a force measurement device the pressure sensing pod can include a flexible moveable fluidimpermeable diaphragm and can be formed via either a oneshot or a twoshot molding process a mechanical engagement member of the force measurement device engages with a mechanical engagement feature of the diaphragm and the engagement member is operative to move in concert with movement of the engagement feature of the diaphragm based on pressure variations with the pressure sensing pod the force measurement device generates and outputs to a processor a signal based on detected force associated with movement of the engagement

jeffrey h burbank dennis m treu christopher s mcdowell goetz friederichs method and apparatus for machine error detection by combining multiple sensor inputs publication number  abstract one of the most significant safety concerns in the automation of extracorporeal blood treatments such as dialysis is the risk of blood leakage extracorporeal blood treatment systems draw blood at such a high rate that a loss of integrity in the blood circuit can be serious there are a number of mechanisms for detecting and preventing leaks but none is perfect this tends to limit the use of such equipment in unsupervised settings such as the home will be limited some leak detection schemes can be made sensitive enough to detect the barest of leaks but when this is done they result in too many false positives the invention combines information from multiple inputs to enhance sensitivity in leak detection and reduce the problem of false positives type application filed january   publication date

number  abstract a water purification component which may be integrated in a medicament production plant andor a blood treatment system removes chloramine and other chlorine compounds and deionizes water the deionization is selected to be effective for providing product water whose resistivity is sufficiently high to allow chloramine to be detected in the product water if the chloramine removal filtration fails this allows a chloramine removal filter to be changed based on a predicted exhaustion schedule with the safety of automatic chloramine breakthrough provided type application filed

for machine error detection by combining multiple sensor inputs publication number  abstract one of the most significant safety concerns in the automation of extracorporeal blood treatments such as dialysis is the risk of blood leakage extracorporeal blood treatment systems draw blood at such a high rate that a loss of integrity in the blood circuit can be serious there are a number of mechanisms for detecting and preventing leaks but none is perfect this tends to limit the use of such equipment in unsupervised settings such as the home will be limited some leak detection schemes can be made sensitive enough to detect the barest of leaks but when this is done they result in too many false positives the invention combines information from multiple inputs to enhance sensitivity in leak detection and reduce the problem of false positives type application filed january   publication date july   applicant nxstage medical inc inventors jeffrey h burbank james m brugger safety
