buyin for their vision and communicate with more impact in my spare time i enjoy guiding successful professionals to find their true professional calling in my work with embrace possibility my philosophy to be great you have to pursue and reach mastery at what you’re called to do  that calling comes from within you and the only way to hear it is through self reflection and introspection and taking action on what you uncover so that you can uncover more high performers who don’t follow their calling may do well initially but then end up living a life of mediocrity once the initial learning and novelty wears off to have staying power to reach mastery you need to take on functions that you are truly interested in in addition to finding your professional calling it’s important to also set and attain your personal financial and healthrelated goals my approach with all of my engagements i start by helping my clients gain clarity around their current situation and finding the drivers for the results they are currently experiencing next we focus on the specific outcomes my client would like to achieve if there are skill gaps we fill those in with experiential skill building drawing either on my expertise or those of relevant experts if there are willingness gaps we explore the reasons for sticking to the “less effective” habit and make a decision on whether to accept or challenge the status quo throughout my sessions i invest fully in my client’s success and remain both flexible and persistent to help my clients achieve positive results my responsibility clarity

forward i am responsible to keep the focus on your needs and to continuously learn new ways to shine light on your blind spots and guide you through your selfexploration i will suggest strategies from time to time but the choice is always yours  one of my main duties is to empower you and to keep you responsible and accountable for the commitments you make everything discussed during the coaching

there i can help you avoid my mistakes and use my successes” mentoring conversations look like this “here’s what you need to do next” a coach uses a process to help you understand where you are where

add value to my readers  currently i’m keeping this blog to a one author blog who should consider coaching robert chen t who should consider coachinghigh performers who want to reach the next level without making all the mistakes “i’ve done just fine without a coach…” you may be doing just fine but what does that really mean are you living the life you really want if not do you recognize the barriers that are stopping you you are the expert of your professional and personal life and you already have all the creativity and resources to live to your fullest potential coaches are experts on helping you identify and define the goals that matter to you and to support you in maximizing the life you want to live  welldefined goals along with new skills and insights will allow you to move toward achieving those goals faster and more effortlessly if you decide to engage in a coaching relationship you can expect to experience fresh perspectives on life’s challenges and opportunities improved thinking and decisionmaking skills enhanced interpersonal effectiveness and increased confidence in all aspects of your life this will lead to noticeable results in personal effectiveness and satisfaction along with a strong sense of achievement and happiness what are the benefits of coaching robert chen t what are the benefits of coaching finally…you can live the life you want most people never reach their full potential because they don’t think it is possible to live the life they want and deserve if you don’t believe me just look around you the rewards of coaching compounds so the earlier you start the more you will benefit not all coaches are created equal and you need to choose wisely here are the benefits you can receive distinguishing wants from shouldsi will help you distinguish your “wants” which is important from your “shoulds” which are not as important when you can confidently answer the question “why do you do what you do” you will begin to live life with a sense of purpose and become committed to achieving your goals interestingly when you commit achieving your goal becomes inevitable this is the preventative cure for the “midlife crisis” setting effective goalshow many times have you disappointed yourself by starting something but never finishing it as your coach i will help you get what you want through effective goal setting live life with no regrets with the proper goals anything is possiblechallenging limiting beliefs“i am too young i am too old i am a minority i never went to college i am not smart enough i can’t do that etc” these are examples of the many beliefs that actively hold people back from getting what they want i will help you to challenge your beliefs and to recognize that you don’t need permission to be happy and live the life you wantidentifying strengthsdo you want to be good or do you want to be great life becomes easier when you stop trying to improve your weaknesses and you work on enhancing your strengths the first step is to identify them and i will show you howproviding specific feedbackwe can only see things through our own eyes and that makes us susceptible to blind spots imagine rushing to go somewhere and deciding to drive full speed just to find out you were going the wrong way i will help you prevent that by giving you a third person’s perspective of the situationupholding accountabilityhow easy is it to give up when we are by ourselves most people quit right before the finish line i will make sure you stay motivated by consistently reminding you of the commitments you have made and provide support when you need it if you’ve ever worked out with someone you know how different that is compared to working out by yourselfachieving balancehow many people do you know have great careers but poor relationships or a lot of money but poor health my philosophy is that you cannot reach your full potential unless you enrich the main areas of your life health financial freedom relationships personal development professional development you have all the resources necessary to achieve your highest potential my role is to help you identify the best places to allocate those resourcesremoving riskit is not easy to invest your hardearned money on selfdevelopment especially with someone you’ve never met or worked with so i have decided to take all the risk out of your decision i’m confident in what i do and if i don’t provide you with enough value then i won’t take your money what to expect from our time together robert chen t what to expect from our time togetherhaving worked with clients from various industries i have come to realize that the fundamentals of my methodology remain the same the first thing i do is to conduct an initial consultation to make sure i am the right coach for you the second is to verify that you are willing and committed to improve it is okay if you don’t know how as long as you are willing i will not coach people who do not want to be coached it would be a waste of everyone’s time after securing a commitment to the coaching relationship we will work together to clarify and create a plan to achieve the goals that you want the usual commitment is for  month period meeting every  weeks  sessions i love coaching and training others to be their best and i have extensively researched the  key aspects for living your life to the fullest i am passionate about reaching my highest potential and i apply everything i learn in my life before ever presenting it to you how is coaching different from consulting therapy andor having a supportive friend robert chen t how is coaching different from consulting therapy andor having a supportive friendconsulting provides temporary or intermittent solutions while coaching is a consistent ongoing relationship where the coach stays with the client to help them achieve their goals through skill building and change management consulting often involves telling people what they should do while coaching focuses on helping the client discover the solution on hisher own coaching is not therapy coaching is focused on the client and provides the support and strategy to make changes based on the awareness a client holds coaching is movement oriented and action based therapy brings understanding and awareness of the past to a client to help resolve conflicting issues they have impeded them a supportive friend is great but they rarely hold the objectivity and distance a coach would a coach is a professional who is trusted to work with you on the most important aspects of your life and to offer a different perspective of the truth because of the emotional distance the professional relationship offers robert chens profile on product hunt product huntthe best new
