windowmoreclick to share on pocket opens in new windowthe biotime subsidiary asterias has received fda approval for a combined phase iiia clinical trial of opc for treating spinal cord injury biotime btx and asterias asty have picked up the portfolio of the former geron clinical trial using oligodendrocyte precursor cells opc asterias also acquired a second element from geron in the form of a lung cancer treatment based on stem cells that sounds quite intriguing to learn more about this exciting news i interviewed jane lebkowski president of research and development at asterias  what are the most important things for the stem cell community to know about asterias getting the fda approval to move forward with this phase a trial lebkowski there are a couple of very interesting points in the first clinical trial by geron safety was established in patients with thoracic spinal cord injury now with this current fda clearance and the new clinical protocol we will test astopc in a different patient population those patients with complete cervical spinal cord injuries we think this population will be the first target for registration trials for astopc patients with cervical injuries have more extensive paralysis involving both the lower and upper limbs because of both the anatomy of spinal cord in the cervical spinal cord region and superior ways to assess restoration of upper body movement we believe testing of astopc in this patient population will provide a better opportunity to assess potential clinical benefit of the cells another important point of the new trial is that will test escalating doses of astopc the first clinical trial performed by geron tested a single low dose of the cells in the new phase a trial we will escalate doses into the range where we feel we can see potential clinical activity  what are the doses in the new trial versus the original one lebkowski  the dose used in the geron trial was  million cells the new trial will start with a dose of  million cells in the first cohort and then escalate to doses of 0 and 0 million cells in cohorts  and   the patients that originally received opc when geron was starting things have now been followed for a relatively long time how are they doing lebkowski   there have been no safety problems observed in these patients that were associated with the cells injection of the cells or immunosuppression used in the first clinical trial we haven’t seen measurable neurological improvements in the patients however these patients were administered only a low dose of cells importantly there were no immune responses observed which targeted the cells by mri there were indications of tissue sparing effects reduced cavitation in four out of the five patients in the original trial the device and procedure used to administer the cells in cervical spinal cord injury patients are essentially the same as those used in the first trial in thoracic injury patients when the product was owned by geron it was referred to as “grnopc”  it is now called “astopc” to reflect its new owner asterias biotherapeutics  what does the involvement of cirm mean for the whole process lebkowski  cirm will be helping to cofund this new clinical trial this funding can now be activated with the fda clearance  what will the time course be like for this trial  lebkowski  we plan to start the trial in early 0 with data becoming available as the trial progresses through the cohorts   in a broad sense what does this clearance and the trial mean lebkowski  although the first trial was small a good safety profile was established enabling more advanced testing of astopc in clinical trials where both safety and efficacy can be potentially measured the clearance also shows more broadly that human embryonic stem cell based therapies are progressing in their development the field is advancing beyond the feasibility stage now  can you tell us briefly about asterias’ lung cancer program lebkowski  a second asterias product is astvac which are human embryonic stem cell derived dendritic cells these cells are modified to express telomerase a protein typically expressed in cancer cells the aim is to use these telomerase expressing dendritic cells to stimulate immune responses against cancer cells we are now preparing for clinical trials with this product  related postsearly but encouraging data from
