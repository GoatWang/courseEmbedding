surveys of us consumer and business confidence surged to multiyear highs on expectations that the new administration’s policies would accelerate gdp growth however measures of hard economic activity such as retail sales and capital spending  had yet to show similar strength at its midmarch policy meeting the federal reserve kept its  growth forecast at  but raised interest rates  as its preferred

first time it had exceeded  in nearly five years outside the us the uk economy remained resilient following the june  brexit vote with unemployment falling to its lowest level since  eurozone unemployment also continued to decline and manufacturing activity picked up across the region despite heightened political uncertainty emerging markets experienced robust investor inflows due to several factors including attractive valuations and a weakening in the us dollar in this environment the global equity market registered a strong gain led by emerging markets returns were also

global macro absolute return strategy allocation also contributed strongly to performance duration management of the fund was a very slight contributor but essentially flat relative to the index as the fund’s slightly negative average duration position in the us provided a small headwind as rates ended the quarter very close to wher e they began while long interest rate exposure in other

those with regard to regulation and tax reform — may further nurture corporate sector health the fund’s allocation to our global macro strategy also contributed strongly to returns as select currency and interest rate positions within the portfolio earned positive returns — particularly in iceland which announced its planned removal of capital controls that have been in place since  and in russia where the ruble and local interest rates continued their rally from oversold levels stabilizing oil prices and the prospects of improving relations with the us limited allocations to emergingmarkets
