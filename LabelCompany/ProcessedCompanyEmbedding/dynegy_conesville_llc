dyn  said friday it agreed to buy power plants and retail electricity businesses from duke energy  duk  and private equity firm energy capital partners or ecp for  billion doubling its generating capacity to  megawatts and giving it retail operations in three new states dynegy is paying  billion for dukes assets and  billion for ecps the duke portfolio includes its retail business and ownership interests in the killen stuart conesville miami fort zimmer hanging rock washington fayette lee and dicks creek power plants the ecp assets that make up the sale of equipower resources corp and brayton point holdings llc include the milford lake road dighton masspower liberty elwood richland stryker kincaid and brayton point power plants the deal will allow dynegy to provide retail electricity to residents and businesses in ohio pennsylvania and michigan along with illinois with the ecp and duke ohio generation assets providing the generation to support the businesses dynegy ceo and president robert flexon said in a statement the plants transform dynegy by adding considerable scale in the pjm interconnection llc and new england markets the addition of these portfolios is forecasted to significantly improve our financial outlook by tripling our  adjusted ebitda and being massively accretive to adjusted ebitda and free cash flow per share in  and beyond he said flexon added that dynegy intends to honor the terms of the collective bargaining agreements in both generating fleets the company also intends to honor ecps agreement to retire the brayton point coal plant on may   and complete the decommissioning after retirement marc manly president of dukes commercial business said the transaction is an important milestone in its strategy to exit the merchant generation business in the third quarter duke expects to book a  million pretax reversal of the  billion impairment previously recognized in  it said use of the proceeds is being evaluated but it expects the transaction to be accretive to shareholders by  tudor pickering holt  co securities inc said the deal metrics look very good at  times next years enterprise value to ebitda especially considering that dynegy is looking to capture  million in cash tax savings through the use of its large net operating loss position and sees  million in annual synergies the firm added that it will be interesting to see where the pricing falls on the  billion in new notes dynegy will issue to finance the deals industry observers had expressed concern about dukes auction process when arlington vabased aes  aes  pulled back on selling the power plants and retail electricity businesses that made up dpl inc deciding instead to separate out the businesses as required by regulators industry experts had expected the business to fetch as much as  billion in an auction led by barclays but sources told the deal in early august that duke was on track to complete a sale which industry bankers estimated would fetch  billion to  billion the deal had previously expected dynegy to be one of the bidders for dukes assets along with the blackstone group lp riverstone holdings llc energy investors funds and ecp paul patterson a longtime utility and power analyst at glenrock associates llc said the deal wasnt all that surprising the more of these deals take place you have to wonder how much will remain to be done he said a key factor could be the desire on the part of hybrid utilities to shed their nonregulated businesses dynegy said the addition of ecps and dukes assets complement dynegys existing assets and retail business by adding significant scale and fuel diversification in markets in which the company participates but lacks scale of the  megawatts being acquired dynegy said  megwatts are modern combined cycle natural gas plants and  megawatts are environmentally compliant coal generation plants dynegy said the deals will quadruple the size of its pjm fleet and boost its new england fleet sevenfold and will be  ebitda accretive and  free cash flow accretive next year dynegy expects the combined enterprise to generate  billion to  billion in ebitda and  million to  million in free cash flow assuming both deals close by the end of the year dynegy also said its  billion net operating loss position will be available to offset taxable income of the combined company providing nearly  million in present value cash tax savings if you liked this article you might like stocks at highs as crude closes above  trump takes international trip stocks are higher on friday
