thank you phil and welcome everyone i would like to focus my comments today on three themes first i would like to pick up on our commentary from the q call in february about  setting up to be a choppier year than usual second ill provide an update on the important projects we are executing on in  and third despite the transitory crosscurrents we are experiencing i want to remind you that we are making the investments to make our business stronger more geographically diverse and more capable these actions will allow us to return to our traditional growth profile in  and beyond starting with choppiness in performance due to a number of factors this year many of which are transitory our financial results will be a bit bumpy in the quarters q demonstrated this in spades so let me go through what we saw in q and set expectations for the remainder of the year this past quarter we faced a number of adversities the primary challenge we faced in the us was the continuation of the software stability issues that began in q and carried over into q you may recall that we described these issues to you in our yearend call three months ago as we worked to set expectations for this challenging quarter the software issues led to two separate but related impacts on our performance first we experienced elevated levels of atm downtime which are reflected in our weaker than usual organic growth and samestore growth numbers second it slowed the pacing of our emv upgrades which led us to absorb more fraud liability and operating expenses associated with maintenance visits to the atms these operating issues in combination with an unrelated vendor software issue with pin pads and the timing of a branding transition effectively trimmed  of eps from the quarter not helping the yearoveryear comparison was a tough compare we did not have the benefit of a couple of material tailwinds that lifted our q results last year now the good news is that several of these factors have passed and we expect that we are through the most challenging period of the year we have substantially addressed our software stability issues and are now tracking to our traditional availability levels prior to the onset of those issues this in turn enables us to push ahead on our emv upgrades towards completion in q getting the emv rollout completed provides two important benefits for cardtronics first it limits the exposure to fraud losses we have not yet closed the door on emv liability exposure so that will linger into the next quarter or two but second and more importantly it also allows us to ramp up our sales activities for multibank branding services once the technical capability is available on all of our owned atms in the third quarter for the remainder of  we have a full agenda of execution opportunities in front of us lets start with the integration of dcpayments there are several things to keep in mind as we integrate the largest acquisition in our corporate history the first is that this feels more like four acquisitions in that it spans five countries and three continents we have to combine our canadian operations our uk operations our mexican operations and our australianew zealand operations the second point to remember is that in australia we acquired a business dcpayments which had just acquired another business in australia cashcard and we have to finish integrating both of those as we also work to inject the cardtronics success formula into that newly combined australiannew zealand business my third observation is that this is a twoyear process and progress will be different in each country based on integration conditions through the first quarter we are on track with progress in canada and australia our two canada businesses are coming together organizationally and operationally quite well we are working towards addressing this market as one cohesive team with one product set in australia we continue to integrate the acquired cashcard business into the dcpayments base business now it is no secret that samestore transaction declines are a reality of the market in australia and one that we understood when we made the investment in dcpayments this will present growth challenges in the nearterm not too dissimilar from what we faced in  with our cardpoint acquisition in the uk which was also experiencing near double digit declines in volume we leveraged the scale and people in cardpoint to transform the uk into a double digit revenue and earnings grower in  excluding currency impacts we can succeed in challenging market conditions because these markets effectively help us tell our story to the financial institutions in a market with declining volumes banks and credit unions need relief on the course of operating atms we can serve our bank clients by being the trusted consolidator of volumes with our retail placements branding services and surchargefree offerings and as the scale atm specialist in the market we are best prepared to help banks migrate to a lower cost solution atms have the interesting distinction of being absolutely necessary for financial institutions to serve their customers but they are no longer strategic and therefore the fis are better served relying on cardtronics now to close out on australia im pleased to report that the australian competition and consumer commission the accc has announced the completion of its review of dcpayments acquisition of the cashcard atm business without any action as cardtronics was not previously in the market there was never a concern about our acquisition of dcpayments now in the uk we have not yet begun the integration process due to the ongoing cma review of the combination however we were notified just this morning that we were referred to a phase  investigation cardtronics fully supports the competition and markets authority merger inquiry process we are in the process of reviewing the detail of the cmas decision and will continue to be an active participant in the review process at this time and in accordance with the cma merger inquiry directives the cardtronics and dcpayments brands and operations remain wholly distinct in the united kingdom pending completion of the cma review classes let me continue now with several other initiatives i talked in february about continued investment in providing managed services to the inbranch atm market we continue to be encouraged by the early pipeline with potential customers and partners these sales are expected to be longer in their cycle times to signing and conversion but we are wellpositioned to be a leader in this very real opportunity we do have to fortify our capabilities in some areas that are of particular importance to banks in past calls i referred to this concept as becoming bankgrade in multiple dimensions of our service delivery an example of this is in the area of information security we want banks and credit unions to know that cardtronics is the safest place to put their atms because we aim to be the most secure environment for atms as a sign of our commitment to worldclass information security earlier this week we announced the hiring of our new chief information security officer dan antilley who previously ran information security operations for bank of america he will ensure we deliver on that bankgrade promise and he can represent the needs of financial institutions with his  years of experience at bank of america in combination with our other recent hires from chase and ncr you can see we are building a team of key executives who can drive our movement into the financial institution sector on the eleven wind down we stand ready to commence the deconversion in q and more importantly we have taken steps to restructure our costs so we can minimize earnings impact when that customer comes off ed will update you on our considerable progress in this area now lets shift gears to how we are executing on the fundamentals of our business away from all the transitory factors weve just discussed we had a couple of notable wins in the course of q both of these are very much on point with our growth strategy with fis first on allpoint we added another top  fi to the roster of over  issuers that participate in our surchargefree network bmo harris is now on allpoint complementing the expanse of longterm branding relationship we have had with this great bank that now makes one top  bank joining allpoint in each of the last four quarters in the area of inbranch managed services we will be managing  atms with inbranches for bank of queensland in australia this is a tangible delivery on the strategy we are undertaking in australia with our strong footprint of over  atms out of a total market of  atms we want to enable the banking market to migrate to a more efficient model of cash distribution by turning to the leading specialized operator in the market cardtronics to further improve customer convenience while lowering their total cost of serving their cardholders aside from these two notable deals we demonstrated solid execution on other drumbeat growth in the business in the quarter we secured contracts representing over  new atm locations worldwide this is a very solid start to the year and consistent with our geographic diversification plans these came through six of our markets we signed an additional  new issuers in the allpoint network including bmo harris and we are on cost in implementing the renewed citi branding relationship that we announced last quarter which will stand  atms in key metropolitan markets we remain focused on our goal of being the most convenient and cost efficient physical network through which banks will direct more of their customers activities i am as confident as ever in our positioning to capitalize on opportunities that are emerging as the banking world evolves how they interact with customers the financial benefits from this strategy will become evident once we get back to more normalized environment in  and beyond in the meantime the team has a strong handle on the ins and outs of  and we are confident in reiterating our guidance for the year with that i will turn it over to ed edward h west  cardtronics plc great thank you steve my comments today will focus on the following three areas first as expected the first quarter results were impacted by several transitory factors that are now on the other side in most of them second we remain on track to achieve our fullyear  guidance and finally we are executing on the systems and operational improvements to drive improved effectiveness and cost efficiencies in a post eleven environment before i get into the results one item of note regarding our segment reporting for q we have broken out dcpayments as its own segment for q given that the business was initially managed as a separate entity before we started the integration in north america and australia beginning in q dcpayments will be reported within our existing geographical reporting segments now lets go through some of the aspects of our q performance total revenue growth was  or  on a constant currency basis on an organic constant currency basis revenue growth was down  for the quarter if we adjust from transitory headwinds in the quarter this growth would have been a positive  most of these headwinds will sound familiar from our q call when we anticipated that these issues will come up first on a relative yearoveryear basis the tough compare to last year was caused by an extra day in the quarter from leap year and a large powerball jackpot in the us which together added  to last years growth secondly atm availability was negatively impacted by the software rollout in the us and the ncr pin pad issue that we mentioned last quarter lastly a transition in branding locations with one of our major branding banks led to a temporary dip in branding revenue the software and pin pad issues combined with the branding transition impacted revenue by about another  all of these factors resulted in a  head to revenue growth and are now behind us regarding the performance items we are now back to par on atm uptime in q atm operating revenues in north america excluding dcpayments were down  while the european segment was up  in constant currency terms again excluding dcpayments looking at the underlying us samestore withdrawal transaction growth it was down approximately  for the quarter we estimate that normalized for the powerball leap year and the software issues samestore transactions would have been down about  to  in the quarter in the uk our samestore withdrawal rate was down  which is just slightly below levels we have recently experienced we saw unusual weakness in volume in the months of january and february but which stabilized in the month of march gross margin in the quarter was  compared to  in the prior year there were three main drivers of this decline first the decline in us revenue had a significant impact to margin totaling approximately  basis points this will selfcorrect as we get back to more normalized revenue  secondly we had elevated operating cost in the us as a result of higher chargebacks and maintenance service fees associated with our us atm fleet and our software and emv upgrade efforts which adversely impacted margin by approximately  basis points until we are done with emv upgrades in q we will continue to absorb chargebacks but the magnitude will diminish as we get more atms upgraded lastly the dcpayments acquisition was initially somewhat dilutive to gross margin by approximately  basis points in q as we progress in the integration of dcpayments and realized synergies this negative pressure will mitigate adjusted ebitda in the quarter was  million or  million on a constant currency basis up slightly from last year as we reported in our q we filed earlier today dcpayments contributed approximately  million in adjusted ebitda for the quarter but this was offset by underperformance in north america adjusted eps was  compared to  in the first quarter of  currency changes had an adverse impact of approximately  per share increased interest and depreciation expense associated with the dcpayments acquisition caused the relatively higher adverse impact to adjusted eps versus the yearoveryear change in adjusted ebitda this divergence will continue for the balance of the year now let me touch on gaap net income as there were several factors that resulted in a gaap net loss for the quarter as mentioned on our last call we undertook a reorganization and restructuring initiative to streamline our cost structure and increase the operating efficiency we made good progress on this initiative in q and are progressing solidly on the  million savings objective as a part of this program we recorded nonrecurring severance costs totaling  million we also recorded an impairment loss of  million associated with assets we no longer expect to fully utilize in the future finally we incurred  million in acquisition related costs this is primarily professional services expenses for the dcpayments transaction and integration in total we recorded about  million in nonrecurring costs that were adjusted out of our ebitda metric moving on to the balance sheet our pro forma net leverage was  times as of march  at the end of the quarter we had  million drawn on our credit facility which was partially paid down after quarter end with proceeds from the  million  senior notes issuance additionally we amended the credit facility capacity to  million with the ability to accordion up to  million capex in the quarter was  million the majority of which related to our fleet upgrade and recent contract renewals in the us now turning to guidance we are maintaining our outlook for the calendar year to recap this guidance revenues of  billion to  billion gross margin of  to  ebitda in the range of  million to  million cash interest tightened to  million to  million which incorporates the permanent financing nongaap tax rate of  adjusted eps of  to  a share and capex of  million to  million now we do not historically give quarterly guidance but i thought it would be helpful to provide some color regarding the quarterly distribution of adjusted ebitda given the choppiness in the eleven deconversion the midpoint of the  ebitda guidance range is  million based on the first quarters results of  million that leaves a balance of  million for the back nine months which we believe will peak in q when considering the distribution of that  million i previously indicated that q could be down slightly yearoveryear and we believe ebitda for q could be up slightly yearoveryear we currently expect that the gbp headwind will anniversary in q which will benefit the yearoveryear comparison regarding eleven the deconversion plan has been firmed up and we expect it to begin in midq and complete sometime in the first quarter of  now let me close by commenting on the team thats highly focused on new business operational execution and integration were glad to be past this first quarter a period that incorporated the full agenda of integrating two acquisitions one being the largest in the companys history addressing the software and platform stability issue roll out of emv in the us and australia and undertaking a broad restructuring program we maintain our focus on positioning the company for steadier performance post the eleven deconversion in  and beyond and with that operator lets open up the line for questions questionandanswer session operator thank you and our first question comes from ramsey elassal from jefferies your line is open ramsey elassal  jefferies llc hi guys let me take a step back and basically get your take on your sort of most updated thoughts on given all the puts and takes with your growth rate here in q you stripped some of the kind of transitory impacts out it still felt like samestore sales is a little softer maybe us revenue is a little soft can you update us on your sort of perception of the organic growth profile of the business maybe total business and also just the us business steven a rathgaber  cardtronics plc well what i can say ramsey is that with all the moving parts in the quarter its hard to see some of these things as clearly as we would like the company remains committed to the organic growth goals that we have historically enjoyed i can declare that and we do have pipelines that are looking reasonable from that perspective but with all the noise in the quarter its just very difficult to focus on the organic growth rate alone in this particular quarter because of the adverse effects of the transaction challenges with the software but ed did you want to talk to any more detail on that okay so our goal remains the same we believe we will get back to that goal and it will be a bit more challenging because there is some samestore pressure that is evolving it seems the first quarter we wondered about the retailers experiences in january and february postholiday there was a lot of talk about retailer volume being down and we believe we felt some impact from that on a samestore basis but our revenue growth is going to come from new sales new transactions coming from banks and credit unions new atms coming from retail locations around the world and we believe we can have a solid growth rate organically from that material edward h west  cardtronics plc the only other thing i would add there is as steve was pointing out the first two months were quite negative particularly in the us but we actually saw that in other countries around the world as well and that did stabilize in march which was encouraging you just have so much other noise going on from a transaction particularly in the us and then now well combine that with eleven deconversion in the back half of the year which will further cloud that separately if you focus on the european segment actual samestore and thinking about the overall organic growth where we had approximately  on a constant currency terms was attractive in europe ramsey elassal  jefferies llc and thats europe exuk or inclusive of uk edward h west  cardtronics plc inclusive ramsey elassal  jefferies llc okay edward h west  cardtronics plc in the european segment as weve ramsey elassal  jefferies llc okay i see okay thank you one more the – youve commented on the uk regulatory decision today and respecting your need to be kind of cautious when talking about these types of things that are in process when i read the documentation there it sounded like the regulators are most concerned about surcharge machines which as i understand is a relative minority of the business that you do in that market although im a little less clear about the percentage of surcharge machines in the dcpayments footprint but is that a fair characterization of what theyre primarily interested in and as the implication does that theyre not really talking about the sort of the large majority of the revenue that you have over there but rather some kind of more sort of peripheral placements steven a rathgaber  cardtronics plc yeah i think while its – we do have to be cautious in commenting on that material i think your plain reading of the document it does reflect a reasonable point of view and for cardtronics the payasyougo – the nonfree atms in the uk the paytouse guys are like  of the volume – of the transactions in the uk so its a very small piece of the market and quite frankly were working with them to talk through why they are concerned about it and see where we get ramsey elassal  jefferies llc got it okay and lastly for me any update on link and the negotiations ongoing there any further updates or timelines or expectations you could update us on would be terrific steven a rathgaber  cardtronics plc again difficult to comment on those sort of closed industry wings there but the link process for interchange formulation has continued through this year on a normal course there are other discussions going on about how to adjust it but i think that its fair to say that that process will continue for several more months before we have any clarity but we are not expecting and a theme that seems to be consistent so were not expecting any dramatic changes in the near term ramsey elassal  jefferies llc okay great thanks thats all from me operator and our next question comes from kartik mehta from northcoast research your line is open kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc hey good evening gentlemen steve i think you indicated during your prepared remarks that there was a  headwind because some of the issues yet you maintained your guidance is that the reflection of other businesses that are doing well or you anticipate doing well or your recent acquisition as a part maybe that wasnt included in the original guidance be interested in your thoughts on that steven a rathgaber  cardtronics plc well i think what youre alluding to is we had a different view going into the quarter of what expectations were regarding street level estimates but given that we had that view were backing – were boxing back to the prior years quarter but it wasnt that we were terribly surprised by these numerics we expected and try to set the stage for that in our fourth quarter commentary does that help edward h west  cardtronics plc yeah i would just say most everything that we walked through and as steve mentioned and discussed through there was anticipated in the range that was provided and yes we did have the acquisition of spark atm systems in south africa were included in that for what steve went through steven a rathgaber  cardtronics plc yeah so no real surprises there kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc and then in the uk as far as the cma review is concerned is the next step that you will offer them a solution or is it that you negotiate a solution or they offer you a solution whats the next step in the process steven a rathgaber  cardtronics plc well the process as outlined in the documentation indicates that there is a period where the company can offer a solution and then theres a period of review theres also an opportunity to travel in a phase  investigation to go deeper into it with the cma office so they can understand different points of view like one that might suggest there isnt – doesnt need to be a concern so there are multiple ways to go at it its a pretty standard process but we expect it will take several months to work through as we get into this phase  part kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc and steve just a last question youre talking about being committed to your organic growth goals yet maybe i notice some hesitation and i was wondering if youve seen anything in this quarter or maybe whats happened so far that might give you pause as to whats happening in the industry or did those – its a misinterpretation on my end steven a rathgaber  cardtronics plc i think its a misinterpretation we are working to build the pipelines and to execute on a sixplus percentage organic growth rate and its just been a challenging couple of quarters with the operating problems but the pipelines the team weve put in place the product sets that were building we feel good about it and we will return to that number the hesitation if theres any that youre hearing is that we werent better this quarter and thats particularly frustrating to the team so it is in that vein that were concerned and it will take us time to ramp that back up through the year but thats why i commented on  being the point of strong return to that kartik mehta  northcoast research partners llc thank you very much i really appreciate it operator and our next question comes from andrew jeffrey from suntrust your line is open andrew jeffrey  suntrust robinson humphrey inc hi guys good afternoon steven a rathgaber  cardtronics plc good afternoon andrew jeffrey  suntrust robinson humphrey inc id like to just point – start with a point of clarification regarding the eleven deconversion timing to the extent that its going to slip into the first quarter of  does your  ebitda guidance has that changed such that now it includes some eleven revenue that you might not have previously i just want to clarify were talking applestoapples in the guidance edward h west  cardtronics plc we are talking applestoapples roughly theres a range and we still support the range that was in there and yes we have finalized with all the parties with eleven their new provider as well as mutual third party that we will be working with to coordinate everything and the deconversion as scheduled now does go into the early part of q of next year then i would just say based on the schedule and the estimates on that we believe the revenue flow through into  based on what we know right now represents less than  million andrew jeffrey  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay edward h west  cardtronics plc so its not a big change its in the bands that we previously provided andrew jeffrey  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay steve can you talk a little bit about some of the nice wins youve had in allpoint in terms of i guess one how they might affect normalized organic revenue growth this year and then as we get into next year it sounds like a little bit that your outlook for organic revenue growth is shifting a little bit toward some drivers like inbranch managed services and allpoint away explicitly from transactions so i guess two parts to the question one am i right in that perception and two maybe the discussion of kind of how allpoint contributes to the total organic revenue profile of the company steven a rathgaber  cardtronics plc sure sure well let me step back and remind you that for years the cardtronics growth story has been powered by multiple tracks of growth new atm placements branding sales allpoint participation and we expect those multiple tracks to continue to be fully functional and which is why weve expanded into now  markets so we can deploy those atms and bring in  or  or  atms a year to feed that part of organic growth on the allpoint side we have had as ive indicated a number of nice wins over the last four quarters with the larger financial institutions because there is some ramping up period and that they have to integrate it into their product offering but were already seeing some examples of increases in volume that are quite nice at some of the locations where some of the bigger banks have access to allpoint atms in terms of the overall growth though its going to be as it has been in the past a broad suite of our products were going to have a multibank branding product is one that has been stalled by the emv rollout in the us and the fact that were going to be close to having that fully complete in the third quarter thats going to be a source for pulling in transactions going forward certainly the samestore trends might be shaping up as a bit more challenging i dont think thats an untruth but when we get cleared and our availability is back to normal as we believe it is now well look to see what some of these samestore trends are doing to the extent that they run a little lighter than were used to well hopefully be poised to pour more volume in from the relationships were building with allpoint customers for our sales and to allpoint customers for products like multibank branding at  financial institutions that we can do more with so that will play into the total growth profile andrew jeffrey  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thats helpful thanks and if i can just circle back to the question ramsey asked about uk or european i guess organic revenue growth which i think you said was  despite a  decline in uk samestore sales did i get that right edward h west  cardtronics plc its actually just shy of  and its the european segment and its overall organic constant currency growth so remember we had a yearoveryear impact of i think it was roughly  in gbp impact exchange rate so when you put it in constant currency it does look more attractive and thats versus just samestore transaction growth what youre thinking of which was down in the uk of about  andrew jeffrey  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay so directionally i got that right i guess the implication is you had pretty good unit count growth i guess edward h west  cardtronics plc yes andrew jeffrey  suntrust robinson humphrey inc im wondering how sustainable that is and if the dynamics of that pretty meaningful spread between underlying revenue growth and samestore sales growth is sustainable or if thats kind of what we should expect i guess edward h west  cardtronics plc the team continues to do a great job and continues to have unit growth weve also had unit growth in other parts within europe as youll see in our press release by country also as branches pull back that gives us the opportunity in the uk to have more locations as well i will say theres a little bit of a headwind this year from a link standpoint as you know link is a cost base model and theres more of a headwind where last year we had a tailwind from a link cost to the formula andrew jeffrey  suntrust robinson humphrey inc okay thank you operator and our next question comes from cris kennedy from william blair your line is open cris d kennedy  william blair  co llc hey guys thanks for taking the question i know its very early but on the last call you kind of alluded that ebitda in  would exceed  are you more confident than that or any color on that would be great thank you edward h west  cardtronics plc sure good afternoon yeah we put that out there just kind of walking through because theres so much activity going on this year from a standpoint of a eleven coming out which overall eleven represents as weve talked about last quarter about  million in ebitda and then you have the flow in of dcpayments and now integrating that acquisition and in addition – additionally we discussed the notion of implementing overall cost improvement programs efficiency and restructuring which we really had some excellent strides on that and in full force and earnest there and expect to realize the  million and in fact in the guidance theres an excess of  million in savings of that that we would expect this year in  when you factor in all those matters we feel good about being able to exceed last years ebitda of the  million thats not guidance and its our focus to do better than that and so well update you all towards the latter part of the year and then going into our guidance for  with more color on that cris d kennedy  william blair  co llc great thank you edward h west  cardtronics plc thank you operator and our next question comes from reggie smith from jpmorgan your line is open reginald lawrence smith  jpmorgan securities llc hey guys thanks for taking my question i guess followup on an earlier question you guys have talked about i think a  drag from some of these trends and issues just curious where that came in relative to your expectations and then kind of whats the expectation for kind of q and when does that actually go away if you guys had any further color on that edward h west  cardtronics plc sure its a host of different things and as steve mentioned there was roughly at a  and frankly just one more item just to put on top of that which was nonrecurring is the tough compare from prior year which is the powerball and leap day and that adds actually another  on top of that with respect to the availability issues of software and epp and frankly the branding transition those have worked out those were timing we feel very good about the software stability now we have uptime performance thats equal to if not better than where we were before the rollout of the new software stack obviously the epp was resolved so thats done and moving on another large item of this was the emv chargebacks and maintenance costs when you combine those two together thats roughly  million ebitda impact and about  combined together thats going to continue on until we finalize the roll out were moving an earnest now in terms of enablement we have the majority of the fleet is enabled now on the emv and transaction emv announced just continuing to move through and slogging through to get that done but well still be exposed to emv chargebacks in the maintenance during this period of time i would say that that may have been a little bit higher but that will ebb throughout the balance of the year reginald lawrence smith  jpmorgan securities llc got it and then just kind of check on my notes i had down  million in savings in  and just kind of reading the press release its – the language that – i dont know if it was changed or modified was it always at least  million or are you – or were you signaling that it could be greater than that in  edward h west  cardtronics plc well it can be greater than that and so our confidence – like i said weve made great strides on that team is doing a terrific job operations globally are having efficiency opportunities day in and day out and continue to do more all up and down the pl and performance and this is both direct cost as well as overhead items so we feel good about the progress there and as i said already in this year we believe well be in excess of  million for this year reginald lawrence smith  jpmorgan securities llc got it if i could ask one last one im going to try here i guess you guys gave a eps range three months ago just curious if you are shading towards the high end low end i mean i know a lot has happened you had the first quarter go by and then eleven pushed out a little bit like are you still anchored at the middle or can you give us any color on which way you may be leaning there edward h west  cardtronics plc like you said we would try i would just say as weve said before as you would expect we feel like its a balanced range on all of these and well continue to give you updates and color reginald lawrence smith  jpmorgan securities llc perfect thank you guys edward h west  cardtronics plc okay thank you
