vice president of bcg and alan zakon former bcg chairman who had succeeded henderson as ceo and later chairman ideas and conceptsedit the experience curveedit main article experience curve effects costs characteristically decline by  in real terms each time accumulated experience doubles—bruce d henderson  the strategic implications of the experience curve came closer to shattering earth—the economist  the experience curve is a managerial tool primarily used to predict cost behavior it states that costs characteristically decline by  in real terms each time accumulated experience doubles this means that when inflation is factored out costs should always decline the decline is fast if growth is fast and slow if growth is slow the experience curve partially relies upon the concept of the learning curve yet expands upon it in delinking it from labordriven repetitive tasks as a managerial tool the experience curve is still in use in the s for example by petrobras in oilfield development the growthshare matrixedit main article growthshare matrix to be successful a company should have a portfolio of products with different growth rates and different market shares the portfolio composition is a function of the balance between cash flows—bruce d henderson  the growthshare matrix or bcg matrix as it came to be known is a managerial tool used to visually represent a companys portfolio it is a twobytwo matrix which divides the dimensions of relative market share x axis and market growth y axis into four quadrants individual business are represented with circles having an area proportional to the size of the business itself the growthshare matrix evolved as a collaborative effort of bcgers likely kent aldershof alan zakon sandy moose richard lochridge lorne weill bill bain and bruce henderson in the period between  the theory underpinning it was laid out in the bcg perspective the product portfolio in  one unusual characteristic of this visualization is that the xaxis is generally represented on an inverted scale greater values are on the left and on a logarithmic scale the logarithmic scale may have been carried over from the work done on the experience curve which uses a loglog scale and is not always consistently used as such  in many cases the scale used is a linear one not a logarithmic one according to mr aldershof the inverted scale is merely accidental during an early development session dr zakon sketched the twobytwo matrix on a chalkboard and labeled the sections as high and low from top to bottom and high and low from left to right simply for convenience the format persisted through later development sessions without anyone considering that in the future the axes might become calibrated—where a lowtohigh scale from left to right would be more typical and easier to produce the rule of three and fouredit a stable competitive market never has more than three significant competitors the largest of which has no more than four times the market share of the smallest—bruce d henderson  the rule of three and four is hendersons attempt to understand the implications of experience curves at the level of industry structures in such endeavor he conjectures that industries that are stable and competitive will evolve into a structure with no more than three significant competitors with market share ratios around  a recent attempt at proving the hypothesis showed that it does indeed hold true within its stated domain of applicability brinkmanship in businessedit the goal of the hottest economic war is an agreement for coexistence not annihilation—bruce d henderson  henderson said the article could equally be titled “how to succeed in business by being unreasonable” he wrote that to compete effectively it was necessary to appear to be cooperating while in fact ensuring you get your own way he compared business to international relations during peace time when countries compete ferociously but exercise restraint to avoid war business and biologyedit competition existed long before strategy it began with life itself—bruce d henderson  by the early s the lessons of the experience curve led henderson to shift his thinking beyond the bankruptcy of mainstream economics he began to imagine a new and far more powerful kind of economics the realization that organizations are not static machines but complex dynamic systems that learn from experience led him to begin seeing companies as living growing organisms following this logic henderson began to argue that the competition in the economys market niches was remarkably like competition in natures ecologic niches the article the origin of strategy  in this area was the last article he published personality and styleedit favorite quotesedit an engineer by training he never tired of quoting archimedes to aspiring staff give me a lever and a place to stand and i will move the world  carl w stern  he was fond of quoting jay forrester while most people understand firstorder effects few deal well with secondand thirdorder effects unfortunately virtually everything interesting in business lies in fourthorder effects and beyond—carl w stern  videos of bruce hendersonedit videos of bruce henderson have been posted on youtube see the links below httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvymzjjxsmw httpswwwyoutubecomwatchvcstndrnqm

his red pds sweater ca  henderson was born on a farm in nashville on april   he entered the peabody demonstration school pds in fourth grade in  where he remained until high school graduation in  he gave good accounts of his time there stating later that as a school pds was almost too good during high school henderson played football with the schools team and on one occasion broke a tooth and permanently damaged two others during a play hendersons first date with catherine porter was also at pds henderson began his career as a salesman for the southwestern company which his father owned for  years he went on to attend the university of virginiacitation needed and later earned an undergraduate degree in mechanical engineering from vanderbilt university in  before attending harvard business school he left hbs ninety days before graduation to work for the westinghouse corporation early careeredit after leaving hbs henderson worked  years at the westinghouse corporation where he became a vice president at the age of  one of the youngest vice presidents in the companys history in  henderson left the westinghouse corporation to join consulting firm arthur d little as a senior vice president for management services he left the firm in  over disagreements with the firms leadership founding and leadership of the boston consulting group bcgedit main article boston consulting group upon leaving arthur d little henderson accepted a challenge from the ceo of the boston company to create a consulting arm for the bank operating as a subsidiary under the name management and consulting division of the boston safe deposit and trust company this consulting arm started operations in  initially it advised clients of the bank the billings for the first month of bcg were only us nevertheless henderson hired his second consultant arthur p contas in december  henderson provided a very specific imprint to the firm that of strategy consultants as to how that choice was made the account from robert mainer is the main source for providing an answer henderson asked what we thought bcgs specialty should be many suggestions were offered but in each case we were able to identify several other firms that already had strong credentials in that particular area the discussion began to stall then bruce asked a momentous question what about business strategy i objected thats too vague most executives wont know what were talking about bruce replied thats the beauty of it well define it—robert e mainer boston  bruce created the publication format which came to be known as perspectives as a new form of marketing and in response to the mckinsey quarterly and adls prism he himself wrote extensively using such format until  in  bill bain left bcg with patrick graham and five other colleagues to found bain  company the exact account of the events surrounding his departure are disputed  except for the fact that it was not a friendly parting with henderson stating that it was war the japanese bombing of pearl harbor i felt more betrayed and robbed and desecrated than ever before in my life the bitterness eventually went away with henderson stating that bill is an imaginative man he is a very able man i wish he had stayed in  henderson made bcg an independent business and was one of the first to take advantage of the employee retirement income security act of  that allowed the establishment of an employee stock ownership plan esop the esop began the process of buying bcg from the boston company the parent corporation of boston safe deposit the buyout would be completed in  five years ahead of schedule between  and  henderson focused on growing the firm and expanding its international presence by the end of  revenues were split evenly between business originating in the united states and overseas retirement and later yearsedit henderson stepped down from his role as president and ceo of bcg in  and was succeeded by alan zakon by

a blizzard speakers at the service included john s clarkeson thenpresident and chief executive officer of bcg george stalk a senior vice president of bcg and alan zakon former bcg chairman who had succeeded henderson as ceo and later chairman ideas and conceptsedit the experience curveedit main article experience curve effects costs characteristically decline by  in real terms each time accumulated experience doubles—bruce d henderson  the strategic implications of the experience curve came closer to shattering earth—the economist  the experience curve is a managerial tool primarily used to predict cost behavior it states that costs characteristically decline by  in real terms each time accumulated experience doubles this means that when inflation is factored out costs should always decline the decline is fast if growth is fast and slow if growth is slow the experience curve partially relies upon the concept of the learning curve yet expands upon it in delinking it from labordriven repetitive tasks as a managerial tool the experience curve is still in use in the s for example by petrobras in oilfield development the growthshare matrixedit main article growthshare matrix to be successful a company should have a portfolio of products with different growth rates and different market shares the portfolio composition is a function of the balance between cash flows—bruce d henderson  the growthshare matrix or bcg matrix as it came to be known is a managerial tool used to visually represent a companys portfolio it is a twobytwo matrix which divides the dimensions of relative market share x axis and market growth y axis into four quadrants individual business are represented with circles having an area proportional to the size of the business itself the growthshare matrix evolved as a collaborative effort of bcgers likely kent aldershof alan zakon sandy moose richard lochridge lorne weill bill bain and bruce henderson in the period between  the theory underpinning it was laid out in the bcg perspective the product portfolio in  one unusual characteristic of this visualization is that the xaxis is generally represented on an inverted scale greater values are on the left and on a logarithmic scale the logarithmic scale may have been carried over from the work done on the experience curve which uses a loglog scale and is not always consistently used as such  in many cases the scale used is a linear one not a logarithmic one according to mr aldershof the inverted scale is merely accidental during an early development session dr zakon sketched the twobytwo matrix on a chalkboard and labeled the sections as high and low from top to bottom and high and low from left to right simply for convenience the format persisted through later development sessions without anyone considering that in the future the axes might become calibrated—where a lowtohigh scale from left to right would be more typical and easier to produce the rule of three and fouredit a stable competitive market never has more than three significant competitors the largest of which has no more than four times the market share of the smallest—bruce d henderson  the rule of three and four is hendersons attempt to understand the implications of experience curves at the level of industry structures in such endeavor he conjectures that industries that are stable and competitive will evolve into a structure with no more than three significant competitors with market share ratios around  a recent attempt at proving the hypothesis showed that it does indeed hold true within its stated domain of applicability brinkmanship in businessedit the goal of the hottest economic war is an agreement for coexistence not annihilation—bruce d henderson  henderson said the article could equally be titled “how to succeed in business by being unreasonable” he wrote that to compete effectively it was necessary to appear to be cooperating while in fact ensuring you get your own way he compared business to international relations during peace time when countries compete ferociously but exercise restraint to avoid war business and biologyedit competition existed long before strategy it began with life itself—bruce d henderson  by the early s the lessons of the experience curve led henderson to shift his thinking beyond the bankruptcy of mainstream economics he began to imagine a new and far more powerful kind of economics the realization that organizations are not static machines but complex dynamic systems that learn from experience led him to begin seeing companies as living growing organisms following this logic henderson began to argue that the competition in the economys market niches was remarkably like competition in natures ecologic niches the article the origin of strategy  in this area was the last article he published personality and styleedit favorite quotesedit an engineer by training he never tired of quoting archimedes to aspiring staff give me a lever and a place to stand and i will move the world  carl w stern  he was fond of quoting jay forrester while most people understand firstorder effects few deal well with secondand thirdorder effects unfortunately virtually everything interesting in business lies in fourthorder effects and beyond—carl w stern  videos of bruce hendersonedit videos of

lunar researcher no comments · by david gilbert · erector sets hansen bruce vehicles  transport bruce hansen writes this model is an splr self propelled lunar researcher built from a  master engineer type iii set the set came out right after apollo  had landed on the moon not coincidentally a large number of the models illustrated in the manual were moonspace vehicles the action in this model is a powermatic motorhoist powered crane with hook and boom control also a pair of antennas rotates and the whole model moves forwardback via walking “legs” the master engineer set included two powermatic motors and a v transformer both motors were not under power at the same time a spdt switch alternated power to the appropriate motor here’s a shot of the model’s back side showing the selector switch hoist motor for the crane functions and the antenna the antennas were driven via a pair of p mitre gears and p pulleysstring type ii enthusiasts will be familiar with the mitre gears which were included in type ii sets size   on up for around  years this happened to be the last set to include the mitre gears the drive “legs” are powered by a second powermatic motor which is geared down to  its slowest speed with a pair of  tooth sprocketladder chain reductions the output shaft has a bt pierced disc on either side with a “leg” made from a square angle girder assembly the model actually works quite well the crane hoist is a typical type iii setup which always worked well the walking action was very smooth after i extended the “box” that the leg travels updown and pivots on by ” in fact it walked about twice as fast as the type ii walking giantrobots i’ve built in the past about  ft per minute the manual shows the antennas reversed from my model i found the stringpulleys couldn’t drive the larger antenna so i flipped them so the heavy one was directly driven by the motor bruce hansen’s tanks no comments · by david gilbert · erector sets hansen bruce vehicles  transport bruce hansen’s light tank bruce hansen writes this is the light tank built from a    set manual the p motor moves the tank forwardreverse there is an error in the manual regarding this model it notes that the motor gearbox setup is “b” instead of “c” the model moves along at about  inchessecond with motor setup “c” the p does not have enough torque to make it go with setup “b” plus the model would have theoretically moved along at about  inchessecond video of a near duplicate of this light tank bruce hansen’s heavy tank bruce hansen writes this is the heavy tank built from a    set manual the p motor moves the tank forwardreverse the heavy tank moves along at about  inchessecond bruce hansen’s half track no comments · by david gilbert · erector sets hansen bruce vehicles

type iii cement mixer truck model built from a  no  master power set the  master power was the only set to include a number of parts this particular model used a couple of them the  programmer and the  programmer reversing switch the  powermatic motor sat between the  programmer and the  drum hoist and powered both the hoist shift lever was connected to the programmer with a link bar in operation the programmer cycled the hoist between its two drums when the programmer reached the end of a cycle a cam tripped the  reversing switch which reversed the motor and repeated the cycle in operation the cement truck drove forward while the mixer bucket turned after a second “drive” it paused and the dump chute in back lowered the reverse switch was tripped at this point so the cycle was reversed the dump chute raised then the cement truck drove in reverse for  seconds a couple of trivia comments about this model the master power set had  illustrated models three of them used the  programmer the cement truck model was the only one that used the  reversing switch this model was also the last truck model that had steering it had a working steering wheel and steering knuckles bruce hansen’s
