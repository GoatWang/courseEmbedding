build our first solid wood furniture cabinet under flat screen tv it could not be easier to use but here are some hints read the paper instructions inside the dvd packet its much quicker than navigating the dvd proper setup is required or the tip of your drill will run into the base of the jig see item  plan on mounting this jig to something more stable as it requires multiple hands when

new yankee workshop and rushed out to get one i have over the years built several projects with the jig and have loved every minute however that being said there are a couple of things the new user should be aware of  if you use glue on your projects be aware it not only serves to strengthen the project in the beginning it will act as a lubricant and make getting your joints flush difficult  if your want perfect joints clamp clamp clamp the force of the screws will force the piece out of alignment beyond that get one of these and build your little heart out  was this review helpful yes  no

recent review sort highest to lowest sort lowest to highest good quality solid work surfaces and a few challenges the kreg table is sturdy has a large sturdy work surface but can be a challenge to set up perfectly it took a bit of ingenuity to drill the insert plate and perfectly center the router even with the video on the kreg site i needed to create a drilling jig to perfectly center my router perfect centering is needed if one uses a guide bushing the fence does stay aligned but it takes two hands to reposition adjustment of nylon screws is crucial for maintaining alignment and squaring the fence the snapin vacuum port works but is not robust it often pulls out of the fence if one uses a shop vac it would be preferred to have a port made of more robust material that screws in or clamps to the fencethe table comes with  insert rings i found that i needed rings that were closer in size to my bits so i purchased a ring set with more sizes i also decided that i needed a switch so i could operate a router and vacuum finally the assembled table is sturdy and heavy that is great if the table is used in a stationary location however if you need to move the table you will need high end lockable casters that are very pricey was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate september   bob a purchased over  years ago woodworking experience intermediate was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate an incredible add to my shop as i was assembling this router table i could tell it was high quality including the stand the table top and the precision fence i takes a little time to complete the assembly but it is well worth it i love the precise adjustability of the fence its an incredible addition to my shop and i smile everytime i use it well worth the money spent was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate september   doug s purchased over  years ago woodworking experience intermediate was this review helpful yes  no  flag as inappropriate a great addition to my shop i had been using a homemade extension to my table saw for a router it served me ok for several years but when i wanted to do angle cuts on my table saw i had to remove the router i finally bit the bullet and after a lot of research purchased this package along with additional brake wheels i have never been sorry although this package cost me nearly as much as my table saw it has been worth every penny someday i hope to get a router lift but in the meantime it is much handier than my homemade one i would definitely recommend this package to the hobbyist or serious

hangers and mounting brackets cut in half joints every ten feet with pins clamps or splices figure  shaped carbon steel conductors bulky space requirements three or four separate bars to install oversized conductors for hoists and monorails fast easy installation means more profits the key to tightwire is an increase in labor savings typically a large amount of installation time is used to weld the mounting brackets to the building tightwire’s unique design allows hanger spacing of  feet instead of the usual  feet by tensioning the system from each end using heavy springs thus the “tightwire” name the time and cost of installing mounting brackets and hangers is cut in half in addition tightwire speeds up installation with its onepiece design all conductors are pre assembled in a onepiece extruded insulator this assembly is supplied on a roll with no joints to the exact total length needed for each project foot single bars joint pins screws covers downtime and maintenance

operators and others with extensive crane experience know that electrical joints are the most common source of crane electrification problems among other things electrical joints become loose over time overheat expand and contract and can cause a loss of power spanguard was the first continuous jointfree electric conductor bar introduced spanguard is uniquely designed with no electric joints in the solid copper conductor and the flexible fullyenclosed insulated cover provides the most reliable highest quality conductor system on the market this jointless conductor is ideal for cranes hoists and moving equipment where problems and downtime cannot be tolerated superior design means fewer parts to repair or replace and minimal maintenance the solid copper conductors and cover ship preassembled on a reel and come in  and  amp sizes the spring loaded collectors come in    and  amp sizes stainless steel is optional capable of running jointfree at lengths up to  feet spanguard eliminates the power loss and overheating associated with the unreliable electrical joints of other heavy industrial power systems our springloaded collectors use a carbongraphite shoe and are more reliable and less costly to maintain than wheel based trolley systems because fewer moving parts require less maintenance the spring loaded collectors automatically compensate for upanddown and sidetoside misalignments between the trolley electrification bars and the crane runway unsurpassed durability the spanguard system’s heavy duty design and construction allows it to take abuses that other systems would not survive making it the ideal choice for heavy duty highly corrosive environments spanguard systems can sustain highwear applications acid and corrosive fumes moisture and severe outdoor weather including temperatures from ºf to ºf or ºf to ºf for low temperatures easy installation and maintenance spanguard has fewer parts than other systems allowing for faster installation upfront and less maintenance in the future the system is comprised of an electrical conductor such as hard drawn copper that is completely enclosed by a flexible insulating cover advanced
