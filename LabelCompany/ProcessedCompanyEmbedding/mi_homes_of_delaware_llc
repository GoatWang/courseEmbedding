formationdocumenting your operating agreementbefore filing the certificate of formation you must first check the prospective business name with the delaware secretary of state for conflicts which can be done online at incnowcomadditionally delaware law requires that all new llcs have either “limited liability company” “llc” or “llc” in the company name if at a later date you want to change your llc name you can do so through an amendment to the certificate of formationdelaware registered agent requirementyou can form an llc in delaware without visiting opening an office or maintaining a bank account in delaware however the delaware llc act requires any company incorporated in delaware to have a delaware registered agent with an instate street address agents and corporations inc incnow

available during business hours to accept and forward court notices to you service of process the registered agent will be there for the life of your company so it’s important to find one that is professional and reliable agents and corporations incnow has been a delaware registered agent since  and at the same office since  incnow is family operated by delaware attorneys who specialize in corporate lawdelaware certificate of formation requirementsour office will sign as the authorized person also known as an organizer and file a certificate of formation with the secretary of state’s division of corporations to form the delaware llc on public record your name and address are not listed on public filings unless requested by you other states refer to this document as articles of organization but delaware does not use that terma certificate of formation must includethe name of the llcthe name and address of the registered agentthe signature of an authorized individualof special note if the delaware llc is a series llc which protects assets of parts of the llc from the liabilities of other parts of the llc then this must be indicated on the certificate of formation more information on the series llc may be found elsewhere on this site many optional provisions could also be included in the certificate of formation upon special request we can include the names of members andor managers on the certificate of formationdelaware llc operating agreementwith our complete package we draft an operating agreement to set forth the ownership and management structure and procedures delaware requires that llcs have an operating agreement that will govern it however delaware does not require that the operating agreement be filed with the state or even be in writingit is recommended that you have a written signed agreement even in a singlemember delaware llc the operating agreement is important because it provides a decisionmaking structure that will benefit the llc when dealing with other entities increase protection and increase credibility for financial transactions the operating agreement will include provisions such as liability ownership dissolution and transfer of interest among othersmany incorporation services use boilerplate agreements without provisions to prevent common problems a wellcrafted delaware operating agreement should serve like a prenuptial agreement to avoid any partnership disputes between members should any member decide to go in a different directionsigning the llc operating agreementonce the delaware operating agreement has been drafted and approved all members should execute it most delaware llcs as a practical matter will not draft and finalize the operating agreement until after formation many formal requirements of corporations such as those related to voting and annual meetings are not required by llcs  to this extent many wellcrafted operating agreements will avoid bureaucracy to streamline your business operationswhile an operating agreement can be enforceable unsigned it is more difficult to prove that an unsigned operating agreement was agreed upon by all members in multimember llcs it is especially important to have a signed operating agreement should you change the agreement or ownership structure an amended and restated llc operating agreement should be signed each time the agreement changes top  reasons to form an llc in delaware delaware llcs offer the most protection for you and your business with twoway protectionby forming a delaware llc you safeguard your personal assets by building a shield between them and your business liabilities this means that if the business itself cannot pay a creditor then this shield makes it difficult for creditors to penetrate into your personal assets such as your house car and other personal possessionsdelaware explicitly makes the “charging order” the sole and exclusive remedy for creditors of llc members this prevents creditors of your business partners from taking over the company creditors of a member can only get an economic interest in the llc’s distributions to that member not a control interest or a right to liquidate the llc delaware’s laws provide the strongest shield of any statedelaware governs the internal affairs of your company including its liability shield the corporate protection or “corporate shield” afforded by the delaware llc act which protects the personal assets of individual owners from creditors of their business is thicker than any protection offered in any other state delaware llcs can operate in almost any state or countryyou can form a delaware llc no matter where your business activities take place or where you live in the united states outside the united states there are very few countries and individuals restricted from using a delaware llc and a delaware llc does not need to have a bank account or office in delaware a registered agent such as incnow maintains a physical address in delaware required to forward court and delaware government notices to you delaware treats you like an adult and lets you manage your businesswhen entering into a delaware llc it is flexible in ownership and management structure one individual can serve as both the owner and manager an llc is governed by its operating agreement allowing you to arrange your business affairs between owners as you see fit and have that arrangement enforced as written since the llc is a contractual entity it is important that the delaware courts honor the contract between the parties as written furthermore there is no required annual general meeting and there is much less administrative paperwork in general compared to a corporation managers are protected from lawsuitsthe llc agreement in delaware can reduce or eliminate fiduciary duties this allows business managers and controlling managing members the flexibility to take risks that are not readily questioned by minority investors provided such actions are not in bad faith even if the fiduciary duties are not waived or reduced business managers have the freedom to make business decisions even if losses result without manager liability provided the decisions are not selfdealing even selfdealing is not entirely prohibited instead selfdealing needs to be “entirely fair” to the other members no delaware income tax if your operations are in other states and other business tax loopholesthere is no delaware tax return to file for llcs that are formed in delaware provided they conduct no business in delawareas with llcs in other states profits are taxed personally at the member level but not at the llc level an llc is taxed as a sole proprietorship or partnership unless it elects scorporation or ccorporation tax statushaving an llc that elects to be taxed as an scorporation can save thousands in selfemployment taxes because your income can be split  between selfemployment income and “sdividend” income the sdividend can reduce your taxes by thousands for example splitting  of income would save the selecting llc member more than  in social security and medicare taxes learn more about these advantages in our llc tax tips section delaware’s speedy approvals and filingsthe delaware secretary of state’s office maintains extended hours for filing and can expedite filings to as fast as one hour you can use a delaware llc to own and manage almost anythingthe business uses can range from one person sales or consulting businesses to multimillion dollar commercial properties it may operate an active business or simply hold passive assets like real estate or intellectual propertymost common uses includeto hold real property such as personal or business real estateto operate a service businessto hold tangible personal property or intangible assets such as airplanes automobiles boats and patents delaware’s business courts handle business disputes in weeks not yearsdelaware has a separate court for the resolution of business disputes the court of chancery its appointed judges are highly experienced in business cases and effectively solve corporate disputes in a way that other states do not there are no jury trials in the court of chancery so court’s expertise is brought to bear in the decision of every case before the courtthe delaware court system can act very quickly sometimes the whole process from start to finish discovery and motions to trial decisions can be over in two months written decisions from the court of chancery are the standard and are often  pages long this wellreasoned process avoids arbitrary outcomes even appeals to the delaware supreme court can be expedited the delaware judges do their homework and read all the pleadings carefully before hearings and trials delaware has the most probusiness laws of any us statedelaware’s law is generally thought to be probusiness and has a “goldilocks” balance of being stable and slowly evolving – to be cutting edge without upsetting existing businesses because of the maturity of delaware’s law and the high volume of corporate cases handled by delaware’s judicial system there is predictability in outcomesthis means if there have been several similar cases to the one facing your llc there is less uncertainty about the judicial outcome which can be key in deciding to settle a dispute or invest the time and capital to litigate even when judges change it is not a favoritism or political system judges in delaware make reasoned nonpolitical decisions more about llcswhat is a delaware
