not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any substantive discussions directly or indirectly with any business combination target while we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any sector or geographical location we intend to focus on the sector that complements our management teams expertise in the exploration exploitation operation and development of crude oil and natural gas wells and

in the event that we find an acquisition opportunity in a different sector or in a different geographic region that is more compelling than the opportunities presented to us in to the us oil and gas

attention to opportunities outside of the us oil and gas industry we will seek to acquire one or more businesses with an aggregate enterprise value of approximately  million to  billion business opportunity overview our strategy is to source acquire and after our initial business combination build an oil and gas exploration and production ep business ep companies focus on finding producing and marketing various forms of crude oil and natural gas we believe that there is a unique and timely opportunity to achieve attractive returns by acquiring and developing ep assets in proven basins with known operational and limited geologic risks we believe this opportunity exists due to several key factors i the recent decline of commodity prices had an immediate and meaningful impact on the cash flows of ep companies creating a need for many ep firms to issue external capital or sell assets ii the recent decline of commodity prices has substantially reduced ep asset valuations and is moderating drilling and completion costs and operating costs resulting in a lower cost to acquire and develop iii the shortterm volatility and cyclical nature of commodity prices underpinned by a positive longterm outlook for crude oil and natural gas demand and the need for higher commodity prices to meet expected demand growth and iv the advantages enjoyed by ep companies operating in the us including access to industryleading technologies and expertise toptier oil and gasproducing basins established infrastructure and favorable political policies relative to other regions      table of

previous experience as sponsor or in a management capacity with other blank check companies initial business combination nasdaq rules provide that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least  of the balance in the trust account less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination if our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses we will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or a qualified independent accounting firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria if our securities are not listed on nasdaq after this offering we would not be required to satisfy the  requirement however we intend to satisfy the  requirement even if our securities are not listed on nasdaq at the time of our initial business combination although we would not be obligated to do so pursuant to any contractual or charter provision or otherwise we anticipate structuring our initial business combination so that the posttransaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire  of the outstanding equity interests or assets of the target business or businesses we may however structure our initial business combination such that the posttransaction company owns or acquires less than  of such interests or assets of the target business in order to meet certain objectives of the target management team or stockholders or for other reasons but we will only complete such business combination if the posttransaction company owns or acquires  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act of  as amended or the investment company act even if the posttransaction company owns or acquires  or more of the voting securities of the target our stockholders prior to the business combination may collectively own a minority      table of contents interest in the posttransaction company depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction for example we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target in this case we would acquire a  controlling interest in the target however as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares our stockholders immediately prior to our initial business combination could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares subsequent to our initial business combination if less than  of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses are owned or acquired by the posttransaction company the portion of such business or businesses that is owned or acquired is what will be valued for purposes of the  fair market value test if the business combination involves more than one target business the  fair market value test will be based on the aggregate value of all of the target businesses consistent with this strategy we have identified the following general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses we will use these criteria and guidelines in evaluating acquisition opportunities but we may decide to enter into our initial business combination with a target business that does not meet these criteria and guidelines  middlemarket focus   we will seek to acquire one or more businesses with an aggregate enterprise value of approximately  million to  billion determined in the sole discretion of our officers and directors according to reasonably accepted valuation standards and methodologies we believe that this segment of the market presents the greatest number of opportunities for investment additionally klr group predominantly advises companies in this segment and has a broad network of established relationships  operations in the us   we will seek to acquire one or more companies with oil and gas operations within the us specifically in the lower  our management team has substantial experience building and operating offshore assets in the gulf of mexico but given current opportunities in the market we prefer to focus onshore we will seek assets in any of the proven producing oil and gas basins with sufficient access to infrastructure and end markets  producing reserves and future development upside   we will seek to acquire one or more companies with significant reserves classified as proved developed producing pdp and generating cash flow from production we will also seek undeveloped inventory that is economic to develop based on forward strip pricing and regional pricing forecasts which will serve as future inventory for development and a growth driver for our company we will not seek to acquire only undeveloped acreage  high quality geology   we will seek to acquire assets or companies that have acreage with high reservoir quality rock that has been proven to be productive we prefer areas that allow us to develop and produce out of multiple horizons within one geologic formation multiple productive geologic formations or stacked pay that can be developed from a single location on the surface and potential for increased production through downspacing enhanced recovery methods eg waterfloods or other means  optimization of operations   we will seek to acquire assets or companies with opportunities to reduce costs boost production or otherwise optimize operations that would result in improved economics and returns to stockholders  companies with strong operating teams   we will seek to acquire one or more companies with a management team that has a proven track record operating their assets we prefer companies that have expertise in the area in which their assets are located we also prefer teams that have had a high degree of success developing assets with minimal execution missteps resulting in mechanical failure or other issues additionally we will seek management teams that have successfully lowered operating costs through development efficiencies technical expertise and strong contractual knowhow these criteria are not intended to be exhaustive any evaluation relating to the merits of a particular initial business combination may be based to the extent relevant on these general guidelines as well as other considerations factors and criteria that our management may deem relevant we believe we can source      table of contents acquisition targets consistent with the acquisition criteria from familyowned companies sponsored companies distressed companies and noncore assets of large companies among others in addition the members of our board of directors have significant executive management and public company experience with ep companies over the course of their careers the members of our management team and board of directors have developed a broad network of contacts and corporate relationships that we believe will be useful for sourcing investment opportunities this network has been developed through our management teams experience in  sourcing acquiring operating developing growing financing and selling businesses and  executing transactions under varying economic and financial market conditions this network has provided our management team with a flow of referrals that have resulted in numerous transactions we believe that the network of contacts and relationships of our management team will provide us with an important source of investment opportunities in addition we anticipate that target business candidates will be brought to our attention from various unaffiliated sources including investment market participants private equity groups investment banks consultants accounting firms and large business enterprises our president in connection with his duties at klr and rodman  renshaw has raised and participated in over  billion in equity over  billion in debt and  million in ma transactions over the past five years in evaluating a prospective target business we expect to conduct a thorough due diligence review which will encompass among other things meetings with incumbent management and employees document reviews and inspection of facilities as well as a review of financial and other information which will be made available to us we are not prohibited from pursuing an initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor officers or directors in the event we seek to complete our initial business combination with a company that is affiliated with our sponsor officers or directors we or a committee of independent directors will obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or a qualified independent accounting firm that our initial business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view members of our management team may directly or indirectly own common stock and warrants following this offering and accordingly may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is an appropriate business with which to effectuate our initial business combination further each of our officers and directors may have a conflict of interest with respect to evaluating a particular business combination if the retention or resignation of any such officers and directors was included by a target business as a

banking firm we will complete our initial business combination only if the posttransaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own or acquire  or more of the outstanding voting

engage in such transactions they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by regulation m under the exchange act subsequent to the consummation of this offering we will adopt an insider trading policy which will require insiders to i refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information and ii to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution we cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a rule b plan as it will be dependent upon several factors including but not limited to the timing and size of such purchases depending on such circumstances our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a rule b plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary         we do not currently anticipate that such purchases if any would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the exchange act or a goingprivate transaction subject to the goingprivate rules under the exchange act however if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules the purchasers will comply      table of contents     with such rules our initial stockholders

with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination manner of conducting redemptions         we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their public shares upon the completion of our initial business combination either i in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or ii by means of a tender offer the decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us solely in our discretion and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than  of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval we intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the sec unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons         if a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons we

offer to redeem will remain open for at least  business days in accordance with rule ea under the exchange act and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period in addition the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  upon the consummation of our initial business combination so that we are not subject to the secs penny stock rules or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination if public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination         if however stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons we will            conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to regulation a of the exchange act which regulates the solicitation of proxies and not pursuant to the tender offer rules and            file proxy materials with the sec         if we seek stockholder approval we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination in such case our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination and our executive officers directors and director nominees have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination public stockholders may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective      table of contents     of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or if we conduct a tender offer         our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  upon the consummation of our initial business combination so that we are not subject to the secs penny stock rules redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination for example the proposed business combination may require i cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners ii cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or iii the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination in the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares and all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof redemption rights in connection with proposed amendments to our certificate of incorporation         some other blank check companies have a provision in their charter which prohibits the amendment of certain charter provisions our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that any of its provisions related to prebusiness combination activity including the requirement to deposit proceeds of this offering and the private placement of warrants into the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances and to provide redemption rights to public stockholders as described herein may be amended if approved by holders

trust account including interest which interest shall be net of income taxes payable divided by the number of then outstanding public shares however we may not redeem our public shares in an amount

section entitled management  committees of the board of directors  audit committee indemnification of trust account         edward kovalik has agreed to be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering      table of contents     into a transaction agreement reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below i  per public share or ii such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay income taxes except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities including liabilities under the securities act moreover in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party mr kovalik will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims we have not independently verified whether mr kovalik has sufficient funds to satisfy its indemnity obligations and therefore mr kovalik may not be able to satisfy those obligations we have not asked mr kovalik to reserve for such eventuality we believe the likelihood mr kovalik having to indemnify the trust account is limited because we will endeavor to have all vendors and prospective target businesses as well as other entities execute agreements with us waiving any right title interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account      table of contents risks we are a

contents risk factors an investment in our securities involves a high degree of risk you should consider carefully all of the risks described below together with the other information contained in this prospectus before making a decision to invest in our units if any of the following events occurs our business financial condition and operating results may be materially adversely affected in that event the trading price of our securities could decline and you could lose all or part of your investment we are a newly formed development stage company with no operating history and no revenues and you have no basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective we are a recently formed development stage company with no operating results and we will not commence operations until obtaining funding through this offering because we lack an operating history you have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective of completing our initial business combination with one or more target businesses we have no plans arrangements or understandings with any prospective target business concerning a business combination and may be unable to complete our business combination if we fail to complete our business combination we will never generate any operating revenues our independent registered public accounting firms report contains an explanatory paragraph that expresses substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as of december   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficiency of approximately  further we have incurred and expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our acquisition plans managements plans to address this need for capital through this offering are discussed in the section of this prospectus titled managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our plans to raise capital and to consummate our initial business combination may not be successful these factors among others raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern the financial statements contained elsewhere in this prospectus do not include any adjustments that might result from our inability to consummate this offering or our inability to continue as a going concern our public stockholders may not be afforded an opportunity to vote on our proposed business combination which means we may complete our initial business combination even though a majority of our public stockholders do not support such a combination we may not hold a stockholder vote to approve our initial business combination unless the business combination would require stockholder approval under applicable state law or the rules of nasdaq or if we decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other reasons for instance the nasdaq rules currently allow us to engage in a tender offer in lieu of a stockholder meeting but would still require us to obtain stockholder approval if we were seeking to issue more than  of our outstanding shares to a target business as consideration in any business combination therefore if we were structuring a business combination that required us to issue more than  of our outstanding shares we would seek stockholder approval of such business combination however except for as required by law the decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or will allow stockholders to sell their shares to us in a tender offer will be made by us solely in our discretion and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would otherwise require us to seek stockholder approval accordingly we may consummate our initial business combination even if holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of our common stock do not approve of the business combination we consummate please see the section entitled proposed business  stockholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination for additional information if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination our initial stockholders and our executive officers directors and director nominees have agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination regardless of how our public stockholders vote our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares as well as any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination our initial stockholders will own      table of contents  of our outstanding shares of common stock immediately following the completion of this offering assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering in addition our executive officers directors and director nominees have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination accordingly if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination it is more likely that the necessary stockholder approval will be received than would be the case if our initial stockholders and our executive officers directors and director nominees agreed to vote their founder shares and public shares as applicable in accordance with the majority of the votes cast by our public stockholders your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination will be limited to the exercise of your right to redeem your shares from us for cash unless we seek stockholder approval of the business combination at the time of your investment in us you will not be provided with an opportunity to evaluate the specific merits or risks of one or more target businesses since our board of directors may complete a business combination without seeking stockholder approval public stockholders may not have the right or opportunity to vote on the business combination unless we seek such stockholder vote accordingly your only opportunity to affect the investment decision regarding a potential business combination may be limited to exercising your redemption rights within the period of time which will be at least  business days set forth in our tender offer documents mailed to our public stockholders in which we describe our initial business combination the ability of our public stockholders to redeem their shares for cash may make our financial condition unattractive to potential business combination targets which may make it difficult for us to enter into a business combination with a target we may seek to enter into a business combination transaction agreement with a prospective target that requires as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash if too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights we would not be able to meet such closing condition and as a result would not be able to proceed with the business combination furthermore in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  upon the consummation of our initial business combination so that we are not subject to the secs penny stock rules or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination consequently if accepting all properly submitted redemption requests would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  upon the consummation of our initial business combination or such greater amount necessary to satisfy a closing condition as described above we would not proceed with such redemption and the related business combination and may instead search for an alternate business combination prospective targets will be aware of these risks and thus may be reluctant to enter into a business combination transaction with us the ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares may not allow us to complete the most desirable business combination or optimize our capital structure at the time we enter into an agreement for our initial business combination we will not know how many stockholders may exercise their redemption rights and therefore will need to structure the transaction based on our expectations as to the number of shares that will be submitted for redemption if our business combination agreement requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing we will need to reserve a portion of the cash in the trust account to meet such requirements or arrange for third party financing in addition if a larger number of shares are submitted for redemption than we initially expected we may need to restructure the transaction to reserve a greater portion of the cash in the trust account or arrange for third party financing raising additional third party financing may involve dilutive equity issuances or the incurrence of indebtedness at higher than desirable levels the above considerations may limit our ability to complete the most desirable business combination available to us or optimize our capital structure      table of contents the ability of our public stockholders to exercise redemption rights with respect to a large number of our shares could increase the probability that our initial business combination is not consummated and that you would have to wait for liquidation in order to redeem your stock if the definitive agreement for our business combination requires us to use a portion of the cash in the trust account to pay the purchase price or requires us to have a minimum amount of cash at closing the probability that our initial business combination would not be consummated is increased if our initial business combination is not consummated you would not receive your pro rata portion of the trust account until we liquidate the trust account in connection with our liquidation if you are in need of immediate liquidity you could attempt to sell your stock in the open market however at such time our stock may trade at a discount to the pro rata amount per share in the trust account in either situation you may suffer a material loss on your investment or lose the benefit of funds expected in connection with our redemption until we liquidate or you are able to sell your stock in the open market the requirement that we complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame may give potential target businesses leverage over us in negotiating a business combination and may decrease our ability to conduct due diligence on potential business combination targets as we approach our dissolution deadline which could undermine our ability to complete our business combination on terms that would produce value for our stockholders any potential target business with which we enter into negotiations concerning a business combination will be aware that we must complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering consequently such target business may obtain leverage over us in negotiating a business combination knowing that if we do not complete our initial business combination with that particular target business we may be unable to complete our initial business combination with any target business this risk will increase as we get closer to the timeframe described above in addition we may have limited time to conduct due diligence and may enter into our initial business combination on terms that we would have rejected upon a more comprehensive investigation we may not be able to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame in which case we would cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up and we would redeem our public shares and liquidate our sponsor executive officers directors and director nominees have agreed that we must complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering we may not be able to find a suitable target business and complete our initial business combination within such time period if we have not completed our initial business combination within such time period we will i cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up ii as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem the public shares at a pershare price payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest which interest shall be net of income taxes payable divided by the number of then outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders including the right to receive further liquidation distributions if any subject to applicable law and iii as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors dissolve and liquidate subject in the case of clauses ii and iii to our obligations under delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination our sponsor directors executive officers advisors and their affiliates may elect to purchase shares from public stockholders which may influence a vote on a proposed business combination and reduce the public float of our common stock if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our sponsor directors executive officers advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination although they are under no obligation to do so such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and      table of contents therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights in the event that our sponsor directors executive officers advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares the purpose of such purchases could be to vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met this may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible in addition if such purchases are made the public float of our common stock and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced possibly making it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange if a stockholder fails to receive notice of our offer to redeem our public shares in connection with our business combination or fails to comply with the procedures for tendering its shares such shares may not be redeemed we will comply with the tender offer rules or proxy rules as applicable when conducting redemptions in connection with our business combination despite our compliance with these rules if a stockholder fails to receive our tender offer or proxy materials as applicable such stockholder may not become aware of the opportunity to redeem its shares in addition the tender offer documents or proxy materials as applicable that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will describe the various procedures that must be complied with in order to validly tender or redeem public shares in the event that a stockholder fails to comply with these procedures its shares may not be redeemed see proposed business  tendering stock certificates in connection with a tender offer or redemption rights you will not have any rights or interests in funds from the trust account except under certain limited circumstances to liquidate your investment therefore you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants potentially at a loss our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of i our completion of an initial business combination and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem subject to the limitations described herein and ii the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete an initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering subject to applicable law and as further described herein in addition if our plan to redeem our public shares if we are unable to complete an initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering is not completed for any reason compliance with delaware law may require that we submit a plan of dissolution to our thenexisting stockholders for approval prior to the distribution of the proceeds held in our trust account in that case public stockholders may be forced to wait beyond  months from the closing of this offering before they receive funds from our trust account in no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind in the trust account accordingly to liquidate your investment you may be forced to sell your public shares or warrants potentially at a loss nasdaq may delist our securities from trading on its exchange which could limit investors ability to make transactions in our securities and subject us to additional trading restrictions our units have been approved for listing on nasdaq promptly after the date of this prospectus and our class a common stock and warrants listed promptly after their date of separation although after giving effect to this offering we expect to meet on a pro forma basis the minimum initial listing standards set forth in the nasdaq listing standards we cannot assure you that our securities will be or will continue to be listed on nasdaq in the future or prior to our initial business combination in order to continue listing our securities on nasdaq prior to our initial business combination we must maintain certain financial distribution and stock price levels generally we must maintain a minimum amount in stockholders equity generally  and a minimum number of holders of our securities generally  roundlot holders additionally in connection with our initial business combination we will be required to demonstrate      table of contents compliance with nasdaqs initial listing requirements which are more rigorous than nasdaqs continued listing requirements in order to continue to maintain the listing of our securities on nasdaq for instance our stock price would generally be required to be at least  per share and our stockholders equity would generally be required to be at least  million we cannot assure you that we will be able to meet those initial listing requirements at that time if nasdaq delists our securities from trading on its exchange and we are not able to list our securities on another national securities exchange we expect our securities could be quoted on an overthecounter market if this were to occur we could face significant material adverse consequences including  a limited availability of market quotations for our securities  reduced liquidity for our securities  a determination that our class a common stock is a penny stock which will require brokers trading in our class a common stock to adhere to more stringent rules and possibly result in a reduced level of trading activity in the secondary trading market for our securities  a limited amount of news and analyst coverage and  a decreased ability to issue additional securities or obtain additional financing in the future the national securities markets improvement act of  which is a federal statute prevents or preempts the states from regulating the sale of certain securities which are referred to as covered securities because we expect that our units and eventually our class a common stock and warrants will be listed on nasdaq our units class a common stock and warrants will be covered securities although the states are preempted from regulating the sale of our securities the federal statute does allow the states to investigate companies if there is a suspicion of fraud and if there is a finding of fraudulent activity then the states can regulate or bar the sale of covered securities in a particular case while we are not aware of a state having used these powers to prohibit or restrict the sale of securities issued by blank check companies other than the state of idaho certain state securities regulators view blank check companies unfavorably and might use these powers or threaten to use these powers to hinder the sale of securities of blank check companies in their states further if we were no longer listed on nasdaq our securities would not be covered securities and we would be subject to regulation in each state in which we offer our securities you will not be entitled to protections normally afforded to investors of many other blank check companies since the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants are intended to be used to complete an initial business combination with a target business that has not been identified we may be deemed to be a blank check company under the united states securities laws however because we will have net tangible assets in excess of  upon the successful completion of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants and will file a current report on form k including an audited balance sheet demonstrating this fact we are exempt from rules promulgated by the sec to protect investors in blank check companies such as rule  accordingly investors will not be afforded the benefits or protections of those rules among other things this means our units will be immediately tradable moreover if this offering were subject to rule  that rule would prohibit the release of any interest earned on funds held in the trust account to us unless and until the funds in the trust account were released to us in connection with our completion of an initial business combination for a more detailed comparison of our offering to offerings that comply with rule  please see proposed business  comparison of this offering to those of blank check companies subject to rule  if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules a stockholder or a group of stockholders holding a substantial portion of our class a common stock may influence our ability to complete our business combination unlike other blank check companies if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will not provide that a public stockholder together with any affiliate of such stockholder or any other person with whom such stockholder is acting in      table of contents concert or as a group as defined under section  of the exchange act holding in excess of any certain percentage of shares offered in our initial public offering will be restricted from seeking redemption rights with respect to any shares they hold the ability of any such stockholder to redeem all their shares will increase their influence over our ability to complete our business combination and you could suffer a material loss on your investment in us because of our limited resources and the significant competition for business combination opportunities it may be more difficult for us to complete our initial business combination if we are unable to complete our initial business combination our public stockholders may receive only approximately  per share on our redemption and our warrants will expire worthless we expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including private investors which may be individuals or investment partnerships other blank check companies and other entities domestic and international competing for the types of businesses we intend to acquire many of these individuals and entities are wellestablished and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting directly or indirectly acquisitions of companies operating in or providing services to various industries many of these competitors possess greater technical human and other resources or more local industry knowledge than we do and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors while we believe there are numerous target businesses we could potentially acquire with the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants our ability to compete with respect to the acquisition of certain target businesses that are sizable will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of certain target businesses furthermore if we are obligated to pay cash for the shares of class a common stock redeemed and in the event we seek stockholder approval of our business combination we make purchases of our class a common stock potentially reducing the resources available to us for our initial business combination any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination if we are unable to complete our initial business combination our public stockholders may receive only approximately  per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless if the net proceeds of this offering not being held in the trust account are insufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next  months we may be unable to complete our initial business combination the funds available to us outside of the trust account may not be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next  months assuming that our initial business combination is not completed during that time we believe that upon the closing of this offering the funds available to us outside of the trust account will be sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next  months however we cannot assure you that our estimate is accurate of the funds available to us we could use a portion of the funds available to us to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business we could also use a portion of the funds as a down payment or to fund a noshop provision a provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from shopping around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses with respect to a particular proposed business combination although we do not have any current intention to do so if we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business and were subsequently required to forfeit such funds whether as a result of our breach or otherwise we might not have sufficient funds to continue searching for or conduct due diligence with respect to a target business if we are unable to complete our initial business combination our public stockholders may receive only approximately  per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless if the net proceeds of this offering not being held in the trust account are insufficient it could limit the amount available to fund our search for a target business or businesses and complete our initial business combination and we will depend on loans from our sponsor or management team to fund our search to pay our income taxes and to complete our business combination of the net proceeds of this offering only approximately  including up to  of loans provided or to be provided by our sponsor in connection with this offering which loans are not payable until the closing of our business combination will be available to us initially outside the trust account to fund our      table of contents working capital requirements in the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of  we may fund such excess with funds not to be held in the trust account in such case the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount conversely in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of  the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount if we are required to seek additional capital we would need to borrow funds from our sponsor management team or other third parties to operate or may be forced to liquidate neither our sponsor members of our management team nor any of their affiliates is under any obligation to advance funds to us in such circumstances any such advances would be repaid only from funds held outside the trust account or from funds released to us upon completion of our initial business combination if we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account consequently our public stockholders may only receive approximately  per share on our redemption of our public shares and our warrants will expire worthless subsequent to our completion of our initial business combination we may be required to subsequently take writedowns or writeoffs restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition results of operations and our stock price which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment even if we conduct extensive due diligence on a target business with which we combine we cannot assure you that this diligence will surface all material issues that may be present inside a particular target business that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence or that factors outside of the target business and outside of our control will not later arise as a result of these factors we may be forced to later writedown or writeoff assets restructure our operations or incur impairment or other charges that could result in our reporting losses even if our due diligence successfully identifies certain risks unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our preliminary risk analysis even though these charges may be noncash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about us or our securities in addition charges of this nature may cause us to violate net worth or other covenants to which we may be subject as a result of assuming preexisting debt held by a target business or by virtue of our obtaining postcombination debt financing accordingly any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our executive officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the tender offer materials or proxy statement relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission if third parties bring claims against us the proceeds held in the trust account could be reduced and the pershare redemption amount received by stockholders may be less than  per share our placing of funds in the trust account may not protect those funds from thirdparty claims against us although we will seek to have all vendors service providers prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right title interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders such parties may not execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements they may not be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver in each case in order to gain advantage with respect to a claim against our assets including the funds held in the trust account if any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by      table of contents management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver in addition there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of or arising out of any negotiations contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason upon redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within the prescribed timeframe or upon the exercise of a redemption right in connection with our business combination we will be required to provide for payment of claims of creditors that were not waived that may be brought against us within the  years following redemption accordingly the pershare redemption amount received by public stockholders could be less than the  per share initially held in the trust account due to claims of such creditors mr kovalik has agreed to be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below i  per public share or ii such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay income taxes except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities including liabilities under the securities act moreover in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party mr kovalik will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such third party claims we have not independently verified whether mr kovalik has sufficient funds to satisfy their indemnity obligations and therefore mr kovalik may not be able to satisfy those obligations we have not asked mr kovalik to reserve for such eventuality our directors may decide not to enforce the indemnification obligations of our president resulting in a reduction in the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders in the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below the lesser of i  per share or ii other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver such lesser amount per share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in the value of the trust assets in each case net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay income taxes and mr kovalik asserts that he is unable to satisfy his obligations or that he has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against mr kovalik to enforce his indemnification obligations while we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against mr kovalik to enforce his indemnification obligations to us it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance if our independent directors choose not to enforce these indemnification obligations the amount of funds in the trust account available for distribution to our public stockholders may be reduced below  per share if after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed a bankruptcy court may seek to recover such proceeds and the members of our board of directors may be viewed as having breached their fiduciary duties to our creditors thereby exposing the members of our board of directors and us to claims of punitive damages if after we distribute the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtorcreditor andor bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance as a result a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders in addition our board of directors may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors andor having acted in bad faith thereby exposing itself and us to claims of punitive damages by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors      table of contents if before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed the claims of creditors in such proceeding may have priority over the claims of our stockholders and the pershare amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced if before distributing the proceeds in the trust account to our public stockholders we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders to the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account the pershare amount that would otherwise be received by our stockholders in connection with our liquidation may be reduced if we are deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act we may be required to institute burdensome compliance requirements and our activities may be restricted which may make it difficult for us to complete our business combination if we are deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act our activities may be restricted including  restrictions on the nature of our investments and  restrictions on the issuance of securities each of which may make it difficult for us to complete our business combination in addition we may have imposed upon us burdensome requirements including  registration as an investment company  adoption of a specific form of corporate structure and  reporting record keeping voting proxy and disclosure requirements and other rules and regulations we do not believe that our anticipated principal activities will subject us to the investment company act the proceeds held in the trust account may be invested by the trustee only in united states government treasury bills with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds investing solely in united states treasuries and meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act because the investment of the proceeds will be restricted to these instruments we believe we will meet the requirements for the exemption provided in rule a promulgated under the investment company act if we were deemed to be subject to the investment company act compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to consummate a business combination if we were deemed to be subject to the investment company act compliance with these additional regulatory burdens would require additional expenses for which we have not allotted funds and may hinder our ability to complete a business combination if we are unable to complete our initial business combination our public stockholders may receive only approximately  per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless our stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against us to the extent of distributions received by them upon redemption of their shares under the dgcl stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering may be considered a liquidation distribution under delaware law if a corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in section  of the dgcl intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it including a day notice period during which any thirdparty claims can be brought against the corporation a day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought and an additional day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholders pro rata share of the claim or the      table of contents amount distributed to the stockholder and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution however it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following the  th month from the closing of this offering in the event we do not complete our business combination and therefore we do not intend to comply with those procedures because we will not be complying with section  section b of the dgcl requires us to adopt a plan based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the  years following our dissolution however because we are a blank check company rather than an operating company and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors such as lawyers investment bankers etc or prospective target businesses if our plan of distribution complies with section b of the dgcl any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholders pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder and any liability of the stockholder would likely be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution we cannot assure you that we will properly assess all claims that may be potentially brought against us as such our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them but no more and any liability of our stockholders may extend beyond the third anniversary of such date furthermore if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering is not considered a liquidation distribution under delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful then pursuant to section  of the dgcl the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution instead of three years as in the case of a liquidation distribution we may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after our consummation of a business combination and you will not be entitled to any of the corporate protections provided by such a meeting we may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders until after we consummate a business combination unless required by nasdaq and thus may not be in compliance with section b of the dgcl which requires an annual meeting of stockholders be held for the purposes of electing directors in accordance with a companys bylaws unless such election is made by written consent in lieu of such a meeting therefore if our stockholders want us to hold an annual meeting prior to our consummation of a business combination they may attempt to force us to hold one by submitting an application to the delaware court of chancery in accordance with section c of the dgcl we are not registering the shares of class a common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the securities act or any state securities laws at this time and such registration may not be in place when an investor desires to exercise warrants thus precluding such investor from being able to exercise its warrants and causing such warrants to expire worthless we are not registering the shares of class a common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants under the securities act or any state securities laws at this time however under the terms of the warrant agreement we have agreed as soon as practicable but in no event later than  days after the closing of our initial business combination to use our best efforts to file a registration statement under the securities act covering such shares and no later than  days after the closing of our initial business combination to use our best efforts to have an effective registration statement covering such shares and to maintain a current prospectus relating to the class a common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so if for example any facts or events arise which represent a fundamental change in the information set forth in the registration statement or prospectus the financial statements contained or incorporated by reference therein are not current or correct or the sec issues a stop order if the shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants are not registered under the securities act we will be required to permit holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis however no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder unless an exemption is available in no event will we be required to      table of contents net cash settle any warrant or issue securities or other compensation in exchange for the warrants in the event that we are unable to register or qualify the shares underlying the warrants under the securities act or applicable state securities laws if the issuance of the shares upon exercise of the warrants is not so registered or qualified or exempt from registration or qualification the holder of such warrant shall not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless in such event holders who acquired their warrants as part of a purchase of units will have paid the full unit purchase price solely for the shares of class a common stock included in the units the grant of registration rights to our initial stockholders and holders of our private placement warrants may make it more difficult to complete our initial business combination and the future exercise of such rights may adversely affect the market price of our class a common stock pursuant to an agreement to be entered into concurrently with the issuance and sale of the securities in this offering our initial stockholders and earlybirdcapital and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the founder shares holders of our private placement warrants and their permitted transferees can demand that we register the private placement warrants and the shares of class a common stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants we will bear the cost of registering these securities the registration and availability of such a significant number of securities for trading in the public market may have an adverse effect on the market price of our class a common stock in addition the existence of the registration rights may make our initial business combination more costly or difficult to conclude this is because the stockholders of the target business may increase the equity stake they seek in the combined entity or ask for more cash consideration to offset the negative impact on the market price of our class a common stock that is expected when the securities owned by our initial stockholders holders of our private placement warrants or their respective permitted transferees are registered unlike most other similarly structured blank check companies our initial stockholders will receive additional class a common stock if we issue shares to consummate an initial business combination the founder shares will automatically convert into class a common stock on the first business day following the consummation of our initial business combination on a oneforone basis subject to adjustment as provided herein in the case that additional class a common stock or equitylinked securities convertible or exercisable for class a common stock are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in this prospectus and related to the closing of the initial business combination the ratio at which founder shares shall convert into class a common stock will be adjusted so that the number of class a common stock issuable upon conversion of all founder shares will equal in the aggregate on an asconverted basis  of the total number of all outstanding shares of common stock upon completion of the initial business combination excluding any shares or equitylinked securities issued or to be issued to any seller in the initial business combination and any private placement warrants issued upon conversion of working capital loans after taking into account class a common stock redeemed in connection with the business combination this is different from most other similarly structured blank check companies in which the initial shareholders will only be issued an aggregate of  of the total number of shares to be outstanding prior to the initial business combination because we are not limited to a particular industry or any specific target businesses with which to pursue our initial business combination you will be unable to ascertain the merits or risks of any particular target businesss operations we will seek to complete a business combination with an operating company in the energy sector but may also pursue acquisition opportunities with other characteristics except that we will not under our amended and restated certificate of incorporation be permitted to effectuate our business combination with another blank check company or similar company with nominal operations because we have not yet identified or approached any specific target business with respect to a business combination there is no basis to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any particular target businesss operations results of operations cash flows liquidity financial condition or prospects to the extent we complete our business combination we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the business operations with which we combine for example if we combine with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or      table of contents earnings we may be affected by the risks inherent in the business and operations of a financially unstable or a development stage entity although our executive officers directors director nominees and members of our sponsor will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors or that we will have adequate time to complete due diligence furthermore some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business we also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will ultimately prove to be more favorable to investors than a direct investment if such opportunity were available in a business combination target accordingly any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our executive officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the tender offer materials or proxy statement relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission we may seek acquisition opportunities in industries or sectors outside the energy sector which may or may not be outside of our managements area of expertise we will consider an initial business combination outside the energy sector which sectors may or may not be outside our managements areas of expertise if a business combination candidate is presented to us and we determine that such candidate offers an acquisition opportunity for our company although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in any particular business combination candidate we cannot assure you that we will adequately ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors we also cannot assure you that an investment in our units will not ultimately prove to be less favorable to investors in this offering than a direct investment if an opportunity were available in a business combination candidate in the event we elect to pursue an acquisition outside of the areas of our managements expertise our managements expertise may not be directly applicable to its evaluation or operation and the information contained in this prospectus regarding the areas of our managements expertise would not be relevant to an understanding of the business that we elect to acquire although we identified general criteria and guidelines that we believe are important in evaluating prospective target businesses we may enter into our initial business combination with a target that does not meet such criteria and guidelines and as a result the target business with which we enter into our initial business combination may not have attributes entirely consistent with our general criteria and guidelines although we have identified general criteria and guidelines for evaluating prospective target businesses it is possible that a target business with which we enter into our initial business combination will not have all of these positive attributes if we complete our initial business combination with a target that does not meet some or all of these guidelines such combination may not be as successful as a combination with a business that does meet all of our general criteria and guidelines in addition if we announce a prospective business combination with a target that does not meet our general criteria and guidelines a greater number of stockholders may exercise their redemption rights which may make it difficult for us to meet any closing condition with a target business that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash in addition if stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons it may be more difficult for us to attain stockholder approval of our initial business combination if the target business does not meet our general criteria and guidelines if we are unable to complete our initial business combination our public stockholders may receive only approximately  per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless we may seek investment opportunities with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of revenue or earnings to the extent we complete our initial business combination with a financially unstable business or an entity lacking an established record of sales or earnings we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in the operations of the business with which we combine these risks include volatile revenues or earnings and difficulties in obtaining and retaining key personnel although our executive officers directors and director      table of contents nominees will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business we may not be able to properly ascertain or assess all of the significant risk factors and we may not have adequate time to complete due diligence furthermore some of these risks may be outside of our control and leave us with no ability to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking or accounting firm and consequently you may have no assurance from an independent source that the price we are paying for the business is fair to our company from a financial point of view unless we complete our business combination with an affiliated entity we are not required to obtain an opinion from an independent investment banking firm or accounting firm that the price we are paying is fair to our company from a financial point of view if no opinion is obtained our stockholders will be relying on the judgment of our board of directors who will determine fair market value based on standards generally accepted by the financial community such standards used will be disclosed in our tender offer documents or proxy solicitation materials as applicable related to our initial business combination we may issue additional shares of class a common stock or preferred stock to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination we may also issue shares of class a common stock upon the conversion of the class f common stock at a ratio greater than onetoone at the time of our initial business combination as a result of the antidilution provisions contained therein any such issuances would dilute the interest of our stockholders and likely present other risks our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will authorize the issuance of up to  shares of class a common stock par value  per share and  shares of class f common stock par value  per share and  shares of preferred stock par value  per share immediately after this offering there will be  and  assuming in each case that the underwriters have not exercised their overallotment option authorized but unissued shares of class a and class f common stock available respectively for issuance which amount takes into account shares reserved for issuance upon exercise of outstanding warrants but not upon the conversion of the class f common stock shares of class f common stock are automatically convertible into shares of our class a common stock at the time of our initial business combination initially at a oneforone ratio but subject to adjustment as set forth herein immediately after this offering there will be no shares of preferred stock issued and outstanding we may issue a substantial number of additional shares of class a common or preferred stock to complete our initial business combination or under an employee incentive plan after completion of our initial business combination we may also issue shares of class a common stock upon conversion of the class f common stock at a ratio greater than onetoone at the time of our initial business combination as a result of the antidilution provisions contained therein however our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide among other things that prior to our initial business combination we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to i receive funds from the trust account or ii vote on any initial business combination the issuance of additional shares of common or preferred stock  may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in this offering  may subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock  could cause a change in control if a substantial number of common stock is issued which may affect among other things our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards if any and could result in the resignation or removal of our present executive officers and directors and  may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our units common stock andor warrants      table of contents resources could be wasted in researching acquisitions that are not completed which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business if we are unable to complete our initial business combination our public stockholders may receive only approximately  per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless we anticipate that the investigation of each specific target business and the negotiation drafting and execution of relevant agreements disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention and substantial costs for accountants attorneys and others if we decide not to complete a specific initial business combination the costs incurred up to that point for the proposed transaction likely would not be recoverable furthermore if we reach an agreement relating to a specific target business we may fail to complete our initial business combination for any number of reasons including those beyond our control any such event will result in a loss to us of the related costs incurred which could materially adversely affect subsequent attempts to locate and acquire or merge with another business if we are unable to complete our initial business combination our public stockholders may receive only approximately  per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless we are dependent upon our executive officers and directors and their departure could adversely affect our ability to operate our operations are dependent upon a relatively small group of individuals and in particular mr hanna mr kovalik and our other executive officers and directors we believe that our success depends on the continued service of our executive officers and directors at least until we have completed our business combination in addition our executive officers and directors are not required to commit any specified amount of time to our affairs and accordingly will have conflicts of interest in allocating management time among various business activities including identifying potential business combinations and monitoring the related due diligence we do not have keyman insurance on the life of any of our directors or executive officers the unexpected loss of the services of one or more of our directors or executive officers could have a detrimental effect on us our ability to successfully effect our initial business combination and to be successful thereafter will be totally dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel some of whom may join us following our initial business combination the loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our postcombination business our ability to successfully effect our business combination is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel the role of our key personnel in the target business however cannot presently be ascertained although some of our key personnel may remain with the target business in senior management or advisory positions following our business combination it is likely that some or all of the management of the target business will remain in place while we intend to closely scrutinize any individuals we engage after our business combination we cannot assure you that our assessment of these individuals will prove to be correct these individuals may be unfamiliar with the requirements of operating a company regulated by the sec which could cause us to have to expend time and resources helping them become familiar with such requirements none of our executive officers or directors has ever been associated with a special purpose acquisition corporation and such lack of experience could adversely affect our ability to consummate a business combination none of our executive officers or directors has ever been associated with a special purpose acquisition corporation accordingly you may not have sufficient information with which to evaluate their ability to identify and consummate a business combination using the proceeds of this offering our managements lack of experience in operating a special purpose acquisition corporation could adversely affect our ability to consummate a business combination and could result in our not completing a business combination in the prescribed time frame      table of contents our key personnel may negotiate employment or consulting agreements with a target business in connection with a particular business combination these agreements may provide for them to receive compensation following our business combination and as a result may cause them to have conflicts of interest in determining whether a particular business combination is the most advantageous our key personnel may be able to remain with the company after the completion of our business combination only if they are able to negotiate employment or consulting agreements in connection with the business combination such negotiations would take place simultaneously with the negotiation of the business combination and could provide for such individuals to receive compensation in the form of cash payments andor our securities for services they would render to us after the completion of the business combination the personal and financial interests of such individuals may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business however we believe the ability of such individuals to remain with us after the completion of our business combination will not be the determining factor in our decision as to whether or not we will proceed with any potential business combination there is no certainty however that any of our key personnel will remain with us after the completion of our business combination we cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with us the determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with us will be made at the time of our initial business combination we may have a limited ability to assess the management of a prospective target business and as a result may effect our initial business combination with a target business whose management may not have the skills qualifications or abilities to manage a public company when evaluating the desirability of effecting our initial business combination with a prospective target business our ability to assess the target businesss management may be limited due to a lack of time resources or information our assessment of the capabilities of the targets management therefore may prove to be incorrect and such management may lack the skills qualifications or abilities we suspected should the targets management not possess the skills qualifications or abilities necessary to manage a public company the operations and profitability of the postcombination business may be negatively impacted accordingly any stockholders who choose to remain stockholders following the business combination could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our executive officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the tender offer materials or proxy statement relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission the officers and directors of an acquisition candidate may resign upon completion of our initial business combination the departure of a business combination targets key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our postcombination business the role of an acquisition candidates key personnel upon the completion of our initial business combination cannot be ascertained at this time although we contemplate that certain members of an acquisition candidates management team will remain associated with the acquisition candidate following our initial business combination it is possible that members of the management of an acquisition candidate will not wish to remain in place our executive officers and directors will allocate their time to other businesses thereby causing conflicts of interest in their determination as to how much time to devote to our affairs this conflict of interest could have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination our executive officers and directors are not required to and will not commit their full time to our affairs which may result in a conflict of interest in allocating their time between our operations and our search for a business combination and their other businesses we do not intend to have any fulltime employees prior to the completion of our business combination our independent directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities if our executive officers and directors other business affairs require them to devote substantial amounts of time to such affairs in excess of their current commitment levels it could limit their ability to devote time to our affairs which may have a negative impact on our ability to complete our initial business combination for a complete discussion of our executive officers and directors other business affairs please see management  directors and executive officers      table of contents certain of our executive officers and directors are now and all of them may in the future become affiliated with entities engaged in business activities similar to those intended to be conducted by us and accordingly may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented following the completion of this offering and until we consummate our initial business combination we intend to engage in the business of identifying and combining with one or more businesses our sponsor and executive officers and directors are or may in the future become affiliated with entities that are engaged in a similar business our executive officers directors and director nominees also may become aware of business opportunities which may be appropriate for presentation to us and the other entities to which they owe certain fiduciary or contractual duties including klr group mr kovalik and certain other persons who may make decisions for us are not independent from klr group and have other responsibilities within klr group conflicts related to the allocation of potential business opportunities to us will be considered and resolved on a casebycase and discretionary basis by klr group including mr kovalik accordingly they may have conflicts of interest in determining to which entity a particular business opportunity should be presented these conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and a potential target business may be presented to another entity prior to its presentation to us our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we renounce our interest in any corporate opportunity offered to any director or officer unless such opportunity is expressly offered to such person solely in his or her capacity as a director or officer of our company and such opportunity is one we are legally and contractually permitted to undertake and would otherwise be reasonable for us to pursue for a complete discussion of our executive officers and directors business affiliations and the potential conflicts of interest that you should be aware of please see management  directors and executive officers management  conflicts of interest and certain relationships and related party transactions our executive officers directors security holders and their respective affiliates may have competitive pecuniary interests that conflict with our interests we have not adopted a policy that expressly prohibits our directors executive officers security holders or affiliates from having a direct or indirect pecuniary or financial interest in any investment to be acquired or disposed of by us or in any transaction to which we are a party or have an interest in fact we may enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our sponsor our directors or executive officers although we do not intend to do so nor do we have a policy that expressly prohibits any such persons from engaging for their own account in business activities of the types conducted by us accordingly such persons or entities may have a conflict between their interests and ours in addition certain of our executive officers and directors including mr kovalik are employed by klr group which provides investment banking services to a wide variety of clients mr kovalik and certain of our other officers who may make decisions for our business will concurrently work for and receive compensation relating to such investment banking services such compensation may incentivize them to serve the interests of klr groups investment banking business and its clients over our interests we may engage in a business combination with one or more target businesses that have relationships with entities that may be affiliated with our executive officers directors or existing holders which may raise potential conflicts of interest in light of the involvement of our sponsor executive officers and directors with other entities we may decide to acquire one or more businesses affiliated with our sponsor executive officers and directors our directors also serve as officers and board members for other entities including without limitation those described under management  conflicts of interest such entities may compete with us for business combination opportunities our sponsor executive officers and directors are not currently aware of any specific opportunities for us to complete our business combination with any entities with which they are affiliated and there have been no preliminary discussions concerning a business combination with any such entity or entities although we will not be specifically focusing on or targeting any transaction with any affiliated entities we would pursue such a transaction if we determined that such affiliated entity met our criteria for a business      table of contents combination as set forth in proposed business  effecting our initial business combination  selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination and such transaction was approved by a majority of our disinterested directors despite our agreement to obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or independent investment banking firm regarding the fairness to our company from a financial point of view of a business combination with one or more domestic or international businesses affiliated with our executive officers directors or existing holders potential conflicts of interest still may exist and as a result the terms of the business combination may not be as advantageous to our public stockholders as they would be absent any conflicts of interest since our sponsor executive officers and directors will lose their entire investment in us if our business combination is not completed a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination in november  our sponsor purchased an aggregate of  founder shares for an aggregate purchase price of  or approximately  per share in december  and february and march  our

our chief operating officer and general counsel and  shares each to messrs abbas buckner and york our director nominees in march  mr dow and ms thom returned to us at no cost  and  founder shares respectively which we cancelled to the extent the underwriters do not exercise their overallotment option our sponsor may forfeit up to  founder shares so that the remaining founder shares would represent  of the outstanding shares upon completion of this offering assuming it does not purchase any units in this offering the founder shares will be worthless if we do not complete an initial business combination in addition our sponsor and earlybirdcapital andor its designees have committed to purchase an aggregate of  or  if the overallotment option is exercised in full private placement warrants among which  or  if the overallotment is exercised in full insider warrants will be purchased by our sponsor and  or  if the overallotment is exercised in full ebc warrants will be purchased by earlybirdcapital andor its designees each exercisable for one share of our class a common stock at  per share for a purchase price of  or  if the overallotment option is exercised in full or  per warrant that will also be worthless if we do not complete a business combination in addition our sponsor has loaned or will loan us up to  which loans are not payable until the closing of our business combination the founders shares are identical to the shares of common stock included in the units being sold in this offering except that i the founder shares are subject to certain transfer restrictions ii our initial stockholders officers directors and director nominees have entered into letter agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed a to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination b to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering although they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares they hold if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame and iii the founder shares are automatically convertible into shares of our class a common stock at the time of our initial business combination on a oneforone basis subject to adjustment pursuant to certain antidilution rights as described herein additionally in connection with the consummation of our business combination or thereafter we may retain klr group to provide certain financial advisory underwriting capital raising and other services for which they may receive fees the personal and financial interests of our executive officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination completing an initial business combination and influencing the operation of the business following the initial business combination      table of contents since our sponsor executive officers and directors will not be eligible to be reimbursed for their outofpocket expenses if our business combination is not completed a conflict of interest may arise in determining whether a particular business combination target is appropriate for our initial business combination at the closing of our initial business combination our sponsor executive officers and directors or any of their respective affiliates will be reimbursed for any outofpocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations there is no cap or ceiling on the reimbursement of outofpocket expenses incurred in connection with activities on our behalf these financial interests of our sponsor executive officers and directors may influence their motivation in identifying and selecting a target business combination and completing an initial business combination we may issue notes or other debt securities or otherwise incur substantial debt to complete a business combination which may adversely affect our leverage and financial condition and thus negatively impact the value of our stockholders investment in us although we have no commitments as of the date of this prospectus to issue any notes or other debt securities or to otherwise incur outstanding debt we may choose to incur substantial debt to complete our business combination we have agreed that we will not incur any indebtedness unless we have obtained from the lender a waiver of any right title interest or claim of any kind in or to the monies held in the trust account as such no issuance of debt will affect the pershare amount available for redemption from the trust account nevertheless the incurrence of debt could have a variety of negative effects including  default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial business combination are insufficient to repay our debt obligations  acceleration of our obligations to repay the indebtedness even if we make all principal and interest payments when due if we breach certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios or reserves without a waiver or renegotiation of that covenant  our immediate payment of all principal and accrued interest if any if the debt security is payable on demand  our inability to obtain necessary additional financing if the debt security contains covenants restricting our ability to obtain such financing while the debt security is outstanding  our inability to pay dividends on our common stock  using a substantial portion of our cash flow to pay principal and interest on our debt which will reduce the funds available for dividends on our common stock if declared expenses capital expenditures acquisitions and other general corporate purposes  limitations on our flexibility in planning for and reacting to changes in our business and in the industry in which we operate  increased vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic industry and competitive conditions and adverse changes in government regulation and  limitations on our ability to borrow additional amounts for expenses capital expenditures acquisitions debt service requirements execution of our strategy and other purposes and other disadvantages compared to our competitors who have less debt we may only be able to complete one business combination with the proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants which will cause us to be solely dependent on a single business which may have a limited number of products or services this lack of diversification may negatively impact our operations and profitability the net proceeds from this offering and the private placement of warrants will provide us with  or  if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full that we may use to      table of contents complete our business combination less up to  in deferred commissions to be released to the underwriters in the event that the underwriters exercise their overallotment option upon completion of an initial business combination we may effectuate our business combination with a single target business or multiple target businesses simultaneously or within a short period of time however we may not be able to effectuate our business combination with more than one target business because of various factors including the existence of complex accounting issues and the requirement that we prepare and file pro forma financial statements with the sec that present operating results and the financial condition of several target businesses as if they had been operated on a combined basis by completing our initial business combination with only a single entity our lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic competitive and regulatory risks further we would not be able to diversify our operations or benefit from the possible spreading of risks or offsetting of losses unlike other entities which may have the resources to complete several business combinations in different industries or different areas of a single industry accordingly the prospects for our success may be  solely dependent upon the performance of a single business property or asset or  dependent upon the development or market acceptance of a single or limited number of products processes or services this lack of diversification may subject us to numerous economic competitive and regulatory risks any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact upon the particular industry in which we may operate subsequent to our business combination we may attempt to simultaneously complete business combinations with multiple prospective targets which may hinder our ability to complete our business combination and give rise to increased costs and risks that could negatively impact our operations and profitability if we determine to simultaneously acquire several businesses that are owned by different sellers we will need for each of such sellers to agree that our purchase of its business is contingent on the simultaneous closings of the other business combinations which may make it more difficult for us and delay our ability to complete our initial business combination with multiple business combinations we could also face additional risks including additional burdens and costs with respect to possible multiple negotiations and due diligence investigations if there are multiple sellers and the additional risks associated with the subsequent assimilation of the operations and services or products of the acquired companies in a single operating business if we are unable to adequately address these risks it could negatively impact our profitability and results of operations we may attempt to complete our initial business combination with a private company about which little information is available which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected if at all in pursuing our acquisition strategy we may seek to effectuate our initial business combination with a privately held company by definition very little public information exists about private companies and we could be required to make our decision on whether to pursue a potential initial business combination on the basis of limited information which may result in a business combination with a company that is not as profitable as we suspected if at all our management may not be able to maintain control of a target business after our initial business combination we cannot provide assurance that upon loss of control of a target business new management will possess the skills qualifications or abilities necessary to profitably operate such business we may structure a business combination so that the posttransaction company in which our public stockholders own shares will own less than  of the equity interests or assets of a target business but we will only complete such business combination if the posttransaction company owns or acquires  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquires a controlling interest in the target sufficient for us not to be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act we will not consider any transaction that does not meet such criteria even if the posttransaction company owns  or more of the voting securities of the target our stockholders prior to the business combination      table of contents may collectively own a minority interest in the post business combination company depending on valuations ascribed to the target and us in the business combination transaction for example we could pursue a transaction in which we issue a substantial number of new shares of common stock in exchange for all of the outstanding capital stock of a target in this case we would acquire a  interest in the target however as a result of the issuance of a substantial number of new shares of common stock our stockholders immediately prior to such transaction could own less than a majority of our outstanding shares of common stock subsequent to such transaction in addition other minority stockholders may subsequently combine their holdings resulting in a single person or group obtaining a larger share of the companys stock than we initially acquired accordingly this may make it more likely that our management will not be able to maintain our control of the target business we do not have a specified maximum redemption threshold the absence of such a redemption threshold may make it possible for us to complete a business combination with which a substantial majority of our stockholders seek redemption our amended and restated certificate of incorporation does not provide a specified maximum redemption threshold except that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  upon the consummation of our initial business combination such that we are not subject to the secs penny stock rules or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination as a result we may be able to complete our business combination even though a substantial majority of our public stockholders have redeemed their shares or if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules have entered into privately negotiated agreements to sell their shares to our sponsor executive officers directors advisors or their affiliates in the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares all shares of common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof and we instead may search for an alternate business combination in order to effectuate an initial business combination blank check companies have in the recent past amended various provisions of their charters and modified governing instruments we cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation or governing instruments in a manner that will make it easier for us to complete our initial business combination that our stockholders may not support in order to effectuate a business combination blank check companies have in the recent past amended various provisions of their charters and modified governing instruments for example blank check companies have amended the definition of business combination and extended deadlines to complete business combinations we cannot assure you that we will not seek to amend our charter or governing instruments in order to effectuate our initial business combination the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that relate to our prebusiness combination activity and corresponding provisions of the agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended with the approval of holders of  of our common stock which is a lower amendment threshold than that of some other blank check companies it may be easier for us therefore to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to facilitate the completion of an initial business combination that some of our stockholders may not support some other blank check companies have a provision in their charter which prohibits the amendment of certain of its provisions including those which relate to a companys prebusiness combination activity without approval by a certain percentage of the companys stockholders in those companies amendment of these provisions requires approval by between  and  of the companys public stockholders our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that any of its provisions related to prebusiness combination activity including the requirement to deposit proceeds of this offering and the private placement      table of contents of warrants into the trust account and not release such amounts except in specified circumstances and to provide redemption rights to public stockholders as described herein may be amended if approved by holders of  of our common stock and then only if we allow dissenting holders the opportunity to get their pro rata share from the trust account and corresponding provisions of the trust agreement governing the release of funds from our trust account may be amended if approved by holders of  of our common stock in all other instances our amended and restated certificate of incorporation may be amended by holders of a majority of our common stock subject to applicable provisions of the dgcl or applicable stock exchange rules our initial stockholders who will beneficially own  of our common stock upon the closing of this offering assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation andor trust agreement and will have the discretion to vote in any manner it chooses as a result we may be able to amend the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation which govern our prebusiness combination behavior more easily than some other blank check companies and this may increase our ability to complete a business combination with which you do not agree our stockholders may pursue remedies against us for any breach of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation our sponsor executive officers directors and director nominees have agreed pursuant to a letter agreement with us a form of which has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow holders to redeem their public shares unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a pershare price payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest net of the interest which may be withdrawn to pay income taxes divided by the number of then outstanding public shares these agreements are contained in letter agreements that we have entered into with our sponsor executive officers directors and director nominees our public stockholders are not parties to or thirdparty beneficiaries of these agreements and as a result will not have the ability to pursue remedies against our sponsor executive officers directors or director nominees for any breach of these agreements as a result in the event of a breach our public stockholders would need to pursue a stockholder derivative action subject to applicable law we may be unable to obtain additional financing to complete our initial business combination or to fund the operations and growth of a target business which could compel us to restructure or abandon a particular business combination although we believe that the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will be sufficient to allow us to complete our initial business combination because we have not yet identified any prospective target business we cannot ascertain the capital requirements for any particular transaction if the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants prove to be insufficient either because of the size of our initial business combination the depletion of the available net proceeds in search of a target business the obligation to repurchase for cash a significant number of shares from stockholders who elect redemption in connection with our initial business combination or the terms of negotiated transactions to purchase shares in connection with our initial business combination we may be required to seek additional financing or to abandon the proposed business combination we cannot assure you that such financing will be available on acceptable terms if at all the current economic environment has made it especially difficult for companies to obtain acquisition financing to the extent that additional financing proves to be unavailable when needed to complete our initial business combination we would be compelled to either restructure the transaction or abandon that particular business combination and seek an alternative target business candidate in addition even if we do not need additional financing to complete our business combination we may require such financing to fund the operations or growth of the target business the failure to secure additional financing could have a material adverse effect on the continued development or growth of the target business none of our executive officers directors or stockholders is required to provide any financing to us in connection with or after our business combination if we are unable to complete our initial business combination our public stockholders may only receive approximately  per share on the liquidation of our trust account and our warrants will expire worthless      table of contents our initial stockholders control a substantial interest in us and thus may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote potentially in a manner that you do not support upon the closing of this offering our initial stockholders will own  of our issued and outstanding shares of common stock assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering accordingly they may exert a substantial influence on actions requiring a stockholder vote potentially in a manner that you do not support including amendments to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation if our initial stockholders or our executive officers and directors purchase any units in this offering or if our initial stockholders or our executive officers and directors purchase any additional shares of common stock in the aftermarket or in privately negotiated transactions this would increase such control in addition our board of directors whose members were elected by our sponsor is and will be divided into two classes each of which will generally serve for a term of two years with only one class of directors being elected in each year we may not hold an annual meeting of stockholders to elect new directors prior to the completion of our business combination in which case all of the current directors will continue in office until at least the completion of the business combination if there is an annual meeting as a consequence of our staggered board of directors only a minority of the board of directors will be considered for election and our initial stockholders because of their ownership position will have considerable influence regarding the outcome accordingly our initial stockholders will continue to exert control at least until the completion of our business combination our sponsor paid an aggregate of  or approximately  per founder share and accordingly you will experience immediate and substantial dilution from the purchase of our class a common stock the difference between the public offering price per share allocating all of the unit purchase price to the common stock and none to the warrant included in the unit and the pro forma net tangible book value per share of our class a common stock after this offering constitutes the dilution to you and the other investors in this offering our sponsor acquired the founder shares at a nominal price significantly contributing to this dilution upon the closing of this offering and assuming no value is ascribed to the warrants included in the units you and the other public stockholders will incur an immediate and substantial dilution of approximately  or  per share assuming no exercise of the underwriters overallotment option the difference between the pro forma net tangible book value per share of  and the initial offering price of  per unit this dilution would increase to the extent that the antidilution provisions of the class f common stock result in the issuance of class a shares on a greater than onetoone basis upon conversion of the class f common stock at the time of our initial business combination and would become exacerbated to the extent that public stockholders seek redemptions from the trust in addition because of the antidilution protection in the founder shares any equity or equitylinked securities issued in connection with our initial business combination would be disproportionately dilutive to our class a common stock we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner that may be adverse to holders with the approval by the holders of at least  of the then outstanding public warrants our warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between continental stock transfer  trust company as warrant agent and us the warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision but requires the approval by the holders of at least  of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants accordingly we may amend the terms of the warrants in a manner adverse to a holder if holders of at least  of the then outstanding public warrants approve of such amendment although our ability to amend the terms of the warrants with the consent of at least  of the then outstanding public warrants is unlimited examples of such amendments could be amendments to among other things increase the exercise price of the warrants shorten the exercise period or decrease the number of shares of our common stock purchasable upon exercise of a warrant      table of contents we may redeem your unexpired warrants prior to their exercise at a time that is disadvantageous to you thereby making your warrants worthless we have the ability to redeem outstanding warrants at any time after they become exercisable and prior to their expiration at a price of  per warrant provided that the last reported sales price of our class a common stock equals or exceeds  per share for any  trading days within a  tradingday period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holders redemption of the outstanding warrants could force you i to exercise your warrants and pay the exercise price therefor at a time when it may be disadvantageous for you to do so ii to sell your warrants at the thencurrent market price when you might otherwise wish to hold your warrants or iii to accept the nominal redemption price which at the time the outstanding warrants are called for redemption is likely to be substantially less than the market value of your warrants none of the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us so long as they are held by their initial purchasers or their permitted transferees our warrants may have an adverse effect on the market price of our class a common stock and make it more difficult to effectuate our business combination we will be issuing warrants to purchase  shares of our class a common stock or up to  shares of class a common stock if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full as part of the units offered by this prospectus and simultaneously with the closing of this offering we will be issuing in a private placement an aggregate of  or up to  if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full private placement warrants each exercisable to purchase one share of class a common stock at  per share to the extent we issue shares of class a common stock to effectuate a business transaction the potential for the issuance of a substantial number of additional shares of class a common stock upon exercise of these warrants could make us a less attractive acquisition vehicle to a target business such warrants when exercised will increase the number of issued and outstanding shares of our class a common stock and reduce the value of the shares of class a common stock issued to complete the business transaction therefore our warrants may make it more difficult to effectuate a business transaction or increase the cost of acquiring the target business the private placement warrants are identical to the warrants sold as part of the units in this offering except that so long as they are held by the initial holders or their permitted transferees i they will not be redeemable by us ii they including the class a common stock issuable upon exercise of these warrants may not subject to certain limited exceptions be transferred assigned or sold by our sponsor until  days after the completion of our initial business combination and iii they may be exercised by the holders on a cashless basis the determination of the offering price of our units and the size of this offering is more arbitrary than the pricing of securities and size of an offering of an operating company in a particular industry you may have less assurance therefore that the offering price of our units properly reflects the value of such units than you would have in a typical offering of an operating company prior to this offering there has been no public market for any of our securities the public offering price of the units and the terms of the warrants were negotiated between us and the underwriters in determining the size of this offering management held customary organizational meetings with representatives of the underwriters both prior to our inception and thereafter with respect to the state of capital markets generally and the amount the underwriters believed they reasonably could raise on our behalf factors considered in determining the size of this offering prices and terms of the units including the class a common stock and warrants underlying the units include  the history and prospects of companies whose principal business is the acquisition of other companies  prior offerings of those companies  our prospects for acquiring an operating business at attractive values  a review of debt to equity ratios in leveraged transactions  our capital structure      table of contents  an assessment of our management and their experience in identifying operating companies  general conditions of the securities markets at the time of this offering and  other factors as were deemed relevant although these factors were considered the determination of our offering price is more arbitrary than the pricing of securities of an operating company in a particular industry since we have no historical operations or financial results there is currently no market for our securities and a market for our securities may not develop which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities there is currently no market for our securities stockholders therefore have no access to information about prior market history on which to base their investment decision following this offering the price of our securities may vary significantly due to one or more potential business combinations and general market or economic conditions furthermore an active trading market for our securities may never develop or if developed it may not be sustained you may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established and sustained because we must furnish our stockholders with target business financial statements we may lose the ability to complete an otherwise advantageous initial business combination with some prospective target businesses the federal proxy rules require that a proxy statement with respect to a vote on a business combination meeting certain financial significance tests include historical andor pro forma financial statement disclosure in periodic reports we will include the same financial statement disclosure in connection with our tender offer documents whether or not they are required under the tender offer rules these financial statements may be required to be prepared in accordance with or be reconciled to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america or gaap or international financing reporting standards or ifrs depending on the circumstances and the historical financial statements may be required to be audited in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board united states or pcaob these financial statement requirements may limit the pool of potential target businesses we may acquire because some targets may be unable to provide such statements in time for us to disclose such statements in accordance with federal proxy rules and complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame we are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the securities act and if we take advantage of certain exemptions from disclosure requirements available to emerging growth companies this could make our securities less attractive to investors and may make it more difficult to compare our performance with other public companies we are an emerging growth company within the meaning of the securities act as modified by the jobs act and we may take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved as a result our stockholders may not have access to certain information they may deem important we could be an emerging growth company for up to five years although circumstances could cause us to lose that status earlier including if the market value of our common stock held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of any june  before that time in which case we would no longer be an emerging growth company as of the following december  we cannot predict whether investors will find our securities less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions if some investors find our securities less attractive as a result of our reliance on these exemptions the trading prices of our securities may be lower than they otherwise would be there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the trading prices of our securities may be more volatile further section b of the jobs act exempts emerging growth companies from being required to comply with new or revised financial accounting standards until private companies that is those that have not      table of contents had a securities act registration statement declared effective or do not have a class of securities registered under the exchange act are required to comply with the new or revised financial accounting standards the jobs act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to nonemerging growth companies but any such an election to opt out is irrevocable we have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies we as an emerging growth company can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard this may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is neither an emerging growth company nor an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accountant standards used compliance obligations under the sarbanesoxley act may make it more difficult for us to effectuate our business combination require substantial financial and management resources and increase the time and costs of completing an acquisition section  of the sarbanesoxley act requires that we evaluate and report on our system of internal controls beginning with our annual report on form k for the year ending december   only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting further for as long as we remain an emerging growth company we will not be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement on our internal control over financial reporting the fact that we are a blank check company makes compliance with the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act particularly burdensome on us as compared to other public companies because a target company with which we seek to complete our business combination may not be in compliance with the provisions of the sarbanesoxley act regarding adequacy of its internal controls the development of the internal control of any such entity to achieve compliance with the sarbanesoxley act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition provisions in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and delaware law may inhibit a takeover of us which could limit the price investors might be willing to pay in the future for our class a common stock and could entrench management our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests these provisions include a staggered board of directors and the ability of the board of directors to designate the terms of and issue new series of preferred shares which may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities we are also subject to antitakeover provisions under delaware law which could delay or prevent a change of control together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities if we effect our initial business combination with a company located outside the united states or with operations located outside the united states we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations if we effect our initial business combination with a company located outside the united states or with operations or opportunities outside of the united states we would be subject to any special considerations or risks associated with companies operating in an international setting including any of the following  costs and difficulties inherent in managing crossborder business operations  rules and regulations regarding currency redemption  complex corporate withholding taxes on individuals      table of contents  laws governing the manner in which future business combinations may be effected  tariffs and trade barriers  regulations related to customs and importexport matters  longer payment cycles  tax issues such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the united states  currency fluctuations and exchange controls  rates of inflation  challenges in collecting accounts receivable  cultural and language differences  employment regulations  crime strikes riots civil disturbances terrorist attacks and wars and  deterioration of political relations with the united states we may not be able to adequately address these additional risks if we were unable to do so our operations might suffer which may adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition we may face risks related to oil and gas exploration and production companies business combinations with oil and gas exploration and production companies entail special considerations and risks if we acquire a target business in the oil and gas exploration and production industry we may be subject to and possibly adversely affected by the following risks  our success may be dependent on the prices of oil and natural gas  low oil or natural gas prices and the substantial volatility in these prices may adversely affect our financial condition and our ability to meet our capital expenditure requirements and financial obligations  our exploration development and exploitation projects may require substantial capital expenditures that may exceed our cash flows from operations and potential borrowings and we may be unable to obtain needed capital on satisfactory terms which could adversely affect our future growth  drilling for and producing oil and natural gas are highly speculative and involve a high degree of operational and financial risk with many uncertainties that could adversely affect our business  we may incur indebtedness which could reduce our financial flexibility increase interest expense and adversely impact our operations and our unit costs  our operations may be subject to operational hazards and unforeseen interruptions for which we may not be adequately insured  our reserves and production may be concentrated in a few core areas such that problems in production and markets relating to a particular area could have a material impact on our business  the unavailability or high cost of drilling rigs completion equipment and services supplies and personnel could adversely affect our ability to establish and execute exploration and development plans within budget and on a timely basis which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows  our oil and natural gas reserves may be estimated and may not reflect the actual volumes of oil and natural gas we will recover and significant inaccuracies in these reserves estimates or underlying assumptions could materially affect the quantities and present value of our reserves  our identified drilling locations may be scheduled over several years making them susceptible to uncertainties that could materially alter the occurrence or timing of their drilling      table of contents  competition in the oil and natural gas industry is intense which may make it more difficult for us to acquire properties market oil and natural gas and secure trained personnel  our competitors may use superior technology and data resources that we may be unable to afford or that would require a costly investment by us in order to compete with them more effectively  strategic relationships upon which we may rely may be subject to change which may diminish our ability to conduct our operations  the marketability of our production may be dependent upon oil and natural gas gathering processing and transportation facilities owned and operated by third parties and the unavailability of satisfactory oil and natural gas gathering processing and transportation arrangements would have a material adverse effect on our revenue  financial difficulties encountered by our oil and natural gas purchasers third party operators or other third parties could decrease our cash flows from operations and adversely affect the exploration and development of our prospects and assets  gathering processing and transportation services are subject to complex federal state and other laws that could adversely affect the cost manner or feasibility of conducting our business  a component of our growth may come through acquisitions and our failure to identify or complete future acquisitions successfully could reduce our earnings and hamper our growth  we may purchase oil and natural gas properties with liabilities or risks that we did not know about or that we did not assess correctly and as a result we could be subject to liabilities that could adversely affect our results of operations  we may incur losses or costs as a result of title deficiencies in the properties in which we invest  we may be required to write down the carrying value of our proved properties under accounting rules and these writedowns could adversely affect our financial condition  hedging transactions or the lack thereof may limit our potential gains and could result in financial losses  we may be subject to government regulation and liability including complex environmental laws which could require significant expenditures and  we may have difficulty managing growth in our business which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of

described herein the deferred commissions will be released to the underwriters only on completion of an initial business combination      table of contents  these expenses are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination in the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel in addition our staffing needs may vary and as a result we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence we do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses which fluctuations to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses would not be available for our expenses in addition in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our executive officers directors and director nominees may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required if we complete our initial business combination we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us otherwise such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account in the event that our initial business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts up to  of such loans including any loans outstanding as of the date of this prospectus may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of  per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the private

such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account  includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our business combination to fund a no shop provision and commitment fees for financing  pursuant to an employment agreement entered into between us and ms thom we will pay ms thom a salary of  annually following the consummation of this offering the rules of the nasdaq capital market provide that at least  of the gross proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account of the

stock transfer  trust company acting as trustee and will be invested only in us government treasury bills with a maturity of  days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a under the investment company act which invest only in direct us government treasury obligations we will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account except for the withdrawal of interest to pay income taxes until the earlier of i the completion of our initial business combination or ii the redemption of  of our public shares if we are unable to complete a business combination within  months from the closing of this offering subject to the requirements of law the net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business combination if the entire purchase price of our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities or if not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the posttransaction company the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital or up to  in deferred underwriting commissions in the event that the underwriters exercise their overallotment option we believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated this belief is based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an indication of interest we intend to undertake indepth due diligence depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may be required to raise additional capital      table of contents the amount availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable if we are required to seek additional capital we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our sponsor members of our management team or their affiliates but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to or invest in us pursuant to an employment agreement entered into between us and ms thom we will pay ms thom a salary of  annually following the consummation of this offering as of the date of this prospectus our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to   as of the date of this prospectus to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering these loans are noninterest bearing unsecured and are due at the closing of our initial business combination in

such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account in connection with the consummation of our business combination or thereafter we may retain klr group to provide certain financial advisory underwriting capital raising and other services for which they may receive fees upon consummation of such business combination or thereafter the amount of fees we pay to klr group will be based upon the prevailing market for similar services rendered by comparable investment banks for such transactions at such time and will be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit committees policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present conflicts of interest if we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our sponsor directors executive officers advisors or their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination however they have no current commitments plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions if they engage in such transactions they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by regulation m under the exchange act we do not currently anticipate that such purchases if any would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the exchange act or a goingprivate transaction subject to the goingprivate rules under the exchange act however if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules the purchasers will comply with such rules we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  upon the consummation of our initial business combination so that we are not subject to the secs penny stock rules and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash if too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination and instead may search for an alternate business combination a public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only upon the earlier to occur of i our completion of an initial business combination and then only in connection with those shares      table of contents of our class a common stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem subject to the limitations described herein or ii the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within  months following the closing of this offering subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations including but not limited to cash requirements created by the terms of the proposed business combination in no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination in addition our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame however if our initial stockholders or any of our executive officers directors or affiliates acquire public shares in or after this offering they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame      table of contents dividend policy we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of our initial business combination the payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings if any capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of our initial business combination the payment of any cash dividends subsequent to our initial business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time in addition our board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any stock dividends in the foreseeable future except if we increase the size of the offering pursuant to rule b under the securities act in which case we will effect a stock dividend or other appropriate mechanism immediately prior to the consummation of the offering in such amount as to maintain the ownership of our initial stockholders prior to this offering at  of our issued and outstanding shares of our common stock upon the consummation of this offering assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering further if we incur any indebtedness in connection with our business combination our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith      table of contents dilution the difference between the public offering price per share

and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a blank check company incorporated as a delaware corporation and formed for the purpose of effecting a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities we have not identified any business combination target and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any substantive discussions directly or indirectly with respect to identifying any business combination target we intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants our capital stock debt or a combination of cash stock and debt the issuance of additional shares of our stock in a business combination  may significantly dilute the equity interest of investors in this offering which dilution would increase if the antidilution provisions in the class f common stock resulted in the issuance of class a shares on a greater than onetoone basis upon conversion of the class f common stock  may subordinate the rights of holders of common stock if preferred stock is issued with rights senior to those afforded our common stock  could cause a change of control if a substantial number of shares of our common stock are issued which may affect among other things our ability to use our net operating loss carry forwards if any and could result in the resignation or removal of our present executive officers and directors  may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control of us by diluting the stock ownership or voting rights of a person seeking to obtain control of us and  may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our class a common stock andor warrants similarly if we issue debt securities it could result in  default and foreclosure on our assets if our operating revenues after an initial

approximately  in cash and deferred offering costs of  further we expect to continue to incur significant costs in the pursuit of our acquisition plans we cannot assure you that our plans to raise capital or to complete our initial business combination will be successful results of operations and known trends or future events we have neither engaged in any operations nor generated any revenues to date our only activities since inception have been organizational activities and those necessary to prepare for this offering following this offering we will not generate any operating revenues until after completion of our initial business combination we will generate nonoperating income in the form of interest income on cash and cash equivalents after this offering there has been no significant change in our financial or trading position and no material adverse change has occurred since the date of our audited financial statements after this offering we expect to incur increased expenses as a result of being a public company for legal financial reporting accounting and auditing compliance as well as for due diligence expenses we expect our expenses to increase substantially after the closing of this offering liquidity and capital resources as indicated in the accompanying financial statements at december   we had approximately  in cash and cash equivalents and a working capital deficiency of approximately  further we have incurred costs in connection with our formation and this offering and expect to continue to incur significant costs in pursuit of our financing and acquisition plans managements plans to address this uncertainty through this offering are discussed above our plans to raise capital or to consummate our initial business combination may not be successful these factors among others raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern our liquidity needs have been satisfied to date through receipt of  from the sale of the founder shares to our sponsor and loans from our sponsor of  we estimate that the net proceeds from i the sale of the units in this offering after deducting offering expenses of approximately  underwriting commissions of  and ii the sale of the private placement warrants for a purchase price of  or  if the overallotment option is exercised in full will be approximately  million or approximately  million if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full  million or approximately  million if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full will be held in the trust account up to  in deferred commissions will be released to the underwriters in the event that the underwriters exercise their overallotment option only on completion of an initial business combination the remaining approximately  including up to  of loans provided or to be provided by our sponsor in connection with this offering which loans are not payable until the closing of our initial business combination will not be held in the trust account in the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of  we may fund such excess with funds not to be held in the trust account in such case the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount conversely in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of  the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount we intend to use substantially all of the funds held in the trust account including any amounts representing interest earned on the trust account which interest shall be net of income taxes payable to complete our initial business combination we may withdraw interest to pay income taxes the interest earned on the amount in the trust account may not be sufficient to pay our income taxes to the extent that our capital stock or debt is used in whole or in part as consideration to complete our initial business combination the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business or businesses make other acquisitions and pursue our growth strategies prior to the completion of our initial business combination we will have available to us the approximately  of proceeds held outside the trust account including up to  of loans provided or to be provided by our sponsor in connection with this offering which loans are not payable until the closing of our initial business combination we will use these funds primarily to pay the salary of our chief financial officer identify and evaluate target businesses perform business due diligence on prospective target businesses travel to and from the offices plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses or      table of contents their representatives or owners review corporate documents and material agreements of prospective target businesses structure negotiate and complete a business combination and to pay income taxes to the extent the interest earned on the trust account is not sufficient to pay our income taxes in order to fund working capital deficiencies or finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our executive officers directors and director nominees may but are not obligated to loan us funds as may be required if we complete our initial business combination we would repay such loaned amounts in the event that our initial business combination does not close we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment up to  of such loans including any loans described above may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a price of  per warrant at the option of the lender the warrants would be identical to the placement warrants issued to the initial holder we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account we expect our primary liquidity requirements during that period to include approximately  for legal accounting due diligence travel and other expenses associated with structuring negotiating and documenting successful business combinations  for legal and accounting fees related to regulatory reporting requirements  for nasdaq and other regulatory fees  as salary for our chief financial officer and  for miscellaneous expenses these amounts are estimates and may differ materially from our actual expenses in addition we could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay commitment fees for financing fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business or as a down payment or to fund a noshop provision a provision designed to keep target businesses from shopping around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target businesses with respect to a particular proposed business combination although we do not have any current intention to do so if we entered into an agreement where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target business the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a noshop provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time our forfeiture of such funds whether as a result of our breach or otherwise could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for or conducting due diligence with respect to prospective target businesses we do not believe we will need to raise additional funds following this offering in order to meet the expenditures required for operating our business however if our estimates of the costs of identifying a target business undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination are less than the actual amount necessary to do so we may have insufficient funds available to operate our business prior to our business combination moreover we may need to obtain additional financing either to complete our business combination or because we become obligated to redeem a significant number of our public shares upon completion of our business combination in which case we may issue additional securities or incur debt in connection with such business combination in the current economic environment it has become especially difficult to obtain acquisition financing if we are unable to complete our initial business combination because we do not have sufficient funds available to us we will be forced to cease operations and liquidate the trust account in addition following our initial business combination if cash on hand is insufficient we may need to obtain additional financing in order to meet our obligations controls and procedures we are not currently required to maintain an effective system of internal controls as defined by section  of the sarbanesoxley act we will be required to comply with the internal control requirements of the sarbanesoxley act for the fiscal year ending december   only in the event that we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer would we be required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement further for as long as we remain an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act we intend to take advantage of certain exemptions      table of contents from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the independent registered public accounting firm attestation requirement prior to the closing of this offering we have not completed an assessment nor have our auditors tested our systems of internal controls we expect to assess the internal controls of our target business or businesses prior to the completion of our initial business combination and if necessary to implement and test additional controls as we may determine are necessary in order to state that we maintain an effective system of internal controls a target business may not be in compliance with the provisions of the sarbanesoxley act regarding the adequacy of internal controls many small and midsized target businesses we may consider for our business combination may have internal controls that need improvement in areas such as  staffing for financial accounting and external reporting areas including segregation of duties  reconciliation of accounts  proper recording of expenses and liabilities in the period to which they relate  evidence of internal review and approval of accounting transactions  documentation of processes assumptions and conclusions underlying significant estimates and  documentation of accounting policies and procedures because it will take time management involvement and perhaps outside resources to determine what internal control improvements are necessary for us to meet regulatory requirements and market expectations for our operation of a target business we may incur significant expenses in meeting our public reporting responsibilities particularly in the areas of designing enhancing or remediating internal and disclosure controls doing so effectively may also take longer than we expect thus increasing our exposure to financial fraud or erroneous financing reporting once our managements report on internal controls is complete we will retain our independent auditors to audit and render an opinion on such report when required by section  the independent auditors may identify additional issues concerning a target businesss internal controls while performing their audit of internal control over financial reporting quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants held in the trust account will be

a result we may not comply with new or revised accounting standards on the relevant dates on which adoption of such standards is required for nonemerging growth companies as a result our financial statements may not be comparable to companies that comply with new or revised accounting pronouncements as of public company effective dates additionally we are in the process of evaluating the

asset acquisition stock purchase reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses or entities which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination we have not identified any business combination targets and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any substantive discussions directly or indirectly with any business combination target while we may pursue an acquisition opportunity in any sector or geographical location we intend to focus on the sector that complements our management teams expertise in the exploration exploitation operation and development of crude oil and natural gas wells and related infrastructure and to capitalize on the ability of our management team to source screen evaluate negotiate structure close and manage acquisitions of attractive assets or businesses in the us in the event that we find an acquisition opportunity in a different sector or in a different geographic region that is more compelling than the opportunities presented to us in to the us oil and gas industry we would pursue the opportunity in such other sector or such other geographic region however we have not established any particular parameters or criteria as to when we might turn our attention to opportunities outside of the us oil and gas industry we will seek to acquire one or more businesses with an aggregate enterprise value of approximately  million to  billion business opportunity overview our strategy is to source acquire and after our initial business combination build an ep business ep companies focus on finding producing and marketing various forms of crude oil and natural gas we believe that there is a unique and timely opportunity to achieve attractive returns by acquiring and developing ep assets in proven basins with known operational and limited geologic risks we believe this opportunity exists due to several key factors i the recent decline of commodity prices had an immediate and meaningful impact on the cash flows of ep companies creating a need for many ep firms to issue external capital or sell assets ii the recent decline of commodity prices has substantially reduced ep asset valuations and is moderating drilling and completion costs and operating costs resulting in a lower cost to acquire and develop iii the shortterm volatility and cyclical nature of commodity prices underpinned by a positive longterm outlook for crude oil and natural gas demand and the need for higher commodity prices to meet expected demand growth and iv the advantages enjoyed by ep companies operating in the us including access to industryleading technologies and expertise toptier oil and gasproducing basins established infrastructure and favorable political policies relative to other regions competitive strengths our executive officers we believe our management team is in a prime position to take advantage of opportunities within oil and gas and to create value for our

corporate      table of contents strategy and implementation which we believe will be of significant benefit to us as we evaluate potential acquisition or merger candidates as well as following the completion of our initial business combination our network of relationships and third party advisors   we intend to utilize what our management believes is an accomplished and proven network of relationships and third party advisors to assist with target company origination and evaluation due diligence and implementation of value creation programs and activities following our initial business combination we believe this combination of resources is unique and provides us with a truly differentiated value proposition for investors sellers target companies and their management teams status as a public company we believe our structure will make us an attractive business combination partner to target businesses as an existing public company we offer a target business an alternative to the traditional initial public offering through a merger or other business combination in this situation the owners of the target business would exchange their shares of stock in the target business for shares of our stock or for a combination of shares of our stock and cash allowing us to tailor the consideration to the specific needs of the sellers although there are various costs and obligations associated with being a public company we believe target businesses will find this process a more certain and cost effective method to becoming a public company than the typical initial public offering in a typical initial public offering there are additional expenses incurred in marketing road show and public reporting efforts that may not be present to the same extent in connection with a business combination with us furthermore once a proposed business combination is completed the target business will have effectively become public whereas an initial public offering is always subject to the underwriters ability to complete the offering as well as general market conditions which could prevent the offering from occurring once public we believe the target business would then have greater access to capital and an additional means of providing management incentives consistent with stockholders interests it can offer further benefits by augmenting a companys profile among potential new customers and vendors and aid in attracting talented employees we are an emerging growth company as defined in the jobs act we will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of  the last day of the fiscal year a following the fifth anniversary of the completion of this offering b in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least  billion or c in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer which means the market value of our common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the prior june  th  and  the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the prior threeyear period financial position with funds available for a business combination initially in the amount of  assuming no redemptions or  assuming no redemptions if the underwriters overallotment option is exercised in full and except for up to  we may have to pay in deferred underwriting commissions in the event that the underwriters exercise their overallotment option we offer a target business a variety of options such as creating a liquidity event for its owners providing capital for the potential growth and expansion of its operations or strengthening its balance sheet by reducing its debt ratio because we are able to complete our business combination using our cash debt or equity securities or a combination of the foregoing we have the flexibility to use the most efficient combination that will allow us to tailor the consideration to be paid to the target business to fit its needs and desires however we have not taken any steps to secure third party financing and there can be no assurance it will be available to us      table of contents conflicts of interest an affiliate of ours klr group is a registered brokerdealer operating in the oil and gas sector klr group undertakes a wide range of financial advisory merchant and investment banking research and sales and trading activities for a wide variety of clients including public and private companies in the oil and gas sector accordingly there may be situations in which klr group has an obligation or an interest that actually or potentially conflicts with our interests these conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and as a result we may be denied certain investment opportunities or may be otherwise disadvantaged in some situations by our relationship to klr group klr group is regulated by financial industry regulatory authority or finra klr groups merchant banking business generally targets transactions of a similar size as those that would be suitable for our initial business combination and thus may compete with us for one or more potential targets further other investors in affiliates of ours and klr groups may be in direct competition with us for a possible target for our initial business combination klr group may also choose to operate or have an interest in investment entities similar to us or that otherwise compete with us in the future other clients of klr groups advisory business may also compete with us for investment opportunities meeting our investment objectives if klr group is engaged to act for any such clients we may be precluded from pursuing such opportunities in addition investment ideas generated within klr group including by mr kovalik and other persons who may make decisions for the company may be suitable for both us and for an investment banking client or a current or future klr group internal investment vehicle including other blank check companies in which klr group may participate and may be directed to such client or investment vehicle rather than to us klr groups advisory business may also be engaged to advise the seller of a company business or assets that would qualify as an investment opportunity for us in such cases we may be precluded from participating in the sale process or from purchasing the company business or assets if we are permitted to pursue the opportunity klr groups interests or its obligations to the seller will diverge from our interests neither klr group nor members of our management who are also employed by klr group have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware unless such opportunity was expressly offered in writing to our management solely in their capacity as officers or directors of the company klr group andor our management in their capacities as officers of klr group or in their other endeavors may choose to present potential business combinations to the related entities described above current or future klr group internal investment vehicles including other blank check companies in which klr group may participate or third parties including clients of klr group before they present such opportunities to us in addition our president edward kovalik is a director of river bend oil  gas llc a private company operating in the oil and gas sector and our other executive officers are affiliated either with klr group or with other companies in the oil and gas industry in addition our independent directors expected to be appointed just prior to the consummation of our public offering may have preexisting duties or obligations that prevent them from presenting otherwise suitable target businesses to us our independent directors will be under no obligation to present opportunities of which they become aware to the company unless such opportunity was expressly offered to the independent director solely in his capacity as a director of the company any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination our management believes however that our status as a public entity and potential access to the united states public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privatelyheld entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business or businesses with significant growth potential on favorable terms if we succeed in effecting a business combination there will be in all likelihood intense competition from competitors of the target business subsequent to a business combination we may not have the resources or ability to compete effectively mr hanna our chief executive officer is currently restricted by a noncompete provision contained in his consulting agreement with energy xxi which provision is in effect until june   such provision prohibits mr hanna from acquiring or managing certain businesses in the shallow gulf of mexico that broadly compete with the business activities of energy xxi in light of the noncompetition agreement we      table of contents will not seek an initial business combination with any company operating in the businesses described above unless such transaction were to close subsequent to the expiration of the noncompetition provision any litigation associated with the noncompetition agreement could be time consuming costly and distract managements focus from locating suitable acquisition candidates and operating our business none of the members of our management team the sponsor klr group or klr holdings has previous experience as sponsor or in a management capacity with other blank check companies effecting our initial business combination general we are not presently engaged in and we will not engage in any operations for an indefinite period of time following this offering we intend to effectuate our initial business combination using cash from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement of the private placement warrants our capital stock debt or a combination of these as the consideration to be paid in our initial business combination we may seek to complete our initial business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth which would subject us to the numerous risks inherent in such companies and businesses if the entire purchase price of our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities or if not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination or used for redemptions of purchases of our common stock we may apply the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general corporate purposes including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the posttransaction company the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination to fund the purchase of other companies to pay up to  in deferred underwriting commissions in the event that the underwriters exercise their overallotment option or for working capital we have not identified any business combination target and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any substantive discussions with respect to identifying any business combination target from the period commencing with our formation through the date of this prospectus there have been no communications or discussions between any of our officers directors or our sponsor and any of their potential contacts or relationships regarding a potential initial business combination additionally we have not engaged or retained any agent or other representative to identify or locate any suitable acquisition candidate to conduct any research or take any measures directly or indirectly to locate or contact a target business accordingly there is no current basis for investors in this offering to evaluate the possible merits or risks of the target business with which we may ultimately complete our initial business combination although our management will assess the risks inherent in a particular target business with which we may combine we cannot assure you that this assessment will result in our identifying all risks that a target business may encounter furthermore some of those risks may be outside of our control meaning that we can do nothing to control or reduce the chances that those risks will adversely impact a target business we may seek to raise additional funds through a private offering of debt or equity securities in connection with the completion of our initial business combination and we may effectuate our initial business combination using the proceeds of such offering rather than using the amounts held in the trust account subject to compliance with applicable securities laws we would complete such financing only simultaneously with the completion of our business combination in the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other than the trust account assets our tender offer documents or proxy materials disclosing the business combination would disclose the terms of the financing and only if required by law we would seek stockholder approval of such financing there are no prohibitions on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our initial business combination at this time we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise in the case of an initial business combination funded with assets other

this time we are not a party to any arrangement or understanding with any third party with respect to raising any additional funds through the sale of securities or otherwise selection of a target business and structuring of our initial business combination the nasdaq rules require that our initial business combination must be with one or more target businesses that together have a fair market value equal to at least  of the balance in the trust account less any deferred underwriting commissions and taxes payable on interest earned at the time of our signing a definitive agreement in connection with our initial business combination the fair market value of the target or targets will be determined by our board of directors based upon one or more standards generally accepted by the financial community such as discounted cash flow valuation or value of comparable businesses if our board is not able to independently determine the fair market value of the target business or businesses we will obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or an independent investment banking firm with respect to the satisfaction of such criteria we do not intend to purchase multiple businesses in unrelated industries in connection with our initial business combination subject to this requirement our management will have virtually unrestricted flexibility in identifying and selecting one or more prospective target businesses although we will not be permitted to effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations in any case we will only complete an initial business combination in which we own or acquire  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the target or otherwise acquire a controlling interest in the target sufficient for it not to be required to register as an investment company under the investment company act if we own or acquire less than  of the equity interests or assets of a target business or businesses the portion of such business or businesses that are owned or acquired by the posttransaction company is what will be valued for purposes of the  fair market value test there is no basis for investors in this offering to evaluate the possible merits or risks of any target business with which we may ultimately complete our business combination to the extent we effect our business combination with a company or business that may be financially unstable or in its early stages of development or growth we may be affected by numerous risks inherent in such company or business although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business we cannot assure you that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risk factors the time required to select and evaluate a target business and to structure and complete our initial business combination and the costs associated with this process are not currently ascertainable with any degree of certainty any costs incurred with respect to the identification and evaluation of a prospective target business with which our business combination is not ultimately completed will result in our incurring losses and will reduce the funds we can use to complete another business combination in connection with the consummation of our business combination or thereafter we may retain klr group to provide certain financial advisory underwriting capital raising and other services for which they may receive fees upon consummation of such business combination or thereafter the amount of fees we pay to klr group will be based upon the prevailing market for similar services rendered by comparable investment banks for such transactions at such time and will be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant to the audit committees policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present conflicts of interest klr group will not be asked to render a fairness opinion with respect to our initial business combination as klr group may have a conflict of interest by virtue of its affiliation with our sponsor as a consequence we may be required to retain another firm to render such an opinion if one is required lack of business diversification for an indefinite period of time after the completion of our initial business combination the prospects for our success may depend entirely on the future performance of a single business unlike other entities that have the resources to complete business combinations with multiple entities in one or several industries it is probable that we will not have the resources to diversify our operations and mitigate the risks of being in a single line of business by completing our business combination with only a single entity our lack of diversification may      table of contents  subject us to negative economic competitive and regulatory developments any or all of which may have a substantial adverse impact on the particular industry in which we operate after our initial business combination and  cause us to depend on the marketing and sale of a single product or limited number of products or services limited ability to evaluate the targets management team although we intend to closely scrutinize the management of a prospective target business when evaluating the desirability of effecting our business combination with that business our assessment of the target businesss management may not prove to be correct in addition the future management may not have the necessary skills qualifications or abilities to manage a public company furthermore the future role of members of our management team if any in the target business cannot presently be stated with any certainty while it is possible that one or more of our directors will remain associated in some capacity with us following our business combination it is unlikely that any of them will devote their full efforts to our affairs subsequent to our business combination moreover we cannot assure you that members of our management team will have significant experience or knowledge relating to the operations of the particular target business we cannot assure you that any of our key personnel will remain in senior management or advisory positions with the combined company the determination as to whether any of our key personnel will remain with the combined company will be made at the time of our initial business combination following a business combination we may seek to recruit additional managers to supplement the incumbent management of the target business we cannot assure you that we will have the ability to recruit additional managers or that additional managers will have the requisite skills knowledge or experience necessary to enhance the incumbent management stockholders may not have the ability to approve our initial business combination we may conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the sec however we will seek stockholder approval if it is required by law or applicable stock exchange rule or we may decide to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons presented in the table below is a graphic explanation of the types of initial business combinations we may consider and whether stockholder

purchases of our securities in the event we seek stockholder approval of our business combination and we do not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to the tender offer rules our sponsor directors executive officers advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination however they have no current commitments plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions none of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase shares in such transactions they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by regulation m under the exchange act such a purchase may include a contractual acknowledgement that such stockholder although still the record holder of our shares is no longer the beneficial owner thereof and therefore agrees not to exercise its redemption rights subsequent to the consummation of this offering we will adopt an insider trading policy which will require insiders to i refrain from purchasing shares during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information and ii to clear all trades with our legal counsel prior to execution we cannot currently determine whether our insiders will make such purchases pursuant to a rule b plan as it will be dependent upon several factors including but not limited to the timing and size of such purchases depending on such circumstances our insiders may either make such purchases pursuant to a rule b plan or determine that such a plan is not necessary in the event that our sponsor directors executive officers advisors or their affiliates purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions from public stockholders who have already elected to exercise their redemption rights such selling stockholders would be required to revoke their prior elections to redeem their shares we do not currently anticipate that such purchases if any would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the exchange act or a goingprivate transaction subject to the goingprivate rules under the exchange act however if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules the purchasers will comply with such rules the purpose of such purchases would be to i vote such shares in favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of obtaining stockholder approval of the business combination or ii to satisfy a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business combination where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met this may result in the completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been possible in addition if such purchases are made the public float of our common stock may be reduced and the number of beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced which may make it difficult to maintain or obtain the quotation listing or trading of our securities on a national securities exchange our sponsor executive officers directors andor their affiliates anticipate that they may identify the stockholders with whom our sponsor executive officers directors or their affiliates may pursue privately negotiated purchases by either the stockholders contacting us directly or by our receipt of redemption requests submitted by stockholders following our mailing of proxy materials in connection with our initial business combination to the extent that our sponsor executive officers directors advisors or their affiliates enter into a private purchase they would identify and contact only potential selling stockholders who have expressed their election to redeem their shares for a pro rata share of the trust account or vote against the business combination our sponsor executive officers directors advisors or their affiliates will only purchase shares if such purchases comply with regulation m under the exchange act and the other federal securities laws any purchases by our sponsor executive officers directors andor their affiliates who are affiliated purchasers under rule b under the exchange act will only be made to the extent such purchases are able to be made in compliance with rule b which is a safe harbor from liability for manipulation under section a and rule b of the exchange act rule b has certain technical requirements that must be complied with in order for the safe harbor to be available to the purchaser our sponsor executive officers directors andor their affiliates will not make purchases of common stock if the purchases would violate section a or rule b of the exchange act      table of contents redemption rights for public stockholders upon completion of our initial business combination we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of class a common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination at a pershare price payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account as of two business days prior to the consummation of the initial business combination including interest which interest shall be net of income taxes payable divided by the number of then outstanding public shares subject to the limitations described herein the amount in the trust account is initially anticipated to be approximately  per public share our initial stockholders executive officers directors and director nominees have entered into letter agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination manner of conducting redemptions we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of class a common stock upon the completion of our initial business combination either i in connection with a stockholder meeting called to approve the business combination or ii by means of a tender offer the decision as to whether we will seek stockholder approval of a proposed business combination or conduct a tender offer will be made by us solely in our discretion and will be based on a variety of factors such as the timing of the transaction and whether the terms of the transaction would require us to seek stockholder approval under the law or stock exchange listing requirement asset acquisitions and stock purchases would not typically require stockholder approval while direct mergers with our company where we do not survive and any transactions where we issue more than  of our outstanding common stock or seek to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation would require stockholder approval we intend to conduct redemptions without a stockholder vote pursuant to the tender offer rules of the sec unless stockholder approval is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement or we choose to seek stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons if a stockholder vote is not required and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons we will pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  conduct the redemptions pursuant to rule e and regulation e of the exchange act which regulate issuer tender offers and  file tender offer documents with the sec prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about the initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under regulation a of the exchange act which regulates the solicitation of proxies upon the public announcement of our business combination we or our sponsor will terminate any plan established in accordance with rule b to purchase shares of our class a common stock in the open market if we elect to redeem our public shares through a tender offer to comply with rule e under the exchange act in the event we conduct redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules our offer to redeem will remain open for at least  business days in accordance with rule ea under the exchange act and we will not be permitted to complete our initial business combination until the expiration of the tender offer period in addition the tender offer will be conditioned on public stockholders not tendering more than a specified number of public shares which are not purchased by our sponsor which number will be based on the requirement that we may not redeem public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  upon the consummation of our initial business combination so that we are not subject to the secs penny stock rules or any greater net tangible asset or cash requirement which may be contained in the agreement relating to our initial business combination if public stockholders tender more shares than we have offered to purchase we will withdraw the tender offer and not complete the initial business combination if however stockholder approval of the transaction is required by law or stock exchange listing requirement or we decide to obtain stockholder approval for business or other legal reasons we will pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation      table of contents  conduct the redemptions in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to regulation a of the exchange act which regulates the solicitation of proxies and not pursuant to the tender offer rules and  file proxy materials with the sec in the event that we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination we will distribute proxy materials and in connection therewith provide our public stockholders with the redemption rights described above upon completion of the initial business combination if we seek stockholder approval we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of class a common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination a quorum for such meeting will consist of the holders present in person or by proxy of shares of outstanding capital stock of the company representing a majority of the voting power of all outstanding shares of capital stock of the company entitled to vote at such meeting the founder shares held by our initial stockholders will count towards this quorum and our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination and our executive officers directors and director nominees have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination public stockholders may elect to redeem their public shares irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposed transaction or if we conduct a tender offer in addition our initial stockholders executive officers directors and director nominees have entered into letter agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that in no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  upon the consummation of our initial business combination so that we are not subject to the secs penny stock rules redemptions of our public shares may also be subject to a higher net tangible asset test or cash requirement pursuant to an agreement relating to our initial business combination for example the proposed business combination may require i cash consideration to be paid to the target or its owners ii cash to be transferred to the target for working capital or other general corporate purposes or iii the retention of cash to satisfy other conditions in accordance with the terms of the proposed business combination in the event the aggregate cash consideration we would be required to pay for all shares of class a common stock that are validly submitted for redemption plus any amount required to satisfy cash conditions pursuant to the terms of the proposed business combination exceed the aggregate amount of cash available to us we will not complete the business combination or redeem any shares and all shares of class a common stock submitted for redemption will be returned to the holders thereof tendering stock certificates in connection with redemption rights we may require our public stockholders seeking to exercise their redemption rights whether they are record holders or hold their shares in street name to either tender their certificates to our transfer agent up to two business days prior to the vote on the proposal to approve the business combination in the event we distribute proxy materials or to deliver their shares to the transfer agent electronically using depository trust companys dwac depositwithdrawal at custodian system at the holders option the proxy materials that we will furnish to holders of our public shares in connection with our initial business combination will indicate whether we are requiring public stockholders to satisfy such delivery requirements accordingly a public stockholder would have from two days prior to the vote on the business combination if we distribute proxy materials to tender its shares if it wishes to seek to exercise its redemption rights given the relatively short exercise period it is advisable for stockholders to use electronic delivery of their public shares there is a nominal cost associated with the abovereferenced tendering process and the act of certificating the shares or delivering them through the dwac system the transfer agent will typically charge the tendering broker  and it would be up to the broker whether or not to pass this cost on to the redeeming holder however this fee would be incurred regardless of whether or not we require holders seeking to exercise redemption rights to tender their shares the need to deliver shares is a requirement of exercising redemption rights regardless of the timing of when such delivery must be effectuated      table of contents the foregoing is different from the procedures used by many blank check companies in order to perfect redemption rights in connection with their business combinations many blank check companies would distribute proxy materials for the stockholders vote on an initial business combination and a holder could simply vote against a proposed business combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holder was seeking to exercise his or her redemption rights after the business combination was approved the company would contact such stockholder to arrange for him or her to deliver his or her certificate to verify ownership as a result the stockholder then had an option window after the completion of the business combination during which he or she could monitor the price of the companys stock in the market if the price rose above the redemption price he or she could sell his or her shares in the open market before actually delivering his or her shares to the company for cancellation as a result the redemption rights to which stockholders were aware they needed to commit before the stockholder meeting would become option rights surviving past the completion of the business combination until the redeeming holder delivered its certificate the requirement for physical or electronic delivery prior to the meeting ensures that a redeeming holders election to redeem is irrevocable once the business combination is approved any request to redeem such shares once made may be withdrawn at any time up to the date set forth in the tender offer materials or the date of the stockholder meeting set forth in our proxy materials as applicable furthermore if a holder of a public share delivered its certificate in connection with an election of redemption rights and subsequently decides prior to the applicable date not to elect to exercise such rights such holder may simply request that the transfer agent return the certificate physically or electronically it is anticipated that the funds to be distributed to holders of our public shares electing to redeem their shares will be distributed promptly after the completion of our business combination if our initial business combination is not approved or completed for any reason then our public stockholders who elected to exercise their redemption rights would not be entitled to redeem their shares for the applicable pro rata share of the trust account in such case we will promptly return any certificates delivered by public holders who elected to redeem their shares if our initial proposed business combination is not completed we may continue to try to complete a business combination with a different target until  months from the closing of this offering redemption of public shares and liquidation if no initial business combination our sponsor executive officers directors and director nominees have agreed that we will have only  months from the closing of this offering to complete our initial business combination if we are unable to complete our business combination within such month period we will i cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up ii as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem the public shares at a pershare price payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest which interest shall be net of income taxes payable divided by the number of then outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders including the right to receive further liquidation distributions if any subject to applicable law and iii as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors dissolve and liquidate subject in the case of clauses ii and iii to our obligations under delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law there will be no redemption rights or liquidating distributions with respect to our warrants which will expire worthless if we fail to complete our business combination within the month time period our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which they have waived their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering however if our initial stockholders or any of our executive officers directors or affiliates acquire public shares in or after this offering they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted month time period our sponsor executive officers directors and director nominees have agreed pursuant to a letter agreement with us a form of which has been filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part that they will not propose any amendment to our amended and restated certificate of      table of contents incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to allow holders to redeem their public shares unless we provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their shares of class a common stock upon approval of any such amendment at a pershare price payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest which interest shall be net of income taxes payable divided by the number of then outstanding public shares however we may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  upon the consummation of our initial business combination so that we are not subject to the secs penny stock rules we expect that all costs and expenses associated with implementing our plan of dissolution as well as payments to any creditors will be funded from amounts remaining out of the approximately  of proceeds held outside the trust account including up to  of loans provided or to be provided by our sponsor in connection with this offering which loans are not payable until the closing of our initial business combination although we cannot assure you that there will be sufficient funds for such purpose if we were to expend all of the net proceeds of this offering other than the proceeds deposited in the trust account and without taking into account interest if any earned on the trust account the pershare redemption amount received by stockholders upon our dissolution would be approximately  the proceeds deposited in the trust account could however become subject to the claims of our creditors which would have higher priority than the claims of our public stockholders we cannot assure you that the actual pershare redemption amount received by stockholders will not be substantially less than  under section b of the dgcl our plan of dissolution must provide for all claims against us to be paid in full or make provision for payments to be made in full as applicable if there are sufficient assets these claims must be paid or provided for before we make any distribution of our remaining assets to our stockholders while we intend to pay such amounts if any we cannot assure you that we will have funds sufficient to pay or provide for all creditors claims although we will seek to have all vendors service providers prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right title interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account for the benefit of our public stockholders there is no guarantee that they will execute such agreements or even if they execute such agreements that they would be prevented from bringing claims against the trust account including but not limited to fraudulent inducement breach of fiduciary responsibility or other similar claims as well as claims challenging the enforceability of the waiver in each case in order to gain an advantage with respect to a claim against our assets including the funds held in the trust account if any third party refuses to execute an agreement waiving such claims to the monies held in the trust account our management will perform an analysis of the alternatives available to it and will only enter into an agreement with a third party that has not executed a waiver if management believes that such third partys engagement would be significantly more beneficial to us than any alternative examples of possible instances where we may engage a third party that refuses to execute a waiver include the engagement of a third party consultant whose particular expertise or skills are believed by management to be significantly superior to those of other consultants that would agree to execute a waiver or in cases where management is unable to find a service provider willing to execute a waiver in addition there is no guarantee that such entities will agree to waive any claims they may have in the future as a result of or arising out of any negotiations contracts or agreements with us and will not seek recourse against the trust account for any reason in order to protect the amounts held in the trust account mr kovalik has agreed to be liable to us if and to the extent any claims by a vendor for services rendered or products sold to us or a prospective target business with which we have discussed entering into a transaction agreement reduce the amount of funds in the trust account to below i  per public share or ii such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay income taxes except as to any claims by a third party who executed a waiver of any and all rights to seek access to the trust account and except as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities including liabilities under the securities act in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party then mr kovalik will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such thirdparty claims we cannot assure you however that mr kovalik      table of contents would be able to satisfy those obligations none of our other executive officers will indemnify us for claims by third parties including without limitation claims by vendors and prospective target businesses in the event that the proceeds in the trust account are reduced below i  per public share or ii such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver in each case net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay taxes and mr kovalik asserts that he is unable to satisfy its indemnification obligations or that he has no indemnification obligations related to a particular claim our independent directors would determine whether to take legal action against mr kovalik to enforce his indemnification obligations while we currently expect that our independent directors would take legal action on our behalf against mr kovalik to enforce his indemnification obligations to us it is possible that our independent directors in exercising their business judgment may choose not to do so in any particular instance accordingly we cannot assure you that due to claims of creditors the actual value of the pershare redemption price will not be substantially less than  per share we will seek to reduce the possibility that mr kovalik will have to indemnify the trust account due to claims of creditors by endeavoring to have all vendors service providers prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right title interest or claim of any kind in or to monies held in the trust account mr kovalik will also not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities including liabilities under the securities act we will have access to up to approximately  including up to  of loans provided or to be provided by our sponsor in connection with this offering which loans are not payable until the closing of our initial business combination from the proceeds of this offering with which to pay any such potential claims not including costs and expenses incurred in connection with our liquidation currently estimated to be no more than approximately  in the event that we liquidate and it is subsequently determined that the reserve for claims and liabilities is insufficient stockholders who received funds from our trust account could be liable for claims made by creditors in the event that our offering expenses exceed our estimate of  we may fund such excess with funds from the funds not to be held in the trust account in such case the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would decrease by a corresponding amount conversely in the event that the offering expenses are less than our estimate of  the amount of funds we intend to be held outside the trust account would increase by a corresponding amount under the dgcl stockholders may be held liable for claims by third parties against a corporation to the extent of distributions received by them in a dissolution the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within  months from the closing of this offering may be considered a liquidation distribution under delaware law if the corporation complies with certain procedures set forth in section  of the dgcl intended to ensure that it makes reasonable provision for all claims against it including a day notice period during which any thirdparty claims can be brought against the corporation a day period during which the corporation may reject any claims brought and an additional day waiting period before any liquidating distributions are made to stockholders any liability of stockholders with respect to a liquidating distribution is limited to the lesser of such stockholders pro rata share of the claim or the amount distributed to the stockholder and any liability of the stockholder would be barred after the third anniversary of the dissolution furthermore if the pro rata portion of our trust account distributed to our public stockholders upon the redemption of our public shares in the event we do not complete our business combination within  months from the closing of this offering is not considered a liquidation distribution under delaware law and such redemption distribution is deemed to be unlawful then pursuant to section  of the dgcl the statute of limitations for claims of creditors could then be six years after the unlawful redemption distribution instead of three years as in the case of a liquidation distribution if we are unable to complete our business combination within  months from the closing of this offering we will i cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up ii as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter redeem the public shares at a pershare price payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest net of the amount of interest which may be withdrawn to pay income taxes      table of contents divided by the number of then outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders including the right to receive further liquidation distributions if any subject to applicable law and iii as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors dissolve and liquidate subject in the case of clauses ii and iii to our obligations under delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law accordingly it is our intention to redeem our public shares as soon as reasonably possible following our  th month and therefore we do not intend to comply with those procedures as such our stockholders could potentially be liable for any claims to the extent of distributions received by them but no more and any liability of our stockholders may extend well beyond the third anniversary of such date because we will not be complying with section  section b of the dgcl requires us to adopt a plan based on facts known to us at such time that will provide for our payment of all existing and pending claims or claims that may be potentially brought against us within the subsequent  years however because we are a blank check company rather than an operating company and our operations will be limited to searching for prospective target businesses to acquire the only likely claims to arise would be from our vendors such as lawyers investment bankers etc or prospective target businesses as described above pursuant to the obligation contained in our underwriting agreement we will seek to have all vendors service providers prospective target businesses or other entities with which we do business execute agreements with us waiving any right title interest or claim of any kind in or to any monies held in the trust account as a result of this obligation the claims that could be made against us are significantly limited and the likelihood that any claim that would result in any liability extending to the trust account is remote further our sponsor may be liable only to the extent necessary to ensure that the amounts in the trust account are not reduced below i  per public share or ii such lesser amount per public share held in the trust account as of the date of the liquidation of the trust account due to reductions in value of the trust assets other than due to the failure to obtain such waiver in each case net of the amount of interest withdrawn to pay income taxes and less any pershare amounts distributed from our trust account to our public stockholders in the event we are unable to complete our business combination within  months from the closing of this offering and will not be liable as to any claims under our indemnity of the underwriters of this offering against certain liabilities including liabilities under the securities act in the event that an executed waiver is deemed to be unenforceable against a third party mr kovalik will not be responsible to the extent of any liability for such thirdparty claims if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed the proceeds held in the trust account could be subject to applicable bankruptcy law and may be included in our bankruptcy estate and subject to the claims of third parties with priority over the claims of our stockholders to the extent any bankruptcy claims deplete the trust account we cannot assure you we will be able to return  per share to our public stockholders additionally if we file a bankruptcy petition or an involuntary bankruptcy petition is filed against us that is not dismissed any distributions received by stockholders could be viewed under applicable debtorcreditor andor bankruptcy laws as either a preferential transfer or a fraudulent conveyance as a result a bankruptcy court could seek to recover all amounts received by our stockholders furthermore our board may be viewed as having breached its fiduciary duty to our creditors andor may have acted in bad faith and thereby exposing itself and our company to claims of punitive damages by paying public stockholders from the trust account prior to addressing the claims of creditors we cannot assure you that claims will not be brought against us for these reasons our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of the redemption of our public shares if we do not complete our business combination within  months from the closing of this offering or if they redeem their respective shares for cash upon the completion of the initial business combination in no other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account in the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination a stockholders voting in connection with the business combination alone will not result in a stockholders redeeming its shares to us for an applicable pro rata share of the trust account such stockholder must have also exercised its redemption rights described above      table of contents amended and restated certificate of incorporation our amended and restated certificate of incorporation contains certain requirements and restrictions relating to this offering that will apply to us until the consummation of our initial business combination if we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders rights or prebusiness combination activity we will provide dissenting public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem their public shares in connection with any such vote our initial stockholders executive officers directors and director nominees have entered into letter agreements with us pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our initial business combination specifically our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide among other things that  prior to the consummation of our initial business combination we shall either  seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination at a meeting called for such purpose at which stockholders may seek to redeem their shares regardless of whether they vote for or against the proposed business combination into their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest which interest shall be net of income taxes payable or  provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to tender their shares to us by means of a tender offer and thereby avoid the need for a stockholder vote for an amount equal to their pro rata share of the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest which interest shall be net of income taxes payable in each case subject to the limitations described herein  we will consummate our initial business combination only if we have net tangible assets of at least  upon such consummation and solely if we seek stockholder approval a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination  if our initial business combination is not consummated within  months from the closing of this offering then our existence will terminate and we will distribute all amounts in the trust account and  prior to our initial business combination we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to i receive funds from the trust account or ii vote on any initial business combination these provisions cannot be amended without the approval of holders of  of our common stock and then only if we allow dissenting holders the opportunity to get their pro rata share from the trust account in the event we seek stockholder approval in connection with our initial business combination our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that we may consummate our initial business combination only if approved by a

combination and check a box on the proxy card indicating such holders were seeking to exercise their redemption rights after the business combination was approved the company would contact such stockholders to arrange for them to deliver their certificate to verify ownership      competition in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for our business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including other blank check companies private equity groups and leveraged buyout funds and operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions currently we believe there are approximately  publiclytraded blank check companies that have raised an aggregate of approximately  billion in gross proceeds that may be our competitors although we are only aware of one other of these companies that has an oil and gas sector focus many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business furthermore our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public stockholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination facilities we currently maintain our executive offices at  main street  th floor houston tx  klr group holdings llc an affiliate of our sponsor has agreed to provide at no cost to us office space and general administrative services we consider our current office space adequate for our current operations      table of contents employees we currently have four executive officers members of our management team are not obligated to devote any specific number of hours to our matters but they intend to devote as much of their time as they deem necessary to our affairs until we have completed our initial business combination the amount of time that any members of our management will devote in any time period will vary based on whether a target business has been selected for our initial business combination and the current stage of the business combination process periodic reporting and financial information we will register our units class a common stock and warrants under the exchange act and have reporting obligations including the requirement that we file annual quarterly and current reports with the sec in accordance with the requirements of the exchange act our annual reports will contain financial statements audited and reported on by our independent registered public auditors we will provide stockholders with audited financial statements of the prospective target business as part of the tender offer materials or proxy solicitation materials sent to stockholders to assist them in assessing the target business in all likelihood these financial statements will need to be prepared in accordance with gaap we cannot assure you that any particular target business identified by us as a potential acquisition candidate will have financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap or that the potential target business will be able to prepare its financial statements in accordance with gaap to the extent that this requirement cannot be met we may not be able to acquire the proposed target business while this may limit the pool of potential acquisition candidates we do not believe that this limitation will be material we will be required to evaluate our internal control procedures for the fiscal year ending december   as required by the sarbanesoxley act only in the event we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer or an accelerated filer will we be required to have our internal control procedures audited a target company may not be in compliance with the provisions of the sarbanesoxley act regarding adequacy of their internal controls the development of the internal controls of any such entity to achieve compliance with the sarbanesoxley act may increase the time and costs necessary to complete any such acquisition prior to the date of this prospectus we will file a registration statement on form a with the sec to voluntarily register our securities under section  of the exchange act as a result we will be subject to the rules and regulations promulgated under the exchange act we have no current intention of filing a form  to suspend our reporting or other obligations under the exchange act prior or subsequent to the consummation of our business combination we are an emerging growth company as defined in section a of the securities act as modified by the jobs act as such we are eligible to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements that are applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies including but not limited to not being required to comply with the auditor attestation requirements of section  of the sarbanesoxley act reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements and exemptions from the requirements of holding a nonbinding advisory vote on executive compensation and stockholder approval of any golden parachute payments not previously approved if some investors find our securities less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our securities and the prices of our securities may be more volatile in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the extended transition period provided in section ab of the securities act for complying with new or revised accounting standards in other words an emerging growth company can delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies we intend to take advantage of the benefits of this extended transition period      table of contents we will remain an emerging growth company until the earlier of  the last day of the

banking research and sales and trading activities for a wide variety of clients including public and private companies in the oil and gas sector accordingly there may be situations in which klr group has an obligation or an interest that actually or potentially conflicts with our interests these conflicts may not be resolved in our favor and as a result we may be denied certain investment opportunities or may be otherwise disadvantaged in some situations by our relationship to klr group some of these potential conflicts are described below in considering them you should understand that  mr kovalik and certain other persons who may make decisions for the company are not independent from klr group have other responsibilities including investment banking responsibilities within klr group and may have an economic interest in the success of klr group separate and apart from their economic interest in the company mr kovalik and certain other persons who may make decisions for our business will concurrently work for and receive compensation relating to investment banking or other activities at klr group while their equity interests in the company may incentivize them to benefit the company the compensation from investment banking or other klr group activities may incentivize them to serve the interests of klr groups investment banking business and its clients or other klr group businesses  conflicts related to the allocation of potential business opportunities to us will be considered and resolved on a case by case and discretionary basis by klr group including mr kovalik while this process will consider the companys interests investors should assume that conflicts will be resolved in a manner determined to be in the overall best interests of klr group including its various businesses and relationships accordingly investors should be aware that conflicts will not necessarily be resolved in our favor of the companys interests  gary c hanna our chief executive officer is a party to a consulting agreement with energy xxi which contains a noncompetition provision this agreement is referred to as the noncompetition agreement until june   mr hanna generally will be restricted from acquiring or managing certain businesses in the shallow gulf of mexico that broadly compete with the business activities of energy xxi in light of the noncompetition agreement we will not seek an initial business combination with any company operating in the businesses described above unless such transaction were to close subsequent to the expiration of the noncompetition provision any litigation associated with the noncompetition agreement could be time consuming costly and distract managements focus from locating suitable acquisition candidates and operating our business  in connection with the consummation of our business combination or thereafter we may retain klr group to provide certain financial advisory underwriting capital raising and other services for which they may receive fees the amount of fees we pay to klr group will be based upon the prevailing market for similar services rendered by comparable investment banks for such transactions at such time and will be subject to the review of our audit committee pursuant to the      table of contents audit committees policies and procedures relating to transactions that may present conflicts of interest klr group will not be asked to render a fairness opinion with respect to our initial business combination as klr group may have a conflict of interest by virtue of its affiliation with our sponsor as a consequence we may be required to retain another firm to render such an opinion if one is required without limiting the foregoing the following describes some of the potential conflicts that could arise general  the founder shares and private placement warrants owned by our sponsor executive officers directors and director nominees will be released from the lockup only if a business combination is successfully completed and the warrants held by our sponsor executive officers directors and director nominees including the private placement warrants and any warrants which they may purchase in this offering or in the open market will expire worthless if a business combination is not consummated additionally the holders of founder shares will not receive liquidation distributions with respect to any of their founder shares furthermore our sponsor has agreed that the private placement warrants will not be sold or transferred by them until  days after we have completed a business combination for the foregoing reasons our board may have a conflict of interest in determining whether a particular target business is appropriate to effect a business combination with  our sponsor and our executive officers directors and director nominees may purchase shares of common stock as part of this offering or in the open market if they do they have agreed to vote such shares in favor of our initial business combination  klr group has no fiduciary obligations to us therefore it has no obligation to present business opportunities to us at all and will only do so if it believes it will not violate its other fiduciary obligations advisory activities  klr group currently operates a merchant banking business that could compete with us for acquisition targets klr group may also choose to operate or have an interest in investment entities similar to us or that otherwise compete with us in the future neither klr group nor members of our management who are also employed by klr group have any obligation to present us with any opportunity for a potential business combination of which they become aware unless such opportunity was expressly offered in writing to our management solely in their capacity as officers or directors of the company klr group andor our management in their capacities as officers of klr group or in their other endeavors may choose to present potential business combinations to the related entities described above current or future klr group internal investment vehicles including other blank check companies in which klr group may participate or third parties including clients of klr group before they present such opportunities to us in addition the independent directors that we appoint may have preexisting duties or obligations that prevent them from presenting otherwise suitable target businesses to us our independent directors will be under no obligation to present opportunities of which they become aware to the company unless such opportunity was expressly offered to the independent director solely in his capacity as a director of the company  other clients of klr groups advisory business may also compete with us for investment opportunities meeting our investment objectives if klr group is engaged to act for any such clients we may be precluded from pursuing such opportunities  investment ideas generated within klr group including by mr kovalik and other persons who may make decisions for the company may be suitable for us and for an investment banking client or a current or future klr group internal investment vehicle including other blank check companies in which klr group may participate and may be directed to such client or investment vehicle rather than to us      table of contents  klr groups advisory business may also be engaged to advise the seller of a company or of assets that would qualify as an investment opportunity for the company in such cases we may be precluded from participating in the sale process or from purchasing the business or assets if we are permitted to pursue the opportunity klr groups interests or its obligations to the seller will diverge from our interests accordingly as a result of multiple business affiliations our executive officers directors and director nominees may have similar legal obligations relating to presenting business opportunities meeting our investment criteria to multiple entities in addition conflicts of interest may arise when our board evaluates a particular business opportunity with respect to our investment criteria the above mentioned conflicts may not be resolved in our favor any of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination our management believes however that our status as a public entity and potential access to the united states public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privatelyheld entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business or businesses with significant growth potential on favorable terms we have agreed not

officers and directors our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that our executive officers directors and director nominees will be indemnified by us to the fullest extent authorized by delaware law as it now exists or may in the future be amended in addition our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that our directors will not be personally liable for monetary damages to us for breaches of their fiduciary duty as directors except to the extent such exemption from liability or limitation thereof is not permitted by the dgcl we will enter into agreements with our executive officers directors and director nominees to provide contractual indemnification in addition to the indemnification provided for in our amended and restated certificate of incorporation our bylaws also permit us to maintain insurance on behalf of any executive officer director or employee for any liability arising out of his or her actions regardless of whether delaware law would permit such indemnification we will purchase a policy of directors and officers liability insurance that insures our executive officers directors and director nominees against the cost of defense settlement or payment of a judgment in some circumstances and insures us against our obligations to indemnify our executive officers directors and director nominees these provisions may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors for breach of their fiduciary duty these provisions also may have the effect of reducing the likelihood of derivative litigation against executive officers and directors even though such an action if successful might otherwise benefit us and our stockholders furthermore a stockholders investment may be adversely affected to the extent we pay the costs of settlement and damage awards against executive officers and directors pursuant to these indemnification provisions we believe that these provisions

initial business combinations and provide for related redemptions of public shares for cash upon completion of such initial business combinations even when a vote is not required by law if a stockholder vote is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons we will pursuant to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation conduct the redemptions pursuant to the tender offer rules of the sec and file tender offer documents with the sec prior to completing our initial business combination our amended and restated

like many blank check companies offer to redeem shares in conjunction with a proxy solicitation pursuant to the proxy rules and not pursuant to the tender offer rules if we seek stockholder approval we will complete our initial business combination only if a majority of the outstanding shares of common stock voted are voted in favor of the business combination however the participation of our sponsor executive officers directors advisors or their affiliates in privatelynegotiated transactions as described in this prospectus if any could result in the approval of our business combination even if a majority of our public stockholders vote or indicate their intention to vote against such business combination for purposes of seeking approval of the majority of our outstanding shares of common stock nonvotes will have no effect on the approval of our business combination once a quorum is obtained we intend to give approximately  days but not less than  days nor more than  days prior

business combination and b to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination within  months from the closing of this offering although our initial stockholders or any of our executive officers directors or affiliates will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any public shares acquired if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the allotted month time period and iii the founder shares are automatically convertible into shares of our class a common stock at the time of our initial business combination on a oneforone basis subject to adjustment pursuant to certain antidilution rights as described herein if we submit our business combination to our public stockholders for a vote our initial stockholders have agreed to vote their founder shares and any public shares purchased during or after this offering in favor of our initial business combination and our executive officers directors and director nominees have also agreed to vote any public shares purchased during or after the offering in favor of our initial business combination as a result we would need only  of the  public shares or  sold in this offering to be voted in favor of our initial business combination in order to have such transaction approved assuming the overallotment option is not exercised and no shares are purchased by such parties in this offering permitted transferees of our sponsor will be subject to the same obligations of our sponsor the shares of class f common stock will automatically convert into shares of class a common stock at the time of our initial business combination on a oneforone basis subject to adjustment as provided herein in the case that additional shares of class a common stock or equitylinked securities are issued or deemed issued in excess of the amounts offered in this prospectus and related to the closing of the business combination the ratio at which shares of class f common stock shall convert into shares of class a common      table of contents stock will be adjusted so that the number of shares of class a common stock issuable upon conversion of all shares of class f common stock will equal in the aggregate on an asconverted basis  of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding upon completion of this offering plus all shares of class a common stock and equitylinked securities issued or deemed issued in connection with the business combination excluding any shares or equitylinked securities issued or to be issued to any seller in the business combination or pursuant to warrants issued to our sponsor upon conversion of working capital loans after taking into account any shares of class a common stock redeemed in connection with the business combination subject to certain limited exceptions  of their founder shares will not be transferred assigned or sold until the earlier of i one year after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination or ii the date on which the closing price of our common stock equals or exceeds  per share as adjusted for stock splits stock dividends reorganizations and recapitalizations for any  trading days within any trading day period commencing  days after our initial business combination and the remaining  of the founder shares will not be transferred assigned or sold until six months after the date of the consummation of our initial business combination or earlier in either case if subsequent to our initial business combination we consummate a subsequent liquidation merger stock exchange or other similar transaction which results in all of our shareholders having the right to exchange their common stock for cash securities or other property preferred stock our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series our board of directors will be authorized to fix the voting rights if any designations powers preferences the relative participating optional or other special rights and any qualifications limitations and restrictions thereof applicable to the shares of each series our board of directors will be able to without stockholder approval issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of the common stock and could have antitakeover effects the ability of our board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of us or the removal of existing management we have no preferred stock outstanding at the date hereof although we do not currently intend to issue any shares of preferred stock we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future no shares of preferred stock are being issued or registered in this offering warrants public stockholders warrants each warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase one share of our class a common stock at a price of  per share subject to adjustment as discussed below at any time commencing on the later of  months from the closing of this offering or  days after the completion of our initial business combination the warrants will expire five years after the completion of our initial business combination at  pm new york city time or earlier upon redemption or liquidation we will not be obligated to deliver any shares of class a common stock pursuant to the exercise of a warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the securities act with respect to the shares of class a common stock underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current subject to our satisfying our obligations described below with respect to registration no warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their warrants unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder unless an exemption is available in the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a warrant the holder of such warrant will not be entitled to exercise such warrant and such warrant may have no value and expire worthless in the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised warrants the purchaser of a unit containing such warrant will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for the share of class a common stock underlying such unit we have agreed that as soon as practicable but in no event later than  days after the closing of our initial business combination we will use our best efforts to file with the sec a registration statement for the      table of contents registration under the securities act of the shares of class a common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants we will use our best efforts to cause the same to become effective no later than  days after the closing of our initial business combination and to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and a current prospectus relating thereto until the expiration of the warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement notwithstanding the foregoing if a registration statement covering the shares of class a common stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants is not effective within  days following the consummation of our initial business combination public warrant holders may until such time as there is an effective registration statement and during any period when we shall have failed to maintain an effective registration statement exercise warrants on a cashless basis pursuant to an available exemption from registration under the securities act in such event each holder would pay the exercise price by surrendering the warrants for that number of shares of class a common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing x the product of the number of shares of class a common stock underlying the warrants multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value defined below by y the fair market value the fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the shares of class a common stock for the  trading days ending on the day prior to the date of exercise if an exemption from registration is not available holders will not be able to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis once the warrants become exercisable we may call the warrants for redemption  in whole and not in part  at a price of  per warrant  upon not less than  days prior written notice of redemption the day redemption period to each warrant holder and  if and only if the reported last sale price of the class a common stock equals or exceeds  per share for any  trading days within a trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send to the notice of redemption to the warrant holders we have established the last of the redemption criterion discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the warrant exercise price if the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption of the warrants each warrant holder will be entitled to exercise his her or its warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date however the price of the class a common stock may fall below the  redemption trigger price as well as the  warrant exercise price after the redemption notice is issued if we call the warrants for redemption as described above our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise his her or its warrant to do so on a cashless basis in determining whether to require all holders to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis our management will consider among other factors our cash position the number of warrants that are outstanding and the dilutive effect on our stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of class a common stock issuable upon the exercise of our warrants if our management takes advantage of this option all holders of warrants would pay the exercise price by surrendering their warrants for that number of shares of class a common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing x the product of the number of shares of class a common stock underlying the warrants multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value defined below by y the fair market value the fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the class a common stock for the  trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of warrants if our management takes advantage of this option the notice of redemption will contain the information necessary to calculate the number of shares of class a common stock to be received upon exercise of the warrants including the fair market value in such case requiring a cashless exercise in this manner will reduce the number of shares to be issued and thereby lessen the dilutive effect of a warrant redemption we believe this feature is an attractive option to us if we do not need the cash from the exercise of the warrants after our initial business combination if we call our warrants for redemption and our management does not take advantage of this option our sponsor and its permitted transferees would still be entitled to exercise their      table of contents private placement warrants for cash or on a cashless basis using the same formula described above that other warrant holders would have been required to use had all warrant holders been required to exercise their warrants on a cashless basis as described in more detail below a holder of a warrant may notify us in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the right to exercise such warrant to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise such person together with such persons affiliates to the warrant agents actual knowledge would beneficially own in excess of  or such other amount as a holder may specify of the shares of class a common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise if the number of outstanding shares of class a common stock is increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of class a common stock or by a splitup of shares of class a common stock or other similar event then on the effective date of such stock dividend splitup or similar event the number of shares of class a common stock issuable on exercise of each warrant will be increased in proportion to such increase in the outstanding shares of class a common stock a rights offering to holders of class a common stock entitling holders to purchase shares of class a common stock at a price less than the fair market value will be deemed a stock dividend of a number of shares of class a common stock equal to the product of i the number of shares of class a common stock actually sold in such rights offering or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such rights offering that are convertible into or exercisable for class a common stock multiplied by ii one  minus the quotient of x the price per share of class a common stock paid in such rights offering divided by y the fair market value for these purposes i if the rights offering is for securities convertible into or exercisable for class a common stock in determining the price payable for class a common stock there will be taken into account any consideration received for such rights as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and ii fair market value means the volume weighted average price of class a common stock as reported during the ten  trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the first date on which the shares of class a common stock trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market regular way without the right to receive such rights in addition if we at any time while the warrants are outstanding and unexpired pay a dividend or make a distribution in cash securities or other assets to the holders of class a common stock on account of such shares of class a common stock or other shares of our capital stock into which the warrants are convertible other than a as described above b certain ordinary cash dividends c to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of class a common stock in connection with a proposed initial business combination d as a result of the repurchase of shares of class a common stock by the company if the proposed initial business combination is presented to the stockholders of the company for approval or e in connection with the redemption of our public shares upon our failure to complete our initial business combination then the warrant exercise price will be decreased effective immediately after the effective date of such event by the amount of cash andor the fair market value of any securities or other assets paid on each share of class a common stock in respect of such event if the number of outstanding shares of our class a common stock is decreased by a consolidation combination reverse stock split or reclassification of shares of class a common stock or other similar event then on the effective date of such consolidation combination reverse stock split reclassification or similar event the number of shares of class a common stock issuable on exercise of each warrant will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares of class a common stock whenever the number of shares of class a common stock purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants is adjusted as described above the warrant exercise price will be adjusted by multiplying the warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction x the numerator of which will be the number of shares of class a common stock purchasable upon the exercise of the warrants immediately prior to such adjustment and y the denominator of which will be the number of shares of class a common stock so purchasable immediately thereafter in case of any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding shares of class a common stock other than those described above or that solely affects the par value of such shares of class a common stock or in the case of any merger or consolidation of us with or into another corporation other than a consolidation or merger in which we are the continuing corporation and that does not result in any      table of contents reclassification or reorganization of our outstanding shares of class a common stock or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or entity of the assets or other property of us as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which we are dissolved the holders of the warrants will thereafter have the right to purchase and receive upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the warrants and in lieu of the shares of our class a common stock immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property including cash receivable upon such reclassification reorganization merger or consolidation or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer that the holder of the warrants would have received if such holder had exercised their warrants immediately prior to such event however if such holders were entitled to exercise a right of election as to the kind or amount of securities cash or other assets receivable upon such consolidation or merger then the kind and amount of securities cash or other assets for which each warrant will become exercisable will be deemed to be the weighted average of the kind and amount received per share by such holders in such consolidation or merger that affirmatively make such election and if a tender exchange or redemption offer has been made to and accepted by such holders other than a tender exchange or redemption offer made by the company in connection with redemption rights held by stockholders of the company as provided for in the companys amended and restated certificate of incorporation or as a result of the repurchase of shares of class a common stock by the company if a proposed initial business combination is presented to the stockholders of the company for approval under circumstances in which upon completion of such tender or exchange offer the maker thereof together with members of any group within the meaning of rule db under the exchange act of which such maker is a part and together with any affiliate or associate of such maker within the meaning of rule b under the exchange act and any members of any such group of which any such affiliate or associate is a part own beneficially within the meaning of rule d under the exchange act more than  of the outstanding shares of class a common stock the holder of a warrant will be entitled to receive the highest amount of cash securities or other property to which such holder would actually have been entitled as a stockholder if such warrant holder had exercised the warrant prior to the expiration of such tender or exchange offer accepted such offer and all of the class a common stock held by such holder had been purchased pursuant to such tender or exchange offer subject to adjustments from and after the consummation of such tender or exchange offer as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in the warrant agreement additionally if less than  of the consideration receivable by the holders of class a common stock in such a transaction is payable in the form of class a common stock in the successor entity that is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or is quoted in an established overthecounter market or is to be so listed for trading or quoted immediately following such event and if the registered holder of the warrant properly exercises the warrant within thirty days following public disclosure of such transaction the warrant exercise price will be reduced as specified in the warrant agreement based on the per share consideration minus blackscholes warrant value as defined in the warrant agreement of the warrant the warrants will be issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between continental stock transfer  trust company as warrant agent and us you should review a copy of the warrant agreement which will be filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is a part for a complete description of the terms and conditions applicable to the warrants the warrant agreement provides that the terms of the warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision but requires the approval by the holders of at least  of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants the warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the warrant agent with the exercise form on the reverse side of the warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated accompanied by full payment of the exercise price or on a cashless basis if applicable by certified or official bank check payable to us for the number of warrants being exercised the warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of class a common stock and any voting rights until they exercise their warrants and receive shares of class a common stock after the issuance of shares of class a common stock upon exercise of the warrants each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by stockholders      table of contents warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares of class a common stock no fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants if upon exercise of the warrants a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share we will upon exercise round down to the nearest whole number the number of shares of class a common stock to be issued to the warrant holder private placement warrants the private placement warrants including the class a common stock issuable upon exercise of the private placement warrants will not be transferable assignable or salable until after the completion of our initial business combination except among other limited exceptions as described under principal stockholders  transfers of founder shares and private placement warrants and they will not be redeemable by us and will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by the initial holders or their permitted transferees otherwise the private placement warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the warrants being sold as part of the units in this offering if the private placement warrants are held by holders other than the initial holders or their permitted transferees the private placement warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the warrants included in the units being sold in this offering if holders of the private placement warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless basis they would pay the exercise price by surrendering his her or its warrants for that number of shares of class a common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing x the product of the number of shares of class a common stock underlying the warrants multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value defined below by y the fair market value the fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the class a common stock for the  trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent the reason that we have agreed that these warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by our sponsor and permitted transferees is because it is not known at this time whether they will be affiliated with us following a business combination if they remain affiliated with us their ability to sell our securities in the open market will be significantly limited we expect to have policies in place that prohibit insiders from selling our securities except during specific periods of time even during such periods of time when insiders will be permitted to sell our securities an insider cannot trade in our securities if he or she is in possession of material nonpublic information accordingly unlike public stockholders who could exercise their warrants and sell the shares of class a common stock received upon such exercise freely in the open market in order to recoup the cost of such exercise the insiders could be significantly restricted from selling such securities as a result we believe that allowing the holders to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis is appropriate dividends we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date and do not intend to pay cash dividends prior to the completion of a business combination the payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings if any capital requirements and general financial condition subsequent to completion of a business combination the payment of any cash dividends subsequent to a business combination will be within the discretion of our board of directors at such time in addition our board of directors is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any stock dividends in the foreseeable future except if we increase the size of the offering pursuant to rule b under the securities act in which case we will effect a stock dividend with respect to our class f common stock immediately prior to the consummation of the offering in such amount as to maintain the ownership of founder shares by our initial stockholders prior to this offering at  of our issued and outstanding shares of our common stock upon the consummation of this offering further if we incur any indebtedness our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith our transfer agent and warrant agent the transfer agent for our common stock and warrant agent for our warrants is continental stock transfer  trust company we have agreed to indemnify continental stock transfer  trust company in its roles as transfer agent and warrant agent its agents and each of its stockholders directors officers and employees against all liabilities including judgments costs and reasonable counsel fees that may arise out of      table of contents acts performed or omitted for its activities in that capacity except for any liability due to any gross negligence willful misconduct or bad faith of the indemnified person or entity our amended and restated certificate of incorporation our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will contain certain requirements and restrictions relating to this offering that will apply to us until the completion of our initial business combination these provisions cannot be amended without the approval of the holders of at least  of our common stock and then only if we allow dissenting holders the opportunity to get their pro rata share from the trust account our initial stockholders who will beneficially own  of our common stock upon the closing of this offering assuming they do not purchase any units in this offering will participate in any vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and will have the discretion to vote in any manner they choose specifically our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide among other things that  if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering we will i cease all operations except for the purpose of winding up ii as promptly as reasonably possible but not more than ten business days thereafter subject to lawfully available funds therefor redeem  of the public shares at a pershare price payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest which interest shall be net of income taxes payable divided by the number of then outstanding public shares which redemption will completely extinguish public stockholders rights as stockholders including the right to receive further liquidation distributions if any subject to applicable law and iii as promptly as reasonably possible following such redemption subject to the approval of our remaining stockholders and our board of directors dissolve and liquidate subject in the case of clauses ii and iii to our obligations under delaware law to provide for claims of creditors and the requirements of other applicable law  prior to our initial business combination we may not issue additional shares of capital stock that would entitle the holders thereof to i receive funds from the trust account or ii vote on any initial business combination  although we do not intend to enter into a business combination with a target business that is affiliated with our management team or their affiliates we are not prohibited from doing so in the event we enter into such a transaction we or a committee of independent directors will obtain an opinion from an independent accounting firm or an investment banking firm that such a business combination is fair to our company from a financial point of view  if a stockholder vote on our initial business combination is not required by law and we do not decide to hold a stockholder vote for business or other legal reasons we will offer to redeem our public shares pursuant to rule e and regulation e of the exchange act and will file tender offer documents with the sec prior to completing our initial business combination which contain substantially the same financial and other information about our initial business combination and the redemption rights as is required under regulation a of the exchange act  our initial business combination must occur with one or more target businesses that together have an aggregate fair market value of at least  of our assets held in the trust account excluding taxes payable on the income earned on the trust account at the time of the agreement to enter into the initial business combination  if our stockholders approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem  of our public shares if we do not complete our business combination within  months from the closing of this offering we will provide our public stockholders with the opportunity to redeem all or a portion of their shares of common stock upon such approval at a pershare price payable in cash equal to the aggregate amount then on deposit in the trust account including interest which interest shall be net of income taxes payable divided by the number of then outstanding public shares and  we will not effectuate our initial business combination with another blank check company or a similar company with nominal operations      table of contents in addition our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that under no circumstances will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net tangible assets to be less than  upon the consummation of our initial business combination certain antitakeover provisions of delaware law and our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws we will be subject to the provisions of section  of the dgcl regulating corporate takeovers upon completion of this offering this statute prevents certain delaware corporations under certain circumstances from engaging in a business combination with  a stockholder who owns  or more of our outstanding voting stock otherwise known as an interested stockholder  an affiliate of an interested stockholder or  an associate of an interested stockholder for three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder a business combination includes a merger or sale of more than  of our assets however the above provisions of section  do not apply if  our board of directors approves the transaction that made the stockholder an interested stockholder prior to the date of the transaction  after the completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder that stockholder owned at least  of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced other than statutorily excluded shares of common stock or  on or subsequent to the date of the transaction the business combination is approved by our board of directors and authorized at a meeting of our stockholders and not by written consent by an affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder our amended and restated certificate of incorporation will provide that our board of directors will be classified into two classes of directors as a result in most circumstances a person can gain control of our board only by successfully engaging in a proxy contest at two or more annual meetings our authorized but unissued common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuances without stockholder approval and could be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes including future offerings to raise additional capital acquisitions and employee benefit plans the existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest tender offer merger or otherwise special meeting of

or any us federal taxes other than income taxes such as gift and estate taxes you are urged to consult your tax advisor with respect to the application of us federal tax laws to your particular situation as well as any tax consequences arising under the laws of any state local or foreign jurisdiction personal holding company status we could be subject to a second level of us federal income tax on a portion of our income if we are determined to be a personal holding company or phc for us federal income tax purposes a us corporation generally will be classified as a phc for us federal income tax purposes in a given taxable year if i at any time during the last half of such taxable year five or fewer individuals without regard to their citizenship or residency and including as individuals for this purpose certain entities such as certain taxexempt organizations pension funds and charitable trusts own or are deemed to own pursuant to certain constructive ownership rules more than  of the stock of the corporation by value and ii at least  of the corporations adjusted ordinary gross income as determined for us federal income tax purposes for such taxable year consists of phc income which includes among other things dividends interest certain royalties annuities and under certain circumstances rents depending on the date and size of our initial business combination at least  of our adjusted ordinary gross income may consist of phc income as discussed above in addition depending on the concentration of our stock in the hands of individuals including the members of our sponsor and certain taxexempt organizations pension funds and charitable trusts more than  of our stock may be owned or deemed      table of contents owned pursuant to the constructive ownership rules by such persons during the last half of a taxable year thus no assurance can be given that we will not become a phc following this offering or in the future if we are or were to become a phc in a given taxable year we would be subject to an additional phc tax currently  on our undistributed phc income which generally includes our taxable income subject to certain adjustments we believe that both of the phc requirements will apply to us in the taxable year of the offering and that it is possible that the phc requirements will apply to us in future taxable years allocation of purchase price and characterization of a unit no statutory administrative or judicial authority directly addresses the treatment of a unit or instruments similar to a unit for us federal income tax purposes and therefore that treatment is not entirely clear the acquisition of a unit should be treated for us federal income tax purposes as the acquisition of one share of our class a common stock and one warrant to acquire one share of our class a common stock we intend to treat the acquisition of a unit in this manner and by purchasing a unit you will agree to adopt such treatment for tax purposes for us federal income tax purposes each holder of a unit must allocate the purchase price paid by such holder for such unit between the one share of class a common stock and the warrant based on the relative fair market value of each at the time of issuance the price allocated to each share of class a common stock and the warrant should be the stockholders tax basis in such share or warrant as the case may be any disposition of a unit should be treated for us federal income tax purposes as a disposition of the share of class a common stock and one warrant comprising the unit and the amount realized on the disposition should be allocated between the class a common stock and warrant based on their respective relative fair market values the separation of the share of class a common stock and the warrant comprising a unit should not be a taxable event for us federal income tax purposes the foregoing treatment of the shares of class a common stock and warrants and a holders purchase price allocation are not binding on the irs or the courts because there are no authorities that directly address instruments that are similar to the units no assurance can be given that the irs or the courts will agree with the characterization described above or the discussion below accordingly each prospective investor is urged to consult its own tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of an investment in a unit including alternative characterizations of a unit the balance of this discussion assumes that the characterization of the units described above is respected for us federal income tax purposes us holders this section applies to you if you are a us holder a us holder is a beneficial owner of our units shares of class a common stock or warrants who or that is for us federal income tax purposes  an individual who is a citizen or resident of the united states  a corporation or other entity taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes organized in or under the laws of the united states any state thereof or the district of columbia or  an estate or trust the income of which is includible in gross income for us federal income tax purposes regardless of its source taxation of distributions   if we pay cash distributions to us holders of shares of our class a common stock such distributions generally will constitute dividends for us federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under us federal income tax principles distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will constitute a return of capital that will be applied against and reduce but not below zero the us holders adjusted tax basis in our class a common stock any remaining excess will be treated as gain realized on the sale or other disposition of the class a common stock and will be treated as described under  gain or loss on sale taxable exchange or other taxable disposition of class a common stock below dividends we pay to a us holder that is a taxable corporation generally will qualify for the dividends received deduction if the requisite holding period is satisfied with certain exceptions including but not limited to dividends treated as investment income for purposes of investment interest deduction limitations and provided certain holding period requirements are met dividends we pay to a noncorporate us holder generally will constitute qualified dividends that will be subject to tax at the maximum tax rate accorded to      table of contents longterm capital gains it is unclear whether the redemption rights with respect to the class a common stock described in this prospectus may prevent a us holder from satisfying the applicable holding period requirements with respect to the dividends received deduction or the preferential tax rate on qualified dividend income as the case may be gain or loss on sale taxable exchange or other taxable disposition of class a common stock and warrants   upon a sale or other taxable disposition of our class a common stock or warrants which in general would include a redemption of class a common stock or warrants as described below and including as a result of a dissolution and liquidation in the event we do not consummate an initial business combination within the required time period a us holder generally will recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the amount realized and the us holders adjusted tax basis in the class a common stock or warrants any such capital gain or loss generally will be longterm capital gain or loss if the us holders holding period for the class a common stock or warrants so disposed of exceeds one year it is unclear however whether the redemption rights with respect to the class a common stock described in this prospectus may suspend the running of the applicable holding period for this purpose longterm capital gains recognized by noncorporate us holders will be eligible to be taxed at reduced rates the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations generally the amount of gain or loss recognized by a us holder is an amount equal to the difference between i the sum of the amount of cash and the fair market value of any property received in such disposition or if the class a common stock or warrants are held as part of units at the time of the disposition the portion of the amount realized on such disposition that is allocated to the class a common stock or the warrants based upon the then fair market values of the class a common stock and the warrants included in the units and ii the us holders adjusted tax basis in its class a common stock or warrants so disposed of a us holders adjusted tax basis in its class a common stock or warrants generally will equal the us holders acquisition cost that is as discussed above the portion of the purchase price of a unit allocated to a share of class a common stock or warrant or as discussed below the us holders initial basis for class a common stock received upon exercise of warrants less in the case of a share of class a common stock any prior distributions treated as a return of capital redemption of class a common stock   in the event that a us holders class a common stock is redeemed pursuant to the redemption provisions described in this prospectus under description of securities  common stock or if we purchase a us holders class a common stock in an open market transaction the treatment of the transaction for us federal income tax purposes will depend on whether the redemption qualifies as sale of the class a common stock under section  of the code if the redemption qualifies as a sale of common stock the us holder will be treated as described under  gain or loss on sale taxable exchange or other taxable disposition of class a common stock and warrants above if the redemption does not qualify as a sale of common stock the us holder will be treated as receiving a corporate distribution with the tax consequences described above under  taxation of distributions whether a redemption qualifies for sale treatment will depend largely on the total number of shares of our stock treated as held by the us holder including any stock constructively owned by the us holder as a result of owning warrants relative to all of our shares outstanding both before and after the redemption the redemption of class a common stock generally will be treated as a sale of the class a common stock rather than as a corporate distribution if the redemption i is substantially disproportionate with respect to the us holder ii results in a complete termination of the us holders interest in us or iii is not essentially equivalent to a dividend with respect to the us holder these tests are explained more fully below in determining whether any of the foregoing tests are satisfied a us holder takes into account not only stock actually owned by the us holder but also shares of our stock that are constructively owned by it a us holder may constructively own in addition to stock owned directly stock owned by certain related individuals and entities in which the us holder has an interest or that have an interest in such us holder as well as any stock the us holder has a right to acquire by exercise of an option which would generally include class a common stock which could be acquired pursuant to the exercise of the warrants in order to meet the substantially disproportionate test the percentage of our outstanding voting stock actually and constructively owned by the us holder immediately following the redemption of class a common stock      table of contents must among other requirements be less than  of the percentage of our outstanding voting stock actually and constructively owned by the us holder immediately before the redemption there will be a complete termination of a us holders interest if either i all of the shares of our stock actually and constructively owned by the us holder are redeemed or ii all of the shares of our stock actually owned by the us holder are redeemed and the us holder is eligible to waive and effectively waives in accordance with specific rules the attribution of stock owned by certain family members and the us holder does not constructively own any other stock the redemption of the class a common stock will not be essentially equivalent to a dividend if a us holders conversion results in a meaningful reduction of the us holders proportionate interest in us whether the redemption will result in a meaningful reduction in a us holders proportionate interest in us will depend on the particular facts and circumstances however the irs has indicated in a published ruling that even a small reduction in the proportionate interest of a small minority stockholder in a publicly held corporation who exercises no control over corporate affairs may constitute such a meaningful reduction a us holder should consult with its own tax advisors as to the tax consequences of a redemption if none of the foregoing tests is satisfied then the redemption will be treated as a corporate distribution and the tax effects will be as described under  taxation of distributions above after the application of those rules any remaining tax basis of the us holder in the redeemed class a common stock will be added to the us holders adjusted tax basis in its remaining stock or if it has none to the us holders adjusted tax basis in its warrants or possibly in other stock constructively owned by it exercise or lapse of a warrant   except as discussed below with respect to the cashless exercise of a warrant a us holder generally will not recognize taxable gain or loss the acquisition of common stock upon exercise of a warrant for cash the us holders tax basis in the share of our class a common stock received upon exercise of the warrant generally will be an amount equal to the sum of the us holders initial investment in the warrant ie the portion of the us holders purchase price for a unit that is allocated to the warrant as described above under   general treatment of units and the exercise price the us holders holding period for the class a common stock received upon exercise of the warrants will begin on the date following the date of exercise of the warrants and will not include the period during which the us holder held the warrants if a warrant is allowed to lapse unexercised a us holder generally will recognize a capital loss equal to such holders tax basis in the warrant the tax consequences of a cashless exercise of a warrant are not clear under current tax law a cashless exercise may be taxfree either because the exercise is not a gain realization event or because the exercise is treated as a recapitalization for us federal income tax purposes in either taxfree situation a us holders basis in the class a common stock received would equal the holders basis in the warrant if the cashless exercise were treated as not being a gain realization event a us holders holding period in the class a common stock would be treated as commencing on the date following the date of exercise of the warrant if the cashless exercise were treated as a recapitalization the holding period of the class a common stock would include the holding period of the warrant it is also possible that a cashless exercise could be treated in part as a taxable exchange in which gain or loss would be recognized in such event a us holder could be deemed to have surrendered warrants equal to the number of shares of class a common stock having a value equal to the exercise price for the total number of warrants to be exercised the us holder would recognize capital gain or loss in an amount equal to the difference between the fair market value of the class a common stock represented by the warrants deemed surrendered and the us holders tax basis in the warrants deemed surrendered in this case a us holders tax basis in the class a common stock received would equal the sum of the fair market value of the class a common stock represented by the warrants deemed surrendered and the us holders tax basis in the warrants exercised a us holders holding period for the class a common stock would commence on the date following the date of exercise of the warrant due to the absence of authority on the us federal income tax treatment of a cashless exercise there can be no assurance which if any of the alternative tax consequences and holding periods described above would be adopted by the irs or a court of law accordingly us holders should consult their tax advisors regarding the tax consequences of a cashless exercise      table of contents possible constructive distributions   the terms of each warrant provide for an adjustment to the number of shares of common stock for which the warrant may be exercised or to the exercise price of the warrant in certain events as discussed in the section of this prospectus captioned description of securities   warrants  public stockholders warrants an adjustment which has the effect of preventing dilution generally is not taxable the us holders of the warrants would however be treated as receiving a constructive distribution from us if for example the adjustment increases the warrant holders proportionate interest in our assets or earnings and profits eg through an increase in the number of shares of common stock that would be obtained upon exercise as a result of a distribution of cash to the holders of shares of our common stock which is taxable to the us holders of such shares as described under  taxation of distributions above such constructive distribution would be subject to tax as described under that section in the same manner as if the us holders of the warrants received a cash distribution from us equal to the fair market value of such increased interest information reporting and backup withholding   in general information reporting requirements may apply to dividends paid to a us holder and to the proceeds of the sale or other disposition of our units shares of class a common stock and warrants unless the us holder is an exempt recipient backup withholding may apply to such payments if the us holder fails to provide a taxpayer identification number a certification of exempt status or has been notified by the irs that it is subject to backup withholding and such notification has not been withdrawn any amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules will be allowed as a refund or a credit against a us holders us federal income tax liability provided the required information is timely furnished to the irs nonus holders this section applies to you if you are a nonus holder a nonus holder is a beneficial owner of our units shares of class a common stock and warrants who or that is for us federal income tax purposes  a nonresident alien individual other than certain former citizens and residents of the united states subject to us tax as expatriates  a foreign corporation or  an estate or trust that is not a us holder but does not include an individual who is present in the united states for  days or more in the taxable year of disposition if you are such an individual you should consult your tax advisor regarding the us federal income tax consequences of the sale or other disposition of our securities taxation of distributions   in general any distributions we make to a nonus holder of shares of our class a common stock to the extent paid out of our current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under us federal income tax principles will constitute dividends for us federal income tax purposes and provided such dividends are not effectively connected with the nonus holders conduct of a trade or business within the united states we will be required to withhold tax from the gross amount of the dividend at a rate of  unless such nonus holder is eligible for a reduced rate of withholding tax under an applicable income tax treaty and provides proper certification of its eligibility for such reduced rate usually on an irs form wben or wbene any distribution not constituting a dividend will be treated first as reducing but not below zero the nonus holders adjusted tax basis in its shares of our class a common stock and to the extent such distribution exceeds the nonus holders adjusted tax basis as gain realized from the sale or other disposition of the class a common stock which will be treated as described under  gain on sale taxable exchange or other taxable disposition of class a common stock and warrants below in addition if we determine that we are likely to be classified as a united states real property holding corporation see  gain on sale taxable exchange or other taxable disposition of class a common stock and warrants below we will withhold  of any distribution that exceeds our current and accumulated earnings and profits      table of contents the withholding tax does not apply to dividends paid to a nonus holder who provides a form weci certifying that the dividends are effectively connected with the nonus holders conduct of a trade or business within the united states instead the effectively connected dividends will be subject to regular us income tax as if the nonus holder were a us resident subject to an applicable income tax treaty providing otherwise a nonus corporation receiving effectively connected dividends may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax imposed at a rate of  or a lower treaty rate exercise of a warrant   the us federal income tax treatment of a nonus holders exercise of a warrant or the lapse of a warrant held by a nonus holder generally will correspond to the us federal income tax treatment of the exercise or lapse of a warrant by a us holder as described under us holders  exercise or lapse of a warrant above although to the extent a cashless exercise results in a taxable exchange the consequences would be similar to those described below in  gain on sale taxable exchange or other taxable disposition of class a common stock and warrants gain on sale taxable exchange or other taxable disposition of class a common stock and warrants   a nonus holder generally will not be subject to us federal income or withholding tax in respect of gain recognized on a sale taxable exchange or other taxable disposition of our class a common stock which would include a dissolution and liquidation in the event we do not complete an initial business combination within  months from the closing of this offering or warrants including an expiration or redemption of our warrants in each case without regard to whether those securities were held as part of a unit unless  the gain is effectively connected with the conduct of a trade or business by the nonus holder within the united states and under certain income tax treaties is attributable to a united states permanent establishment or fixed base maintained by the nonus holder or  we are or have been a us real property holding corporation for us federal income tax purposes at any time during the shorter of the fiveyear period ending on the date of disposition or the period that the nonus holder held our class a common stock and in the case where shares of our class a common stock are regularly traded on an established securities market the nonus holder has owned directly or constructively more than  of our class a common stock at any time within the shorter of the fiveyear period preceding the disposition or such nonus holders holding period for the shares of our class a common stock there can be no assurance that our class a common stock will be treated as regularly traded on an established securities market for this purpose unless an applicable treaty provides otherwise gain described in the first bullet point above will be subject to tax at generally applicable us federal income tax rates as if the nonus holder were a us resident any gains described in the first bullet point above of a nonus holder that is a foreign corporation may also be subject to an additional branch profits tax at a  rate or lower treaty rate if the second bullet point above applies to a nonus holder gain recognized by such holder on the sale exchange or other disposition of our class a common stock or warrants will be subject to tax at generally applicable us federal income tax rates in addition a buyer of our class a common stock or warrants from such holder may be required to withhold us federal income tax at a rate of  of the amount realized upon such disposition we cannot determine whether we will be a us real property holding corporation in the future until we complete an initial business combination we will be classified as a us real property holding corporation if the fair market value of our us real property interests equals or exceeds  percent of the sum of the fair market value of our worldwide real property interests plus our other assets used or held for use in a trade or business as determined for us federal income tax purposes      table of contents redemption of class a common stock   the characterization for us federal income tax purposes of the redemption of a nonus holders class a common stock pursuant to the redemption provisions described in this prospectus under description of securities  class a common stock generally will correspond to the us federal income tax characterization of such a redemption of a us holders class a common stock as described under us holders  redemption of class a common stock above and the consequences of the redemption to the nonus holder will be as described above under nonus holders  taxation of distributions and nonus holders  gain on sale taxable exchange or other taxable disposition of class a common stock and warrants as applicable information reporting and backup withholding   information returns will be filed with the irs in connection with payments of dividends and the proceeds from a sale or other disposition of our units shares of class a common stock and warrants a nonus holder may have to comply with certification procedures to establish that it is not a united states person in order to avoid information reporting and backup withholding requirements the certification procedures required to claim a reduced rate of withholding under a treaty will satisfy the certification requirements necessary to avoid the backup withholding as well the amount of any backup withholding from a payment to a nonus holder will be allowed as a credit against such holders us federal income tax liability and may entitle such holder to a refund provided that the required information is timely furnished to the internal revenue service fatca withholding taxes   provisions commonly referred to as fatca impose withholding of  on payments of dividends including constructive dividends on our class a common stock or warrants and beginning in  sales or other disposition proceeds from our units shares of class a common stock and warrants to foreign financial institutions which is broadly defined for this purpose and in general includes investment vehicles and certain other nonus entities unless various us information reporting and due diligence requirements generally relating to ownership by us persons of interests in or accounts with those entities have been satisfied or an exemption applies typically certified as to by the delivery of a properly completed irs form wbene if fatca withholding is imposed a beneficial owner that is not a foreign financial institution generally will be entitled to a refund of any amounts withheld by filing a us federal income tax return which may entail significant administrative burden foreign financial institutions located in jurisdictions that have an intergovernmental agreement with the united states governing fatca may be subject to different rules prospective investors should consult their tax advisers regarding the effects of fatca on their investment in our securities      table

underwriters against liabilities under the securities act or contribute to payments that the underwriters may be required to make in that respect our units will be listed on the nasdaq capital market under the symbol klreu and once the class a common stock and warrants begin separate trading the class a common stock and warrants will be listed on nasdaq under the symbols klre and klrew respectively prior to this offering there has been no public market for our securities consequently the initial public offering price for the units was determined by negotiations between us and the representative the determination of our per unit offering price was more arbitrary than would typically be the case if we were an operating company among the factors considered in determining initial public offering price were the history and prospects of companies whose principal business is the acquisition of other companies prior offerings of those companies our management our capital structure and currently prevailing general conditions in equity securities markets including current market valuations of publicly traded companies considered comparable to our company we cannot assure you however that the price at which the units class a common stock or warrants will sell in the public market after this offering will not be lower than the initial public offering price or that an active trading market in our units class a common stock or warrants will develop and continue after this offering in connection with the offering the underwriters may engage in stabilizing transactions overallotment transactions syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids in accordance with regulation m under the exchange act  stabilizing transactions permit bids to purchase the underlying security so long as the stabilizing bids do not exceed a specified maximum  overallotment involves sales by the underwriters of units in excess of the number of units the underwriters are obligated to purchase which creates a syndicate short position the short position may be either a covered short position or a naked short position in a covered short position the number of units overallotted by the underwriters is not greater than the number of units that they may purchase in the overallotment option in a naked short position the number of units involved is greater than the number of units in the overallotment option the underwriters may close out any covered short position by either exercising their overallotment option andor purchasing units in the open market  syndicate covering transactions involve purchases of the units in the open market after the distribution has been completed in order to cover syndicate short positions in determining the source of units to close out the short position the underwriters will consider among other things the price of units available for purchase in the open market as compared to the price at which they may purchase units through the overallotment option if the underwriters sell more units than could be covered by the overallotment option a naked short position the position can only be closed out by buying units in the open market a naked short position is more likely to be created if the underwriters are concerned that there could be downward pressure on the price of the units in the open market after pricing that could adversely affect investors who purchase in the offering  penalty bids permit the representative to reclaim a selling concession from a syndicate member when the units originally sold by the syndicate member are purchased in a stabilizing or syndicate covering transaction to cover syndicate short positions these stabilizing transactions syndicate covering transactions and penalty bids may have the effect of raising or maintaining the market price of our units or preventing or retarding a decline in the market price of the units as a result the price of our units may be higher than the price that might otherwise exist in the open market these transactions may be effected on the nasdaq national market or otherwise and if commenced may be discontinued at any time we are not under any contractual obligation to engage any of the underwriters to provide any services for us after this offering and have no present intent to do so however any of the underwriters may introduce us to
