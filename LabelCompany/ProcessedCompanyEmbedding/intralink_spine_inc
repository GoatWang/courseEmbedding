ils is pleased to announce the completion of the phase  longterm largeanimal in vivo testing for the réjuve treatment for lower back pain “the purpose of this study was to verify and validate the final design and safety of the réjuve device in a six month largeanimal sheep model the sheep received fluoroscopic imageguided injections of réjuve in two lumbar intervertebral discs with two posterolateral injections per treated level” states dr tom hedman “no infections clinically relevant or chronic inflammation or behavioral or neuromuscular effects were seen in the animals over the course of the six month study this study showed that the procedure to inject réjuve is safe and can be effectively administered using only standard fluoroscopic techniques” according to lyle hawkins ceo of intralinkspine “this is another significant milestone for the réjuve treatment this study clearly shows the safety and simplicity of the réjuve treatment we’re excited about these results and what this treatment means to those suffering from lower back pain réjuve is truly going to be a disruptive breakthrough for the treatment of lower back pain” learn more at wwwintralinkspinecom according to dr hedman cso of intralinkspine and a leading researcher in softtissue biomechanics “réjuve works in the same manner as the body’s natural response to heal instability and degradation of the spinal disc the réjuve device immediately strengthens and stabilizes the disc upon injection to reduce the pain of the patient and eliminate future episodes of debilitating back pain” “réjuve creates permanent molecular bonds so we’re hopeful that two perhaps even one set of injections are all a patient will ever need to receive permanent lower back pain relief” says hawkins “and réjuve is a much simpler and less expensive treatment than what is being considered with stem cells” about  percent of the adults in the us experience significant back pain at some point in their life and most

experience relief with new treatment august   by whitney harder credit university of kentucky millions of americans suffering from low back pain could soon have a quick costeffective and permanent solution for the debilitating ailment the solution an injectable liquid called réjuve was pioneered by university of kentucky researcher tom hedman and has received promising early results from a recent clinical study réjuve a product of intralinkspine inc and the focus of hedmans research at uk is an injectable orthopaedic device that mechanically strengthens the spinal disc and stabilizes the spinal joint a key to réjuves effectiveness is the devices ability to promote crosslinking of fibrous proteins including collagen which rejuvenates the spinal disk area according to an intralinkspine news release one patient reported that he played  holes of golf three days after the réjuve procedure and another climbed the sydney harbor bridge a few days post procedure this treatment addresses the core deficiencies that contribute to low back pain rather than just temporarily masking the pain like existing approaches said hedman who is an adjunct associate professor in the f joseph halcomb iii md department of biomedical engineering and chief scientific officer at intralinkspine secondly the benefit is almost immediate within days these patients are returning to work and strenuous activities with a dramatic reduction in pain hedman also said both the cost of réjuve and the minute imageguided delivery procedure are considerably less than current and emerging treatments  this is obviously extremely important as we see health care costs exploding in this country and abroad he said the company is hopeful that patients will experience permanent low back pain relief with just one or two réjuve injections currently many low back pain sufferers receive numerous epidural steroid injections each year hedman joined the uk faculty in  and brought intralinkspine to uks coldstream research campus he credits biomedical engineering faculty for providing collegial support and advice as intralinkspine has translated technology from the lab to the clinic additionally the uk college of engineering and college of medicine the national institutes of health and the commonwealth of kentucky provided a portion of the financial support needed to complete the preclinical testing of réjuve  the excitement of seeing technology that youve tested and developed for over  years at long last reach the clinical stage of testing is indescribable hedman said health sciences researchers like myself choose this profession with the desire to see our lifes work benefit others its still very early but every one of our patients thus far are happy with the results of the treatment hedman and the company are now planning a larger multisite clinical study  explore further are antibiotics effective for low back pain tweet favorites email print pdf featured last
