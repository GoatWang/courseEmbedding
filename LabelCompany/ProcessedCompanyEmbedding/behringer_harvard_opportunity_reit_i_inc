real estate losses jan     pm by bruce kelly  zoom photo lobstar its more bad news for behringer harvard holdings llc as an investor who saw the value of her real estate fund drop to  from an original investment of  has begun to complain to regulators on friday d gayle salyer fired a letter to the financial industry regulatory authority inc to complain about the real estate firm which has seen the estimated valuations of some its real estate investment trusts and funds slashed recently “what is going on with the behringer harvard shortterm opportunity fund” ms salyer wrote “in a sixyear period bh has blown away  of my money i would like to know how much of my money has been taken by mr behringer as salary benefits and expenses as well as the management team” at the end of december investors in the behringer harvard shortterm opportunity fund i lp which had about  million in total assets saw its valuation drop to  cents a share down drastically from  a share dec   in an interview ms salyer  said she had not filed an arbitration complaint against her broker dennis freeman who is affiliated with capital financial services inc she also said she wrote the letter to finra with the assistance of mr freeman who said that she also sent a letter to the texas state securities board behringer harvard is based in addison texas particularly distressing is the lack of direct communication from behringer harvard explaining what happened to wipe almost all of the funds value said ms salyer who also lost  of a  investment in provident royalties llc a series of private placements that the securities and exchange commission in  charged with fraud behringer harvard “keeps sending me stuff that shows my money is gone” she said “the only communication is the account statement they sent nothing to say were in trouble nothing” the securities and exchange commission has jurisdiction over funds and reits while finra has jurisdiction over brokerdealers that sell those products industry observers noted finra has recently drawn attention to the issue of how the valuation of illiquid investments — including nontraded reits — are shown on client account statements in september finra issued for comment a proposed amendment to the current rule and the proposal would limit the time period that the initial estimated value would be used on the client account statement the rule change would also require brokerdealers to deduct costs of the offering such as commissions to brokers from that initial valuation “we are looking into the areas over which we have jurisdiction including sales to investors by brokerdealers” said finra spokeswoman nancy condon “but we cant comment about ongoing investigations” “clientspecific information is confidential and behringer harvard does not comment publicly about specific clients” behringer ceo bob aisner said in a statement “our investment services team is available to speak with investors and their financial representatives about specific account questions” he noted that the shortterm opportunity fund makes information public through regular reports and filings with the securities and exchange commission in the statement mr aisner also said “behringer harvard has been very committed to the success of the fund as evidenced by  million of support from behringer harvard which will not be recouped” that support included waived fees and cash support from the sponsor for the fund he wrote in the statement “since the inception of the fund investors have received  per unit in total distributions which includes both recurring monthly distributions and special distributions” mr aisner wrote “condominium projects and singlefamily lot developments which usually depend on redevelopment repositioning or recapitalization were especially hardhit and the fund invested in these asset types before the great recession in addition the fund was significantly negatively impacted by the lack of availability of financing for opportunistic assets over the last several years”mr freeman the broker said that capital financial services stopped selling behringer harvard products within the last year meanwhile

behringer is best known for producing a wide range of musical tools at affordable prices what is less well known is the passion for music that drives the founder uli behringer born into a musical household uli learned to play piano at the age of four by the age of  he had designed and built his first synthesizer keyboard the ub later uli would go on to study both classical piano and audio engineering setting the foundation for his namesake company in  products anyone can afford being a musician and an engineer uli behringers philosophy is to provide tools any musician or engineer could afford behringer equipment quickly became known as a costeffective alternative to wellknown industrystandard equipment from effects processors equalizers and compressors to microphone preamplifiers direct boxes and mixing consoles it was clear that behringer aimed to become a permanent player in the music retail industry its even arguable that the affordability and variety of behringer products played a huge role in the hobbyist recording market as we know it today from studio to stage and beyond in  behringer made big waves in the audio industry with the eurodesk mx mixing console delivering features of boards costing almost twice as much that would mark behringers dedication to producing live sound equipment for practically any application beyond mixers and speakers behringer would also go on to develop a wide range of feedback elimination solutions rackmount digital processors analog crossovers microphones dj mixers and much more by the early s many aspiring musicians and engineers had behringer to thank for creating gear they could afford and grow with recognized by musicians and engineers worldwide in  behringer consolidated  separate production facilities into one single factory in china dubbed behringer city since then they have continued to expand their product range while maintaining affordable prices products such as the x series of digital mixers the bugera family of tube guitar amplifiers and the eurolive series of powered pa speakers offer powerful yet affordable tools for musicians live sound mixers studio engineers and broadcast audio
