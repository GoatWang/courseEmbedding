s with the most recent developments in the areas of asynchronous circuit design testing and verification logic synthesis for fieldprogrammable gate arrays by rajeev murgai book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide short turnaround has become critical in the design of electronic systems software programmable components such as microprocessors and digital signal processors have been used extensively in such systems since they allow rapid design revisions however the inherent performance limitations of softwareprogrammable systems mean that they are inadequate for highperformance designs designers thus turned to gate arrays as a solution userprogrammable gate arrays fieldprogrammable gate arrays fpgas have recently emerged and are changing the way electronic systems are designed and implemented the growing complexity of the logic circuits that can be packed onto an fpga chip means that it has become important to have automatic synthesis

developers and professionals in the field of embedded systems designjacket analysis and simulation of noise in nonlinear electronic circuits and systems by alper demir book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide the existence of electrical noise is basically due to the fact that electrical charge is not continuous but is carried in discrete amounts equal to the electron charge electrical noise represents a fundamental limit on the performance of electronic circuits and systems with the explosive growth in the personal mobile communications market the need for noise analysissimulation techniques for nonlinear electronic circuits and systems has been reemphasized even though most of the signal processing is done in the digital domain every wireless communication device has an analog frontend which is usually the bottleneck in the design of the whole system the requirements for lowpower operation and higher levels of integration create new challenges in the design of the analog signal processing subsystems of these mobile communication devices the effect of noise on the performance of these inherently nonlinear analog circuits is becoming more and more significant analysis and simulation of noise in nonlinear electronic circuits and systems presents analysis simulation and characterization techniques and behavioral models for noise in nonlinear electronic circuits and systems along with practical examples this book treats the problem within the framework of and using techniques from the probabilistic theory of stochastic processes and stochastic differential systems analysis and simulation of noise in nonlinear electronic circuits and systems will be of interest to rfanalog designers as well as engineers interested in stochastic modeling and simulation crosstalk noise immune vlsi design using regular layout fabrics by sunil p khatri book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this book was motivated by the problems being faced with shrinking ic process feature sizes it is well known that as process feature sizes shrink a host of electrical problems such as crosstalk electromigration selfheat etc become important crosstalk is one of the major problems since it results in unpredictable design behavior in particular it can result in significant delay variation or signal integrity problems in a wire depending on the state of its neighboring wire typical approaches to tackling the crosstalk problem attempt to fix the problem once it is created this book introduces a framework for crosstalkfree ic design the main foundation of the book is the use of a predetermined layout pattern on the ic which we call a layout fabric the authors characterize this fabric and show how it yields crosstalkimmune designs two vlsi design flows are introduced which use the fabric concept one flow is a minimally modified standardcell based flow the other flow uses a network of plas to implement the circuit the authors also introduce wire removal techniques which improve circuit wire ability and thereby reduce circuit area the new concepts presented here will be of interest to ic designers and researchers noise analysis of radio frequency circuits by amit mehrotra book  editions published between  and  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide in this book we concentrate on developing noise simulation techniques for rf circuits the difference between our approach of performing noise analysis for rf circuits and the traditional techniques is that we first concentrate on the noise analysis for oscillators instead of nonoscillatory circuits as a first step we develop a new quantitative description of the dynamics of stable nonlinear oscillators in presence of deterministic perturbations unlike previous such attempts this description is not limited to twodimensional system of equations and does not make any assumptions about the type of nonlinearity by considering stochastic perturbations in a stochastic differential calculus setting we obtain a correct mathematical characterization of the noisy oscillator output we present efficient numerical techniques both in time domain and in frequency domain for computing the phase noise of oscillators this approach also determines the relative contribution of the device noise sources to phase noise which is very useful for oscillator design selected papers on computeraided design of very large scale integrated circuits book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide embedded systems development  from functional models to implementations by alberto sangiovannivincentelli book  editions published between  and  in english and undetermined and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide this book offers readers broad coverage of techniques to model verify and validate the behavior and performance of complex distributed embedded systems the authors attempt to bridge the gap between the three disciplines of modelbased design realtime analysis and modeldriven development for a better understanding of the ways in which new development flows can be constructed going from systemlevel modeling to the correct and predictable generation of a distributed implementation leveraging current and future research results describes integration of heterogeneous models discusses synthesis of task model implementations and code implementations compares modelbased design vs modeldriven approaches explains how to enforce correctness by construction in the functional and time domains includes optimization techniques for control performance

king brayton book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide securityaware design for cyberphysical systems  a platformbased approach by chungwei lin book  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide addressing the rising security issues during the design stages of cyberphysical systems this book develops a systematic approach to address security at early design stages together with all other design constraints cyberattacks become more threatening as systems are becoming more connected with the surrounding environment infrastructures and other systems security mechanisms can be designed to protect against attacks and meet security requirements but there are many challenges of applying security mechanisms to cyberphysical systems including open environments limited resources strict timing requirements and large number of devices designed for researchers and professionals this book is valuable for individuals working in network systems security mechanisms and system design it is also suitable for advancedlevel students of computer science hardwaresoftware codesign of embedded systems  the polis approach by felice balarin  editions published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide embedded systems are informally defined as a collection of programmable parts surrounded by asics and other standard components that interact continuously with an environment through sensors and actuators the programmable parts include microcontrollers and digital signal processors dsps embedded systems are often used in lifecritical situations where reliability and safety are more important criteria than performance today embedded systems are designed with an ad hoc approach that is heavily based on earlier experience with similar products and on manual design use of higherlevel languages such as c helps structure the design somewhat but with increasing complexity it is not sufficient formal verification and automatic synthesis of implementations are the surest ways to guarantee safety thus the polis system which is a codesign environment for embedded systems is based on a formal model of computation polis was initiated in  as a research project at the university of california at berkeley and over the years grew into a full design methodology with a software system supporting it hardwaresoftware codesign of embedded systems the polis approach is intended to give a complete overview of the polis system including its formal and algorithmic aspects hardwaresoftware codesign of embedded systems the polis approach will be of interest to embedded system designers automotive electronics consumer electronics and telecommunications

problems arising in fsm synthesis by means of binary decision diagrams bdds a topdown constraintdriven design methodology for analog integrated circuits by henry chang  edition published in  in english and held by  worldcat member libraries worldwide analog circuit design is often the bottleneck when designing mixed analogdigital systems a topdown constraintdriven design methodology for analog integrated circuits presents a new methodology based on a topdown constraintdriven design paradigm that provides a solution to this problem this methodology has two principal advantages  it provides a high probability for the first silicon which meets all specifications and  it shortens the design cycle a topdown constraintdriven design methodology for analog integrated circuits is part of an ongoing research effort at the university of california at berkeley in the electrical engineering and computer sciences department many faculty and students past and present are working on this design methodology and its supporting tools the principal goals are  developing the design methodology  developing and applying new tools and  proving the methodology by undertaking industrial strength design examples the work presented here is neither a beginning nor an end in the development of a complete topdown constraintdriven design methodology but rather a step in its development this work is divided into three parts chapter  presents the design methodology along with foundation material chapters  describe supporting concepts for the methodology from behavioral simulation and modeling to circuit module generators finally chapters  illustrate the methodology in detail by presenting the entire design cycle through three largescale examples these include the design of a current source da converter a sigmadelta ad converter and a video driver system chapter  presents conclusions and current research topics a topdown constraintdriven design methodology for analog integrated circuits will be of interest to analog and mixedsignal designers as well as cad tool developers   more fewer audience level     kids general special   audience level  from  for embedded s

kaufman award to professor alberto sangiovannivincentelli   th november  a richard newton  it is a very special pleasure and an honor for me to present the eighth annual phil kaufman award to professor alberto sangiovannivincentelliacademic entrepreneur businessman and a personal friend for more than a quarter century   but where do you start to describe his career his impact on eda and on the lives of so many of us in academia and in industry on his many students and business leaders throughout the world everyone i have spoken to about alberto believes they know him well and yet they only really know a fraction of this man who works so tirelessly in all of these areas of endeavor and many more tonight i will take a few moments to describe to you the alberto i know and will share the insights of a few key people who have had the chance to walk beside alberto for a part of this amazing journey ill begin at the politecnico di milano one of the most distinguished universities in  italy where alberto graduated as a dottore in ingegneria summa cum laude doctor of engineering in  and served as professore incaricato of electrical engineering from  at  years of age he was already making his mark as the youngest associate professor in the university i first met alberto in  when he and his young family came to berkeley for what was to be just a six month stay as a nato fellow i was a new phd student working with professor don pederson and alberto was a research associate a guest of professor ernie kuh when alberto arrived in california  he was utterly disappointed the first insight i will share with you about alberto is that quality in all its forms is an essential element of everything in albertos lifefrom his research to his business relationships to the wine he drinks and the food he eats and most of all to his personal relationships perhaps this is an influence of his parents of his early family lifethe only child of an aristocratic italian family but having seen  america  on the big screen in italy with its beautiful hollywood villas and green rolling hillsarriving in california only to stay at the golden bear motel on university avenue in berkeley was a bitter disappointment to be sure he and his family were ready to return home immediately so when his six month stay was ending at the encouragement of the berkeley faculty then department chair david sakrison invited alberto to stay at berkeley and even consider applying for a permanent faculty position not wanting to offend the chair alberto explained that his department chair in italy really needed him back and so he had to leave now at berkeley  when were onto a good thing we dont give up so easily so without albertos knowledge sakrison wrote to albertos chair at politecnico di milano asking how come alberto couldnt stay an bit longer at berkeley and then by chance alberto bumped into his italian boss on his way back home at the airport in milano oh by the way he told alberto i wrote back to sakrison saying you are welcome to stay longer at berkeley if you like ugh he was stuck so he returned to berkeley as a visiting assistant professor the following year and never left but alberto was a system guy back then sparse matricies numerical analysis linear placement for printed wiring boards were his areas of emphasis he traveled in the circles of researchers like ernie kuh leon chua and charlie desoer and knew very little about real circuits let alone integrated circuits back then it was in the late s that he alberto caught don pedersons eye i first became acquainted with alberto when he was a young assistant professor in eecs says professor don pederson himself a kaufmann winner alberto was eligible for a permanent position in circuit and systems theory groups in this county as well as in his home country italy  although alberto was not formally skilled in electronics it was clear to me after observing him that he had the talent needed to move effectively into new territory and i approached him to join our ic group in short order he was able to grasp the broad range of abilities that are needed to be effective in this area and from the outset he has been a key faculty member in our group it is astounding that he has been able to do so much in electronics i joined the faculty at berkeley in  myself and we immediately became fast friends and colleagues for life as an impetuous pair of young faculty we began to take on the world of cad and then eda believing we could see a different futurea better futureand wanting to be sure it came to pass now not being one who believes in a predetermined destiny i believe that at any given point in time there are many possible futures that can come to pass and the one that is eventually manifest is influenced strongly by those that believe in it that strive to make it happen so my second insight for you tonight about alberto is that one reason he has been as successful as he has been in his distinguished career is that once alberto sees a future once he believes in a future there is no one in this world who works harder and with more determination that alberto to make it come out the way he thinks it should no one and he has also had the abilitythe talent the respect the relationshipsto literally influence the future of this industry more than once as professor luciano lavagno of the politecnico di torino and research scientist at cadence berkeley labs puts it working with alberto is always exciting and stimulating because he has a great ability to use all his experience about what is happening in eda design and fabrication to look forward and predict what is going to happen what is going to be hot what is going to be problematic he then pushes towards a solution without regard to the difficulty to the fact that noone has been there before raw focused energy is the key aspect that he puts in his work and in his life this is truly the mark of an entrepreneur albertos academic career is unparalled with over  technical publications to his name and fourteen booksspanning the areas of eda control theory systems theory and applied mathematics just to name a fewalberto has educated and mentored a generation of distinguished university faculty and industry leaders among his many awards he includes the distinguished teaching award of the university of california  awarded to only the top few percent of faculty on our campus early in his graduate career at berkeley professor jacob white one of albertos phd students and now a distinguished faculty member at mit was working on the new waveform relaxation wr method while professor res saleh one of my own students was working on what we called iterated timing analysis itatwo accurate but fast methods for simulating large digital circuits alberto had been giving talks about wr in which he claimed that wr had guaranteed convergence properties while ita did not as jacob says i tried to convince alberto that once you discretized the differential equations wr had the same convergence properties as ita alberto was very patient with meat the time i was not doing very well as a studentand he had every reason to believe that i was simply confused however the very second that my argument was clear to him alberto changed from being a patient listener to an enthusiastic one the fact that i was suggesting that what he had been presenting was wrong did not concern him at all he was interested in only two things getting the right answer and expressing his pleasure that one of his students had figured out something that he had missed of course jacob continues this incident demonstrated to me that being the one who is right is unimportant while getting to the right answer is important but for me the idea that my advisor would be pleased that i had uncovered an error really helped me understand what it means to be an academic the job is not about leading your students the job is about having students stand on your shoulders and see further than you did that is one of the most important lessons i learned from alberto this is just one of many such experiences i could quote from any one of the more than  phd students alberto has guided to graduation over the past quarter centuryanother amazing achievement as gerry sullivan once shared with me as we walked along a stretch of beach near monterey many years ago i have finally worked out why you berkeley guys do so wellyou just work so much harder than everyone else in albertos case that should read harder smarter and with an unrelenting passion to succeed in everything he embarks upon whether as an individual as part of a team or as a mentor he will pull you along with him at that moment you are considering giving in making a compromise alberto will spur you on for that extra mile and the satisfaction you share with him at that moment of success makes it all worthwhile like a runners highit is an experience you will never forget and one you will strive to repeat time and time again  no matter what alberto tackles he succeeds in making an impressive set of contributions says professor bob brayton of ibm research and now berkeley our logic synthesis collaboration was marked by lots of excitement enthusiasm and fun it was fun since we shared the common conviction that a firm mathematical foundation and proven results leads to better understanding and to better algorithms at dac in  i remember sitting on a couch in the lobby of the las vegas hilton working with alberto on the remaining algorithmic piece of the twolevel logic optimizer espresso when we finally got it we were so excitedit was far better than winning at the casino in  alberto joined jim solomon then at national semiconductor and me as we sought for ways to get some of our early berkeley cad tools and ideas supported by industry after six months of talking with companies like daisy systems mentor graphics comsat general valid logic systems and even the microelectronics and computer consortium mcc in austin texas and finding no takers jim decided to start a company to support and develop our ideas for commercial use as sda systems and eventually cadence design systems ill leave it to joe costello former ceo of cadence to describe albertos influence on that company from the very beginning alberto helped to shape cadence then sda systems long before i was there he sent his students worked the strategy and guided the product he agonized when the company struggled to get off the ground he talked to customers to get them to work with us he criticized counseled consoled he tried to get us to think big when we were small he tried to get us to work with an even smaller company synopsys as it was born but we didnt understand he supported our moves to merge with ecad tangent gateway when others didnt agree he was a scientific advisor and a consultant he worked with our engineering team year after year inspiring them challenging them spurring them on he provided insights into where we should go and who could best take us there he pushed and pushed and pushed to make us great he personally created cadence berkeley labs with patrick scaglia he established it in the us and abroad thereby institutionalizing forward thinking in the company he worked with our leading edge product groups like alta but at the same time he did not forget our roots and worked just as hard to make sure that our core product lines and teams stayed current and competitive but albertos contribution was not limited to technology he was every bit as present on the business side as an investor and a board member he engaged with just as much enthusiasm in the board meetings as he did as a scientific advisor or as the leader of cadence berkeley labs as i reread these words they look so pathetic when i stand them up against reality words are such a weak tool to encapsulate what alberto has meant to me personally and to cadence i wish that i could share with you a video kaleidoscope of the times that we have spent together it would better capture some of the energy passion and emotion you would better understand the highs the lows and the ultimate victory but still when i run the video in my mind and stand it up against reality it is also too narrow too thin if you werent there to see it as it unfolded how can i help you to understand albertos contribution perhaps since you werent there a symbol would be best when you think of cadence remember that the a in cadence stands for albertowithout the a without alberto the company would just not be the same ray bingham summarizes albertos ongoing contributions to cadence as follows alberto has had a profound and lasting influence on cadence as a company and on me personally as an individual as cadences chief technology advisory alberto provides boundless intellectual capacity and bandwidth which i leverage when considering various business technology strategic and political issues in other words hes my ultimate reality check now one of those companies that joe mentioned was tangent and aki fujimura now president and coo of simplex solutions was a founder of tangent aki recalls that steve teig and i both benefited tremendously from albertos insights and guidance while we were rolling out tangate fourteen years ago alberto was instrumental in evangelizing the shift from a channelsandrows based semicustom architecture to the seaofgatesseaofcells architecture that the whole world uses today albertos greatest strength is his unique blend of technical breadth and depth his intuition for people and his business savvy just a few years later alberto was also a key contributor to the founding team of synopsys and was the founding chair of the synopsys technical advisory board as aart de geus says alberto has the amazing talent and drive to simultaneously recognize breakthrough technology talented people and a business opportunity so often he has acted as a powerful catalyst in amplifying the work of the people around him i will always be grateful for his contribution in starting the most exciting eda company of all timewhichever one you happen to think it is albertos ph d students in particular rick rudell and albert wang formed a core part of the product team for design compiler the most successful single product in the history of the eda industry to date and design compiler was influenced very strongly by the berkeley work of bob brayton alberto and their students in the area of multilevel logic synthesis in  cadence and synopsys had grown to the point where they were beginning to compete in the marketplace and alberto was forced to make a choice i can personally attest to the fact that this was one of the most difficult choices alberto has ever had to make he agonized long and hard on it and frankly at the time he could have gone either way my third insight into the man over the years i have learned that alberto likes to be involved in just about everything for two reasons first he like many of us has a very hard time saying no to people he likes and respects second when alberto makes a commitment you can always count on him to see it through no matter what it takes and he found himself in a situation where he had personally committed his energy to both teamsteams that were now in an irreconcilable conflict for him i know those were some of the toughest days for alberto as he worked through that situation to this day i know he has a strong love for both companies of all the contributions alberto has made to our industry the two that he is personally most proud of are his work in guided analog synthesisdefining a new approach to the automated design of analog ic blocks through the red book as he likes to call itand his work on systemlevel design while alberto has collaborated closely with many of the leading researchers in eda and control systems over the years in these two areas he has truly paved the way for us all he really began by advocating systemlevel design research in earnest back in  stressing the importance of a comprehensive view of systemsnot just the chips the importance of software and hardware that the methodology was key to finding a common ground for effective system design and that one had to study embedded systems and their application in the real world if one was to find a rigorous wellfounded and yet practical approach to the design and verification of complex embedded systems who among us had not heard of communicationbased design or the importance of orthogonalization of concerns or functionarchitecture decomposition these are just a few of the concepts alberto has developed and evangelized for years now and all are finding their rightful place in our modern design systems but like all of our kaufman awardees and like phil himself in the end it is as much the person as it is about any specific technical contribution or new business ideait is how they have inspired people throughout their careers through their own personal example as aki fujimura said what makes alberto great is that whether youre meeting him for business or for academic advice the first thing he wants to talk about with you is you we all know that he genuinely cares about us as individuals and that this comes first before anything else for him ray bingham told me earlier this week that albertos deep humanity as a personas a manexudes itself in everything he does that humanity gives him license to inspire and touch people in many ways he certainly has played an inspiring role in my own life and our industry is extremely fortunate to call him one of our own i would also like to take this opportunity to thank alberto for his steadfast friendship and support over these many years through the mostly good times and the occasional tough passage on behalf of your many many friends throughout the world thank you alberto on behalf of mrs kaufman edac and all present here tonight i am honored to be able to present the phil kaufman award to professor alberto sangiovannivincentelli a colleague a mentor and a friend to many of us here tonight and around the world as i wrote this speech i tried to conclude by summarizing what makes alberto specialwhat are those essential characteristics of this man that make him so important to us allbut i found that i just couldnt do it i share joe costellos perspective when he says that words are such a weak tool to encapsulate what alberto has meant to us all so i leave you with these few anecdotes and testimonials of the many we could all share about this founder of our industry and leave it to you to build your own picture of alberto and his many contributions but i know you all agree with me when i say it is clear that alberto stands as a very worthy recipient of this prestigious award so please raise your glasses as we toast alberto tonight professor kurt keutzer speaks for all of us when he says through his technical efforts alberto has done much to define what eda is today but much more than that alberto has set the highest standard for what it means to be a researcher in this field to alberto eda pioneer alberto sangiovannivincentelli joins ultrasoc advisory board • ultrasoc ultrasoc eda pioneer alberto sangiovannivincentelli joins ultrasoc advisory

standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump
