saturday  march   est first published on saturday  march   est name lord waheed alli title founder of planet  born  november  other directorships tornado group chairman of the digital radio group hobbies travelling helping labour win the next election some things can be revived duran duran tank tops even paul daniels career but a sixties soap set in a midlands motel which flatlined in the eighties does not exactly scream resuscitate yet last week more than  million people tuned in for the first episode of the new look crossroads  very new look in fact the setting has shifted from the west to the east midlands and shock horror the motel has gone we couldnt find a motel they no longer exist says lord waheed alli who brought the soap back from tv purgatory it would have been silly to pretend other wise so we went for a four star hotel  very comfortable rooms sitting in the house of parliament canteen alli small and intense is clearly excited about the launch of his baby i grew up with crossroads  and im anxious to see whether people think weve done justice to it hearing that music come up is brilliant alli breaks off to hum the soaps annoying signature tune he and his partner charlie parsons who cofounded tv production house planet  with bob geldof wanted to remake the soap a few years ago but the company which owned the rights wouldnt sell then two years ago alli parsons and geldof sold planet maker of the big breakfast and the word  to carlton for £ million a deal which reportedly earned alli £m the sale cleared the way for him to make a renewed attempt to bring the soap back he had joined carlton as managing director of its programming arm with a brief from chief executive michael green to shake up the division in came lily savage and a deal was signed with ragdoll productions maker of teletubbies  to provide more childrens programming the company also invested in a raft of new primetime dramas and then came crossroads  i dont know why i loved the old crossroads  but you have very few times in your life when you have the creative freedom to do what you want and we wanted to bring it back the chance came when channel  launched its audacious and successful bid to poach aussie soap home and away from itv alli pounced seizing the weekday slot for his baby while soaps tend not to be the greatest revenue drivers for networks making crossroads was not about economics alli says it was part of a rebranding exercise something that is yielding dramatic results  albeit after alli quit carlton to concentrate on politics i know i changed the face of carlton alli says proudly a sentence which nearly causes keith vaz mp sitting nearby to choke on his lunch whats this lord alli my life story vaz asks keith im talking to the observer  alli says playfully vaz doesnt say much after that alli argues that consolidation among media companies means content is now at a premium its inevitable that carlton and granada will merge channel  is going to rtl the challenge now is to build brands across the platforms and this is why content is so important content may not be king just yet but its close its more like queen at the momentthese days alli doesnt get too heavily involved in the production side of things hes concentrating on his next offspring winning the next election for labour alli was probably new labour before new labour media savvy and like all labour apparatchiks a mix of the urban and the urbane alli left school at  to find a job so he could support his immigrant parents its a stark contrast to the wealth he now enjoys and his generosity is legendary he once bought big breakfast star denise van outen a £ diamond necklace as a christmas present other details about allis rise to media moguldom are sketchy a close friend of both peter mandelson and tony blair he doesnt do many interviews he has been targeted by racist and homophobic groups most notably over his opposition to clause  after the election alli will probably spend more time building his portfolio of parttime careers hes looking for a directorship with a blue chip ftse company to add to the nonexecutive directorship he holds at tornado group a company that specialises in distributing content over the internet he is also chairman of the the digital radio group the two positions seem incongruous at first if you look at tornado it seems an odd choice says alli but its a business i understand its about delivering creatively i love working with creative talent i love making things hes keen to stress that although tornado is involved with the internet its not a dotcom company complete with short shelflife and terrifying cash burn rate alli is scornful of the institutions that created the internet bubble the people to blame are the venture capitalists you cant give that sort of money to inexperienced managers but now weve gone from one extreme to another and the market has completely dried up alli was offered the chairmanship of drg which holds londons third digital radio licence when he left carlton the group is a consortium made up of gwr scottish media group emap the carphone warehouse and kelvin mackenzies wireless group again radio is not something alli would seem to know much about but he argues that the consortium which has yet to launch its digital channels is all about choice something he does understand for instance we have an asian service which id like to listen to and theres a gay service which ill probably tune into however hes not too sure hell be a regular listener to the country music channel  its not very new labour after all but the problem is that no one listens to digital radio the sets are prohibitively priced and the demand for the new medium just isnt there this is not a shortterm project says alli but one day the government will switch off analogue radio is going through a growth perception problem its seen as old media but it is growing audiences not many are doing that and what about mackenzie who when editor of the sun was not exactly renowned for his appreciation of multicultural multisexual britain ive yet to meet him but im looking forward to it the worlds moved on from when kelvin was at the sun  today we dont have an editor of the sun who goes round outing people its much less homophobic alli could have been in the newspaper game himself if his bid to buy the star last year had been successful we didnt get it richard desmond owner of northern  shell publisher of ok and numerous pornographic magazines was far quicker and far more adept alli it transpires is a big fan of desmond richards enthusiasm is amazing the express papers are looking much better since he took over they look like winners you wouldnt expect a labour lord to say anything else in the runup to an election but soon alli wont have to play the political card so much alli and parsons met with geldof the other week for a spot of brainstorming alli grins at the recollection weve had to rest for a couple of years which is contrary to our instincts but when all three of us met up the sparks were flying what next the return of el dorado  the newcomers  compact  we hold our breath topics business the
