from us item no   caution the  pin parallel and  pin serial interfaces look exactly the same externally  they both use a  pin dshell connection a closer look will reveal that the electronics on the actual interfaces boards are different the best way to determine which  pin communication interface is present in the printer is to print a configuration listing from the printer this listing will show either rs serial or p parallel see manual configuration for how to print out this listing what is the difference between parallel and serial communication parallel and serial communications are two distinct ways of getting data from a pc to our printer serial communication transmits data on only  wires one for sending and one for receiving one bit at a time parallel communication transmits data across multiple wires simultaneously this provides a faster means of data transmission than serial a parallel printer must be connected to a parallel port commonly labeled as an lpt port on a pc the lpt port should be set for bidirectional standard or spp a serial printer must be connected to a serial port commonly labeled as a com port on a pc the com port settings must match the printer serial settings to communicate properly please consult your pc’s literature to learn how to change these settingwhat printer driver should i be using the correct printer driver depends on what

plug the power cord back in this updates the interface with the new usb modethen please follow the windows driver installation guide under the drivers section to complete the installationi have an ethernet interface on my printer and i can ping to my printer but i cant print to it why the most common reason why this happens is because the enable bidirectional support checkbox is checked under the ports tab in the properties of your printer to uncheck this go to your printers and faxesdevices and printers page right click on your printer and select propertiesprinter properties click the ports tab uncheck the enable birdirectional support checkbox then click the apply button and then click the ok buttonwhy do i get an �error encountered in opening lang mon registry� when trying to save changes in the properties of the windows driver   the “lang mon” error is due to the drivers lack of privileges writing to the registry if you encounter this error please use the “transactprinterpropertiesexe” program found in the utilities folder that comes with the windows drivers note  you must right click the transactprinterpropertiesexe program and select run as administrator to allow the changes to be saved to the registry         change values as you want them and then click the save changes button then select yes to allow the windows print spooler to be
