volatility foll owing donald trumps presidential election victory during the fourth quarter of  the municipal market stabilized during the first quarter during the period shortterm municipal yields declined  basis points while intermediate and longerter m yields were flat to slightly higher after experiencing significantly negative outflows during the last six weeks of  mutual fund flows stabilized and turned positive in january as some investors sought to take advantage of both higher municipal yields and attractive relative valuatio ns despite this expression of confidence at the beginning of the year mutual fund flows for the entire quarter were fairly tepid with overall inflows totaling just under  billion issuance during the quarter declined to  billion compared to  b illion during the fourth quarter of  the slowdown in issuance was largely related to the a decline in refunding activity due to higher interest rates and the uncertainty surrounding president trumps agenda for health care tax reform and infrastruc ture spending compared to the sharp selloff during the fourth quarter the municipal market was relatively quiet during the first quarter treasury yields traded in a fairly tight range and the curve was more or less unchanged meanwhile the municipal yield curve st eepened significantly as two and fiveyear yields declined  and  basis points respectively while year yields increased bp as a result short term municipals outperformed longerterm municipals with the fiveand sevenyear part of the curve le ading the way in terms of credit quality lower quality municipals outperformed higher quality as bbbs within the index returned  compared to aaas up  similarly after underperforming significantly during the fourth quarter the bloomberg barclays high yield municipal bond index returned  significantly outperforming investment grade this outperformance was primarily due to higher carry spread tightening and renewed strength

all bondholders than previously anticipated performance summary  eaton vance municipal bond fund the fund eim underperformed the index at net asset value for the quarter aiding the funds performance was its security selection in the electricpower sector and its use of leverage employed through tobs these s ecurities act as a financing mechanism allowing investors to borrow at shortterm rates and invest in higheryielding bonds an overweight exposure to prerefunded bonds detracted from relative performance and the funds security selection among zero cou pon bonds also diminished performance

respectivel y lackluster mutual fund flows and the ongoing expectation of lower taxes under the trump administration have combined to keep municipal valuations attractive in our view in addition we continue to lack specific details related to the specifics of trump s policies what will get through congress and when as a result there are a wide range of potential outcomes in our view the historic move higher in yields during the fourth quarter of  created an emerging opportunity to lock in higher yields and potentially generate higher future returns after the first three months of  we believe
