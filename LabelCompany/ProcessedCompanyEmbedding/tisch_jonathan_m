story share this page continue reading the main story photo jonathan m tisch cochairman of the board of the loews corporation and chairman of its subsidiary loews hotels  resorts credit earl wilsonthe new york times this interview with jonathan m tisch cochairman of the board of the loews corporation and chairman of its subsidiary loews hotels  resorts was conducted and condensed by adam bryantq what were some early influencesa i was fortunate to have grown up as a young kid in the hotel business watching my father bob tisch and my uncle larry tisch create what is today the loews corporation i have a recollection of being  years old standing at the front door of the traymore hotel greeting president eisenhower i was given instructions that i first salute him because he was a general and then i shake his hand i was so nervous i did them both at the same timemy cousins my siblings and i were fully indoctrinated into the hotel business as children in  my father and uncle opened the americana of bal harbour and we would often go there on vacation if i was bored i would go behind the front desk at  years old i would go into the kitchen i would go into the laundry i had free rein to walk around the property and i took full advantage of thatmy first paying job in the industry started when i was  years old and i worked at the former americana on seventh avenue in new york a big hotel that my family built i worked behind the front desk and i used my middle name as my last name so that nobody knew that i was a member of the family that controlled loews hotels and the loews corporation continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story it said “jonathan mark” on my name badge on nights when the hotel was sold out somebody might walk up and say “i have a reservation” and i’d check if they didn’t have one i’d say “no sorry there’s no reservation” then they’d say “well i’m going to call the tisch brothers i know them very well i know all three tisch brothers”now my father’s name was preston robert and my uncle is larry so in one particular case an individual thought that there were three tisch brothers he was going to call preston robert or larry so i knew right away that he didn’t know our familywere you always going to go into the family businessi took about four years off and made a detour to go into the tv business during my senior year at tufts i started as an intern and became a cinematographerproducer for what was then the nbc affiliate in boston i had no experience i befriended the producer who taught me how to shoot and edit film and then videotape when i graduated in  they offered me a job and i spent the next three years in various roles producing shows advertisement continue reading the main story i found those years very informative and helpful to me for the lodging industry with the properties i get very involved in the design hotels are made up of thousands of edits — what the lobby looks like what the room looks like what the food tastes like and so those years in tv have become incredibly beneficial to me newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by

i spoke i had a sense of gravitas one of the things i talk about today is that you really have to know your trade you don’t have to have every answer you can’t be all things to all people and it’s good to surround yourself with people who complement your skill set but you have to know enough to be fluent in every aspect of your company there were some lessons learned early on when i might not have done as much homework as i should haveanother area is rushing to make decisions i think taking time is important especially when you’re making big decisions you need to pull all the facts together and canvass your team to get their input when you’re the ceo or the chairman the air gets very thin at the top and oftentimes you’ve got people telling you what they think you should hear as opposed to telling you the truth and as you become more competent in your abilities you start to be able to parse out what’s fact from fiction and then press somebody to say “are you telling me this because it’s what you believe in or because you think it’s what i want to hear” that only comes from experiencehow do you hireyou have to have a gene for hospitality and i want to see that you have the ability to be creative it doesn’t matter what role you’re in you have to be creative in how you look at the challenges you face and i want people who know how to listen you can learn a lot with your mouth shutwhat advice do you give to new college gradsi will say to them take a job any job you’re not necessarily going to get the first job right out of the box that you want but what you will learn by taking a job immediately is how to deal with other people how to process information how to be part of a team and it’s easier to get a job when you have a job try to work in the field you’re interested in but sometimes you may have to take a job that is not your ideal position but you will still benefit from iti also learned something in my first month at loews hotels in  my boss told me that whenever you’re writing a letter — and now it applies to emails today — never start a paragraph with the word “i” because that immediately sends a message that you are more important than the person that you’re communicating withit has stayed with me now for  years and it’s a message that i always deliver when you start to train your thinking about how to not use “i” you become a better writer and it teaches you how to really think through an issue what are you really trying to say and how are you going to say it without starting the paragraph with the word “i” continue reading the
