dym and patricia felch of counsel for thirdparty plaintiffappellant arnstein  lehr chicago patrick geary and richard hellerman of counsel for thirdparty defendantappellee justice hartman delivered the opinion of the court thirdparty plaintiffappellant lawrence engineering and supply inc lawrence appeals from a summary judgment entered in favor of thirdparty defendantappellee california screw products corp cspc lawrence contends that the circuit court erred in  entering summary judgment without first ruling on the choice of law issue regarding whether cspc was a successor to the liabilities of its predecessor  concluding that cspc was not a corporate successor under illinois law and  granting summary judgment when genuine issues of material fact existed as to the corporate transfers made by cspc this controversy arises from the  crash of an ultralight aircraft flown by vern kramer kramer the cause of the crash was a defective an bolt allegedly supplied to the planes manufacturer weedhopper of utah inc by lawrence kramer filed suit against weedhopper and later added lawrence as a defendant additional facts are set forth in our earlier opinion  illappd   illdec   ned  on march   lawrence filed a thirdparty complaint for contribution against an entity it identified as california screw inc california and cal space corporation cal space alleging that the two companies were in the business of designing manufacturing and selling aircraft quality nuts and bolts the complaint stated that in august  cal space purchased the business assets and liabilities of california and california or cal space or both were liable for defects in products they manufactured and sold prior to november  lawrence asserted that either cal space or california had sold the an bolt to lawrence which in turn sold it to weedhopper which subsequently incorporated it into the kit kramer purchased and ultimately assembled the an bolt allegedly was unreasonably dangerous and defective cspc denied the allegations and following discovery moved for summary judgment pursuant to section  of the code of civil procedure illrevstat  ch  par  maintaining that cspc did not sell an bolts at the time kramer purchased the kit in  and that cspcs predecessor ad machine tooling ad was not in the aircraft fastener business at that time the affidavit and discovery deposition of gunther mendel were submitted into evidence from which the following evidence was adduced in  mendel started the associated machine tool rebuilders partnership with andre fernand in  they incorporated as ad with mendel as the president and fernand as the secretary treasurer the two men were the only shareholders and probably the only directors mendel served as president until  the company was in the business of rebuilding and repairing machinery until  when it changed its corporate name to the present cspc meanwhile in  mendel was also an officer a director and a shareholder of cal space another california corporation separate from ad prior to  cal space was doing business under the name california screw products corporation previously identified above as california california was incorporated in  and mendel acted as an officer a director and a shareholder of that corporation too mendel and fernand served as charter shareholders with fernand the president and mendel the secretarytreasurer when alexander goden joined the firm in  he became the president mendel became the vicepresident and fernand became the secretarytreasurer during its entire corporate life california only had three shareholders mendel drew separate checks from both ad and california the latter had been located  blocks from ad the two firms maintained separate identities in  california made aircraft quality fasteners including the type of bolt allegedly involved in this lawsuit in  california changed its name to cal space which continued to operate out of the same physical location as california had in the later manufacturing stages of california the company had manufactured only lower grade aircraft quality fasteners cal space was not engaged in the same business however california previously had sold its fastener products to individual distributors cal space now sold higher grade aircraft quality fasteners directly to aircraft manufacturers such as boeing and mcdonnell douglas the products were not made on the same machinery and different equipment had to be purchased the name change was intended to reflect the higher grade of the companys product and was done for image reasons in  ad purchased cal spaces old low tech fastener equipment comprising  of cal spaces total equipment for  a short time later ad changed its name to cspc and abandoned its machinery rebuilding business in order to focus exclusively on the fastener business the only documentation of the sale from cal space to ad is a three page bill detailing the transaction cal space subsequently sold its remaining equipment to deutsch fasteners corporation in october  and the company dissolved in november  three of its former employees joined cspc after the deutsch sale however all the manufacturing personnel were kept by deutsch in the contract between cal space and deutsch deutsch did not agree to assume any liabilities incurred by cal space mendel stated that lawrence was a customer of california in  before it became cal space and that lawrence purchased fasteners from california including the an bolt following hearings on the motion the circuit court granted the motion for summary judgment on december   finding no successor liability as a matter of law both kramer and lawrence filed timely notices of appeal however only lawrence remains as an appellant as this court previously granted cspcs motion to dismiss kramers appeal on june   i lawrence initially contends that the circuit court erred by not deciding whether california or illinois law governing successor corporation liability applied to the case at bar the court ruled that it did not have to make the determination because cspc was not a successor corporation under either states law conflicts rules are applied only when a difference in law will make a difference in the outcome hartford v burns international security services inc   illappd    illdec   ned  international administrators inc v life insurance company of north america th cir  fd   n  see also in re air crash disaster near chicago illinois th cir  fd   n  since the circuit court held that cspc was not a successor under either states law the law of each state must be examined in order to determine whether the court erred in not deciding to specifically apply california or illinois law to the case sub judice a in illinois a corporation which purchases the assets of another corporation generally is not liable for the debts and liabilities of the transferor in the absence of an agreement providing otherwise green v firestone tire  rubber co   illappd    illdec   ned  green freeman v white way sign  maintenance co   illappd    illdec   ned  freeman hernandez v johnson press corp   illappd   illdec   ned  hernandez exceptions to the rule include  where there is an express or implied agreement of assumption  where the transaction amounts to a consolidation or merger of the purchaser or seller corporation  where the purchaser is merely a continuation of the seller or  where the transaction is for the fraudulent purpose of escaping liability for the sellers obligations green  illappd at   illdec   ned  quoting hernandez  illappd at   illdec   ned  the first exception is not satisfied here because the only documentation of cal spaces equipment sale to ad is a three page invoice listing which machines were included in the sale no express liability provisions appear on the bill and there is no evidence of any express or implied liability assumption by ad anywhere in the record the sale was not a consolidation or merger under the second exception because cal space and ad each continued their separate existence following the sale see freeman  illappd at   illdec   ned  a de facto merger may be sufficient to allow the sellers liabilities to be imposed on the buyer hernandez  illappd at   illdec   ned  and may occur when the following criteria are present  there is a continuation of the enterprise of the seller corporation so that there is a continuity of management personnel physical location assets and general business operations  there is a continuity of shareholders which results from the purchasing corporation paying for the acquired assets with shares of its own stock this stock ultimately coming to be held by the shareholders of the seller corporation so that they become a constituent part of the purchasing corporation  the seller corporation ceases its ordinary business operations liquidates and dissolves as soon as legally and practically possible  the purchasing corporation assumes those liabilities and obligations of the seller ordinarily necessary for the uninterrupted continuation of normal business operations of the seller corporation freeman  illappd at   illdec   ned  none of the requirements of a de facto merger are present in the case at bar the two companies never shared physical locations and different manufacturing employees were involved although cspc purchased  of cal spaces equipment this sale of assets undisputedly was for cash and not for stock as is required by illinois law furthermore cal space did not cease operations until november  two years after the sale of assets see gonzalez v rock wool engineering co   illappd    illdec   ned  gonzalez there is no evidence in the record that cspc assumed the liabilities of cal space as the court in gonzalez noted it is to be expected that the purchasing corporation will continue the operations of the predecessor but this does not by itself render the purchaser liable for the obligations of the predecessor gonzalez  illappd at   illdec   ned  finally the transfer cannot be considered a fraudulent attempt to escape liability since there is no record evidence that it was conducted for fraudulent reasons only a portion of the corporations equipment was sold cal space continued its operations for several years after that transaction and was amenable to suit from  until it dissolved in  cal space has not been shown to have had knowledge of kramers accident or the resulting lawsuit before  which might have demonstrated a fraudulent motive in making the earlier corporate changes moreover adequate consideration was given before any knowledge of the suit appears to have arisen further evincing a nonfraudulent motive see freeman  illappd at   illdec   ned  under illinois law the circuit court correctly found that no successor corporation liability was assumed from the  sale of assets from cal space to cspc b under california law a purchasing corporation does not assume the selling corporations liabilities unless one of the four exceptions noted above exists or when the purchaser buys and continues the sellers product line ray v alad corp   cald   calrptr   pd  ray in ray the plaintiff sought recovery in strict liability for injuries suffered when he fell from a defective ladder in  the manufacturer of the ladder alad i had sold all its assets on july   and the buyer formed a new corporation alad ii as part of its sale alad i dissolved its corporate existence and cooperated with alad iis organization of a new corporation with the same name owning the assets purchased from alad i factory personnel remained the same and alad ii employed alad is former general manager and principal stockholder as a paid consultant for about six months following the sale resulting in what a california justice later termed as an almost complete overlap of the corporate entities becker v irm corp   cald    calrptr   pd  lucas j dissenting the court allowed recovery against the successor under circumstances where the successor acquired the manufacturing business and continued the output of its product line ray  cald   calrptr   pd  in creating this product line exception the court recognized three primary guidelines for justifying the transfer of liability from seller to buyer including  the lack of an adequate plaintiffs remedy against the seller  the purchasers access to knowledge of product risks and  the transfer of good will associated with the sellers product line ray  cald at   calrptr   pd  all three steps of the ray analysis must be satisfied before the products line theory and successor liability will be imposed lundell v sidney machine tool co   calappd    calrptr  none of the above factors however are identified in the case sub judice five years had elapsed between the time cal space then california allegedly manufactured the defective aircraft bolt and its sale of assets to ad by the time ad purchased the equipment cal space was no longer in the an bolt business having started direct sales of higher tech bolts directly to manufacturers after  these changes attenuate the responsibility ad and its successor cspc might have borne for destroying lawrences remedies against the original manufacturer california and its successor cal space see lundell v sidney machine tool co  cal appd at   calrptr  moreover ad only purchased some of cal spaces resources and did not acquire any of its personnel until two years later when deutsch let them go finally there is no evidence that cal space sold its good will and inventory as part of the sale or agreed to dissolve its corporate existence and to assist and cooperate in the recreation of a new corporation see ray  cald at   calrptr   pd  as previously noted cal space at the time of the sale no longer produced the bolt in question therefore cspc could not continue a product line since cspc did not receive the substantial benefit its predecessor enjoyed this court cannot impose upon it the burden of liability for injuries from bolts its predecessor allegedly manufactured the product line exception therefore is inapplicable to the case at bar cspc is not liable under californias rules of successor corporate liability since the outcome under either california or illinois law is the same the circuit court did not err in declining to formally choose which law to follow assuming arguendo that the outcome would have been different under california law illinois law is the proper law to be applied in such a case successor corporate liability is determined under the choice of law provisions for products liability— traditional tort law barron v kane  roach inc   illappd    illdec   ned  and illinois courts utilize the restatement second of conflicts most significant relationship test for choice of law questions concerning torts as set forth in ingersoll v klein   illd    ned  in applying the test to the case at bar illinois has the most significant relationship in that the possible tort liability derives from applications of illinois products liability law the injury occurred in illinois and the relationship of all the parties is centered in illinois in view of the foregoing the circuit court correctly turned to and applied illinois law ii lawrences final contention is that the circuit court improperly granted cspc summary judgment arguing that several factual questions existed which preclude the grant of a summary judgment the principles governing summary judgment procedure are well established and need not be repeated here illrevstat ch  par b c jackson jordan inc v leydig voit  mayer   illappd    illdec   ned  kellerman v marrue realty  builders   illappd    illdec   ned  montes v hawkins   illappd    illdec   ned  at bar the affidavits and depositions filed show that no questions of fact existed as to whether cspc was a corporate successor to cal spaces liabilities cspc denied making the an bolt in question and the record evidence supports this denial cspc also denied that it was in existence at the time the bolt was made an assertion supported by the record as well although lawrence insists that a genuine issue of fact existed as to whether cspc assumed the liability of cal space it filed no counteraffidavits or counterevidentiary material which support these contentions the circuit court therefore correctly determined that there was no genuine issue of material fact see shoemaker v rushpresbyterian st lukes medical center   illappd    illdec   ned  moreover because cspc could not have been found liable to lawrence based on the theory that cspc should assume its predecessors liability the circuit courts grant of summary judgment was proper see nguyen v johnson machine  press corp   illappd    illdec   ned  for the foregoing reasons the order of the circuit court granting cspc summary judgment must be affirmed affirmed bilandic and scariano jj concur footnotes  this part of the appeal was dismissed on june    the third party complaint identifies this entity as california screw inc mendel testified that the name was the same as cspc however it was an entirely different and independent company  lower grade in this context signifies that the material used in such manufacture is a lower grade alloy  there is no claim or evidence indicating that ad purchased the name california screw products company predecessor to cal space nor did ad succeed to any of the business carried on by the entity which previously used this same name  lawrence asks this court to adopt the products line exception to illinois caselaw if it decides illinois law must be applied such an invitation has been repeatedly rejected by our courts green  illappd at   illdec   ned  gonzalez  illappd at   illdec   ned  freeman  illappd at   illdec   ned  barron v kane  roach inc  illappd at   illdec   ned  domine v fulton iron works   illappd    ned  hernandez  illappd at   illdec   ned  moreover as subsection b reveals cspc is not liable even under the ray doctrine comment your name your email comments  characters remaining leaglecom reserves the
