things that she would like to have so i decided to get it for her as a justbecause present the concept is a good oneand since she is a avid icecream lover i thought she would enjoy using this

it continues to fall out easily other than that it was okay to use i wouldnt buy it for myself or for anyone elsebut it was a fun present to use for a momentcomment  people found this helpful was this

purchasebought this so i could better scoop from tall cylindrical ice cream cartons looked promising however there is one serious design flaw you can push the scoop into the ice cream with no problem but there is no way to remove it without twisting it to the side and pulling up at an angle and what you then have in the scoop looks nothing like the clean cut little cylinders that they portray in the pictures it needs some sort of mechanism to slice across the bottom of the scoop after youve inserted it into the ice cream otherwise youre just pulling up an almost empty scoopin addition the buttons on the side that let you release the metal cylinder for cleaning are near impossible to press  needed something like the edge of a spoon and lots of juggling to get it apartit now sits in the

foundation server    team foundation server  general question  sign in to vote i have  read several blogs and posts here as well but have not been able to get a clear idea of a branching structure to create that will allow merging without any problems no baseless merging   here is the sample folder structure that i would use mainrelease mainreleasev mainreleasevmainqa mainqav mainqavmainsrc   i want to have one codeline per major release in both qa and release  hence the v v etc  dev work would be performed under mainsrc  for all releases  selected builds labels would be promoted to qa and from there to release any bug fixes would be performed on the releasevxx branch with the changes being merged back to qa and src  this would allow dev work to go under src while bug fixing occurs in the specific version of the release branch to create the initial codebase for release or qav a branch would be created from mainsrc   is this a feasible approach  any ideas on improving this would also be much appreciated   if anyone knows of any good postings on this issue and shares that would also really help   thanks in advance   thursday august    pm reply  quote answers  sign in to vote a

qateamprojectreleasesrelease teamprojectreleasesrelease  qadoesnt matter at all thursday august    pm reply  quote  sign in to vote i  disagree in that looks very much like a big offer for for some to do exactly what was put aside  a baseless merge under that scenario code fixes for rel x could only be merged ultimately back into main since that is the ultimate parent of the release lines thats fine but this means that to get that same code into my active vnext dev line i then also have to merge from main down through active qa to active dev in that process i now have code in the qa line that has not even been merged into the dev line at least for some time and is some hybrid of who knows what  but certainly is not qa code how can i have a qa build on the qa code line when it has code that has not even been dev tested under the vnext codebase this looks to me to taint your qa line and thus promote a baseless merge from rel x or main directly to vnext dev to avoid that taint am i missing something friday august    am reply  quote  sign in to vote the idea behind my structure is that branch stability looks likestable  testable  under developmentif you follow the promotion model strictly then active development can only happen in a child branch dev or release x dev  its tested and stabilized in the middle branches nothing makes it into main without an official rubberstamp of quality whatever that might mean in your orgso in theory any code that is forward integrated from main is stable  inevitably there will be merge issues but if youve compartmentalized development into cohesive features to begin with then those should be minimal  meanwhile the process of driving a slightlydestabilized tree back to high quality doesnt hurt anyone developers working on new features are isolated until any merge issues are resolved in the staging branch while qa gets to do what qa does besti can see an argument for having a merge path directly from main to dev but you cant do that without opening the possibility of ris that bypass the qa stage  also you cant keep the existing workflow from devqamain unless you introduce a cycle somewhere into the graph which means at least one baseless merge friday august    am reply  quote  sign in to vote regardless my suggestion is hardly the only one  comb the scm literature im sure youll find a strategy that works  some articles that each compare several modelshttpwwwvancecomsteveperforcebranchingstrategieshtmlhttpcsdlcomputerorgpersagendlabstocjspresourcepathdlmagscotoccompmagscortocxmldoimc friday august    am reply  quote  sign

 pm reply  quote  sign in to vote hi richard thanks for your replies  the first one especially cleared up the confusion i had between folders and branches which was the root of my problems i have also been reading a whitepaper from seapine which gives a great explanation of branching models friday august    pm reply  quote  sign in to vote michael i didnt see your post while replying  i have not had an opportunity to read the book you recommend the problem which i suspect a lot of people may have is that i am primarily a dev but tasked with creating a strategy for tfs  so i dont have the time to read through a whole book on scm i did read brads post on cmcrossroads earlier and found it very informative  the whitepaper i referred to in my earlier post can be found at downloadsseapinecompubpapersscmbranchingmodelspdf i like the option presented in fig  of the pdf  i dont know how to or even i am allowed to reproduce the diagram here so my comments may be a bit confusing for those who are not looking at the paper  one question i have at this point is whether to create a new codeline for dev with every new vxy eg  release and then follow the same aproach as in the diagram or to just have one dev line for all versions but with different production candidate ie qa branches created off of dev for each vxy release  i like the idea of creating a new branch for each release even if no work is done on that branch but just for the visibility ie not having to search by label etc to get at a particular release i was wondering what the proscons of creating a new dev branch from the previous dev branch would be for each new vxy version our product is small to mid size just one team so not remote development etc  also we dont have multiple products going on simultaneously that need to branch off from dev pretty broad questions i know but your opinion could get me thinking on different lines i wish someone at ms would do a post on this subject with considerations for tfs i have seen a couple of msdn blogs but nothing that i have found to my liking i have seen a lot of people asking questions of this nature  friday august    pm reply  quote  sign in to vote gday i have enjoyed reading the discussion but i think the aspect that was ignored is how easy it is to follow the branches structure and perform merges through gui as baseless merge is supported only through command line and baseline merge relations are not easily accessible through tfs the howtos of the process are largely left to documentation  that is the user must perform merge according to relation specified somewhere in documentation and using command line at that i am looking at the problem from somewhat different point of view there is pure scm implementation and there is tfs implementation given version  featureset  from my personal experience the users tend to start with largerthanlife approach letsbuildstateoftheartcmprocess and end up with lightened up version of initial process that is easy to perform and maintain therefore as the question asked was about easy merging i would discard baseless merge as a possibility and go for approach proposed by richard

which decision makers or company accountants can monitor business processes and generate financial reports their essential feature is an interactive financial dashboard with a general ledger for handling doubleentry bookkeeping common features to this class of software are a means of tracking company inventory and purchase orders sales tracking automated invoicing receipt capture via document or image processing timekeeping analytics for budgeting and revenue tracking financial reporting and accounts payableaccounts receivable functions these features are either contained intrinsically within the accounting software or managed via integration with thirdparty software that perform these functions in a modular fashion eg dedicated ar or ap software expense management software image

vendors offer specialized accounting software dedicated to handling the regulatory and reporting needs specific to some industries like construction or manufacturing either an allinone solution or a

managementindustryspecific versioninglegacy system data migrationexcerpts from trustradius buyers guide to accounting softwareaccounting software overview what is accounting software financial accounting is a methodology for recording and classifying a firms financial transactions including reporting and analysis of these transactions accounting transactions are encompassed by the general ledger which is a complete record of financial transactions over the life of a company the general ledger often referred to as “the books” contains balance sheet and income statement accounts balance sheet accounts are assets and liabilities and stockholders equity and these accounts show a companys position at a specific moment in time income statement accounts include operating revenues and expenses and show revenues expenses losses and net gain for a specified period of time such as a year or a quarter accounting software automates transactional record keeping processes in each of these areas so that accounting transactions can be completed and tracked more efficiently and more accurately as such accounting software is quintessential backoffice software concerned with record maintenance and regulatory compliance this is quite distinct from corporate finance which focuses on “front office” tasks like financial and strategic planning to maximize shareholder return but this broad definition of what accounting software does at the most basic level does not begin to describe the range of accounting software varieties on the market types of accounting software there are many different ways to segment the market but the following broad distinctions can be made regarding the main different types of accounting software accounting versus enterprise resource planning erp in the software realm the term “accounting” is sometimes used interchangeably with enterprise resource planning erp but these software categories are not synonymous erp platforms certainly include general ledger accounting functionality but they have evolved as fullyintegrated platforms encompassing a broad range of capabilities usually including human resources corporate performance management customer service supply chain management manufacturing production and logistics distribution and sometimes crm erp products have evolved over time away from a unique focus on backoffice processes and have swallowed entire software categories whole in pursuit of a singleplatform approach the focus of this guide is accounting products which necessarily includes erp suites but discussion of erp products will be largely confined to the general ledger accounting aspects of these broad platforms commercial versus fund accounting commercial firms use accounting systems to measure profit and loss performance by product division and company nonprofits have quite different accounting needs nonprofit fund accounting must track different funding sources and grants and allocate expenses across these funds additionally funds must be carefully separated according to donors restrictions nonprofits also need to understand the ratio of overhead to program expenses which is a unique requirement inhouse versus outsourced business process outsourcing or bpo accounting software can be used by firms to manage their own accounting processes or by specialized firms often public accountants working on behalf of clients in what is sometimes referred to as a “platformled bpo model” accounting firms using software products to serve multiple clients have an additional set of requirements which are not a concern for standard users such as a branded dashboard to share data with customers or a billing bypass mechanism allowing the vendor to invoice to the cpa firm instead of the enduser client onpremise versus cloud software traditionally accounting software products were installed locally on servers located in the firms location onpremises software and this kind of accounting software is still widely used today following the dominant trend in the broader software market though many newer products are offered as cloud products delivered over the internet and accessed with a web browser older onpremisebased installed products are sometimes offered in “hosted” deployments but this is not the same thing “cloud” is usually used to mean softwareasaservice saas where the vendor manages the software application and the entire hosting infrastructure on behalf of all customers the product is designed to be deployed in this onetomany model and customers access the product through a simple web browser an example of hosting is where a vendor offers a product that is usually installed on the customers premises over the internet by hosting the software for a single client on a remote server which is accessed via a client such as the citrix client or a browser this onetoone model is not usually what is meant by when people talk about cloud software accounting software features the primary general ledger features of most accounting tools include accounts payable and accounts receivable which includes automation and tracking of payment to vendors and suppliers and on the receivable side automation of invoices and collections cash management which provides a complete picture of a companys cash flows and streamlines payment processing bank reconciliation connecting the software to a companys financial institutions in order to reconcile accounting records with checking savings and credit card accounts often month and year closing capabilities are included expense management for logging and tracking business expenses and reimbursements including travelrelated expenses with the ability to tie them to particular projects time tracking enabling tracking of billable and nonbillable employee time by project calculation and collection of sales tax for transactions fixed asset management including location checkout maintenance scheduling audit history cost and depreciation support for transactions across multiple locations or branches and foreign currencies regulations compliance whereby the software helps users adhere to typical accounting standards and regulations such as ifrs gasb or gaap security features like rolebased user permissions and singlesign on capability reporting analytics including standardized reports like profit and loss sales tax return depreciation foreign exchange gains and losses etc as well as customizable dashboards in addition to these fundamental features some accounting and especially erp products also handle inventory management or the ability to track and manage the flow of goods or materials into and out of an inventory order management which covers the ability to process orders and track them from quote to cash payroll management which handles employee salaries including payroll taxes like income tax withholding social security and federal unemployment tax accounting software trends  increasing dominance of cloud software perhaps the biggest business technology story of the past ten years has been the rapid ascent of the cloud deployment model to a position of unquestioned dominance in the business software sector in general this is also one of the most significant areas of discussion in the accounting software realm today accounting and financial applications have been slower to switch to a cloud delivery model than some other sectors partly because of client concerns around change management and potential client impact in addition to security worries indeed many companies are still using onpremise software like quickbooks desktop accountedge and sage  formerly peachtree all of which are fully featured and well established products however a wave of change is starting to build from the low end as a number of cloud products designed for small businesses have emerged such as xero and wave as well as cloud products from quickbooks accountedge and sage similarly in the midmarket segment some cloud vendors most notably intacct and netsuite have emerged to threaten the ground occupied by legacy installed erp systems the erp world is still dominated by onpremise tools but this too is changing cloudbased or saas products these terms are often used interchangeably even though they are not synonyms have effectively won the day in other domains like crm which is now dominated by cloud pioneer salesforcecom the era of installed or onpremise software is coming to a close and in the accounting sphere as in others the future is cloud deployment the advantages of the cloud deployment model include no capex expense no outlay for infrastructure and software instead software is paid for monthly on a payasyougo plan access the software from anywhere users can access the software from anywhere they have an internet connection no upgrade or patch worries vendor updates the software and all customers are automatically on the latest version  integration strongly related to the cloud deployment model is the growing importance of programmatic integration with other systems historically accounting packages started life as simple general ledger tools for managing debits and credits over time though cfos began to see that having islands of general ledger functionality was of limited value and that integration with other financial capabilities was essential as a result vendors began to build broader accounting suites adding things like accounts payable and receivable payroll bill payment inventory management etc the cloud computing revolution transforming the accounting software sector has radically challenged this integrated suite approach paradigm it is no longer necessary to purchase a fully integrated suite that does all the things you need it to do the fact that products now reside in the cloud and do not need to be installed means that it is much easier to pick and choose discrete products to handle different parts of the financial value chain a financial accounting system can quite easily be hooked up to a bestofbreed payroll system or an expense management system its also relatively straightforward to integrate with an offtheshelf business intelligence tool to produce automated visualizations of key financial metrics like accounts receivable days debt to equity ratio roi and return on capital employed but integration is about more than just adding functional capabilities there is significant value in automating processes so that human beings are freed from the drudgery of simple data entry for example a newer generation of cloud products like wave and xero are capable of importing bank data directly eliminating the need for manual data entry automating clearing house transactions and data interchange further reduces manual coding the automation of all data entry by tight integration with these external systems allows cpas to concentrate on more strategic tasks while the technology handles the mechanical bookkeeping aspects  more choices for small businesses intuit has owned the small business accounting space for many years with quickbooks and still has about  market share quickbooks online which was released more than a decade ago but has struggled in the face of emerging competition from pureplay online vendors a sign of that competition is the fact that a completely modernized version of the quickbooks online product was released in  with a more intuitive interface design and separate apps for ipad and iphone new online products like freshbooks kashoo wave and xero have been designed for internet deployment and each has an elegant consumerlike design and an intuitive user interface these products are generally easier to use for novice users than any quickbooks product indeed many of their customers are former quickbooks users who have switched because they have found quickbooks too difficult to use these new tools are also inexpensive and one of the three—wave—is actually free its supported by advertising revenue however these products still command only a small portion of the market and are generally less fullyfeatured than the various flavors of quickbooks desktop the onpremise versions of quickbooks are still very popular with accountants and small businesses for exactly this reason but the landscape is definitely shifting and small businesses have more choice than ever before as evidence of this change brad smith ceo of intuit recently reported that “for intuits fye for the first time more new quickbooks users chose the online version than the a traditional desktop version contrast that with our income tax preparation products where that shift happened  or  years ago”  cloud solutions also transforming midmarket and enterprise a similar dynamic is playing out at the mid and highend where cloud pioneers like netsuite intacct and workday are challenging the hegemony of traditional industry behemoths like sap and oracle many of the onpremise erp heavyweights have made decades of investment in onpremise solutions only to see flat or declining sales while netsuite and intacct for example have been experiencing doubledigit growth for the last several years the response of the traditional onpremise vendors of course is to reposition their offerings and develop a coherent cloud strategy without abandoning their existing platforms sap has achieved some success with its cloudbased hana technology while oracle is struggling to upgrade onpremise customers to its cloud platform now called oracle erp cloud however as with quickbooks in the smallbusiness market these vendors do have a very dominant share of the market and the challenge from new cloud vendors is still nascent the three main cloud challengers have relatively low market share with very high growth rates they are however quite different one from another intacct is a small to upper midmarket product serving a range of customer types from technology startups to divisions of multinational corporations it is focused exclusively on finance applications with strong integrations to other business applications like salesforcecom the intacct marketplace showcases a rich ecosystem of thirdparty integrations some built by intacct itself and others built by vendor partners netsuite on the other hand is an integrated suite with a broad range of capabilities designed for larger customers netsuites main product includes a fully featured erp platform with financial management ecommerce order management and inventory control and a crm in addition to a professional services automation psa offering workday is a true large enterprise platform with an enviable growth rate of around  year over year  business process outsourcing bpo for small and medium firms is not a new phenomenon and is technologydriven in a model that might be referred to as “platformled bpo” this as the name implies is all about using technology to facilitate collaboration between firms and public accounting firms and implement industry best practices the use of technology to create lasting value through automation and best practices depends greatly on accounting software developments and for that reason has gone through its own evolution initially companies using onpremises products like quickbooks used outsourcing as a way of securing writeup or financial statement compilation services this cannot be considered true bpo but is a kind of precursor the next phase in the development of this model was accounting firms hosting desktop software on a server such that clients could log into the software using a citrix client but the real platformled bpo tsunami was made possible by the development of cloud software which enabled the accounting firm and clients to share the same software instance and to see precisely the same data in real time accounting firms frequently offer outsourcing or bpo services to companies who do not have the staff the skills or the desire to manage fa processes themselves or desire to focus on only their core business or who want to gain efficiencies and hence lower costs services offered span a spectrum from handling a few transactional services such as payroll accounts payable and receivable bookkeeping etc to offering more strategic services like tax management yield management or risk analysis specialization in vertical markets is also driving bpo adoption and accounting firms frequently specialize in a particular market niche specialization allows accounting firms to acquire detailed knowledge of the challenges faced by companies in their niche and provide customized dashboards and benchmarking data the cpa firm sometimes but not always dictates the accounting platform to be used and most cpa firms have expertise in a number of different cloud platforms to service clients of different types and sizes best practice for leading forms is standardize on a few platforms and then dictate the platform but some firms default to the product that the client firm is already using there are different models for cpas in public practice from referring clients to a particular vendor to running the software on behalf of a client to actually reselling the software many accounting products now have cpa versions which have been specifically designed to facilitate use of their products in this bpo model a typical scenario is the cpa firm setting up and running the software on behalf of clients and providing detailed views of the data via dashboards which allow for mutual decisionmaking the goal of outsourcing from the cfo or financial executive standpoint has always been the same removing some of the administrative cost overhead from a fairly rote set of operations the traditional meaning of bpo usually adopted by large companies with over  employees is the model whereby large service providers like accenture wipro and infosys essentially outsource accounting labor offshore to save money by wage differential arbitrage although still very widely implemented this model some analysts argue has not achieved the desired aim for the simple reason that a model based on cheap labor is unlikely to be sustainable over the long term in this model less attention is paid to things like process standardization and automation through technology that are likely to make a significant difference in short a cheap labor model alone is unlikely to lead to sustainable value creation the following diagram shows the distribution of accounting products across size of client organization with the traditional sweet spot for cpa outsourcing services factors to consider when selecting accounting software the following table summarizes the products featured in this guide and gives an indication of the size of organizations typically served whether they are onpremise or installed and whether they are an erp suite vs financials only this is a useful guide to orient product selection according to the most basic criteria there are also additional factors worth considering what addon capabilities does the product have beyond gl almost all accounting platforms have additional features beyond the core general ledger transactional accounting capabilities many including small businessoriented solutions have additional capabilities around things like payroll time tracking invoicing electronic billing and even business intelligence for analytics and reporting its important to understand which additional capabilities are built into the platform and whether they come at an additional cost erp platforms are not all the same the table above indicates products that are erp platforms rather than pure accounting products however erp can mean a lot of different things for example although intacct refers to itself as a “cloud erp” platform and does include inventory management and project accounting it is very focused on the accounting function and does not have the broad array of additional capabilities found in some other erp products netsuite on the other hand has a very complete erp product including supply chain procurement warehousing and fulfillment human capital management and more the core suite also includes customer relationship management crm professional services automation psa and ecommerce capabilities workday in addition to financials has its origin in a broad suite of hr tools integration  connectors given the resurgence of a bestofbreed model it is important to understand the ease of integration to specific rdparty systems instead of having to build connectors to target systems by using the api which will be beyond the expertise of many companies it is preferable if there are prebuilt connectors to systems customers need to leverage for example intacct has a connector to salesforcecom which can be set up with a few clicks and does not require it support or help from expensive consultants xero has a connector to adp run an hr platform specifically designed for small businesses netsuite too has connectors to other systems like salesforce oracle ebusiness suite sap erp and google apps it is important to understand which connectors exist whether they are thirdparty connectors or build in to the accounting application how well they function and which ones might be on the roadmap usability elegant design is not a characteristic normally associated with accounting software which historically has been functional but far from beautiful however some of the newer vendors in the small business sector have started to change that perception the general trend known as the consumerization of business software has improved software usability dramatically across many different domains as vendors strive to match the completely intuitive experience they have come to expect from products like the iphone accounting products too are starting to benefit from this phenomenon for example xero was designed with usability in mind from the very beginning and it looks much more like a consumer application than a business application intacct in the midmarket has also designed a clean intuitive product with more of a consumer lookandfeel welldesigned and even beautiful products are products that people love to use additionally intuitive workflows produce far fewer calls to support with the consequent loss in productivity that implies product design and usability can no longer be considered simply “nice to have” but are an inherently critical factor in successful product adoption and roi

easytouse tool that helps us keep track of each of our entities and run complete sets of financials for each one we also have some very complicated allocations we have to do for our leasing company this requires us to set up allocation accounts so each expense only has to be entered once and the system will do the allocations behind the scenes ive worked with several other gl packages including quickbooks and none of them had the ability to perform complicated allocationsprosfrx is a very simple third party report writer that makes report running so easy and straight forward but it can also use more advanced features such as reporting trees so multiple sets of financials can be chained togetherthe allocation accounts are a great feature of gp it makes the process of allocating salaries

total of the expense it would be nice if you could run a trial balance on the allocation accounts the same way you can with regular accountsive always thought security set up could be a bit simpler it

‘duinstalltxt’ file ‘failure encountered on  at  pm  error  product  does not support upgrading from version ’ we shall be highly obliged if someone assist in this regard regards irfan rasheed tags manufacturing reply all responses  only answers mahmoud m alsaadi works for dynamics innovations in amman jordan mahmoudmalsaadi linkedin google youtube blog website my badges suggested answer mahmoud m alsaadi responded on  jan   am just to make sure of one issue of the upgrade steps you should upgrade first to the latest gp  service pack then you can go directly to gp  utilities should be run initially before adding the module in order to handle stored procedures tables and database related issues then go for the manufacturing module your feedback is highly appreciated reply irfan rasheed works for avanceon limited in pakistan irasheed linkedin google my badges irfan rasheed responded on  jan   am thanks alsaadi for your reply we have upgraded to gp  after moving to latest service pack of gp  sp  initially we have no requirement of manufacturing module hence we do not include it but now we want to activate this module reply mahmoud m alsaadi works for dynamics innovations in amman jordan mahmoudmalsaadi linkedin google youtube blog website my badges mahmoud m alsaadi responded on  jan   am thats absolutely well understood although what i want to make sure of that you run the utilities before you add a new feature from the control panel once utilities is complete go for adding the module reply irfan rasheed works for avanceon limited in pakistan irasheed linkedin google my badges irfan rasheed responded on  jan   am yes after upgrading i follow these steps ran gp utilities message appears that ‘your microsoft dynamics gp’ system database is at the current version after clicking next i login to gp then i have added manufacturing module from control panel and then i ran gp utilities and having this message ‘failure encountered on  at  pm  error  product  does not support upgrading from version ’ no luck  reply irfan rasheed works for avanceon limited in pakistan irasheed linkedin google my badges irfan rasheed responded on  jan   am meanwhile i have tested another thing i have installed a module that was not added earlier but this module was listed in registered modules after running gp utilities this module become active on the other hand manufacturing was not registered earlier as we haven’t entered its registration keys does this cause any issue reply jonathan fear my badges verified answer jonathan fear responded on  jan   am since manf wasnt properly upgraded you will need to reinitialize it this will drop all tables for this module in this company so all data will be lost this issue is typically due to manufacturing objects not being correct since manufacturing is not being used we can simply reinstall the module with a few scripts make sure you have backups of your databases before you run these scripts delete dynamicsdbupgrade where prodid  and dbname  xxxx delete dynamicsdu where prodid   and companyid  xx delete dynamicsdu where prodid   and companyid  xx you can find the companyid by running the following script select cmpanyidcmpnynaminterid from dynamicssy last you need to run the following drop scripts against each company you need to reinstall the module for drop table bm drop table pk drop view expv drop view

answer irfan rasheed responded on  jan   am thanks a lot jonathan for detailed reply i have ran scripts and then add manf module it works reply seany seany responded on  nov   pm i am getting the same error message the only thing that shows up in the dbupgrade table is dynamics database i delete the record and i get error product  doesnt support upgrading there must be another table or view in the dynamics database i ran your scripts against all my companies do you know what other table or view might be in the dynamics db thanks reply amy wharmby my badges amy wharmby responded on  nov   am i am having the same issue  i ran the scripts but when i run gp utilities something is writing a record to dbupgrade for prodid  with a version   so then i receive an error  product  does not support upgrading from version   what is causing this  to write this record to dbupgrade table thanks reply susann susann responded on  jan   pm was a solution discovered for this  i was receiving the message at first for more than one product failure encountered on  at  am  error  product  does not support upgrading from version failure encountered on  at  am  error  product  does not support upgrading from version failure encountered on  at  am  error  product  does not support upgrading from version  i removed the records for those prodid fixed assets manufacturing human resources from

view expv drop view manufacturingorders gp utilities still returns the error but only for manufacturing and with version  failure encountered on  at  pm  error  product  does not support upgrading from version  the dbupgrade table once again has a record for prodid  how is gp utilities adding the record back to the dbupgrade table reply seany seany responded on  feb   am i fixed this but have been thinking really hard back to nov to figure out how but cant remember the only thing that comes to mind is to do what jonathan f said above in all dbs instances i will keep thinking i like to help you reply seany seany responded on  feb   am mine looks like above by the way i might have manually issued an update statement to set columns after the utilities there was one additional step in that is the step i am having hard time remembering   reply patrice bremondgrégoire works for bge inc in upland california patrice bremondgrégoire responded on  mar   pm i think ive figured it out in addition to all the steps above if your initial gp installation was  or earlier you need to do the following in the dynamics database drop procedure dbomsysdummyproc drop table syps it seems that dynamics utils takes the presence of both those objects as an indication that the manufacturing module was installed with gp i dont know about other modules patrice reply mohammed majid ahmed mohammed
