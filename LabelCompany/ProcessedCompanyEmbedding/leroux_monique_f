recteurmonsieur le doyenchers finissants chères finissantesdistingués invitésje tiens tout d’abord à exprimer ma reconnaissance au sénat de l’université d’ottawa et à l’école de gestion telfer je me sens privilégiée de recevoir un doctorat honorifique d’une grande université qui prône des valeurs qui me sont très chères entre autres celle de « contribuer à l’amélioration des collectivités en formant des citoyens du monde »je tiens d’ailleurs à souligner que l’université d’ottawa joue un rôle actif dans la mise en valeur de l’histoire des caisses populaires en ontario son centre de recherche en civilisation canadiennefrançaise conserve en effet les archives des caisses populaires de l’ontario son site internet fait même état du rôleclé qu’a joué alphonse desjardins le fondateur du mouvement desjardins dans la naissance du mouvement coopératif en ontario je tiens à vous témoigner madame la chancellière et monsieur le recteur toute notre appréciationla ville d’ottawa a d’ailleurs été très importante pour alphonse desjardins comme sténographe français de la chambre des communesil y a résidé six mois par année pendant  ansc’est aussi à la chambre des communes qu’ila pris conscience des ravages causés par les prêts usuraires c’est à la bibliothèque du parlement qu’il a mené ses recherches pour trouver un moyen d’y remédier et c’est ici que son projet de caisse populaire a pris formecet honneur qui m’est rendu aujourd’hui par l’université d’ottawaje veux donc le dédier à alphonse desjardins je souhaite aussi le partager avec l’ensemble des dirigeants du mouvement des caisses desjardins qui m’ont accordé le privilège de les représenter de même qu’avec mes collaborateurs et collaboratrices qui forment la grande équipe desjardins je salue d’ailleurs monsieur donat boulerice président de la fédération des caisses de l’ontario et membre du conseil du mouvement ainsi que nombreux dirigeants élus et directeurs généraux qui me font la grâce de leur présence ce matinjepartage enfin cet honneur avec ma famille et mes proches qui m’ont soutenue tout au long de mon parcours tout comme mes beauxparents qui ont fait leurs études à l’université d’ottawa je me réjouis d’en devenir à mon tour une fière diplôméecongratulations to fellow graduatesi am very proud to be a member of the telfer school of management class of   and i truly share the pride of my fellow graduates for reaching this important step in their livesi take this opportunity to congratulate you all  this is a wonderful day for you and for your parents friends and professors who encouraged and supported you throughout your studiesbravo à vous tousthis morning i would like to talk to you about cooperation which is about essentially personal commitment and solidarityyou are graduates of a business school that meets the standards of the most demanding international ranking organizations as such you acquired a highly valuable body of knowledge you can now use to carve out your niche in society a body of knowledge you can also use as future business leaders to help build a better worldin the financial tumult of the past few years the capitalist business model has showed some of its limits personally i believe there is a need for a plural economy one that offers complementary business models which counteract the excesses of one another in my opinion the best formula includes a market economy with companies governed by sound regulations a highly effective public sector and – i am sure you see where i am going – a strong cooperative sectorcooperation a valuable business modelas dean julien mentioned in my citation the united nations has declared  the “international year of cooperatives” and i would like to take this opportunity to talk to you about cooperativeson one hand i believe that − alongside with the corporate and public sectors –cooperatives offers great opportunities for business school graduates like you  both in terms of jobs and community involvementon the other hand we have not yet developed the full potential of this human inclusive innovative participative resilient and sustainable business model there again i believe cooperatives may offer an appealing avenue to many entrepreneurs and leaders among youthe cooperative differencecooperatives are “businesses” they are owned by their members not by shareholders  and while they are part of the business world and work within the market economy they cannot be sold without their members’ consent they focus on longterm growth and sustainable development not on shortterm profit and stock valuebut most importantly cooperatives are humanscale undertakings they remain close to their communities they are controlled by them they bring members into the decisionmaking process thus providing economic and democratic education in action they support local and regional economies and encourage people to get involved to help themselves and to help their communitiesles coopératives  un rôle majeur dans l’économiebien qu’elles soient souvent peu connues du public et peu suivies par la presse financière les coopératives jouent un rôle majeur dans l’économie mondiale elles comptent près d’un milliard de membres dans plus de  pays le chiffre d’affaires des  plus grosses coopératives au monde est de   milliards de dollars soit l’équivalent du pib canadienau canada il existe plus de   coopératives qui appartiennent à  millions de membres parmi les plus connues on retrouve le mouvement desjardins cooperators federated agropur mountain equipment gay lea foods et même des équipes de football professionneldans un contexte où les grandes tendances économiques et financières laissent de plus en plus de gens désabusés désarmés voire « déconnectés » le modèle coopératif fait partie des solutions dont nous devons tirer avantageles coopératives encouragent les personnes à participer et à agir avec les autres plutôt que d’attendre que la solution vienne de l’état elles permettent de « réengager » les personnes dans la société parce qu’elles s’appuient sur la notion de l’« aidetoi toimême » sur l’engagement personnel et sur la force de l’association les coopératives sont donc fondées sur l’exercice du leadership personnel et collectif elles permettent aux personnes de participer et de contribuer à leur entreprise collectivecommitment and selfhelpbased on my own experience i think that personal commitment and solidarity − which are the choices you make to play an active role in life rather than to remain passive − are also the most important ingredients of personal and collective successas you are about to embark in a new stage of your life i would like to give you one piece of advice get involved and commit yourself fully in whatever it is you are undertaking get engaged in your organizations and your communitiesle pouvoir et la volonté d’agirs’engager plutôt qu’être spectateur contribuer plutôt que critiquer c’est ce pouvoir et cette volonté d’agir qui sont à la source de toutes les grandes réalisations du mondec’est aussi ce pouvoir et cette volonté d’agir qui seront les clés de votre propre succès dans la vie quelle que soit la voie que vous choisirezje souhaite donc à chacun et chacune de vous d’être des hommes et des femmes engagés auprès de vos proches et de votre communauté des leaders engagés au sein des entreprises publiques privées ou coopératives que vous aurez créées ou pour lesquelles vous travaillerezone of the most important roles of a leader is building trust because trust is what lets us work together overcome challenges and beak new ground trust makes us seek out solidarity to thrive and prosper businesses and communities depend on the contribution of individuals driven by personal commitment and solidarityso i call on you to be the ones to go out and build that trustdans ce monde en transformation et en changement nous devons tous apporter notre contribution et exercer notre leadership même si c’est parfois difficile en pensant toujours au bien commun et en créant cette confiance essentiels au développement des personnes et de la sociétéà chacun et chacune de vous je souhaite donc d’avoir cette conviction intime et  inébranlable que nous pouvons tous un geste à la fois contribuer à bâtir un monde meilleurmerci encore à toute la
