corpcategory information  knowledge management  risk management at microsoft leveraging internal technology and expertise is the key to creating value edward teach cfo magazineoctober   greg maffei seems a little uncomfortable with all the attention hes been getting lately even though most of it is the kind that any cfo would be happy to have hes proud of his accomplishments as senior vice president and cfo of microsoft corp but he worries that his finance team wont get its due share of credit and he was already the subject of a recent cover story for this magazine smooth operator august so its understandable that hed rather spend less time with reporters and more time on the affairs of his company nevertheless attention must be paid thats because maffei is the winner of two awards in this years cfo excellence competition for informationknowledge management and risk management and though he received plenty of help from his colleagues in redmond washington the value of his leadership is clear some might think that maffeis victory in informationknowledge management is a little too pat microsoft after all is arguably the worlds leading vendor of information management software and it has a workforce of techies eager to use it but in fact the award was anything but a gimme putt like many other companies microsoft used to have financial systems that barely kept up with growth finance had trouble responding to new information needs  it required two weeks to close the books and like many a corporate luddite microsoft used to rely solely on hard copy reports distributing more than  a year if the software giant was more advanced when it came to risk management thanks in no small part to maffeis work in his previous job as treasurer it still faced stiff competition from the other finalists but in the end microsofts innovations in managing both financial and general business risk  including of course a sophisticated web based riskevaluation system  put the  yearold maffei on top characteristically maffei sees these results as a benchmark of collective progress finance was not viewed as a cutting edge place in the company five years ago he says we have tried to build a place that has intellectual challenge and competence based on the evidence presented here hes succeeded information management a digital nervous systemwhile it is hard to believe that microsoft wasnt always on the cutting edge in information management its easy to see why it needed to get there consistent annual growth of  percent­plus sent net revenues soaring from  million in  to nearly  billion in fiscal  and until a few years ago that stellar growth exposed glaring inefficiencies in financial reporting for example there wasnt a master chart of accounts for the companys financial groups now numbering  to work with at one point microsoft had more than  separate general ledgers around the world with inconsistent data definitions to bring order out of chaos microsoft starting under former cfo michael brown set out to build what it calls a financial digital nervous system fdns based on common policies and processes the fdns was intended to provide a coherent worldwide replacement for the companys disconnected systems it would deliver fast global access to information and financial reports and it would provide an infrastructure for knowledge management and collaboration in short microsoft wanted a worldclass information system says maffei who stresses the team effort in its developmentand in particular controller scott boggs whom he calls the driving force behind the system the fdns was built on three primary technologies an enterprise transaction processing system sap r data warehousing which extracts saps transactional data for analysis and a financial intranet which knits together the financial groups and allows employees to access both sap and the warehouse from their desktops the core of the system r was selected in  its financial modules were implemented in seven months along with a single chart of accounts at the same time microsoft upgraded its network bandwidth to accommodate sap data traffic today the system serves  named users and thanks to its integration with the intranet  total usersthat is microsofts entire workforcein  countries to consolidate the sap information and make it available for analysis microsoft created a financial data warehouse and reporting system dubbed mars management reporting system refreshed daily the warehouses database system is microsoft sql server its augmented by olap services microsofts online analytical processing engine microsoft excel provides a standard user interface with drill down capability a custom tool called ms reports enables deeper multidimensional analysis finally to share all this information microsoft created a financial intranet finweb in  detailed financial reports are now posted on finweb and updated daily in addition virtually every financial group has a site on the intranet from their desktops employees can visit finweb sites to submit expense reports purchase goods and services review pl and headcount reports and transfer capital assets having your dog food and eating it too today the worldclass information system produces worldclass benefits microsoft now closes its books on a worldwide basis in three days the ultimate goal is a continuous close financial reporting has become hugely efficient says maffei all management reporting in the company is now processed by just  employees including it staffers managers can make faster betterinformed decisions thanks to their ability to summon and parse relevant data in nearreal time expense reporting procurement and invoicing are now  percent paperless including reporting and approval capabilities maffei readily concedes that the development of the nervous system was aided by the fact that microsoft is microsoft it was driven by an intimate knowledge of and familiarity with microsoft tools thats a great foundation he says we have a willingness to eat our own dog food  to use the latest tools the latest features we have a group of people willing to accept the challenge of new technology risk management an enterprise approach new technology also lies at the heart of microsofts riskmanagement efforts but its far from the whole story in risk management as well as information management maffei and colleagues are spectacularly multitasking microsoft is a pioneer of the enterprise approach to risk management dating back to the creation of the microsoft risk management group in fiscal  under the direction of brown maffei assistant treasurer jean françois heitz now treasurer and then­risk manager scott lange the group conducted a thorough risk assessment of the entire company today the group watches no fewer than  separate risks from market share and pricing wars to industrial espionage and workforce skillsets one result of the assessment was an umbrella insurance policy crafted in fiscal  to cover a variety of risks but perhaps more important was the promotion of a heightened awareness of risk throughout the company microsoft wants managers in every function to understand the risk embodied in every decision they make and to help them do that the company developed a webbased knowledge tool in  called risks risk information system for knowledge sharing residing on the intranet risks has eight major components including a menu of risks organized by type contacts for internal experts on risk subjects anecdotes of lessons learned from dealing with risks and best practices for minimizing risk in the design of business processes before launching any new projects managers are encouraged to consult the system meanwhile to manage financial risk treasury has pioneered hedging techniques and improved on existing ones for example starting in  under treasurer maffei microsoft was one of the first companies to write put warrants on its own stock in order to reduce the cost and risk associated with its stockrepurchase program it was something i had to do at the timethe market was starting to heat up recalls maffei the company periodically repurchases its stock to prevent dilution of earnings per share through the exercise of employee stock options selling put warrants on its stock partially defrays the cost of the buybacks moreover the strike price of the puts is set at a level that the company would be willing to pay for its stock anyway the warrants also have a net share settle option that allows microsoft to issue new shares in lieu of cash so far no puts have been exercised against microsoft but premiums from the warrants have reduced the cost of the buyback program by  billion or more than  percent who buys the puts not investors betting on the direction of the stock we are selling volatility says maffei embarrassment of richesmaffei also pushed microsoft to take a systematic approach to foreignexchange hedging starting in  the company began matching the time horizons of hedges with the horizons of exposures treasury staffers run monte carlo simulations to determine probability distributions of future exchange rates the distributions are used to compare the effectiveness of different hedges with their costs the revamped hedging program consists of two parts the netrevenue hedging program which manages risk for month periods on a rolling basis has so far delivered more than  million in insurance payouts net of hedging costs and the cash flow hedging program which manages risk for shortterm foreign receivables has added another  million in profits theres no speculation afoot though the vast majority of programs are straight hedges says maffei i expect that they will continue to make money but we dont run hedging as a profit center the cash flow from microsofts hedging is a trickle compared with the returns on its portfolio which has ballooned to  billion in the form of fixedincome equity and foreignexchange holdings such a monster would have seriously strained the companys old treasury systems which were assembled on an ad hoc basis and poorly integrated treasury data wasnt centrally managed senior managers had difficulty appraising the market risks being assumed all of these weaknesses have been eliminated with a new integrated treasury system called gibraltar consisting of a transaction system an investment data warehouse and a risk analysis and reporting tool gibraltar enables treasury staffers to optimize performance of the portfolio heady stuff all this but maffei has the bandwidth  and of course the finance team   to handle it were blessed he says microsoft is the kind of place where theres a culture of hiring smart people it starts with bill gates we push to hire smart people and offer them financial incentives to do interesting work the rich get richer somehow it doesnt seem fair � cfo publishing corporation  all rights
