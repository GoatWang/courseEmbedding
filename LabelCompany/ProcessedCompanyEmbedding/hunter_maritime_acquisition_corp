underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised  these expenses are estimates only our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein for example we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination in the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations we may incur additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel in addition our staffing needs may vary and as a result we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence we do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses which fluctuations to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses would not be available for our expenses the amount in the table above does not include investment earnings available to us from the trust account after estimated nondeferred expenses of this offering and the private placement  or  if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full will be placed in a trust account in belgium at kbc bank maintained by continental stock transfer  trust company acting as trustee except for payment of taxes and investment earnings earned after taxes payable on the trust account to fund our working capital requirements the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination or our liquidation after payment or provision for our then current and estimated future liabilities all remaining proceeds held in the trust account including investment earnings earned after taxes payable on such income and after reservation for any taxes assessed against us by any governmental or taxing authority on the trust account will be available for use in consummating our initial business combination and for payment of the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions or will be released to public shareholders upon exercise of their conversion rights or to public shareholders entitled to receive liquidating distributions upon our liquidation after payment or provision for our then current and estimated future liabilities as the case may be we may not use all of the funds remaining in the trust account in connection with our initial business combination and related conversion rights either because the consideration for the initial business combination is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we finance a portion of the consideration with our equity or debt securities or other borrowings in that event the remaining proceeds held in the trust account will constitute working capital for our business after our initial business combination our sponsor has provided an unsecured loan in the amount of up to  to us to be used for the payment of certain of our offering expenses listed in the table above which will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the  of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses as of the date of this prospectus we have drawn down an aggregate of  under the promissory note with our sponsor this loan is unsecured and bears interest at a rate per annum of libor plus  we have allocated  of the net proceeds from this offering and proceeds from the sale of the private placement warrants to fund a portion of our working capital we intend to fund a portion of our working capital requirements from a portion of the investment earnings earned after taxes payable on the trust account under the terms of the investment management trust agreement investment earnings may be released to us in such amounts and at such intervals as we request subject to availability although we do not know the rate of interest to be earned on the trust account and are unable to predict an exact amount of time it will take to complete an initial business combination we believe that following the completion of this offering it will take some time to find a prospective target business and take all of the steps necessary to complete an initial business combination in order to fund working capital deficiencies if any or to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination we may be required to seek loans or additional investments from our executive officers directors or initial shareholders or from third parties however none of our executive officers directors or initial shareholders or any third party is under any obligation to advance funds to us or to invest in us in such circumstances our operating expenses prior to our initial business combination will include but not be limited to deposits or down payments for a proposed initial business combination legal accounting and other expenses including due diligence expenses and reimbursement of outofpocket expenses incurred in connection with the investigation structuring and negotiation of our initial business combination director and officer liability insurance premiums and reserves legal and accounting fees brokers’ retainer fees consulting fees and finder’s fees we expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed by some or all of our executive officers and directors and also that it may include engaging an accounting firm or other thirdparty consultants no compensation of any kind including finder’s and consulting fees will be paid to any of our executive officers or directors or corporate shareholder or any of our or their affiliates for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination including in connection with such due diligence activities other than compensation paid to our nonexecutive directors however our executive officers and directors will receive reimbursement for any outofpocket expenses such as travel expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on a suitable initial business combination and our sponsor or an affiliate thereof will be entitled to receive payments of an aggregate of  per month for office space secretarial support and administrative services we believe that based on rents and fees for similar services in antwerp belgium the fees charged by our sponsor or such affiliates thereof are at least as favorable as we could have obtained from unaffiliated third parties all payments made to our executive officers directors and initial shareholders and our or their affiliates other than the  per month payment described above must be reviewed and approved by the members of our audit committee or a majority of our disinterested directors while it is difficult to determine what the specific operating expenses of our business after consummation of our initial business combination may be we expect that they may include some or all of the following capital expenditures general ongoing expenses including overhead payroll and costs involved in expanding markets and in developing strategic acquisitions or alliances in addition we may use any remaining proceeds held in the trust account to satisfy any unpaid reimbursable outofpocket expenses incurred by our executive officers and directors as well as any unpaid finder’s fees or similar fees or compensation to the extent such expenses fees or compensation exceed the sum of the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account and proceeds properly withdrawable by us from the trust account in addition it is also possible that we could use a portion of the funds not in the trust account to pay finder’s fees consulting fees or other similar compensation or make a deposit or down payment or fund a “noshop” provision with respect to a particular proposed initial business combination in the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such payment or otherwise if the amount were large enough and we had already used up the other funds available to us we could be left with insufficient funds to continue searching for other potential target businesses or otherwise fund our business in such case if we were unable to secure additional financing we would most likely fail to consummate an initial business combination in the allotted time and be forced to liquidate we believe that amounts not held in the trust account as well as the investment earnings earned after taxes payable on the trust account that may be released to us will be sufficient to pay our costs prior to and in connection with our initial business combination as contemplated herein this belief is based on the fact that indepth due diligence will most likely be undertaken only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business combination however if our estimate of the costs of undertaking indepth due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the actual amount of such costs we may be required to raise additional capital the availability amount and cost of which is currently unascertainable and cannot be assured to the extent that such costs exceed the amounts not held in the trust account and the investment earnings earned after taxes payable on the trust account that may be released to us from the trust account such costs may not be reimbursed by us unless and until we consummate an initial business combination the role of our executive officers and directors after an initial business combination is uncertain and we have no current ability to determine what remuneration if any will be paid to our executive officers and directors after our initial business combination our executive officers and directors may as part of any such business combination negotiate the repayment of some or all of the costs incurred by them that have not been reimbursed by us prior to the initial business combination’s closing if the target business’ owners do not agree to such repayment this could cause our executive officers and directors to view such potential initial business combination unfavorably and result in a conflict of interest if we do not have sufficient funds available to cover our costs we may be required to seek additional financing from our executive officers our directors our initial shareholders or third parties we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all and no party including our executive officers our directors our initial shareholders or third parties is obligated to provide any additional financing to us if we fail to obtain the necessary additional financing we may be required to liquidate prior to consummating our initial business combination the net proceeds of this offering and the proceeds from the sale of the private placement warrants that are not immediately required for the purposes set forth above as well as deferred underwriting discounts and commissions will be held in the trust account and invested only in united states “government securities” within the meaning of section a of the investment company act having a maturity of  days or less or money market funds meeting certain conditions under rule a promulgated under the investment company act or securities issued by the united states so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act other than i the repayment of the loan from our sponsor or an affiliate thereof described above ii administrative fees relating to office space secretarial support and administrative services provided to us and iii the payment of compensation to our nonexecutive directors no compensation of any kind including finder’s and consulting fees will be paid to any of our executive officers directors or initial shareholders or any of their respective affiliates prior to or in connection with the initial business combination however our executive officers and directors may receive reimbursement for any outofpocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations a public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account including investment earnings earned on their pro rata portion of the funds in the trust account less up to  of investment earnings to pay dissolution expenses and which investment earnings shall be net of taxes payable and any amounts released to us to fund working capital requirements only in the event of our liquidation upon our failure to consummate our initial business combination meeting the criteria described herein within  months from the closing of this offering if we have executed a letter of intent agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business combination in no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business for our initial business combination we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours including public and private shipping companies other blank check companies private equity groups and other funds that invest in the shipping industry as well as other operating businesses seeking strategic acquisitions many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates moreover many of these competitors possess greater financial technical human and other resources than us our ability to acquire larger target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business furthermore our obligation to pay cash in connection with our public shareholders who exercise their redemption rights may reduce the resources available to us for our initial business combination and our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses either of these factors may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating an initial business combination company description we are a newly organized blank check company incorporated pursuant to the laws of the republic of the marshall islands and formed for the purpose of acquiring through a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition debt acquisition stock purchase reorganization or other similar business combination vessels vessel contracts including contracts for the purchase and charterin by us of vessels or one or more operating businesses which we intend to be in the international maritime shipping industry which we refer to throughout this prospectus as our initial business combination we have not identified any business combination target and we have not nor has anyone on our behalf initiated any substantive discussions directly or indirectly with any business combination target at or promptly following the completion of our initial business combination we will use our best efforts to transfer our corporate domicile from the marshall islands to belgium which requires our shareholders’ approval under belgian law and compliance with other applicable legal requirements we have agreed with our sponsor among other things not to complete the initial business combination if we are unable to obtain such shareholder approval subject to waiver by our sponsor in its sole discretion our sponsor and members of our management team have agreed to vote any common shares owned by them in favor of the transfer of our corporate domicile to belgium while we may pursue one or more acquisition opportunities in various sectors of the international maritime shipping industry or the shipping industry in the event that we find opportunities in one or more different sectors that are more compelling than other sectors including unrelated to the shipping industry we would pursue those opportunities we believe that our management team is well positioned to take advantage of opportunities in the shipping industry and that our contacts and sources within the shipping industry will allow us to generate attractive
