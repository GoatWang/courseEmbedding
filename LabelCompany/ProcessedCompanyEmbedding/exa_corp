recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which

although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and best of all by using these parameters investors have

the truck  it was a critical resorce for our supertruck team link to press release   exas simulation technology critical to achieving  fuel economy improvement for cummins peterbilt supertruck burlington mass march   globe newswire  exa® corporation nasdaqexa a global innovator of fluids simulation solutions for product engineering stated that cummins inc and peterbilt motors company the first companies to announce their supertruck for the department of energy doe supertruck program credited exas technology and engineering expertise as instrumental in the success of their recently announced vehicle exa worked with engineers from both cummins and peterbilt to perform aerodynamic and thermal simulations to achieve significant efficiency improvements throughout the tractor trailer and engine these simulations done long before a physical prototype was ever created helped this supertruck exceed the required  efficiency improvement and deliver a  more efficient truck — ahead of schedule the remarkable improvements were made possible through the collaboration of two worldclass companies they evaluated the entire truck from the underhood cooling requirements and engine housing to every part of the tractor and trailer it was not one aerodynamic or thermal simulation that made the difference stated david koeberlein cummins program lead for the supertruck program using exas simulations we were able to rapidly find and address areas of thermal and aerodynamic efficiency throughout the truck — it was a critical resource for our supertruck team the project started with cummins engineers digitally packaging their new energy efficient engine designed with a waste heat recovery system into the peterbilt tractor cad geometry they then added heat exchangers and simulated the thermal performance of the complete system exas technology was able to quickly demonstrate through simulation alone optimal cooling package design remarked jon dickson cummins engineering manager of advanced vehicle integration to package the new waste heat recovery condenser we had to redesign the vehicle heat exchanger system and use a nontraditional layout we were able to use exas powercool® and powertherm® to identify areas to improve thermal performance while maximizing aerodynamic efficiency — years before any vehicle was built at the same time landon sproull peterbilt chief engineer and rick mihelic peterbilt manager of vehicle performance and engineering analysis were evaluating their tractor and trailer combinations for aerodynamicthermal performance over the course of three years we ran hundreds of simulations to test and analyze every part of this truck using exa powerflow® stated mihelic we designed a complete new supertruck aerodynamic package which included visible devices such as trailer skirts and wheel well covers as well as unseen but critical underbody shields that optimize airflow and thermal efficiency sproull added using visualization of the simulation results our team analyzed each area looking for opportunities for improvement our designers and engineers could easily review and discuss results and optimization options — something simply not possible in a wind tunnel it was this comprehensive analysis that helped us to achieve our extreme efficiency savings that exceeded even the aggressive goals set by the doe each day our customers seek efficiency improvements using our aerodynamic thermal and acoustic solutions remarked stephen remondi exas president and ceo we have been working with peterbilt for many years and were pleased to

languagechinese simplifiedenglishjapanesekorean go super nav exacloud support automotive cooling fan noise industry needs a quite revolutionlowspeed rotating axial and radial fans are frequently used to manage engine temperature by ensuring adequate airflow through heat exchangers especially at low vehicle speeds or idle an undesirable side effect of these fans is generation of flowinduced noise which is an annoyance to the operators and passengers and a source of community noise especially for commercial vehicles and heavy equipment in most cases and particularly for high mass flow configurations the cooling fan is a major contributor to the overall noise and in some cases dominates relative to other sources such as engine transmission tire mechanical or exhaust contributions for heavy industry operator and community noise regulations are imposed by governments and a failure in the acoustic development of a product can lead to delays and expensive countermeasures to meet the requirements in addition cooling fan noise is a perceived quality issue that can affect brand image and customer satisfaction given the regulations and growing importance of acoustic comfort in these competitive markets there is high value in addressing cooling fan flowinduced noise problems as early as possible during product development technical challenges experimental assessment of fan acoustic performance is limited by the difficulties of physical testing and is typically performed in standalone test bench configurations  the results might not correlate well to the performance when integrated into a real system as this tends to substantially alter the flow and acoustic environment of the fan  with physical testing it is very difficult or impossible to identify the source of the noise using simulation has the potential to overcome these difficulties but must meet the challenges of accurately capturing the key physical mechanisms related to flowinduced noise from cooling fans noise generation is by definition a transient phenomenon and traditional cfd codes typically have difficulty accurately predicting transient effects in reasonable timeframes the complex interaction of rotating blades with nearby stationary geometry is a primary source of noise and the typical moving reference frame mrf technique fails to capture this effect tonal noise especially associated with the blade passing frequency can have significant dependence on the quality of the incoming flow rotor casing interactions existence of rotating stall conditions and unsteadiness of the flow field broadband noise which is usually related to vortex shedding flow detachments turbulent boundary layer noise and tip vortex noise installation effects which tend to influence the inlet flow conditions and the acoustic response of the system radiation of small amplitude pressure fluctuations acoustics outside the convective near field exa solution exa provides a complete computation aeroacoustics solution with powerflow and poweracoustics powerflow’s inherently transient solution accurately predicts the complex time dependent turbulent flow structures and the resulting noise sources induced by the cooling fan powerflow’s true rotating geometry capability provides time accurate simulation of rotation and captures all types of interactions more precisely than traditional mrf methods powerflow’s inherently compressible solution predicts the radiated noise simultaneously with the flow induced noise sources powerflow can handle fully detailed geometry and capture all the interactions between the fan and the surrounding components for applications requiring prediction of noise propagation to the far field community noise powerflow transient results can be coupled to the poweracoustics far field noise module which uses an acoustic analogy method based on the ffowcswilliams and hawkings equation easytouse analysis and stateoftheart d visualization capabilities with poweracoustics and powerviz provide insight into sources of noise bandfiltered pressure analyses can be used to isolate phenomena at specific frequency bands of interest for example to perform
