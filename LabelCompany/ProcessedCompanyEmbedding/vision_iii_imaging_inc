about us vision iii imaging team history contact us our partners blog v technologies technical papers critical alignment parallax scanning vd stereoscopic vision iii imaging inc the company specializes in advanced parallax visualization technologies for military and entertainment imaging markets v® imaging technologies have been developed for capturing and displaying threedimensional parallax depth information these technologies provide for the creation of v imagery that possess an enhanced sense of dimension sharpness and with greater texture and realism when presented on a standard unaided display the company has focused its rd efforts on an area of human perception that is unique and has been largely overlooked by the general imaging industry as a result the company has been able to develop and patent a series of fundamental proprietary parallax visualization technologies and tools when fully deployed the v products will provide users with a significant competitive advantage in the marketplace historically viewing threedimensional parallax visual information has required stereoscopic technology that is not compatible with normal display screens this is because stereoscopic systems require leftright visual information to be presented simultaneously or near instantly on separate channels to each eye stereoscopic imagery requires that left and right images be formatted for d monitors which require special glasses or special screens to view v has taken a different approach to threedimensional imaging by presenting parallax information over time in a manner that is compatible with standard unaided displays and media interestingly the original parallax scanning which was developed as a method for enhancing the texture and depth of standard twodimensional imagery is also applicable to stereoscopic d imaging vd when applied it has been shown to overcome one or more of the problems associated with traditional stereoscopic imaging methods vd provides the ability to capture nonhorizontal parallax and other subprocess threedimensional visual information in a manner that triggers a nonfatiguing perceptional response in the viewer it uses stereoscopic parallax scanning to simulate information captured by the eyes natural gaze saccade and head motions vd allows the combined stereoscopic display left and right views to present a variety of threedimensional information to the viewer in a manner that will create a unified realistic visual perception technology overview reference materials products hardware ax hd lens system ax digital

within the data is accurately visualized valuable and now obvious information the pursuer pv plugin makes difficult and obscure image data obvious hidden terrain features andor aerial obstructions
