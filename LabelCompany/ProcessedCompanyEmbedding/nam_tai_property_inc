handheld portable devices front light panels for handheld video game devices which we began manufacturing in january  technologies we utilize advanced technologies in the manufacturing of our products to satisfy the needs of our oem customers we stay abreast of advancements in technology upgrading the technologies used in production to maximize flexibility in product design increase quality levels and minimize production costs chip on film or cof is an assembly method for bonding integrated circuit chips and other components onto a flexible printed circuit this process allows for greater compression of the size of a product when assembled enabling the production and miniaturization of small form factor devices like cellular phones pdas digital cameras and notebook pcs as of december   we had  cof machines these machines connect the bump of large scale integrated or lsi driver onto fpc pattern with anisotropic conductive film or acf these cof machines have the ability to pitch fine to  micrometers and a total production capacity of up to  chips per month chip on glass or cog is a process that connects integrated circuits directly to lcd panels without the need for wire bonding we apply this technology to produce advanced lcd modules for highend electronic products such as cellular phones and pdas as of december   we had  cog lines in our principal manufacturing facilities these machines provide an lcd of dimension of up to  millimeters length x  width x  height a process time of five seconds per chip a pin pitch fine to  micrometers and a total production capacity of up to  chips per month during  our subsidiary jetup also started manufacturing cog lcd modules as of december   jetup had nine cog lines and is capable of bonding  million units of cog lcd modules a month they are able to bond lcd panels up to sizes of  millimeters x  millimeters x  millimeters thick with an accuracy of five microns’ tolerance in a cycle time of  seconds per piece chip on board or cob is a technology that utilizes wire bonding to connect largescale integrated circuits directly to printed circuit boards as of december   we had  cob aluminum bonding machines which provide a high speed chip bonding time of  second per  millimeters wire a bond pad fine to  micrometers and a total production capacity of up to   wiresboard per month we use cob aluminum bonding in the assembly of consumer products such as digital pen calculators electronic dictionaries and audio products we also had three cob gold ball bonding machines which provide a high speed chip bonding time of  second per  millimeters wire a bond pad fine to  micrometers and a total production capacity of up to   wiresboard per month we use cob gold ball bonding in the cmos camera module which use in usb camera notebook computer mobile phone and digital pen outer lead bonding or olb is an advanced technology used to connect pcbs and largescale integrated circuits with a large number of connectors we use this technology to manufacture complex miniaturized products such as highmemory pdas as of december   we had three olb machines the machines include multipinned tape carrier packaged large scale integrated circuit or tcp lsic bonding which is up to  pins which also provide ultra thin assembly with module thickness to around one millimeter and high accuracy bonding with pin pitch to  micrometers the total production capacity is  units per month tape automated bonding with anisotropic conductive film or tab with acf is an advanced heat sealing technology that connects a liquid crystal display component with an integrated circuit in very small lcd modules such as those used in cellular phones and pagers as of december   we had  systems of tab with acf machines the machines provide process time of  to  seconds per component a pin pitch fine to  micrometers and a total production capacity of up to  components per month during  jetup also started manufacturing tab lcd

millimeters thick with an accuracy of  microns’ tolerance in a cycle time of  seconds per piece fine pitch heat seal technology or fphs technology allows us to connect lcd displays to pcbs produced by cob and outer lead bonding that enables very thin connections this method is highly specialized and is used in the production of finished products such as pdas as of december   we had eight machines utilizing fphs technology the machines provide a pin pitch fine to  micrometers and a total production capacity of up to  units per month surface mount technology or smt is a process by which electronic components are mounted directly on both sides of a printed circuit board increasing board capacity facilitating product miniaturization and enabling advanced automation of production we use smt for products such as electronic linguistic devices as of december   we had  smt productions lines the production time per chip ranges from  second per chip to  second per chip and high precision ranging from  millimeter to  millimeter the components size ranges from  millimeter length x  millimeter width to  millimeters length x  millimeters width ball grid array or bga ball pitch is  millimeter and ball diameter is  millimeter flip chip our smallest leadbump pitch is um and out smallest components spacing is  micrometers the total production capacity is over  billion resistor capacitor chips per month supertwisted nematic lcds or stn displays is a type of monochrome passive matrix lcd capable of providing higher information content display systems and are typically found in applications such as cordless phones mobile phones mp players pocket games and pdas our jetup began producing stn lcds in  during  jetup upgraded its two existing twisted nematic or tn type lcd lines to stn lcd lines tn displays rotate the director of the liquid crystal by ° but stn lcd displays employ up to a ° rotation this extra rotation gives the crystal a much steeper voltagebrightness response curve and also widens the agnle at which the display can be viewed before losing much contrast as of december   jetup was using three automated stn lines capable of producing both tn and stn type lcds with capacity of  pairs of glass each sheet of glass of  millimeters x  millimeters size panels per month lcd backend is a main manufacturing process for lcd panels and is regarded as part of the process for its finished product lcd modules it includes the precise pure water cleaning process scribing of lcd glass liquid crystal insertion sealing process and breaking process then turns the lcd mother glass into lcd panels our machines can cope with  millimeters   millimeters lcd mother glass up to dimension  millimeters x  millimeters with cutting tolerance  millimeters nam tai
