higher oil and gas prices may want to give this royalty trust a closer look business model sabine royalty trust was established on december   its business model is based on income received from its royalty and mineral interests in various oil and gas properties sabine is a smallcap stock with a market capitalization of  million its oil and gas producing properties are located in florida louisiana mississippi new mexico oklahoma and texas the trust has had a long and successful history when the trust was formed in  reserves were estimated at  million barrels of oil and  billion cubic feet of gas at inception the lifespan of the trust was pegged at  years the trust was expected to be fully depleted by   years later sabine royalty trust is still kicking in that time the trust has produced more than  million barrels of oil and over a billion cubic feet of gas sabine has paid out approximately  billion in distributions to unitholder over the course of the past  years the most recent forecasts are for remaining reserves of  million barrels of oil and  billion cubic feet of gas if these projections are accurate the trust would have a remaining lifespan of roughly  years the trust does not have a specified end date but it would terminate if revenue from the royalty properties falls below  million per year in any consecutive twoyear period  was a rough year for sabine distributableincomeperunit declined by  from  to  source  annual report page  the spike in oil and gas prices took sabine’s distributableincomeperunit to  in  which allowed the trust to distribute  per unit that year however royalty income and distributions have steadily fallen since the trust’s  distributable income marked a fiveyear low the good news is that sabine at least generated positive distributable income even in  this resilience allowed it to continue making distributions albeit at a much lower rate not surprisingly the major culprit for the declines is lower oil and gas prices sabine had an average realized oil price of  per barrel for  down from  in  in addition oil production fell by  in  to  barrels reflecting natural field declines in addition gas production decreased by  in  and average realized gas prices fell from  in  to  in  growth prospects the biggest growth catalyst for sabine is rising oil and gas prices supportive commodity prices are critical for the trust’s ability to generate higher royalty income which yield higher distribution payouts since bottoming out in early  at  per barrel oil prices have recovered to nearly  per barrel in the us as a result conditions improved considerably for sabine in the first quarter royalty income rose by  million a  increase compared with the ﬁrst quarter of  growth was due primarily to higher oil and gas prices which accounted for  million of the growth in royalty income last quarter in addition higher production added  million of royalty income growth this growth more than offset a  million increase in operating expenses and taxes for the quarter the results from the first quarter underscores how much royalty trusts like sabine benefit from higher commodity prices sabine’s average realized gas price increased to  per thousand cubic feet last quarter up from  in the same quarter last year meanwhile the trust’s average oil price spiked  in the first quarter from the first quarter of  oil and gas production rose  and  respectively last quarter if oil and gas prices head higher still sabine’s distributions could grow in  and beyond dividend analysis sabine royalty trust pays a monthly distribution the record date each month is usually the th day distributions are paid no later than  business days after the monthly record date sabine’s dividend fluctuates depending on the direction of oil and gas prices when times are good the trust has distributed  per unit however distributions dried up last year as falling commodity prices took their toll sabine’s distribution history over the past seven years is as follows  distributions of  per unit  distributions of  per unit  distributions of  per unit  distributions of  per unit  distributions of  per unit  distributions of  per unit  distributions of  per unit sabine distributed approximately  per unit to investors in  based on its recent unit price this represents a yield of  if oil prices were ever to get back to  per barrel there could be considerable dividend growth potential of course this is a big ‘if’ rising oil and gas production particularly by shale drillers in the us coupled with sluggish global demand growth could keep a lid on oil prices for the foreseeable future the opposite scenario could also be true—if oil prices collapsed back to their  low sabine’s dividends could continue to fall the good news is the commodity price recovery over the past year has led to higher distributions from the trust final thoughts royalty trusts like sabine are essentially a bet on commodity prices from an operational standpoint the fundamentals of the trust look strong sabine has highquality oil and gas properties that have kept the trust going for  years which was much longer than originally expected if oil and gas prices increase the assets of the trust could potentially be undervalued and distributions could grow from  levels if commodity prices cooperate that said investors should carefully
