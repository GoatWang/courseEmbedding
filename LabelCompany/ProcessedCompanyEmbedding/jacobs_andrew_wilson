and teachers  reformedish reformedish incompletely reformed thoughts on god ministry and life standard posted by derek rishmawy posted on november   posted under uncategorized comments  comments answering jacobs’ questions on false teaching and teachers i think this is the standard blog image for false teaching posts no watchblogger should be without it what follows is a reply to the alwaysthoughtful alan jacobs who replied to andrew wilson who replied at tgc to his followup to a post by steve holmes after ets go ahead and read those before proceeding jacobs says andrew has avoided the most important questions he raised about how we adjudicate disputes about sex ethics in the church jacobs then lists five rather lengthy ones andrew has responded a bit on twitter but since i’ve gotten too big for my britches lately i figured i’d give it a bit of a go myself first though i’ll answer as proposed but i want to offer a resituation or two at the end that i think matter so do please stick around  q  a on protestant problems jacobs  how do we distinguish between error in interpreting scripture which we are all guilty of and “false teaching” carefully but seriously this basically goes back to the very old issue of establishing what deviations in teaching count as heresy as well as the importance of dogmatic rank first tier second tier etc as a concept in theology at that point the question is sifting how nested a particular teaching is within the broader fabric of christian theology and what implications it has for our basic gospel confession it’s not an easy one but presumably the same process that is used for sifting through disputed matters in christology can likely apply here as well it takes deep study of scripture discernment listening to the church through history prayer and patience because this teaching hasn’t been challenged for nearly  years of church history we maybe haven’t had to explicitly draw all the lines between these doctrines but the process is not new by a long shot  jacobs  how do we distinguish between error in interpreting scripture and sin presumably not all errors are the product of sin though some are again carefully the problem is that the question is so fuzzy your error in interpreting scripture might be a result of a willful desire to avoid what scripture says–a somewhat conscious suppression of the truth a la romans –or it might be much softer your sin may lie much farther back layered over with broader plausibility structures family dynamics and personal histories that have levels of guilt within them but are not directly leading you to twist the truth unraveling that mess takes more insight into the human heart than most of us have now i do think there are smaller midlevel “nonsinful” errors but the question i wonder about for jacobs is whether we are ever culpable for our “goodfaith” beliefs so we might through a series of unfortunate educational events come to believe the bible teaches polytheism and we believe this “honestly” and in “good faith” this is an “error” in interpretation all the same this belief is materially gross idolatry and sin despite the fact that you arrived at it in conscious honesty the belief itself is what is objectionable and culpable beyond the processes by which you arrived at it and the earnestness with which you pursued the question  it takes care then but it seems that sort of judgment can and must be made at points   jacobs  how do we distinguish between the accountability of those who promote erroneous interpretations and the accountability of those who believe those interpretations the argument that those who affirm samesex unions are “leading people onto the highway to hell” implies that god will damn people for being badly catechized that’s an implication that requires some scrutiny as andrew pointed out online james  has some things to say about this i would also think the pastoral epistles    timothy titus etc which lay out the qualifications for elders and teachers in the church do as well applied more broadly theses might be expanded to include theology professors as “doctors” of the church the distinction between teachers and others matters and i’m glad jacobs raised it there is a great deal of difference between those who are confused in the pews and those doing the confusing but honestly i don’t think this is as complicated as jacobs seems to imply by raising it as an issue andrew has just brushed past presumably andrew has a functional theology of teachers and eldership that’s in play  beyond that jacobs raises the point that andrew’s position might suggest that someone could end up damned because they were badly catechized i think jacobs has put the question badly and brought us back around again to the previous answer will people be held account because they were badly catechized or rather is it because of the grievous practices they engaged in in part because they were badly catechized yes scripture holds teachers to a higher account but it seems to hold everyone to some account god warns ezekiel that he will be accountable for the blood of anyone he does not warn but he never says that he will be accountable in the place of that person ezekiel  he will be accountable alongside them for the sin of not holding them accountable for the grievous sins he should have   now i do think lewis’ comment in mere christianity likely is on the mark god will judge us differently according to our time place upbringing sociohistorical context and so forth it’s plausible to think that for many in the pews and even some in the pulpits the intellectual conditions under which we live make certain errors more likely and less culpable than if they were made in other times and places but not entirely this brings us to andrew’s article listing out the various consequences for flagrant disobedience the point wasn’t simply to argue against “antinomianism” in general but rather to call attention to the fact that scripture connects the violation of specific commands with the threat of disqualification from the kingdom of god in a way that presumably doesn’t violate sola fide in which case holmes’ appeal to it doesn’t quite settle the matter it may be that there is a different level of culpability in god’s sight for certain violations according to time place and so forth but that’s not anything to bank on when we have very forceful very direct texts on the subject jacobs  while as andrew points out there are many passages in scripture that emphasize the importance of correcting erroneous teaching and calling out sinful behavior under what circumstances may we say that someone who teaches error or who commits certain sins habitually is not a christian at all and that we must say so if we do believe that we can and should make this judgment how then do we interpret the parable of the wheat and the weeds this question is a good one but again i’m somewhat puzzled by it simply because it’s just the question “how should we practice church discipline” under a different form it seems relevant to point out that the same jesus who told the parable of the wheat and the weeds matt  is also the one who gave us instructions for how to deal with a sinful brother in the context of the church and gave the disciples the power to bind and loose matt  he also empowered his apostles to give some instruction on the matter  cor  etc i personally have found calvin’s warnings against ecclesial perfectionism or libertinism to strike a pastoral and eschatologicallyrealistic balance see the institutes book  chapters     of course these are prudential judgments on the basis of scripture to be made with fear and trembling what’s more they’re best made in an ecclesial setting and thankfully most ecclesiastical traditions with ethicists ecclesiologists canon lawyers etc seem to have a lot of material on the books in that respect  jacobs  presumably those who denounce interpreters who affirm samesex unions as false teachers who are leading people on the highway to hell would readily acknowledge that they themselves are sinners — but redeemed sinners people not on the broad path that leads to destruction but on the narrow way that leads to salvation how do they distinguish between their sins and those they are denouncing why does jesus’s contrast between the speck in your brother’s eye and the long in your own not apply to them i think jacobs muddies things a bit with a general appeal to “we’re all sinners” moving to “what makes your sin different from theirs” there may be all sorts of things two seem particularly relevant the first is that those doing the denouncing may be sinners in all sorts of ways arrogant angry boastful etc and yet not actually be teaching anybody to do such things at least not explicitly they may be awful examples but given that the conversation is about false teaching there is a relevant difference between being a glutton and an arian and so with respect to the charge of false teaching that their sin is not a species of teaching true or false seems important the second and main answer to this question–and i do wonder somewhat at its status as a question and not a rhetorical jab–is whether those sins are being repented of or not that’s probably the biggest and major difference between them hopefully the teachers who are doing the “denouncing” are not falling afoul of paul’s warning in romans  against hypocritical condemnation  in the context of teaching that means that if someone comes to them and corrects them on a point of doctrine and interpretation where they are wrong then they will repent turn from this teaching and teach something else so if they find out about a speck or a log hopefully they’re plucking it out–even if it feels like taking an eye–in order that they might not lead any of christ’s little ones astray of course that doesn’t settle the question entirely because we’re still left with the issue of “who says” but this is where i have to admit i’m just a bit puzzled over all the questions in general for taken together they are essentially the question of protestantism scripture and ecclesial authority they’re real questions mind you and if you don’t mind here’s a shameless plug for my advisor’s new book on just that issue but they’re not new by a long shot i have a suspicion it’s mainly the pastoral difficulty of the presenting issue sexual practice that makes it seem very different and tempts us to pose them that way warning brothers who teach falsely against becoming false teachers now i have been talking as if i am very strong and rigid and clear on all of this in practice i’m not really i have friends and acquaintances that i love talking to and engaging who believe all sorts of things i disagree with–heresies false teaching variances of opinions etc i’m not very interested in running around and labeling them heretics cutting them off or wagging my finger at them i like getting along and i haven’t found that waving a big stick is all that effective in conversation anyways though a good scrap from time to time…  i too am skittish about drawing a straight line between someone teaching something false and calling them a “false teacher” in an absolute sense–as if that is the determinative judgment upon them for now and into eternity i’m reminded of the fact that abraham kuyper was once a resurrectiondenying heretic in school and that gives me pause it also gives me hope to patiently pray argue and engage with people i have profound disagreements with on serious issues  that said my question for jacobs is whether it’s possible for us to look our friends in the eye the ones we honestly believe love jesus deeply and say “look i’m not calling you a false teacher but what you are teaching is false–dangerously so and if you persist if continue down this course instructing others in this way you will indeed be a false teacher and that is a heavy thing for which god will hold you eventually accountable this is not simply an ‘agree to disagree’ issue” incidentally that’s part of what was at issue in ets having a panel that intentionally or not functionally treated the issue of samesex relationships as if it was in that category i think we have to be able to say something like this warning to our friends who are teachers or we ignore the weight of the warnings against false teaching in scripture one text i have been thinking of is romans  not verses  but verse  which follows the broader vice list condemning the gentiles not only for practicing all the vices listed but precisely because they “give approval to those who practice them” it is against such things that paul says the wrath of god is being revealed  or again i think of galatians  a text which jacobs rightly raises in his first post he uses the example of paul confronting peter as an example of lovingly confronting someone in deep error not walking in conformity with the gospel but yet confronting him as a brother i want to say that’s a good word and an excellent example but what i wonder about is what would have happened had peter persisted in that error and enabled the judaizers to mislead the sheep what if peter continued to refuse fellowship with the gentiles even if only for fear of the judaizers and not even agreement do we not think paul would have eventually looked at him and said “you are falling under the anathema of god for denying the gospel and giving place to those who do” gal  those are the questions i’d be curious to see jacobs answer indeed they’re the questions all of us with teaching voices in the church will eventually have to answer soli deo gloria share thistwitteremailprintfacebookreddittumblrpinterestlike thislike loading related  thoughts on “answering jacobs’ questions on false teaching and teachers” thanks for this article very helpful just a couple of things  – the link to andrew wilson’s tgc article just goes to the same blog post as the first link  – does jeremiah  add anything re  the prophets were lying about god’s truth and they would be punished but so would the people who believed the lies it’s not a straight line between the two issues granted but it might have something to say re culpability of those who believe what false teachers say particularly when the need to repent for something is being denied reply thanks fixed the link and yes i think that’s a very pertinent text thanks for commenting reply link to aw still doesn’t work hi derek thank you for this article it was helpful i do have a question for you though you mention at the end of the article that jacobs’ example of galatians  is excellent i am wondering how applicable that example really is in his original article jacobs recognizes that paul opposes peter because his conduct and the conduct of those who imitated him “was not in step with the truth of the gospel” however elsewhere jacobs seems to strongly imply again and again that peter’s error was in his actual theology suggesting peter held and taught the same things as the circumcision party perhaps i am misinterpreting jacobs’ comments but that seems to be implied if that is the case then his example is as you say an excellent one however paul’s challenge to peter seems to be that peter was acting hypocritically not that peter believed and taught the wrong theology before the men from james came peter was eating with the gentiles which seems to reflect a sound doctrine he then changed his behavior not because he changed his beliefs but because he feared the circumcision party therefore his sin was not believing and teaching the wrong things but acting out of fear in a way that contradicted the gospel he believed and proclaimed isn’t this somewhat different than the men and women who are teaching a false sexual ethic their problem is not hypocrisy like peter’s but it is actual false teaching perhaps i am reading jacobs incorrectly or perhaps i am misunderstanding galatians  if my understanding is correct however it does not seem that peter’s example corresponds very well to the false teaching on sexual ethics paul’s response to the circumcision party would seem more applicable than paul’s response to peter although i am not suggesting that that would be an applicable example in every case either your thoughts would be helpful reply “… look our friends in the eye the ones we honestly believe love jesus deeply and say “look i’m not calling you a false teacher but what you are teaching is false–dangerously so and if you persist if continue down this course instructing others in this way you will indeed be a false teacher and that is a heavy thing for which god will hold you eventually accountable this is not simply an ‘agree to disagree’ issue” hi derek great great post thanks for writing it with regards to the quoted excerpt above have you ever said anything like that to a friend of yours if you have how was it received did they repent did they double down ignore you if your warnings aren’t heeded is there a next step separate from
