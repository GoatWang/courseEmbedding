continue reading the main story mr rascoff  is the chief executive of zillow an online real estate database and marketplace with headquarters in seattlebefore helping to start the company in  and rising to the helm in  mr rascoff was involved in the travel industry he was a founder of hotwire an online travel company that was sold to expedia in  he also was an investment banker with goldman sachsinterview conducted and condensed by vivian marinoq what brings you to new yorka primarily streeteasy when we acquired streeteasy about a year ago it was a relative newcomer to mobile — contrast that with zillow which has about threequarters of our usage on mobile and so over the last year we’ve been taking the zillow playbook to streeteasy and expanding its product development resources against mobile the first thing we did was make the service free previously it was  per month then we redesigned the website we relaunched it on the mobile web we launched an iphone app and we launched an android app and an ipad app for streeteasyq zillow has been quite busy the past year or so both with the acquisition of streeteasy and trulia advertisement continue reading the main story a we haveq how exactly did the trulia deal an allstock transaction announced in august come about continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story a our two companies have known one another respected and competed against one another for many years and we’ve had several merger conversations in the past none of which amounted to much until this past summer when we approached the trulia executives and the board of directors yet againq what’s the status of the deala it’s now in the regulatory approval processwe have had a lot of conversations with the federal trade commission which is evaluating the proposed transaction i’m confident that the deal will close late this year or early next and that it will meet the necessary regulatory approvals they decide whether to litigate in court if they want to stop the transactionwhat they’re evaluating is whether real estate agents have enough alternatives when it comes to advertising themselves and their listings our perspective is that real estate agents spend about  billion a year on advertising and they spend about  percent of that on zillow and about  percent on trulia so they have ample choice when evaluating where to spend their ad budgetsq is that zillow’s biggest revenue sourcea our biggest revenue source comes from selling advertising to real estate agents specifically we sell zipcodetargeted advertisingq after the acquisition is complete what will be the role of peter flint trulia’s ceo and a founder a when we close we’ll announce what the new organizational structure will be it’s expected that pete will run trulia which will be a separate brand within the zillow family of real estate brands we will definitely keep the name trulia and the website and the suite of mobile apps under the trulia brand so we will operate a multibrand portfolio of real estate media assets photo spencer rascoff credit earl wilsonthe new york times q will there be any cutbacks once the deal is donea we haven’t announced whether there will be any reductions in the employee count we’ll have more clear organizational announcements once we close advertisement continue reading the main story we have  employees i’m not including trulia’s  peopleq there’s a lot of overlap between the two businesses newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify youre not a robot by

phasezillow focuses on that market segment — people deep in the transaction — as well as earlierstage home shoppers for example zillow would appeal to a homeowner trying to keep track of the value of their home and look at their “zestimate” and perhaps plan a remodel or refinance their mortgage trulia would focus on the transactionwe were attracted to the size of the trulia audience and the strength of its brand trulia has over  million monthly unique users and a very wellknown and wellliked brandq how big is zillow’s audience nowa zillow has about  million unique visitors a month most of which are on mobile about  percent of our usage is on mobile and we have over  homes that are viewed every second on a mobile device on zillowthree years ago when we went public it was about  homes that were viewed every second on mobile real estate is the ultimate mobile shopping experience it’s when you’re untethered when you’re driving around or walking around a neighborhood that you most want access to real estate informationq how important is the new york market to zillow’s overall businessa it is the largest real estate market in the country therefore it’s critical for zillow to win in new york and we acquired streeteasy with that goal in mindi grew up in new york my mom was a real estate agentq you have a pretty extensive résumé for such a young agea looks like i can’t keep a job huhq you founded the travel website hotwirecom and spent some time in that industry before switching to real estate did you see real estate as an industry that needed some help in a technological sense advertisement continue reading the main story a yes that’s right when we left the travel industry we started looking at other industries that hadn’t been impacted very much by the internet real estate is a huge industry it’s informationintensive and it begged for consumer empowermentq where would you like to see zillow in the next few yearsa zillow is about  years old and many technology companies start to lose a step in their second decade they cease to be innovative and entrepreneurial and so five or  years from now i hope i can say that zillow is every bit as innovative and entrepreneurial as it was in its first decade in terms of where that might take us who knowsq so how do i raise the “zestimate” of my house a the first thing you should do is claim your home on zillow which any owner can do and you should make sure that your home facts are accurately represented when we have accurate information about the home the zestimate becomes more accurate continue reading

the first time in the sp’s four years – and we suspect the industry’s longer history as well – someone not from the brokerage or national franchise real estate ranks is the most powerful person in residential real estate a brief glance at zillow’s nasdaq z third quarter  earnings report tells a staggering story revenues up  percent from the previous year to  million from  million  million monthly unique users an increase of  percent from a year ago the number of agents who spend more than  per month to advertise with zillow group increased  percent from the previous year perhaps most impressive of all zillow group posted a third quarter profit of million versus a loss of  million a year ago quieting the naysayers who snipe that zillow group has never made any money and is just burning through investor capital in  zillow group also settled the lawsuit with move inc and nar for  million and did not miss a beat its industry relations effort conducted while its top two industry representatives were under the burden of a lawsuit has borne fruit as just about every major mls franchise and brokerage in the country is now working with zillow and the firm bolstered its presence in the industry with the acquisition of bridge interactive group which provides retsrelated services to major mls and brokerage clients zillow group also introduced its brokerfocused advertising product premier broker which we think could be a gamechanger in improving its relationships with the brokerages who were often unhappy about its role in the increasingly online real estate industry the company just keeps marching on in  rascoff was in the third spot on the sp because of all of the challenges facing his firm the thenpending court case and the continuing integration challenges of trulia with zillow its class a shares had dropped to  per share and its market cap was down to  billion as of december  its stock was up to  per share and its market cap is  billion what a difference a year makes zillow group’s accomplishments under rascoff during the last year propels him to the no  position on the sp – he is the most powerful person in residential real estate today rascoff has been with the firm since inception he was one of its founding employees in  and became ceo in  when cofounder and executive chairman rich barton relinquished the role prior to zillow rascoff cofounded
