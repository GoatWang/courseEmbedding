post later wrote he rose to the pinnacle of the arkansas legal establishment at the white house he was unhappy with work in politics and spiraled into depression his death by gunshot was attributed by five official or governmental investigations to suicide but several conspiracy theories emerged contents  early life  arkansas lawyer  white house counsel  death  subsequent investigations  legacy  references  external links early lifeedit foster was born in hope arkansas to alice mae and vincent w foster his father became prosperous from real estate sales and development vincent had two sisters sheila and sharon he was a childhood neighbor and friend of bill clinton for four of the first five years of his life until clinton moved away as clinton later recalled i lived with my grandparents in a modest little house across from vince fosters nice big white brick house another childhood friend was mack mclarty who would one day become white house chief of staff for clinton foster excelled as a student and athlete at hope high school he became president of the student council with mclarty as vice president he graduated from there in  foster attended davidson college graduating with a bachelors degree in psychology in  his father wanted him to join the family real estate business but he instead chose law after starting at vanderbilt university law school he joined the arkansas national guard during the height of the vietnam war to avoid the military draft to be closer to his guard responsibilities he transferred to the university of arkansas school of law where he was managing editor of the law review and received his juris doctor in  graduating first in his class he scored the highest in his class on the arkansas bar exam foster met elizabeth braden known as lisa during his sophomore year at davidson she was the daughter of an insurance broker from nashville and was attending sweet briar college they married on april   at st henry catholic church in nashville they had three children vincent iii laura and john arkansas lawyeredit in  foster joined rose law firm in little rock arkansas and in  was made partner one of only nine in the firm at the time he was the head of the arkansas bar association committee that oversaw legal aid and as such worked with legal aid clinic worker hillary rodham in successfully overcoming an unreasonable measuring requirement for indigent clients foster then initiated the hiring of rodham at rose law firm where she became its first ever female associate and later first female partner foster and fellow partner webster hubbell were instrumental in overcoming the reluctance of other partners to hire a woman foster and rodham worked together on a number of cases rose law firm in little rock where foster worked for two decades foster practiced mostly corporate law eventually earning nearly  a year known for his extensive preparation of cases ahead of time including the creation of decision trees foster developed a reputation as one of the best trial litigators in arkansas hillary clintons memoirs call foster one of the best lawyers ive ever known and compared him in style and substance to gregory pecks portrayal of atticus finch in the classic  film to kill a mockingbird writer carl bernstein has described foster as tall with impeccable manners and a formal mien  elegant in perfectly tailored suits and softspoken to the point of taciturnity writer dan moldea characterized him as a cando lawyer who worked best when under pressure phillip carroll the leading litigator at rose law firm once said of foster he was my ideal of a young lawyer the aba journal reported that foster was acknowledged by many as the soul of the firm he appeared to experience only success at rose law a partner later said i never saw a professional setback never not even a tiny one the firm grew five times its size during his time there the arkansas bar association gave him a number of awards and in june  would name him as its outstanding lawyer of the year he was also listed in the best lawyers in america book his wife lisa described him as driven to prevail staying up around the clock to prepare for big cases believing he would lose the case even though he rarely did she later viewed this as an early sign of depressed behavior by  vince foster was as the washington post later wrote at the pinnacle of the arkansas legal establishment he was also an established figure in little rock society serving as the chair of the board of the arkansas repertory theatre and belonging to the exclusive country club of little rock white house counseledit after clintons  election foster joined clintons presidential transition team once clinton was inaugurated foster joined his white house staff as deputy white house counsel in early  this was despite fosters initial reluctance to leave his little rock life behind and come to washington there he worked under the white house counsel bernard w nussbaum although nussbaum would consider the pair to be cosenior partners he was also joined with two other rose law firm partners william h kennedy iii who served as his associate counsel and webster hubbell who became associate attorney general the foster residence was a small rented house in georgetown in washington dc foster had difficulty making the transition to life and politics in washington unlike some other clintonassociated figures he had had no experience with campaigns or politics at all his wife and youngest son were not with him having stayed behind in arkansas so the son could complete his senior year of high school at catholic high in little rock his initial role was in vetting potential administration appointees and in this he was one of the key figures in the transition as one subject of the vetting process later said i wondered why i was being interviewed by the guy who would be deputy counsel seemed his job was to find out how honest i was and what level of ego i was bringing its a measure of how much the clintons trusted him but foster found this involvement in vetting appointments to be causing him depression and anxiety in particular he blamed himself for the failed zoë baird nomination he had thought that baird had been justified in following her lawyers advice regarding the payment of taxes on household employees but he had failed to anticipate the political backlash that led to it becoming known as nannygate and that blemished the early days of the administration the equally unsuccessful kimba wood and lani guinier appointments were also under fosters purview he had to resign from the country club of little rock once its allwhite membership became a political issue for others in the administration as deputy counsel foster was also involved in a range of other matters including preparation of executive orders analyzing the legal effect of various policies examining international treaties discussing the ramifications of authorizations for use of military force and authorizing expenditures within the white house foster worked on placing the clintons financial holdings into a blind trust he handled the clintons madison guaranty and industrial development corporation paperwork and also several whitewaterrelated tax returns he worked twelvehour days six or seven days a week and although thin to begin with began losing weight on may   foster gave the commencement address at his university of arkansas law school alma mater and said the reputation you develop for intellectual and ethical integrity will be your greatest asset or your worst enemy you will be judged by your judgment  treat every pleading every brief every contract every letter every daily task as if your career will be judged on it there is no victory no advantage no fee no favor which is worth even a blemish on your reputation for intellect and integrity  dents to the reputation in the legal profession are irreparable one faculty member listening to it recalled telling another that it was the most depressing graduation speech i had ever heard in both content and manner a friend of fosters has said look its just crazy right you get one dent and it can never be fixed in washington you get them all the time you get twenty dents and you go to the body shop vince couldnt see that apparently four days after the speech the white house travel office controversy erupted foster was the target of several hostile wall street journal editorials in june and july  with titles such as who is vincent foster he became quite upset over the travel office matter and the possibility of a congressional hearing at which he might have been called to testify disliking the public spotlight and suffering from continued weight loss and insomnia he considered resigning his position but feared a personal humiliation upon returning to arkansas deathedit main article suicide of vince foster grave of vince foster at memory gardens cemetery in his boyhood home of hope struggling with depression which after his death was assessed as clinical depression foster was prescribed the antidepressant medication trazodone over the phone by his arkansas doctor starting with a low initial dosage the next day foster was found dead in fort marcy park a federal park in virginia an autopsy determined that he was shot in the mouth and no other wounds were found on his body a draft resignation letter was found torn into  pieces in his briefcase the letter contained a list of grievances including the wsj editors lie without consequence and saying i was not meant for the job or the spotlight of public life in washington here ruining people is considered sport his funeral mass was held at the cathedral of st andrew catholic church in little rock bill clinton gave a eulogy in which he recalled their boyhood times together and quoted a line from leon russells a song for you i love you in a place that has no space and time foster was buried in memory gardens cemetery in his hometown of hope foster was  years old and was survived by his wife and three children subsequent investigationsedit five official or governmental investigations into fosters death all concluded that he committed suicide  the first was by the united states park police in  in whose jurisdiction the original investigation fell because of fosters position in the white house the federal bureau of investigation assisted in the investigation as did several other state and federal agencies the result of this investigation was released as a joint report from the department of justice the fbi and the park police on august   and it stated the condition of the scene the medical examiners findings and the information gathered clearly indicate that mr foster committed suicide  investigations by a coroner and independent counsel robert b fiske in a page report released on june   also concluded that foster had committed suicide this report made use of fbi resources and incorporated the views of several experienced pathologists it concluded the overwhelming weight of the evidence compels the conclusion  that vincent foster committed suicide in fort marcy park on july    and  two investigations by the us congress found that foster committed suicide one was by representative william f clinger jr from pennsylvania the ranking republican on the house government reform and oversight committee who reached this conclusion in a finding published on august   the other was by the senate committee on banking housing and urban affairs wherein both the majority democratic and minority republican reports reached the same conclusion in reports issued on january   theories of a coverup persisted however some of which were promulgated by the arkansas project the speculation and conspiracy theories featured on talk radio and elsewhere caused pain to the foster family  after a threeyear investigation whitewater independent counsel ken starr released a report on october   also concluding that the death was a suicide in response sheila foster anthony vince fosters sister said she agreed with starrs findings but criticized his investigation for having taken so long thus contributing to the existence of ridiculous conspiracy theories proffered by those with a profit or political motive legacyedit fosters death occurring just six months into the new administration is thought by some to have ended the optimism and remaining innocence of the white house staff white house chief of staff and childhood friend mack mclarty said that it was a deep cut it clearly had a tremendous impact nussbaum speculated that if foster had lived he would have helped resist the calls to appoint independent counsels and the many investigations lumped under the whitewater umbrella that occupied the administration and clinton for the rest of his presidency might not have happened as it did happen how hillary clintons chief of staff maggie williams in particular handled fosters files and documents immediately after his death became an issue of much investigation itself years later bill clinton expressed his continued anger about the foster rumors

with the fbi records proving that the fbi fraudulently manufactured lisa fosters recognition of the gun found at fort marcy park refused to get involved opting instead for a story accusing sidney

events surrounding the death of vincent foster on july   six months to the day after bill clinton took office as president of the united states the white house deputy council vincent foster told his secretary deborah gorham ill be right back he then walked out of his office after offering his coworker linda tripp the leftover mms from his lunch tray that was the last time vincent foster was seen alive contrary to the white house spin vincent fosters connection to the clintons was primarily via hillary rather than bill vincent and hillary had been partners together at the rose law firm and allegations of an ongoing affair had persisted from the little rock days to the white house itself vincent foster had been struggling with the presidential blind trust normally a trivial matter the trust had been delayed for almost  months and the us trustees office was beginning to make noises about it foster was also the keeper of the files of the clintons arkansas dealings and had indicated in a written memo that whitewater is a can of worms that you should not open but vincents position at the white house did not sit well with him only days before following a public speech stressing the value of personal integrity he had confided in friends and family that he was thinking of resigning his position foster had even written an outline for his letter of resignation thought by this writer to have been used as the center portion of the fake suicide note foster had scheduled a private meeting with bill clinton for the very next day july   at which it appeared foster intended to resign vincent foster had spent the morning making busy work in his office and had been in attendance at the white house announcement of louis freeh as the new head of the fbi earlier in the day passing by the checkpoint manned by white house uniformed guard styles this is a key point the white house is the most secure private residence in the world equipped with a sophisticated entry control system and video surveillance system installed by the mitre corporation yet no record exists that vincent foster left the white house under his own power on july th  no video of him exiting the building exists no logbook entry shows he checked out of the white house several hours after he was last seen inside the white house vincent foster was found dead in fort marcy park in a virginia suburb just outside washington dc the death was ruled a suicide the first major washington suicide since secretary of defense james forrestal in  but almost immediately rumors began to circulate that the story of a suicide was just a coverup for something much worse the first witness to find the body insisted that there had been no gun near the body the memory in fosters pager had been erased critical evidence began to vanish many witnesses were harassed others were simply ignored there were even suggestions that the body had been moved and a secret service memo surfaced which reported that fosters body had been found in his car the official reports were selfcontradictory the looting of fosters office while the us park police a unit not equipped for a proper homicide investigation studied the body fosters office at the white house was being looted secret service agent henry o neill watched as hillary clintons chief of staff margaret williams carried boxes of papers out of vincent fosters office before the park police showed up to seal it amazing when you consider that the official identification of vincent fosters body by craig livingstone did not take place until pm speaking of craig livingstone another secret serviceman saw him remove items from vincent fosters office in violation of the official seal witnesses also saw bernard nussbaum in fosters office as well three witnesses noted that patsy thomason director of the white houses office of administration was desperate to find the combination to vincent fosters safe ms thomason finally opened the safe apparently with the help of a special mig technical team signed into the white house in the late hours two envelopes reported to be in the safe by fosters secretary deborah gorham addressed to janet reno and to william kennedy iii were never seen again when asked the next day regarding rumors of the safe opening mack mclarty told reporters fosters office did not even have a safe a claim immediately shot down by former occupants of that office the next day when the park police arrived for the official search of vincent fosters office they were shocked to learn that nussbaum thomason and williams had entered the office conflicts channeled through janet renos department of justice resulted in the park police merely sitting outside fosters office while bernard nussbaum continued his own search of fosters office during this search he opened and upended vincent fosters briefcase showing it to be empty three days later it would be claimed that this same briefcase was where the torn up suicide note was discovered the boxes of documents removed from fosters office by hillary clintons chief of staff margaret williams were taken to the private residence area of the white house eventually only  pages emerged one set of billing records under subpoena for two years and thought to have originated in fosters office turned up unexpectedly in the private quarters of the white house with hillarys fingerprints on them so who ordered the office looting bill clinton was unavailable being on camera with larry king but hillary clinton who had only the day before diverted her planned return to washington dc to little rock was on the phone from little rock to someone at the white house in the moments before the looting took place the initial reactions back in little rock fosters friends werent buying it doug buford friend and attorney stated something was badly askew fosters brotherinlaw a former congressman also did not accept that depression was what had been behind the suicide thats a bunch of crap and webster hubbell former clinton deputy attorney general phoned a mutual friend to say dont believe a word you hear it was not suicide it couldnt have been outside experts not connected the official investigation also had their doubts vincent j scalise a former nyc detective fred santucci a former forensic photographer for nyc and richard saferstein former head of the new jersey state crime lab formed a team and did an investigation of the vwf case for the western journalism center of fair oaks calif they arrived at several conclusions  homicide cannot and should not be ruled out  the position of the arms and legs of the corpse were drastically inconsistent with suicide  neither of vwfs hand was on the handgrip when it was fired this is also inconsistent with suicide the investigators noted that in their  years of combined experience they had never seen a weapon or gun positioned in a suicides hand in such an orderly fashion  vwfs body was probably in contact with one or more carpets prior to his death the team was amazed that the carpet in the trunk of vfs care had not been studied to see whether he had been carried to the park in the trunk of his own car  the force of the guns discharge probably knocked vfs glasses flying however it is inconceivable that they could have traveled  feet through foliage to the site where they were found ergo the scene probably was tampered with  the lack of blood and brain tissue at the site suggests vf was carried to the scene the peculiar tracking pattern of the blood on his right cheek also suggests that he was moved despite numerous official assurances that vincent foster really did commit suicide more and more americans over  at the last count no longer believe the official story tv specials most notably the one put out by aes inside investigations with bill kurtis have failed to answer the lingering questions indeed have engaged in deliberate fraud to try to dismiss the evidence that points to a coverup this website this web site is built primarily from official records newspaper reports and other hard data careful analysis of those records reveals a pattern of deliberate obfuscation surrounding vincent fosters death this pattern of obfuscation this coverup is a matter that should concern all americans not because of what it means for vincent foster but because of what it means for the rest of us one thing is for certain as we approach the fifth anniversary of this crime it is clear from the amount of resources being brought to bear by the government that there is something about this particular crime that has made those in power very afraid with the latest zogby poll revealing that the majority of americans no longer believe the official claim of suicide the perpetuation of the coverup must be to prevent an examination of the motive why was vincent foster murdered and his body dumped in fort marcy park new photo of vince fosters shirt after he was removed from fort marcy park proves foster had to have been shot where he was found one of the many false trails put out by government disinformation operatives was the claim that vince foster really did kill himself but did so someplace embarrassing and his body was moved to fort marcy park postmortem explaining away the many inconsistencies in the evidence of a suicide at fort marcy park itself contradicting that claim was the observation that while the body was rather bloodless as found suggesting that foster was already dead by other means when a gun was fired into his mouth to simulate a suicide once paramedics moved the body blood poured from the wounds staining fosters shirt the above photo is of vince fosters shirt after it had been removed from his body at the morgue as can clearly be seen the process of moving the body resulted in a great deal of blood flow from the head wounds this proves that the gunshot wound to the head although most likely postmortem was inflicted exactly where the body was found at fort marcy park the abc tv photograph wheres the blood on friday march   in response to rumors which were even then beginning to circulate regarding fosters death abc news broadcast the following photograph which had been leaked by the white house to reuters news agency the intent was to reinforce the claim that fosters death had indeed been a suicide the photo did not have the intended effect click for full size picture i was not a political activist at the time nor did i ever intend to become one my career is in feature film and tv visual effects which i have been doing for almost forty years i know about film fakery and the instant i saw the above photo on tv i turned to my wife and said to her half jokingly this is staged if i did work this sloppy i wouldnt be working but the more i thought about it the less funny it all seemed there are several troubling aspects in this photograph which reveal it to be a staged shot first and foremost among them the total lack of blood anywhere in the scene this lack of blood is the single strongest proof that vincent foster did not put the gun into his own mouth and pulls the trigger had he done so the blowback from the gunshot would have coated the gun hand and white sleeve of fosters shirt with a spray of blood and organic matter none appears in the photo anywhere the fbi lab report reveals that even with the most sensitive chemical test available no blood was found on the gun that foster we are told inserted into his mouth and fired not only that fosters fingerprints were not on the gun this is the crux of the suicide theory put forward by the government that vincent foster under stress on a hot july day put the barrel of a  revolver into his mouth and pulled the trigger and did not leave blood or fingerprints on that gun click here for the official documents the lack of blood was foster already dead when the headshot was fired one of the key pieces of information that argued against suicide was the lack of blood at the scene when the brain is destroyed the heart will continue to beat on its own for as long as it has oxygenated blood to feed it this is why head trauma victims provide most donor hearts the heart remains alive as long as blood is still in the body in the case of a gunshot into the mouth the bullet has to pass through the sinus cavities any child who has been in a schoolyard fight knows how easy it is for the nose to start bleeding and how hard it can be to stop had foster really shot himself in the mouth his heart would have continued to beat pumping most of his blood out through the shattered sinus cavities and the entrance wound in his mouth as well as out through the supposed exit wound but this did not happen witnesses at the scene reported a trickle of blood from the mouth and nose one of the tracks appeared to have flowed up hill actual video of a suicide by shooting in the mouth warning extremely graphic depiction not for kids as can be seen by the above video after a gunshot through the head the heart continues to pump blood out the mouth and nose the front of fosters clothing should have been soaked with blood as the heart continued to beat this did not happen this indicates that fosters heart was already stopped when the gunshot into the mouth was fired to mask the real cause of death references regarding how the heart behaves following traumatic brain death brain damage in heart surgery ethics in cardiac surgery life connection of ohio  brain death brain death  diagnosisclinical bibliography first aid book sudden death the fiske report robert fiske was the first independent council appointed to investigate the whitewater scandal for a variety of reasons including his past association with bcci a failed bank involved with the laundering of drug money fiske was considered by many unsuitable to investigate the various failed sl in the whitewater affair many of which also appear to have been involved with the laundering of drug money and fiske was eventually replaced by kenneth starr the preliminary report on vincent foster by robert fiske note that fiskes report was only preliminary his final report on vincent foster remains sealed when the wall street journal filed a freedom of information act request to force the release of fiskes final report the court in an unprecedented prior restraint ordered the wall street journal not to report on the case or to even mention what the final ruling actually was this illegal prior restraint is one of the indicators which reveals how terrified the government is of the facts behind the death of vincent foster the coverup unravels no sooner had the preliminary fiske report been issued than it met with immediate criticism even from the us house of representatives careful analysis of the report by private citizens typified by hugh sprunts citizens investigative report revealed dozens and dozens of obvious and clumsy contradictions yet another outstanding series of articles was written by dave martin called americas dreyfus affair americas dreyfus affair part  americas dreyfus affair part  americas dreyfus affair part  americas dreyfus affair part  americas dreyfus affair part  americas dreyfus affair part  the silver black gun among the most damning pieces of evidence to emerge from the official records was the deliberate and fraudulent manufacturing of the testimony of lisa foster in regards to the gun found with vincent fosters body vincent foster was found with a  revolver made by colt arms it was built from parts taken from two other guns and as a result had two serial numbers the frame number was  and according to the records of the colt arms company  the gun was manufactured with a standard dark blue almost black finish in the park police record the gun is described as black the accompanying photographs in the park police report show a black gun the photograph leaked by the white house to abctv also shows a dark gun compare the reflectivity of the gun to fosters gold ring on his finger just an inch away in all the statements by the fort marcy park witnesses in the park police reports in the reports by experts at the fbi and ballistics lab the gun is never described as anything but dark blue or more often black the photographs recently obtained in allan favishs foia lawsuit clearly show a dark surface to the gun no connection exists between that gun and vincent foster fosters fingerprints were not on the gun neither was any of his blood  the dna traces on the gun while not inconsistent with foster were more likely to have originated with a black or a hispanic than with a caucasian no gunpowder or bullet fragments were found in fosters wounds that could be matched to the gun despite this robert fiske inserted a comment on page  of his report on foster a statement that lisa foster thought the gun found with her husband was one she had brought up from little rock arkansas this statement came from an interview of lisa foster conducted by the fbi on may th  more than nine months after vincent fosters death in the handwritten notes and final fda report of the interview the interviewing fbi agents describe the gun being shown to lisa foster as silver colored not just once but many times the gun is never described as dark blue or black the fbi agents are not quoting lisa foster they write down their impressions of what is being said and done in their own words on the bottom of page  and the top of page  of the fda form lisa foster believes that the gun found at fort marcy park may be the silver gun which she brought up with her other belongings when she permanently moved to washington in order for lisa foster to believe that the gun presented to her as the fort marcy park gun might be the family silver gun the gun presented as the fort marcy park gun must also be silver lisa foster doesnt have to be a gun expert to know that silver is not black from the official record its clear that lisa foster was shown a gun she recognized as the gun she brought up from little rock but its equally clear that this is not the same gun as that found with vincent foster black is not silver click here to review the official records that prove the fbi manufactured lisa fosters testimony gun powder residue was found on fosters body although not in his mouth later testing showed the residue to be unique to winchester  ammunition as reported in the amended complaint filed by attorney john clarke on behalf of patrick knowlton patrick knowlton the credibility of the suicide claim took another hit when one of the witnesses at fort marcy park patrick knowlton came forward to claim that the fbi had altered his testimony patrick was then harassed and threatened which prompted the filing of a lawsuit for witness tampering perrypatterson the white house had come forward to claim that they were not notified of the discovery of vincent fosters body until quite late in the evening this was a critical item relating to when vincent fosters office was officially sealed for the investigation and as it later came out when it was being looted of records but two arkansas state troopers put the white houses official time of notification in doubt roger perry and larry patterson had both come forward to report a phone call made from the white house to the arkansas governors mansion approximately two hours earlier than the white house claimed it had learned of fosters death the clintons nanny helen dicky made the call during the whitewater hearings helen placed the call much later and to bring the issue to an end the committee members announced to all that the former troopers had changed their minds and would not testify to receiving the call any earlier than helen stated this of course was yet another lie perry and patterson were not former anything they were still arkansas state troopers who had wanted to testify but were kept out angered and with no other venue perry and patterson swore out affidavits stating the facts as they knew them linda tripp recently at the end of her appearance before the monica lewinsky grand jury linda tripp issued a public statement that hinted at the deceptions behind the death of vincent foster the suicide note at least partly a forgery no single item connected to the foster death has aroused as much controversy as the socalled suicide note this was a note allegedly written by vincent foster and discovered in his briefcase some days after his death the problem was that bernard nussbaum in controlling the park police search of fosters office had shown them that same briefcase empty just two days before coupled with that was the fact that the white house did not report the existence of the note for almost  hours after it was allegedly discovered adding another odd aspect to the note was the great pains taken to conceal it from the public even though the text itself had been published jim hamilton made a point during lisa fosters fbi interview to remind everyone that photos of the note were not to be allowed out even in response to a freedom of information act request hamilton went to far as to request in a letter page   page  to janet reno the return of the actual suicide note as soon as possible and thanks her again for refusing to allow photographs of the note to be allowed in public such secrecy surrounding a supposed suicide note aroused much curiosity which was finally satisfied when someone on the inside leaked a photocopy of the note to the wall street journal which published it the availability of the note prompted james davidson at strategic investment to commission three of the worlds top document examiners to examine the note in their report all three experts judged the note to be a forgery this hardly came as a surprise an even cursory examination reveals that at last two different hands worked on that note suggesting that fosters outline for a letter of resignation for that is what lisa foster thought the note had been was modified a botched attempt at a signature may have required the strange tearing of the note with the loss of onepiece right where the signature would go the note had fingerprints on it officially the origin of the prints remains undetermined but while testifying before the whitewater committee the fbi expert reported that one palm print was identified as belonging to bernard nussbaum the autopsy fosters magic bullet hole virtually the entire case for supposed suicide rests firmly on the autopsy done by dr james c beyer a pathologist for fairfax county virginia with strong ties to the fbi dr bayers autopsy report at first reading seems unremarkable its conclusion is that vincent foster died of a single gunshot wound entering the roof of the mouth and exiting the back of the skull but on closer examination problems become apparent dr beyers coworker at the fairfax county virginia medical examiners office is dr donald haut it was dr haut not dr beyer who actually examined vincent fosters body while it was still at fort marcy park assisted by john rolla on page two of dr hauts signed report the wound track is described as a gunshot wound mouth to neck this corroborates the eyewitness testimony of ems technician richard arthur who described the gunshot wound in some detail placing it under the right ear this is consistent with the news story reported by ambrose evenspritchard who described a photograph of that wound was there really an exit wound out the back of fosters head prior to the bodys delivery to beyer nobody reported a gunshot wound out the back of the head ems sergeant gonzalas stated he did not see a gunshot wound out the back of the head john rolla did not report a gunshot wound out the back of the head another ems technician cory ashford testified is a tape recorded interview with reporter chris ruddy that he was certain there was no exit wound at the back of the head while vincent foster was at fort marcy park outside of the obviously altered page one of dr hauts report there isnt a single official record of a gunshot wound exiting the back of fosters head while hes still at fort marcy park it is not until the body arrives at dr beyers morgue that the neck wound seen by arthur and haut seems to go away and the wound out the back of the head appears on the wound description page in the beyer autopsy the box for neck wounds has been left blank but the wound that beyer does describe is rather odd supposedly the wound is the result of a soft nosed unjacketed lead bullet being fired through two dense bones first at the base of the skull and then at the rear there should be metal fragments all over the wound track for a comparison take a look at the xray taken of john f kennedys skull following his assassination metal fragments are seen throughout the interior of the skull and this is from a full metal jacket round the type that limits fragmentation yet in describing the wound track in vincent fosters head beyer notes on page  of his report that no metallic fragments were recovered during the examination there should have been lead scrapings all over the bone perforations had a softnosed lead bullet really made them more recently a fbi telex was uncovered which reported that the autopsy conducted by the fairfax county medical examiner had found a bullet entry but no exit wound the missing xrays beyer himself checked and signed the boxes on his report indicating that xrays had been taken dr beyer told park police detective james g morrissette that the xrays showed no bullet fragments at all again with the type of ammunition in the gun found with fosters body this is impossible of course the xrays were not to be found beyer later claimed that they hadnt been taken and that his xray machine was broken although the service records on that machine do not bear out this claim the missing crime scene photos with the exception of a few polaroid photos that are currently the subject of allan favishs foia lawsuit no photographs of the crime scene exist the mm photographs taken by the park police were supposedly underexposed in the laboratory although starr investigator miquel rodriguez reportedly used an outside lab to successfully recover images from the film just prior to his conflict with mark touhey and subsequent resignation from the oic in addition to the mm photos many more of the polaroids of the crime scene simply vanished it turns out that beyer was the last person known to be in possession of the nowvanished crime scene polaroids rolla was unable to attend the autopsy of vincent foster because the autopsy was moved up  hours unexpectedly as rolla stated in his testimony normally you like to have at least one of the scene investigators at the autopsy to answer questions for the medical examiner dr james c beyer but he had the photographs and copies of the reports rolla testified that the photos were inside the case jacket when the jacket went to beyer after it had come back the photos were gone note also that whereas it is normal to have investigators present for the autopsy the last minute schedule change moving the foster up a day meant that beyer performed a significant part of the autopsy unobserved by the time park police observers saw the body beyer had removed fosters entire tongue and upper palette obliterating the mouth to neck gunshot wound dr haut had seen clearly something is very wrong with the autopsy and the preponderance of evidence points to beyer as author of the deception certainly he was well positioned to tamper with dr hauts original report altering the page  description beyers past history isnt the most reassuring indeed he seems to be the virginia version of the infamous dr fahmy malek the arkansas me who ignored clear evidence of homicide in the deaths of don henry and kevin ives and in one case ruled that a man who had been beheaded was dead of natural causes beyer himself in the case of tommy burkett ignored a broken jaw in order to rule that burkett had killed himself with a gun despite having shown the autopsy photos to burketts father beyer later claimed as he did with the foster xrays that they had never really existed after a second autopsy the case was reopened as a homicide likewise in  there was an autopsy on establishing the death of a man named tim easley mr beyer the coroner ruled that easley killed himself by stabbing himself in the chest he failed to notice a defensive wound on the mans hand the case was reopened and after an outside expert reviewed the case easleys girlfriend confessed to murdering him in short dr beyers consistent performance indeed his specialty appears to be the coverup of murder by declaration of suicide in the case of vincent foster the question must be asked if dr beyer given his past history changed a nonfatal neck wound seen by witnesses at fort marcy park into a fatal head shot needed for the suicide cover up the foster autopsy and proof that xrays were taken documented proof of a wound on fosters neck concealed by the official autopsy and the fbi memo that confirms there was no exit wound to the back of fosters head       the starr report long before the actual release of kenneth starrs report on vincent foster and despite an appearance of a sincere effort at investigation there were indications of an impending continuance of the coverup started by starrs predecessor robert fiske the bcci lawyer the first indication came with starrs handling of investigator miquel rodriquez conflicts with fellow investigator mark touhey rodriquez had uncovered what he thought was clear evidence of a coverup in the death of vincent foster in hindsight it would be almost impossible not to by way of example rodriguez had taken the mm negatives taken at the fort marcy park location which had been declared unusable and taken them to an outside image enhancement lab which succeeded in recovering images from the negatives under normal circumstances one would assume such a success at recovering data would meet with approval but such was not to be rodriguez came under severe criticism and opposition from fellow investigator mark touhey when rodriguez took the conflict to kenneth starr starr backed touhey and rodriguez was forced to resign his enhanced photographs of the crime scene have never been released further confirmation of starrs intentions came when the fbi records regarding the showing of a silver gun to lisa foster first surfaced hugh sprunt in one of his many meetings with investigators from kenneth starrs office informed them of this discovery starrs investigators echoing the claims being put out on the internet at the time assured hugh sprunt that the photo leaked by the white house to reuters was quite misleading with regard to the guns color and that it was reasonable to consider the gun to be of silver color as can be seen by the high quality photographs of the gun released as part of allan favishs freedom of information act lawsuit the gun is quite dark and not to be confused with a shiny silver gun with such an obvious pander to the official story coming from the lips of starrs own investigators it therefore came as no surprise that kenneth starrs report on vincent foster continued the claim of suicide but unlike the fiske report starrs report had something new it had an addendum this addendum had been submitted by the attorney for patrick knowlton john clarke and had been added to starrs report by the threejudge panel supervising his work over starrs strenuous objections the addendum so undermined the conclusions of starrs report that starr had it published in a second separate volume from his own report copies of the starr report were then distributed to the media without the second volume most americans to this day are not aware of the existence of the court ordered addendum to the starr report kenneth starr caught in a lie in his report on vincent foster kenneth starr attempted to resolve some of the lingering questions regarding the claim of suicide one such question involved the dark blued steel gun found with fosters body the gun that the fbi had fraudulently tried to link to vincent foster which did not have any of his fingerprints on it kenneth starr included in his report the comment that glove box of vincent fosters car contained an oven mitt dr henry lee had concluded that vincent foster had carried the dark blued steel revolver to fort marcy park inside the oven mitt and that this explained the lack of fingerprints of course there is a huge logic flaw in the claim star reports that the oven mitt was left in the car photographed inside the glove box by the park police the very next day foster would therefore have to have carried the dark blued steel revolver with him from the car without the protection of the oven mitt then placed it inside his mouth and pulled the trigger the presence of the oven mitt in the glove box therefore does not explain the lack of fingerprints on the dark blued steel revolver found next to fosters body while there may be legitimate reasons for an oven mitt to be in the glove box there is some question as to whether the oven mitt was really in fosters car as represented by kenneth starr starr states that the oven mitt was photographed by the park police in their impound lot the day after fosters body was found july st  and in the photographs from allan favishs foia lawsuit there are photographs showing an oven mitt quite prominently on display inside the glove box but there is a problem a photograph taken at fort marcy park the night of july th  clearly shows debris on the passenger side floor in the park police records detective braun emptied the glove box of all items prior to detective smith removing and cataloguing the debris from the passenger seat floor records show braun emptying the glove box prior to leaving the park police impound lot as  am july st detective smiths paperwork has him cleaning off the passenger side floor after noon on july st clearly a photograph showing the glove box with items in it over a clean passenger side floor is in direct contradiction to the park police record of the search of fosters car the photographs of the oven mitt appear to be afterthefact stagings at best complete frauds at worst when detective braun emptied the glove box from vincent fosters car her inventory did not record the presence of an oven mitt lisa foster its easy to simply dismiss lisa foster as the hapless victim of a tragedy and to as so many supporters of the suicide theory have argued declare her offlimits in any analysis of the events surrounding the death of her first husband however there are indications that lisa foster has had her own suspicions regarding just how her husband died when john rolla first arrived at the fosters dc home to inform lisa foster of the discovery of her husbands body at fort marcy park rolla noted an unusual event in his report what rolla saw fit to comment on was the strange reaction of lisa foster to rollas describing the gun found with her husbands body in which at the mention of the guns color lisa simply exits the room in a highly emotional state in lisa fosters fbi interview it was established that the only gun that was in the fosters washington dc residence was a chrome plated revolver it is apparent that lisa would have had to know that the black gun being described to her by rolla was not her husbands but rather than say anything about the discrepancy lisa foster simply terminated the discussion yet another indication of acquiescence if not complicity was found in lisa fosters new yorker interview basically a spin piece in which lisa foster talked about the stresses of the preceding two years but said nothing to challenge the suicide theory of her husbands death now at the time lisa foster did this interview she had to know deception existed in the case john rolla had told her that the gun found with her husbands body was black lisa knew that the black gun could not be the foster familys silver gun when shown a photograph of the dark blued steel gun she did not identify it but by the time this interview took place she had been through the fbi interview in which a silver gun was presented to her as the gun found with her husbands body lisa foster did not comment on the magically changed gun during the interview nor did she take the opportunity to mention the issue during her interview with the new yorker its important not to ascribe a sinister motive to lisa fosters actions a mother who has seen her children lose one parent and is reasonably concerned that they not lose another easily explains them shortly after the new yorker interview lisa foster married judge moody in arkansas shortly after that moodys son neil was killed in a highspeed traffic accident witnesses reported he was being pursued at the time of the crash the endless spin no sooner had questions surfaced regarding the circumstances of vincent fosters death than a crowd of people surged forth to assure america that vincent foster had indeed been depressed even though he had clearly concealed it from everyone around him leading the attack was cbs  minutes which had openly admitted biasing its handling of the gennifer flowers segment in  to help bill clinton win the nomination quit a far cry from the media handling of gary harts infidelities so when reporter chris ruddy started writing a series of article for the new york post regarding the inconsistencies in the vincent foster case  minutes again stepped again to bill clintons defense with a hit piece on ruddy the misreporting was so outrageous and error filled that accuracy in media and issued some highly critical reports as did congressman dan burton next came a segment of the ae program inside investigations with bill kurtis which attempted to explain the absence of fingerprints on the gun found with fosters body by showing how the deep grooves of a modern automatic pistol simply do not provide the surfaces needed to capture fingerprints that fosters body was not found with a modern automatic pistol with deep grooves and heavy texturing but with a smooth metal revolver was not mentioned the extreme lengths that mike wallace went to attack those who doubted the official suicide story resulted in the following cartoon chris ruddys cartoon writing books in support of the official lie has become a growth industry with blood sport and washington tragedy being prime examples in the book blood sport page  susan thomases describes a meeting in her room at a private boarding house in which vincent foster unburdened himself to her

actually black stewert tries to equivocate then simply yanks the plug on larry this transcript makes clear that stewert knows he is in error on the gun color and is refusing to acknowledge its implications ergo stewert and his book are purely propaganda misc collected articles articles from chris ruddy dave martin and selected journalists the public reaction with the mainstream media having abandoned its selfproclaimed role of watchdog against government abuse the public at large began to seek other less traditional venues to display their awareness an unknown party traced out the words foster murder at the base of the washington monument using garden fertilizer this prompted the following news story the washington monument event ny post  april   paranoid posse gus for brown by richard johnson last paragraph finally lest foster be forgotten our spy peering out a window atop the washington monument claims that the letters foster are eerily spelled out in the lawn looking toward the lincoln memorial presumably a prankster armed with a bag of fertilizer wanted all those unmindful tourists to wonder whose next hardly had the national park service removed the lettering and as the aroma wafted unnoticed across the capitol building the photographs of the fertilizer words appeared as an underground postcard distributed from one internet activist to the next the

press room buy dvds on shoppbs download on itunes teacher center faqs recent guides college inc obamas deal the vaccine war watchscheduletopicsabout frontlineshopteacher center vince foster committed suicide july   in the spring and early summer of that year travelgate erupted it was one of a series of problems and scandals foster was confronting  not only in his role as deputy white house counsel but  as in the case of whitewater  in his role as personal lawyer for the clintons it all took a toll on foster and his wife and friends sensed his gathering despair before clicking here for the notations from fosters journal the following brief background on travelgate is helpful in understanding the notations harry thomason a close friend of the clintons and thomasons partner darnell martens had helped the clinton campaign by providing charter air service after the election harry was everywhere in and around the white house working on improving the first couples image his most disastrous meddling came when his partner darnell told harry hed heard rumors that the white house travel office was corrupt and worse disloyal to the first family this happened in the time frame of the leaks about marital discord in the white house and everyone was ultra sensitive so harry began pressing hillary telling her that the travel office people were a bunch of crooks and that weve got to get our people in there hillary in turn pressed vince foster and david watkins who in her opinion were already failing her because of leaks the secret service etc quickly the whole messy and silly travelgate episode was in full swing the fbi was called in a young cousin of clintons appointed herself undercover agent in the travel office and started sneaking memos away in the dark of night harry thomason kept asking watkins what was being done hillary kept asking vince foster what was being done the fbi showed a disconcerting willingness to help find some evidence of wrongdoing though none of them had any solid basis for suspicion except for those rumors in the end seven staffers in the travel office were fired but the staffers had pals in the press who wrote their story and suddenly congress is talking about an investigation into the firing suddenly the white house its now mayjunejuly  is on the defensive trying to explain itself at a press conference george stephanoupolos says the fbi had evidence the travel office people were crooks  an assertion that the fbi disputes and then came the inevitable selfinquiry led by white house lawyer john podesta which was aimed at pointing the finger some place besides at hillary and her meddling friend harry thomason in the end david watkins and to a degree vince foster got the blame all of this made foster quite sick he was integrally involved in travelgate having been consulted by watkins because he was a white house lawyer hed overseen the investigation of the seven travel office employees though hed always been cautious about acting precipitously hed participated in meetings with the fbi and most importantly hed discussed the problem with hillary  who had impatiently asked him whats being done about those crooked disloyal travel office people over the course of several weeks foster in his careful lawyerly increasingly distressed fashion laid out his case in a private chronology he kept in a spiral notebook hed write down his memory of events consult his calendar add things here and there and then hed write it all down again over and over narrowing broadening editing  obsessing in other words he plainly feared embarrassment and public humiliation in a congressional hearing that he believed was coming through it all he was clearly motivated by his pointed intention to protect hrc  the client
