of a € we achieved the revenue growth of  and volume growth of  with a  growth in operating profit all on a comparable and currencyneutral basis given ccep was created in late may of last year these growth numbers represent the combined performance of each of our territories as if ccep had existed in the first quarter of  now as we look closer at our first quarter results our sparkling portfolio was flat with a  decline in our cocacola trademark brands cocacola zero sugar continued to perform extremely well with growth of  and we will continue to expand and build on this success throughout the summer and across our territories sparkling flavors which include energy grew  led by fanta with a growth of  during the quarter energy was up more than  as we continue to execute our multibrand strategy and we achieved solid gains from monster and benefited from distribution in spain which began in february of  our still brands portfolio grew  sports drinks grew  primarily through the aquarius brand and water grew  reflecting our focus on value and reflecting growth in aquabona chaudfontaine and vio during the quarter we also continued to make important progress towards our stated goal of € million to € million in synergies by  we remain very focused and diligent in working towards this goal as we enhance the effect of the suboperations  were very happy to continue to share best practices and work to improve our efficiency across all functions and territories allowing all of our markets and people to learn from each other as we continue to build and grow ccep each of these factors contributed to a solid first quarter results with a combination of volume and revenue per unit growth benefiting both revenue and obviously our operating profit we did see our gross margins decline during the quarter largely due to some oneoff factors which nik will discuss with you in a moment so given our results todate and our effort for the year weve affirmed our operating targets for the full year  however as always it is important to remember that the first quarter is our smallest and we firmly are aware that much work lies ahead of us as we move into our key summer selling season reaching our fullyear goals will continue to require spending execution at the field level and a continued focus on achieving our synergy objectives we are confident in our approach yet realistic about the months that lie ahead and the challenges we continue to face our results todate support our confidence that we have the initiative in place to achieve our fullyear goals for example we are committed to continue to make bold moves on package innovations with a focus on smaller convenience packaging including the new fanta twist bottle and the ml can for schweppes sparkling juice we continue to invest in our digital capabilities and we are improving our execution merchandizing and displays to ensure our products flow through our supply chain more efficiently and critically are presented to the consumer more effectively in all our outlets we also have a solid program of brand innovation expansion in conjunction with the cocacola company and our other partners this was highlighted by the cocacola zero sugar launch new monster flavors low and nocalorie products and initiatives such as vio which is proving very successful in our german business we also have excellent plans in place across our other categories in stills tea water with initiatives for aquarius expansion honest tea expansion and continued innovation with our caprisun brand and we will continue to build on the success weve seen with our smartwater proposition and as i mentioned earlier we are entering the critical and very important summer selling season we are excited about the new joint campaigns with the cocacola company like the evolution of the share a coke campaign which now focuses on dream holiday packs across all our business units this marketing is expected to reach more than  million consumers across europe fully supported by great interval  execution and partnership with our customers across ccep now as we work towards achieving our objectives for the rest of the year we firmly believe its important we maintain a sharp focus on three key areas first we must continue to execute every day at the highest levels we have great brands we support them with marketing programs and outstanding field execution all focused on driving value for our customers and satisfaction for our consumers our people who are the most talented in the business and are highly modeled to win every day have proven their ability to accomplish this secondly we must continue to deliver on our synergy objectives which includes as i stated earlier a pretax goal of € million to € million by mid were making good progress and importantly were realizing the benefits in our results and finally we must continue to work in and partnership with the cocacola company to deliver sustainable profitable growth our two companies have shared goals on the consistency of the marketplace we both want to create sustainable longterm growth through a focus on revenue and profit and were working diligently together to reach that vision now in closing before i hand over to nick let me share some key thoughts as i stated before we have a compelling business combination with the worlds best brands in categories that offers significant opportunities for profitable growth we continue to be realistic about the environment but we remain confident about our ability to capitalize in all these opportunities we have a talented experience leadership team and employees who with the excellent support of our board of directors are driven to achieve success we have a company that has important operating assets and advantages that are second to none across europe and create excellent opportunities for enhanced effectiveness importantly we are on track to deliver synergy objectives and achieve the full potential of our new company ccep we are committed to creating a workplace that is dedicated to the shared success of all our stakeholders this requires a diverse and inclusive culture that inspires the personal growth potential for each of more than our  employees it also requires and builds on our continued pledge to do this sustainably which remains a key part of our business proposition for our employees our customers our consumers and our communities and importantly ccep has a commitment to driving increasing levels of shareholder value building on a strong heritage and a track record of success this commitment was at the very heart of the decision to create this company and it remains a key focus of our work so thank you very much for your time ill now turn over the call to nik who will share us some more details on our financial results and i look forward to answering some of your questions after nik thank you manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc thank you damian and we appreciate each of you taking the time to be with us today i will now discuss the results of the quarter in a bit more detail as well as our outlook for the remainder of  looking at the quarter on a reported basis first quarter diluted earnings per share were € and on a comparable basis were € currency translation reduced earnings per share by about € revenue grew  on a comparable and currencyneutral basis this reflects the reported volume decrease of  and revenue per unit case growth of  this revenue per unit case growth was driven by several factors including favorable mix promotional timing and rate increases first quarter cost of sales per unit case increased  on a comparable and currencyneutral basis while there has been modest cost inflation this increase is magnified and largely driven by the accounting for bottles and crates in germany which was a onetime favorable adjustment in the same quarter last year while we expect some impact in our quarterly yearoveryear growth figures for cogs and opex versus onehalf  we do not expect any material impact to operating profit or full year growth figures importantly for the full year  we expect cost of sales per unit case to be at the higher end of our previous range and increase by approximately  on a comparable currencyneutral basis this slight increase is driven by yearoveryear cost increases in key inputs principally pet and cans and the impact of currency rates notably the gb pound to euro or partially offset by the benefits from our cost reduction programs while we did have some gross margin contraction in the first quarter this is largely related to the factors that i just discussed and we remain committed to maintaining and even expanding gross margins over time and expect to see modest gross margin improvements in  in the first quarter operating expenses were down  on a comparable and currencyneutral basis this reflects the impact of synergy benefits cycling last years increased costs associated with the supply chain disruptions in gb one fewer selling day in the quarter and the impact of the yearoveryear accounting differences and overall timing these factors contributed to operating profit growth of  on a comparable and currencyneutral basis additionally these results reflect solid overall performance and the benefit of synergies partially offset by the impact of one less selling day in the quarter during the quarter weve realized approximately € million in synergies excluding these synergies core operating profit growth was approximately  up and ahead of our revenue growth importantly lets now look at our outlook for  for the full year we continue to expect modest low singledigit revenue growth with high singledigit operating profit growth and diluted earnings per share growth as well for the full year the synergies delivered are expected to benefit cogs slightly more than opex excluding these synergies we expect core operating

continuing to drive shareowner value thanks for your time and now damian and i will be happy to take your questions operator questionandanswer session operator thank you your first question comes from the line of judy hong with goldman sachs judy e hong  goldman sachs  co thank you good morning or hi everyone manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc hello damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc hi judy judy e hong  goldman sachs  co so damian i guess i was hoping to get a little bit more color just in terms of the competitive environment the share performance in gb it looks like it was a good quarter but obviously youre lapping an easy compare there so just wanted to get a better sense of what youre seeing from an underlying perspective and the pricing environment as i think some of the uk grocers are obviously starting to see more inflation coming through damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc thanks judy yeah we have seen i think towards the end of  and into this year improving performance in gb obviously as we talked about before nielsen doesnt cover all of our business in gb but where it does track weve seen a recovery i think thats been on the back of a couple of initiatives that i mentioned during the call one gb was the first market where we launched zero sugar cocacola and that was the segment in which a lot of our share challenges had been in in the sugarfree cola segment so that was a good solid response to that opportunity and thats working well we also see our flavor business performing well in gb thats supporting our share as well so a number of the marketing initiatives that we brought in at the end of  have definitely help shore up and grow our share in  on your second point we have seen retailers obviously on their own discretion making moves around promo pricing and youll see a number of the offers which traditionally for example in their case a number of retailers would have promoted two  liters for £ we have seen throughout q a number of cases where that has now gone up for £ for two  liters so signification inflation in the promo price and that seems to be continuing into q so some inflationary moves on promo pricing not so much on the shelf price they remain pretty constant but as you know in gb a lot of the product and volumes sold on promotion so the promo price really is the biggest readthrough for inflation in value in gb so theyre the two factors that are in play and we would expect both of those to continue into q and into the summer judy e hong  goldman sachs  co okay thank you and nik if i can just followup on the gross margin performance and i know there was that the onetime impact but can you just sort of bridge the impacts from that onetime item how much the cost savings offset that and just a little bit more color on the bridge in gross margin thank you manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc yeah so judy if you look at the cost savings piece remember its roughly that  in terms of the split between cogs and opex so you have an indication of what impact that had on the first quarter if you actually exclude the onetime impact that had  up it essentially would say our gross margin was slightly down but i would say very slightly down but we would continue to see that normalizing over the course of the year and more importantly i think there will be some noise as i said as we just cycle through some of the first half of  but the full year is very much intact to have a slight growth margin improvement which obviously includes the benefits of synergies as well judy e hong  goldman sachs  co okay and the lower sugar prices at this point are you embedding any of that into your outlook on the commodity piece manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc most of our – are you referring to q  judy e hong  goldman sachs  co yeah manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc yeah i mean everything that we have guided to – remember the main areas that were open for us was essentially pet and we had some element of aluminum open and thats whats really driven now with at least in the aluminum and currency fully covered the sugar benefits that we had we also were benefiting in prior years because as the whole sugar regime was in the face of been dismantled we did get some favorable pricing in  as well but i think our cogs outlook today outside of again the one variable being pet i think were pretty comfortable with that judy e hong  goldman sachs  co got it thank you operator your next question comes from lauren lieberman with barclays lauren rae lieberman  barclays capital inc great thanks good morning or good afternoon damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc hello lauren rae lieberman  barclays capital inc hi if you could just talk a little bit again about price mix so i know nik you guys shared that it was all elements of what you would hope will be driving pricing mix but anything specific on price pack architecture versus product mix and portfolio mix that could help us understand some of the positive claim thanks damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc thanks lauren i mean we – as we stated on earlier calls and as we talked about coming out of  youre seeing a number of common initiatives in play across all of our markets firstly maybe ill just talk about headline pricing so we were able to meet our pricing plans as we moved into  so that obviously supports some of our revenue growth secondly we have been spending a lot of time on investing with our customers on driving pack mix benefits smaller packaging and looking at – actually building on some of the learnings out of the us from our learning trip there last year looking at diversifying particularly in growths here  around smaller packaging and taking some of the pressure off large multipack particularly pet and cans thats starting to play a role but i would caution that that is – thats quite a journey thats not something that gets transformed within a quarter for sure but its the right thing to do to build a more sustainable consumer franchise and adapt to a more choice thats helping we are seeing again from a mix perspective continued strength across our sparkling portfolio i called out fanta obviously cocacola zero sugar so that continues to support good margin so again each market has slightly different dynamics given where were coming from but those three factors of headline price package mix product mix are definitely contributing to the revenue figures that nik shared with you over a longer period of time we are very much focused and also channel mix and building our business and continue to leverage our strength outside of top end retail i think thats one of the strengths of this business we have got good businesses in – up and down the street in horeca clearly thats a mix benefit as well thats in our business going forward so the first three really are playing  the fourth one is something that were – we believe is a strategic advantage and well continue to cherish going forward thor or nik do you want to add anything manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc no i would just say just keep in mind obviously i think if you look at the first quarter remember the rate increases particularly in some of the larger markets will start coming through more going forward because depending on timing its either february or march type of an impact so we did had some good brand and pack mix that supported those numbers as well so its really is a good combination lauren rae lieberman  barclays capital inc okay thats great in germany i know its hard to disaggregate easter shift and so on but it did look like revenue in germany maybe is under a little bit of pressure this quarter is it just a slow start to the year or is there anything kind of more specific around that market damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc no no nothing specific i mean if you recall when we talked about our full year results in march we did call out that january was a bit of a slow start you can see that from the nielsen data particularly in germany so there was definitely a function of a slow start we were not as intensively active on promotions in q in germany two factors have played there one we were in discussions with our customers around some pricing moves and obviously there i suppose in those cases youre just not featured as much and then secondly easter is a huge holiday for us in germany as in all of our markets so the traditional promotional activity some of thats set into q so they were the two reasons at play for germany and certainly were happy where that business is at going forward for the rest of  lauren rae lieberman  barclays capital inc okay great thank you so much manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc and keep in mind lauren we did have both volume and valueshare growth in germany in the first quarter damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc yeah manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc and that reinforces damians point that were doing the right thing lauren rae lieberman  barclays capital inc yeah okay great operator your next question comes from bonnie herzog with wells fargo bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc hi everyone manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc hey bonnie damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc hey bonnie bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc i have a question on france with the election coming this weekend there is certainly a lot of uncertainty about the outcome but it seems kind of le pen is able to win frances withdrawal from euros is really a foregone conclusion which certainly has implications on the euro more broadly so im just curious if you guys could comment on how that may potentially impact your business maybe in the nearterm what ways if any youre preparing for that possibility and then perhaps broader longterm implications of the eurozone breakup damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc well thats a cnn question bonnie bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc i couldnt resist damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc well manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc its dangerous to ask damian that is what he is saying damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc no let me take the question i mean clearly we like im sure as you are and everybody else is watching intently with what decisions the french people will make over the weekend clearly if it wants to go the way that youve articulated which again i mean none of us are  so we can debate what the probability of left or right is weve factored in both eventualities so we thought about what happens clearly it would be still subject to a referendum so wed still have to go to the french people regardless of the margin of victory so we would wait and see i mean we clearly would like to see stability across all of our markets and obviously the political environment contributes to consumer confidence and stability so well watch with intense but again it would be remiss of me to really comment on what i think will happen i think youd know what we would like to happen but i think if we bring politics into these calls they may last two or three hours going forward so we have it in mind we are confident that our business there is performing well clearly coming into an election there is a degree of uncertainty but likewise as you come out of it then i think france will have a clear path forward over the coming years and i think that would be a good benefit for us going into the summer season so well watch as im sure you will with intent at the weekend manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc and we hope all the french continue to celebrate with lots of coke damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc yeah bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc good point and then if i may ask a broader question on the macro environment which i guess on the margin things seem to be improving so id like to get a sense from you guys if youre actually seeing this and if youre now more confident youll able to hit your low singledigit top line growth guidance for the year and then if you could maybe drill down a little bit on the markets that are improving you called out for instance improvements in local market conditions in iberia and then maybe touch on some markets that are still pressured thank you damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc well as weve said on the call weve reaffirmed our guidance for the full year so i think that reflects our confidence in achieving our revenue targets for the full year where were particularly happy about is as we look at our performance coming through the first quarter all of our markets have continued to performance well so – and as we stated there were reasons for a couple of them being slightly behind just in terms of absolute revenue growth but again we factored that into our fullyear guidance so i think were pretty confident that all of the markets will contribute to our revenue growth objectives profit and margin objectives for the fullyear its challenging to call out any one that stands out either on the upside or on the downside i mean i think in iberia we did talk about a slow start to the year as we did in germany but both of those markets have responded extremely strongly through the backend of the quarter and into the second quarter so both of those issues have been addressed so overall pretty consistent growth across markets i mean there are pockets of some brands doing better here or there some packages doing better here or there but overall its a pretty consistent picture for us nik anything to add manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc no no you said it all bonnie l herzog  wells fargo securities llc all right thank you operator your next question comes from stephen powers with ubs stephen r powers  ubs securities llc hey guys thanks manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc hey stephen damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc hey stephen stephen r powers  ubs securities llc i just had a – its i guess a little bit of a bigger picture question thinking about your cage presentation and other interactions with us in the last couple of months you definitely prioritized growth – new growth priorities not only across colas but also across sparkling flavors and energy juices teas waters et cetera and at the same time weve heard from the cocacola company about them also thinking more about leveraging the total portfolio for growth elevating innovation outside of csd theyre really trying to break down historical barriers preventing speed to market and so id love just a general update for you on your optimism on portfolio growth initiatives broadly but specifically in terms of whether there are valid reasons for incremental optimism just based on some of the changes occurring at coke aims at making the system overall more agile and if thats something that youre encouraged by and if there are some tangible examples as to how its playing through thank you damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc yeah i mean clearly with james moving into the ceo role james had the key role to play in the creation of ccep he was operating in this region prior to moving into his previous role so i think clearly we know that james understands the opportunities across western europe i think thats a positive for us beyond that though obviously the companys strategic intent around total beverages speed to market productivity and cost saving we believe supports a very similar objective to the one that we articulated on the creation of ccep so obviously having aligned objectives really helps us make faster decisions and win together i would want to come back to your comment on growth so i mean we see value creation as being the primary objective of profitability so while we will look across all of those categories it will be with a view to where can we make a good return rather than where can we just grow and i think a testament to that is most of the initiatives that weve taken on water whether its smartwater on tea honest tea on energy we have and will continue to prioritize areas where we believe will contribute longterm to value creation and therefore all of those brands are only sold in immediate consumption of small packs because i know there is a question out there on with the levels of revenue guidance were giving why is it not higher well a lot of the new initiatives were launching we deliberately kept them in profitable segments of those categories so we can build a more sustainable longterm value business that ties back into the coke companys objective and as you know were on a incidence pricing model so obviously that fits with their revenue goal as well so i think its very much aligned and were looking forward to continue to expand a portfolio with the coke company youll see that throughout  youll see that into  were having those conversations already but id go back to my point i mean we will do it in a way that makes sense for our shareholders and in a way that we can create value and i think that requires alignment and thankfully thats what we have now at the coke company stephen r powers  ubs securities llc yeah thats great is it too early to cite some examples of where there have been improvements in speed to market and agility or can you offer some damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc no i think to be fair the coke company has been on that agenda with muhtar for a number of years and i think they have restructured their operations with a view to being faster to market with a view to funding more innovation so in some ways i think its an acceleration of that strategy that was articulated by james last week so we have seen benefits and obviously creating ccep in western europe took three decision entities in the bottling system to one and obviously thats allowed us to be more efficient on the bottling side with the coke company as well so i dont think we would be where we are without that and that really goes back to decisions that were taken in  so clearly we look forward to seeing the acceleration of that under james but it has been a theme of the company strategy for a number of years and yeah as i said we look forward to continuing stephen r powers  ubs securities llc great thank you operator your next question comes from ali dibadj with bernstein ali dibadj  sanford c bernstein  co llc  followup with a larger one just the two smaller ones you mentioned just a second ago and also in the prepared remarks that in water youre going to focus on the value just want to understand what that means i think i know what that means i think that means ic but i just want to understand more and then on the uk would love to just learn more about what you think kind of a normalized whatever that means market growth should be volumetrically i mean this quarter youre clearly lapping some of the it issues you had last year but on a more – and i would have thought volume would have come back even more so but just on a normalized basis what do you think the volume is there damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc so hi ali just on your first point i think a good example is our smartwater proposition where weve kept it in ic weve just broadened that whole proposition into sparkling recently and were now moving into sparkling flavors so also on constant zero for  chaudfontaine again we prioritize ic and glass on that water business because they are the packages that command generally a higher consumer price and then therefore we share a higher margin with the retailer so when we talk about value it is really about where we can make sustainable good margin by focusing on packages and increasing on channels that just generates higher revenue for us and the retailers and we both share that and thats less on large bulk pack waters sold in retail at very competitive value prices – i mean or very competitive low prices thats not a business that we believe one we can add a lot of value to for our retailers and secondly its not a business that we think is kind of good for our shareholders over the longer term so it is about ic as you mentioned it is about glass and it is about packaging and channel innovation on gb again were focused much more on revenue than volume we certainly had a good comp quarter in gb thats fair we had the sap issues we talked about last year in q we havent given any guidance for revenue growth by market but clearly wed expect gb to participate in our overall guidance probably slightly ahead given that we had some issues last year so we do get a slightly benefit from that in  but thats all factored in already so again that low singledigit revenue guidance that weve given for the whole business pretty much fits all of our markets consistently ali dibadj  sanford c bernstein  co llc okay that helpful and the bigger question is more of a kind of organizational question and im just trying to think about how taxing it is on the organization to actually do integrations so clearly lots of integrations right now in bringing the bottlers in iberia and snapple  germany et cetera how taxing is that on the organization so structurally is there kind of a different integration team kind of a separate team is there a synergy pmo and whats the infrastructure if any because sometimes you need one and sometimes you dont to integrate and i guess im asking that question in the context of how stretched do you think your organization is from a human resources perspective or could it in short order integrate you in more territories without too much stress on the company damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc thats a good question ive been involved in a number of integrations and this by far in a way has been the best planned and best executed that ive been involved in clearly there was a lot of work i think the most important aspect to that is we started very early so if you recall when we talked about the creation of ccep we obviously were planning for that for quite a while we took us a lot of our key executives throughout the end of  and into  to work on planning the integration and the preprepare for a lot of the process work that we needed to do so we definitely brought forward a lot of the work because of that certainly the integration has gone extremely well the synergy capture is on track weve maintained a very small but very lean team just to complete some of the longerterm aspects of the integration but again as i said its very small its very lean it doesnt interfere with the business as you can see from our results in q and in the second half of last year on a positive note certainly what weve learned would help us integrate other businesses even better so we have a model that we know works for the bottling business we have people that have led this integration and are part of our senior leadership team and clearly we would advocate that that would give us a lot of benefits if and when we have the opportunity to acquire more territories if that comes to that ali dibadj  sanford c bernstein  co llc are you prepreparing anything now manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc  damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc well were always prepared ali its just that other people are ali dibadj  sanford c bernstein  co llc okay thanks very much guys operator your next question comes from richard withagen with kepler richard withagen  kepler cheuvreux sa netherlands yes good afternoon can i ask if you can give us an update on the sugar taxes in spain i think the catalan region has implemented tax on the st of may and how do you plan to react to this specific tax and also the countrywide tax seems to be on hold for now in spain but perhaps could you give us the status of that tax damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc yeah so we are working with the spanish team and obviously the spanish authorities to look at the structure and mechanics of that tax clearly we have some learnings from what weve gone through in gb weve had previous experience in france and portugal so as far as the most important thing is were applying that learning and knowledge back into our catalan business and we will respond in accordance as weve talked about before with obviously passing on the tax and looking at package differentiation to maintain affordability and relevance to the consumer we have already been accelerating our non or lowsugar products and variance so that obviously minimizes the impact to the tax and obviously were as interested as i think all of our competitors and customers are around what will the national governments do based on the regional tax so its in our plans were responding to it clearly like all of these taxes we would question the viability and whether they will really change behavior we dont believe it will we think there are other ways to deal with this challenge having said that theyve made a decision obviously well honor that and would execute against the law and within that it really puts more emphasis on us to diversify faster in packaging and product and were doing that in gb were doing that in portugal were doing it in spain and well see how the consumers respond to that as we move through the summer but its clearly on its way richard withagen  kepler cheuvreux sa netherlands and can i also ask on honest tea i mean how is that performing in the uk right now and ive seen in a couple of other european countries have you introduced it now across all countries or still in a selected number of  damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc were being quite selective i think if you look over the mediumterm and our objective would be to have a multibrand tea strategy in all our markets and were working with the cocacola company to understand marketbymarket whats relevant youve obviously seen the announcement regarding our association – or the companys association with nestea and so we will roll out honest were happy we think its a brand that has got relevance its organic platform its products are great but i suppose its also a category with consumers and with customers that when you need to be segmented thats the nature of that brand and two you need to be patient and were applying both of those principles so you will not find it everywhere hopefully youll find it somewhere but you wont find it everywhere and again in the interest of longterm value creation we want to make sure that we prioritize channels and customers that generate a reasonable selling price for that product thats what weve done in gb its worked well and were looking at new variants and new flavors that we can bring in to support that brand but overall the response from retailers and consumers have been very positive and as i said over the next  months you will see that brand move across all of our territories richard withagen  kepler cheuvreux sa netherlands all right thanks operator your next question comes from brett cooper with consumer edge brett cooper  consumer edge research llc thanks guys can you just talk about your capacity both from an infrastructure standpoint and then from a people standpoint to begin putting more brands or more launches through the business i guess on the heels of coke is planning to invest more you guys – your desire to diversify your portfolio thanks damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc yeah we feel wellpositioned to add more i think one of the great things about the bottling business is we have a fixed cost base we have a sales force of over  people in europe weve great customer relationships and weve got a great route to market so all of those assets are expandable to take out more brands and more packages so its something we welcome clearly you got to do it in a way that both our customers and our people can absorb so planning with the coke company and phasing in is something that were very focused on on the manufacturing side a lot of the innovation is coming in packaging formats that run on our existing lines so smaller cans smaller pet we have existing accepted capacity so a lot of these new still products are on accepted we have capacity in  we upgraded a number of our production lines particularly on energy so to inhouse monster so we have that capacity in place so certainly manufacturing is not a barrier we believe our customer relations are an asset because clearly we are operating in a category thats growing so if you look at any rtd its growing revenue so from a consumer goods perspective were in a right space in terms of the category we operate within theyre looking for innovation and looking for new products theyre looking for lower sugar which again we can clearly deliver and then from a sales force perspective if you look at our existing sales force we have expanded our association with salesforcecom and weve rolled out proprietary technology to all of our sales reps which were seeing driving increased engagement so our sales force are happier to be working on tablets were seeing a lot of productivity because weve simplified processes weve taken away bureaucracy and weve enabled them with a stateoftheart software solution and as a result of that theyve got extra capacity so without increasing € of opex were generating incremental sales capacity and that allows us to filter in some of these new products and packs so certainly not a barrier for us and clearly its about phasing in our capex numbers weve also reflected the need for extra cold space for all these new products so when nik talks about our capex guidance in the full year baked into that is an expectation that some of these new products will require incremental cold space and thats also factored into our capex guidance so overall its an exciting journey with the coke company ill just come back to my second point probably from a leadership perspective what weve just got to do is be very smart about phasing in those initiatives so we give people time to adapt and our customers to except new products and packs so thats probably the art and the science and thats something were very focused on brett cooper  consumer edge research llc great thank you operator your next question comes from stoyko moev with jpmorgan stoyko moev  jpmorgan securities plc yeah good morning gentlemen and thank you for taking my questions ive got two if i may so firstly i noticed a relatively weak performance in france i appreciate your comment in the press release on the timing of promotions but i was wondering whether you could provide a bit more color in terms of to what degree that was driven by industry weakness and to what degree these are kind of ccepspecific issues and then secondly a followup question on gb you provided some color on your performance but i was wondering whether you have seen a bit more rationale pricing from your key competitor in the market especially more recently and whether they have mirrored your price increases and also in gb last year you launched your biggest marketing campaign behind coke zero should we expect you to continue to support the brand to quite a significant degree this year thank you damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc okay thank you you did a good job of fitting three questions into one there so congratulations ill start with – in reverse order as i said were extremely happy with the zero sugar performance so thats a longterm investment from us and the coke company behind that brand so that will continue and it is continuing in  and as i said were bringing that format and taste profile to all our markets so were very happy and well continue to investment behind that brand i dont know what our competitors have done on pricing in gb and all i can do is look at what our retailers have done on pricing and certainly as i mentioned earlier weve seen retailers taking up pricing on our their promotions that seems to be reflected across the category so i think youre seeing overall the category promo pricing levels rise in gb since january end of january and thats kind of – that has been the case through easter which is probably the first – was the first big holiday event and so were seeing that being maintained but again thats fully up to the retailers discretion but it seems to be across category its certainly happening on our brands because we know that and if we look at names then we would see thats also the case across the other brand so that seems to be the dynamic theyre playing we obviously believe its a good way for the retailers to create more value in the category and we would support that so i think thats good news on france we did talk on our last call about changing our promo strategy in france we have in q not just reduced some of the promotions with easter moving but we also have started to promote smaller packages so if you – in our french business we have for a number of years have a very dependent volume around large pet packages we believe theres a bigger opportunity with smaller packaging smaller pet smaller can sized and weve redirected some of our support into those packages clearly in the shortterm they dont generate the absolute volume or absolute revenue given the selling prices of the large pet packs but it is we believe the right thing to do for the longterm and clearly that was the big change with some of our retailers and candidly like all of these changes when you change pricing or promo there is a period of disruption in the market thats what occurred in january we talked about that and were happy when we looked at our price realization in france on a per case level its reflecting that strategy but clearly through the summer well get a better understanding of how the consumer responds to the new offers but again it was a conscious decision and we believe the right one for the longterm health of the business stoyko moev  jpmorgan securities plc okay thank you operator your next question comes from robert ottenstein with evercore robert ottenstein  evercore group llc great i want to followup on some of the answers that you gave in terms of capacity for new products and specifically sparkling water and sparkling smartwater do you see that as having more geographic potential than just plain smartwater which has largely been a uk product so thats question – or part one innocent do you believe that you have the capacity in terms of the cold storage whatever you need on the logistic side for innocent and any plans to get that and then third in the coke system coke in japan is starting to introduce more premium cocacola variance that have a health and wellness angle with added ingredients do you see that as something that may make sense in your markets thank you damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc hi robert thank you for the question so on smartwater yeah simple answer is yes i mean actually in some of our markets particularly like germany we know that carbonated water is the preferred choice so we would expect that over time having a carbonated and a flavored and a still variant on smartwater makes sense we launched it first in gb because thats where weve had the longest experience with smartwater weve got a good consumer franchise so well see how it goes but from a consumer perspective if you look at our other markets it is easy to see a path to expansion over the next couple of years but its early days on sparkling flavored so we just got in so wed probably be able to give you more color around that in the second half of the year on innocent thats currently not in our plans thats something that we continue to reflect on with the cocacola company in terms of whats right for that brand and can ccep add a lot of value to that proposition and can innocent add a lot of value to our shareholders thats our number one question its quite a different business as you mentioned its chilled so i think if it was the right decision for the system the aspects of the supply chain that we would need to address are not that complex as you called out its really about chilled distribution thats readily available in western europe through partnerships so i dont think that would be a barrier i think the real question is given where that brand is at and its success and the level of investments that goes behind that success is it a brand that would add value to ccep we continually reflect on that with the coke company but at the moment we dont have any plans to build that chilled capability at ccep that may change in the future im aware but you probably know more than i do if im being honest about whats going on in japan but clearly weve – we have a session with the cocacola company coming up with all of the large bottlers as part of that conversation well look at what innovations are working across the globe and what can we take back into europe and ive now added what youve told me to my list of questions so ill know more by the end of may and that may be something that would work well in europe but ive got to learn a bit more about – i have heard about it but i havent seen any results  there might be something that would work well given the similar demographics in western europe robert ottenstein  evercore group llc terrific thank you very much operator your next question comes from mark swartzberg with stifel nicolaus mark swartzberg  stifel nicolaus  co inc good afternoon gentlemen thanks for taking the questions i had two one damian iberia specifically i know theres – the one fewer selling day but it looks like even after you adjust for that there was a slowdown in organic revenue growth in the quarter after either by comparison to last year entirely or by comparison to the second half of last year where you had a nice pickup in growth so am i interpreting that correctly and if i am whats going on there and then my second question is for either you or nik it does – in spite of iberia which seems very manageable it looks like youre in a position where you could have some earnings upside as you move through the year if that were to be the case is your emphasis – im trying to get a sense of where the priority might be is it to put more money against a particular part of your sparkling portfolio is it to put more money against this emphasis on water or this greater emphasis on being properly positioned in water just trying to get a sense on where the priorities are there for that damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc so just on the iberia mark i mean theres nothing really to read through on the quarter in iberia and as you said yourself iberia had a really strong year last year with a good quarter four easter moved we did have a slow january in iberia but thats really it i mean theres nothing else going on in iberia in fact its a fantastic business and it continues to deliver solid revenue growth over a number of quarters so i think probably the biggest factor is the selling day that gets you back to around flat easter again is a big factor so were not concerned at all about iberia manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc sorry just to be clear with the one additional selling day we actually are up about  its flat on a reported basis damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc yeah sorry yeah so – and again as you said mark swartzberg  stifel nicolaus  co inc yeah damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc go ahead sorry mark swartzberg  stifel nicolaus  co inc no go ahead damian sorry damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc so as i just said its a slight slowdown from where it was but again i wouldnt underestimate slow january but overall still a good quarter and when you take easter out i think were very happy with iberia mark swartzberg  stifel nicolaus  co inc and are you saying its only easter because i see a  and then i see a  last year and i look at the second half which implies of course the first half was an easier compare so it makes me think its more than easter so im just – and more than january so is that all it is or is there something else going on damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc thats all it is manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc thats all it is and also theres an impact from portugal remember we have a sugar tax that has an impact damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc yeah mark swartzberg  stifel nicolaus  co inc fair enough manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc in terms of the volume and revenue piece damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc yeah now theres a – i mean in fact if we look at our execution metrics if we look at our channel mix in iberia and if we look at our renovation pipeline with the cocacola company that business is performing very well so nothing else going on there manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc and we actually had a strong q  hurdle as well in iberia remember obviously it wasnt a part of the group but we did talk about what q looked like too so i think all those factors and as damian said theres nothing outside of that that we see we actually continue to be very pleased with the performance there mark swartzberg  stifel nicolaus  co inc great great damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc and maybe you could just manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc we got so caught up in the first one we forgot your second question damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc yeah so your second question if you could restate it please mark operator i apologize hes no longer in the queue manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc i think mark i think your question was in relation to if the business performs better how would we be thinking about potential opportunities and i think one keep in mind again its only the first quarter we still got the summer selling season ahead of us weve got some tough comps in q and q to hurdle as well so we dont want to get ahead of ourselves obviously we continue to look at things that we would like to do jointly at the system to think about reinvigorating and sustaining that topline growth and if and when that arises we will update you thor erickson  cocacola european partners plc operator next question please thank you operator thank you and your next question comes from bryan spillane with bank of america merrill lynch bryan d spillane  bank of america merrill lynch hi good morning everyone manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc good morning bryan d spillane  bank of america merrill lynch just one question about cash flow can you – nik can you maybe update us on your thinking in terms of sort of how youre thinking about returning cash to shareholders and especially putting aside if there is the possibility for ma just how youll think about like excess cash flow the bias towards share repurchases or dividends just kind of where youre thinking as youre getting closer to that point where maybe youll be in a position to return more cash to shareholders manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc no closer than we were last quarter a couple of months ago bryan so – or maybe a couple of months closer no but listen i think in all fairness a couple of things i would say to you and again this is obviously absent other investment opportunities including ma first thing is obviously we continue to want to steadily increase the dividend payout ratio and i think i indicated that last time as well we had planned to move towards that  dividend payout which we did with the increase to € a share per quarter but were probably still at the lower end of our peer range in terms of dividend payouts so i think that would be a steady increase there nothing big or dramatic second is obviously as we get down towards that leverage range and with the interest of wanting to continuing to maintain flexibility for opportunities going forward but at the same time optimizing that capital structure we would do some form of return if that was appropriate again i think ill reiterate what i said last time there is no bias or preference for a special dividend versus a share repo the board would need to consider that we have talked about that i dont think theres anything that precludes us from doing either one and what form it ultimately takes will be the decision of the board and could be a combination thereof so our thinking continues to be in the same direction as weve had since day one bryan d spillane  bank of america merrill lynch okay thanks nik operator your next question comes from andrew holland with société générale andrew holland  société générale sa uk yeah hi given the success that youre having with zero sugar in the uk can you give us an update on the proportion of your gb volume that you would expect to be captured by the sugar tax when that comes in next year and related to that could you give us your estimate of what the retail prices will have to do if that tax is passed on in full given the sort of channel mix and brand mix of your business damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc hi andrew so directionally it will be less than half of our range or of our volume lets say more in terms of range would fall into that tax spend so if you look at some of the data from last year we are really accelerating our low and nonsugar  or maybe even higher than that so – but clearly we understand whats coming and therefore if we look at reformulation and investment by brand et cetera we continue to grow our nonsugar and lowsugar variance much faster so that mix is just going to go one way but at the moment would be less than half on your second question its too early i mean at the moment were just looking at what will the tax means what will it mean by customer by channel by pack weve been doing a lot of modeling i suppose the only commitment we will make is were committed to pass on the tax to the consumer and to the – or to the customer and then we would expect the customer to pass on to the consumer but again thats their choice the reason i cant be more specific is obviously from a competitive perspective we are looking at pack sizes and variance and affordability concerns and only when we really finalize those well be able to kind of be clear on what it may mean in terms of potential selling prices so we will do that as we move through the year but at the moment its still work in progress so hopefully you can appreciate that andrew holland  société générale sa uk okay and just pressing a bit on your less than half a volume less than half could be  it could be  might it be sort of  to  is it in that sort of range that youre expecting damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc yeah i think to be fair weve been hitting weve been over  nonsugar in gb coming out of the last quarter and if you take our growth rate you kind of guessed exactly into the range of what youre – what youve just said absolutely andrew holland  société générale sa uk okay thank you manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc and again keep in mind as weve always said it will just be two products red coke and monster green that would be  damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc so we have a little reformulated all other brands and varieties below the sugar tax level so as nik said it will be coke classic and our green energy monster brand so from a products perspective then obviously the percentages are a lot different but from a volume perspective it lands within the range that you said so i think weve got time for one more question operator all right and your next question comes from kevin grundy with jefferies kevin grundy  jefferies llc hey good morning guys manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc morning kevin grundy  jefferies llc question for nik on mix implications on margins as you look out so not just for just year nik but as you look out like the next three to five years and given the puts and takes from a geography perspective where germany clearly lags other regions pack and channel strategies which you guys have spoken a lot about and then product perspective with twothirds of the portfolio still levered to trademark coke but trends there weaken and thats likely to persist particularly given sort of a deemphasis from the cocacola company now so understanding nik that synergies are going to be the key margin driver here over the next few years as we think about those moving parts whats your expectations as you kind of pull all those pieces together for mix on margins kind of on a per annum basis any sort of help there would be great thanks manik h jhangiani  cocacola european partners plc sure tough one to give you really straight direction on but i think youve hit the highlights there will be obviously markets such as germany that are bit more of a drag given their lower margin structure but i think were doing a lot of things that are right in that marketplace both from a restructuring as well as what damian even highlighted from a pricing promotional plan perspective that should help over time continue to drive margins up in that market our focus is clearly to be able to get a favorable pack architecture mix coming through channel mix with a lot more focus around the cold immediate consumption channel and obviously with new product introductions a lot of what were looking at would be much more in the ic space which over time should continue to have a positive impact on our mix as well and when i say over time because clearly there will be some early cost associated to invest behind those brands but netnet we would continue to see over time mix to be a positive kevin grundy  jefferies llc okay thank you good luck damian paul gammell  cocacola european partners plc thank you so again thank you everybody for taking the time to join us just wanted to share to you some closing thoughts before we end the call clearly as youve heard from nik and i were very pleased with a solid start to  again wed like to emphasis it is our smallest quarter and our focus in the nearterm is really preparing the organization for our key summer selling season and working particularly with the cocacola company on product brand innovation to build and sustain longterm shareholder value for all of the shareholders at ccep so we look forward to talking to you again during the year updating you on our progress and again thank you very much for taking the time goodbye operator this does concludes todays conference call you may now disconnect copyright policy all
