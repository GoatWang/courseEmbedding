continue the effectiveness of article viii section  of the declaration of trust the board of trustees recommends that shareholders vote to continue the effectiveness of article viii section  of the declaration of trust on september   pursuant to authority granted to the trustees under article xii section  of the declaration of trust and applicable laws the trustees modified a provision in the declaration of trust to resolve any legal uncertainty regarding derivative actions brought on behalf of a fund notwithstanding their authority to amend the declaration of trust the trustees authorized the submission of this amendment to shareholders to vote on the continued effectiveness of the provision the amended provision currently in effect is set forth below section  a shareholder may bring derivative action on behalf of the trust only if the shareholder or shareholders first make a presuit demand upon the trustees to bring the subject action unless an effort to cause the trustees to bring such action is excused a demand on the trustees shall only be excused if a majority of the board of trustees or a majority of any committee established to consider such action has a personal financial interest in the action at issue a trustee shall not be deemed to have a personal financial interest in an action or otherwise be disqualified from ruling on a shareholder demand by virtue of the fact that such trustee receives remuneration from his service on the board of trustees of the trust or on the boards of one or more investment companies with the same or an affiliated investment advisor or underwriter the amendment provides that a trustee shall not be deemed to have a personal interest or otherwise be disqualified from considering a presuit demand by a shareholder to bring a derivative action on behalf of a fund due to his or her service on boards of trustees of other funds with the same or affiliated investment advisor or underwriter there is some legal uncertainty regarding whether a trustee serving on multiple boards of trustees is independent of the investment advisor and therefore permitted to consider a presuit demand by a shareholder seeking to assert a claim against a funds investment advisor the trustees seek to ensure that they retain the ability to manage the affairs of the funds including control of derivative actions that are brought on behalf of a fund this provision in the amendment will resolve any legal uncertainty by expressly stating that a trustee shall not be deemed to have a personal interest or otherwise be disqualified from considering a presuit demand due to his or her service on multiple fund boards of trustees continuing the effectiveness of the amendment will not alter in any way the trustees existing fiduciary obligations to act with due care and in shareholders interests if shareholders do not vote to continue the provisions effectiveness the trustees will execute an amended and restated declaration of trust which eliminates article viii section  conclusion the board of trustees has concluded that continuing the effectiveness of the amendment to article viii section  of the declaration of trust is in the best interests of the trusts shareholders accordingly the trustees unanimously recommend that shareholders vote for the proposal if the proposal is approved article viii section  will remain in the declaration of trust as presented above if the proposal is not approved the trustees will execute an amended and restated declaration of trust which eliminates article viii section    and  to authorize the trustees to adopt an amended and restated declaration of trust the board of trustees has approved and recommends that the shareholders of the trust authorize them to adopt and execute an amended and restated declaration of trust in the form attached to this proxy statement as exhibit  new declaration of trust the new declaration of trust has been marked to show changes from the trusts existing declaration of trust current declaration of trust the new declaration of trust is a standard form that will be used for all new fidelity funds organized as massachusetts business trusts going forward the new declaration of trust gives the trustees more flexibility and subject to applicable requirements of the  act and massachusetts law broader authority to act this increased flexibility may allow the trustees to react more quickly to changes in competitive and regulatory conditions and as a consequence may allow the funds to operate in a more efficient and economical manner adoption of the new declaration of trust will not alter in any way the trustees existing fiduciary obligations to act with due care and in the shareholders interests before utilizing any new flexibility that the new declaration of trust may afford the trustees must first consider the shareholders interests and then act in accordance with such interests under the current declaration of trust shareholders generally have the right to vote on any amendment affecting their right to vote any amendment affecting the amendment provisions of the declaration of trust any amendment that would alter the maximum number of trustees any amendment required by law or the trusts registration statement and any matter submitted to the shareholders by the trustees on november   the trustees approved the form of the new declaration of trust on december   the trustees approved additional changes to the form of the new declaration of trust which changes have been incorporated into the form attached to this proxy statement on november   the board authorized the submission of the new declaration of trust to the trusts shareholders for their authorization at this meeting r in addition to the modifications discussed below in the new declaration of trust other nonmaterial changes may be noted see exhibit  the changes are intended to clarify certain language and conform the current declaration of trust to the standard for all new fidelity funds organized as massachusets business trusts going forward if any of proposals   or  are approved by shareholders it is intended that these nonmaterial changes will be included in the new declaration of trust that will be executedr r as summarized below shareholders are being asked to approve three proposals to amend the current declaration of trustr rproposal  to authorize the trustees to increase the maximum number of trustees r the new declaration of trust modifies rarticle iv section  orf the current declaration of trust to allow the trustees to increase the maximum number of trustees from twelve  to fourteen  this increase is intended to enhance the flexibility of the board to organize itself and its committees in overseeing management of the fidelity funds and to expand the level of the boards expertise under the current declaration of trust and the new declaration of trust the maximum number of trustees cannot be changed without shareholder approval rproposal  to authorize the trustees to clarify the scope of the trustees authority regarding mergers consolidations incorporations and reorganizations r rarticle xii sections  and  of ther new declaration of trust explicitly allows the trustees to authorize the merger consolidation incorporation or reorganization of a class or a portion of the trust or a series or class thereof in addition to the merger consolidation incorporation or reorganization of the whole trust or a series thereof providing the trustees with additional flexibility with respect to classes and a portion of the trust or its series or classes will allow the trustees to respond more quickly to changes without the cost of an additional shareholder meeting the trustees already have this authority with respect to the trust and its series the new declaration of trust does not give the trustees the authority to merge a fund or class with another operating mutual fund or sell all or a portion of a class or funds assets to another operating mutual fund without first seeking shareholder approval under the new declaration of trust shareholder approval is still required for these transactions in addition the new declaration of trust explicitly allows the trustees to effect mergers consolidations incorporations reorganizations and similar transactions through any method approved by the trustees including shareforshare exchanges transfers or sale of assets shareholder inkind redemptions and purchases and exchange offers rproposal  to authorize the trustees to enter into management contracts on behalf of a new fund r the new declaration of trust modifiesr article vii section  of rthe current declaration of trust to allow the trustees on behalf of a new fund to enter into a management contract with fmr subject to the provisions of section  of the  act as modified or interpreted by the securities and exchange commission sec the current declaration of trust explicitly requires the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of a fund to initially approve such a contract the sec permits the sole initial shareholder usually fmr or an affiliate to approve the initial management contract rather than the funds public shareholders the new declaration of trust would clarify that approval by the sole initial shareholder is sufficient if permitted by the sec conclusion the board of trustees has concluded that the proposed adoption of the new declaration of trust is in the best interests of the trusts shareholders accordingly the trustees unanimously recommend that the shareholders vote for rproposals   and r to authorize them to adopt and execute the new declaration of trust rif proposals   and  are all approved by shareholders the trustees will adopt the form of new declaration of trust attached as exhibit  if some but not all of proposals   and  are approved the trustees will adopt a form of new declaration of trust that reflects only those

computing the performance adjustment the basic fee for fidelity aggressive growth fund fidelity growth company fund and fidelity new millennium fund is subject to upward or downward adjustment depending upon whether and to what extent the funds investment performance for the performance period exceeds or is exceeded by the record of the russell midcap growth index the russell  growth index

twelfth  of the annual performance adjustment rate is then applied to each funds average net assets determined as of the close of business on each business day throughout the month and the performance period giving a dollar amount which will be added to or subtracted from the basic fee each funds performance is calculated based on changes in net asset value nav for purposes of calculating the

presidents message photoofedwardcjohnsond dear shareholder although financial turmoil in pacific basin countries was a catalyst for significant volatility in us markets in late october and into november the standard  poors  index has risen more than  yeartodate almost three times its historical annual average meanwhile bond markets  primarily influenced by a relatively steady flow of positive news on the inflation front  continued to post solid returns through the first  months of  while its impossible to predict the future direction of the markets with any degree of certainty there are certain basic principles that can help investors plan for their future needs first investors are encouraged to take a longterm view of their portfolios if you can afford to leave your money invested through the inevitable up and down cycles of the financial markets you will greatly reduce your vulnerability to any single decline we know from experience for example that stock prices have gone up over longer periods of time have significantly outperformed other types of investments and have stayed ahead of inflation second you can further manage your investing risk through diversification a stock mutual fund for instance is already diversified because it invests in many different companies you can increase your diversification further by investing in a number of different stock funds or in such other investment categories as bonds if you have a short investment time horizon you might want to consider moving some of your investment into a money market fund which seeks income and a stable share price by investing in highquality shortterm investments of course its important to remember that there is no assurance that a money market fund will achieve its goal of maintaining a stable net asset value of  per share and that these types of funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by any agency of the us government finally no matter what your time horizon or portfolio diversity it makes good sense to follow a regular investment plan investing a certain amount of money in a fund at the same time each month or quarter and periodically reviewing your overall portfolio by doing so you wont get caught up in the excitement of a rapidly rising market nor will you buy all your shares at market highs while this strategy  known as dollar cost averaging  wont assure a profit or protect you from a loss in a declining market it should help you lower the average cost of your purchases if you have questions please call us at  we are available  hours a day

a funds historical performance you can look at the total percentage change in value the average annual percentage change or the growth of a hypothetical  investment total return reflects the change in

terms over a set period  in this case one year five years or  years for example if you had invested  in a fund that had a  return over the past year the value of your investment would be  you can compare the funds returns to the performance of the standard  poors  index  a widely recognized unmanaged index of common stocks to measure how the funds performance stacked up against its peers you can compare it to the growth funds average which reflects the performance of mutual funds with similar objectives tracked by lipper analytical services inc the past one year average represents a peer group of  mutual funds these benchmarks include reinvested dividends and capital gains if any and exclude the effect of sales charges average annual total returns periods ended november   past  past  past  year years years fidelity growth company    sp     growth funds average    average annual total returns take the funds cumulative return and show you what would have happened if the fund had

invested in fidelity growth company fund on november   as the chart shows by november   the value of the investment would have grown to   a  increase on the initial investment for comparison look at how the sp  did over the same period with dividends and capital gains if any reinvested the same  investment would have grown to   a  increase understanding performance how a fund did yesterday is no guarantee of how it will do tomorrow the stock market for example has a history of longterm growth and shortterm volatility in turn the share price and return of a fund that invests in stocks will vary that means if you sell your shares during a market downturn you might lose money but if you can ride out the markets ups and downs you may have a gain checkmark fund talk the managers overview market recap the  months that ended november   was a period that truly tested the us stock markets resolve but despite frequent shifts in sentiment an interestrate hike and global volatility concerns us stocks still managed to perform well the standard  poors  index  a broad gauge of the us stock market  returned  during the period well above the markets longterm annual average return of around  in the first half of the period largecap stocks were responsible for much of the markets gain as investors were drawn to stocks with recognizable names and consistent earningsgrowth track records consequently stock prices soared and enthusiasm was high the federal reserve board  in an attempt to halt inflation before it appeared  raised a key shortterm interest rate by  in march the market paused briefly but then kept rolling as the dow jones industrial average reached the point mark for the first time ever in august with several multinational companies announcing earnings shortfalls in midaugust smallcap stocks came into favor among investors during august and september the russell  index  which measures smallcap stock performance  was up  while the sp was down  volatility in asian markets in late october sent skittish investors running for cover the dow slid  points in one day then snapped back the next reclaiming plus points sensing continued fallout from this volatility investors again became qualityconscious and largecaps regained their perch through november an interview with steven wymer portfolio manager of fidelity growth company fund q how did the fund perform steve a its been a challenging year for the  months that ended november   the fund returned  this lagged the standard  poors  index which compiled a return of  over the same time the growth funds average returned  according to lipper analytical services q what factors caused the fund to underperform the index and peer group a individual stock selection within certain industry groups hurt as did a difficult environment for technology stocks and an underweighting in finance stocks relative to the sp  in terms of individual disappointments the funds positions in retailoriented stocks such as ikon office solutions petsmart and sunglass hut were particularly disappointing hollywood entertainment  a video rental company  was hurt by a slow summer box office slate and subsequent weak video demand waste industry stocks  such as waste management inc and usa waste  also went through difficult performance stretches technology stocks  which accounted for approximately  of the funds investments at the end of the period  had trouble particularly in the latter months of the period finally finance stocks performed very well the fund had some representation in this group but finance is not an area that typically attracts a fund such as growth company that seeks aboveaverage sales and earnings growth q why did technology stocks falter a in the first half of the period networkingrelated technology stocks were big detractors several fund holdings  including ascend communications and cisco  suffered due to sluggish demand and increased pricing pressure but the time period that really hurt was october and november when volatility in asia hit tech stocks hard the asiapacific region  exclusive of japan  accounts for roughly  of the worlds personal computer consumption and  of all pcs are actually produced there from a manufacturing standpoint currency devaluations in that region will result in lower costs thats the good news the bad news is that consumption in asia will decline and companies that sell locally there or export products to that region will suffer the consequences q at various intervals during the period investors favored stocks of larger companies over smaller companies and vice versa how did these shifts in sentiment affect the fund a for much of the first half of the period an extremely narrow group of largecapitalization stocks were the top performers for a variety of reasons investors favored the more recognizable highquality names regardless of the price of their stocks that type of environment favors the sp  over a more diversified stock fund such as growth company in late summer however a few of these companies announced earnings shortfalls and this helped to broaden the market the fund benefited from this shift because it made for a more even playing field for stocks of all sizes in seeking growth i dont limit myself to one particular cap level ill consider opportunities in the small medium and largecap arenas q you mentioned the sluggish performance of wasterelated stocks during the period yet usa waste services was the funds largest single position as of november     a many of the problems within the waste group can be linked to a negative surprise concerning one company waste management inc  which the fund also owned during the period  was in the midst of restructuring itself when its new chief executive officer left the company there were also concerns about aggressive accounting practices with waste management unfortunately these developments affected the entire waste group for much of the period usa waste however could continue to benefit from an industry that is displaying more discipline concerning capital management the company also has been extremely active in terms of making logical acquisitions while id characterize the waste industry as being disappointing during the period usa waste still had many appealing characteristics q were there any noteworthy additions to the funds top  holdings a one interesting stock that joined the top  at the close of the period was drugmaker lilly the draw to this company was mostly productrelated at the end of the period lilly was close to receiving regulatory approval for a new drug called evista the ability of this drug to fight osteoporosis and other potential benefits  including reducing cholesterol and fighting breast cancer  resulted in a fair amount of optimism among investors the stock performed reasonably well during the period q along the same lines the fund held many drug distribution and drug store stocks what was the appeal there a increased consolidation activity  particularly some highprofile mergers  helped many of these stocks post strong performances drug distributor cardinal health was in the process of making a favorable acquisition while drugstore stocks cvs and riteaid both benefited from mergers cvs  which has shown that it knows how to run drug stores successfully  bought revco while riteaid purchased thrifty payless mergers such as these can be beneficial particularly if an acquisition can give a company more pricing power within its industry the fund had positions in cardinal health cvs and riteaid during the period and each performed nicely q why do you think there has been so much merger and acquisition activity lately a i think the real driver behind this increased activity is that in an economy where it is difficult to raise prices  which is what weve seen recently  companies are looking for ways to improve their profitability sometimes a wellplanned merger not only increases a companys size but also improves its access to key customers and allows it to lower its overall cost structure q what other stocks performed well a four names that stood out were bristolmyers squibb nextel communications compusa and dell computer like most pharmaceutical stocks bristolmyers performed well due to an impressive array of new products and strong prescription drug demand nextel  which offers wireless communications services  and compusa  a retail computer store chain  enjoyed solid growth while dell continued to gather market share q whats your outlook a much attention will be focused on the fallout from asias economic crisis no one knows when the situation will begin to improve  it could be three months or three years with this in mind the future for technology stocks  much of which is determined by asian consumption and production  is unpredictable its a waitandsee game that ill be monitoring quite closely the views expressed in this report reflect those of the portfolio manager only through the end of the period of the report as stated on the cover the managers views are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions steve wymer on international market volatility the economic crisis that enveloped the asiapacific region in october and november affected many us companies especially technology firms that sell locally in asia or export their products to that area due to its growth focus nature the fund has historically had considerable exposure to growthoriented technology companies at this point it seems like the environment for tech stocks is worse than companies are admitting when severe economic downturns occur it usually takes a while for companies to assess the real impact but my sense is that asias problems have had a harmful domino effect theres always a chance for rapid improvement but i dont see anything nearterm that indicates a turnaround right now nobody wants to touch asia with a foot pole what does all this mean for the fund one positive aspect of foreign market volatility is that it often creates buying opportunities stocks have become cheaper im going to keep a close eye on asia to see if any signs of stabilization crop up as with the latin american currency crisis in  us stocks with exposure to beaten down markets tend to rise quite quickly when improvement is visible

catalyst for significant volatility in us markets in late october and into november the standard  poors  index has risen more than  yeartodate almost three times its historical annual average meanwhile bond markets  primarily influenced by a relatively steady flow of positive news on the inflation front  continued to post solid returns through the first  months of  while its impossible to predict the future direction of the markets with any degree of certainty there are certain basic principles that can help investors plan for their future needs first investors are encouraged to take a longterm view of their portfolios if you can afford to leave your money invested through the inevitable up and down cycles of the financial markets you will greatly reduce your vulnerability to any single decline we know from experience for example that stock prices have gone up over longer periods of time have significantly outperformed other types of investments and have stayed ahead of inflation second you can further manage your investing risk through diversification a stock mutual fund for instance is already diversified because it invests in many different companies you can increase your diversification further by investing in a number of different stock funds or in such other investment categories as bonds if you have a short investment time horizon you might want to consider moving some of your investment into a money market fund which seeks income and a stable share price by investing in highquality shortterm investments of course its important to remember that there is no assurance that a money market fund will achieve its goal of maintaining a stable net asset value of  per share and that these types of funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by any agency of the us government finally no matter what your time horizon or portfolio diversity it makes good sense to follow a regular investment plan investing a certain amount of money in a fund at the same time each month or quarter and periodically reviewing your overall portfolio by doing so you wont get caught up in the excitement of a rapidly rising market nor will you buy all your shares at market highs while this strategy  known as dollar cost averaging  wont assure a profit or protect you from a loss in a declining market it should help you lower the average cost of your purchases if you have questions please call us at  we are available  hours a day seven days a week to provide you the information you need to make the investments that are right for you best regards edward c johnson d performance the bottom line there are several ways to evaluate a funds historical performance you can look at the total percentage change in value the average annual percentage change or the growth of a hypothetical  investment total return reflects the change in the value of an investment assuming reinvestment of the funds dividend income and capital gains the profits earned upon the sale of securities that have grown in value cumulative total returns download table periods ended november   past  life of year fund fidelity new millennium   fidelity new millennium incl  sales charge   sp registered trademark   capital appreciation funds average  na cumulative total returns show the funds performance in percentage terms over a set period  in this case one year or since the fund started on december   for example if you had invested  in a fund that had a  return over the past year the value of your investment would be  you can compare the funds returns to the performance of the standard  poors  index  a widely recognized unmanaged index of common stocks to measure how the funds performance stacked up against its peers you can compare it to the capital appreciation funds average which reflects the performance of mutual funds with similar objectives tracked by lipper analytical services inc the past one year average represents a peer group of  mutual funds these benchmarks include reinvested dividends and capital gains if any and exclude the effect of sales charges average annual total returns periods ended november   past  life of year fund fidelity new millennium   fidelity new millennium incl  sales charge   sp    capital appreciation funds average  na average annual total returns take the funds cumulative return and show you what would have happened if the fund had performed at a constant rate each year note lipper calculates average annual total returns by annualizing each funds total return then taking an arithmetic average this may produce a slightly different figure than that obtained by averaging the cumulative total returns and annualizing the result  over life of fund imahdr prasun shrcht    s new millennium sp   sp

over life of fund lets say hypothetically that  was invested in fidelity new millennium fund on december   when the fund started and the current  sales charge was paid as the chart shows by november   the value of the investment would have grown to   a  increase on the initial investment for comparison look at how the sp  did over the same period with dividends and capital gains if any reinvested the same  investment would have grown to   a  increase understanding performance how a fund did yesterday is no guarantee of how it will do tomorrow the stock market for example has a history of longterm growth and shortterm volatility in turn the share price and return of a fund that invests in stocks will vary that means if you sell your shares during a market downturn you might lose money but if you can ride out the markets ups and downs you may have a gain checkmark fund talk the managers overview market recap the  months that ended november   was a period that truly tested the us stock markets resolve but despite frequent shifts in sentiment an interestrate hike and global volatility concerns us stocks still managed to perform well the standard  poors  index  a broad gauge of the us stock market  returned  during the period well above the markets longterm annual average of around  in the first half of the period largecap stocks were responsible for much of the markets gain as investors were drawn to stocks with recognizable names and consistent earningsgrowth track records consequently stock prices soared and enthusiasm was high the federal reserve board  in an attempt to halt inflation before it appeared  raised a key shortterm interest rate by  in march the market paused briefly but then kept rolling as the dow jones industrial average reached the point mark for the first time ever in august with several multinational companies announcing earnings shortfalls in midaugust smallcap stocks came into favor among investors during august and september the russell  index  which measures smallcap stock performance  was up  while the sp was down  volatility in asian markets in late october sent skittish investors running for cover the dow slid  points in one day then snapped back the next reclaiming plus points sensing continued fallout from this volatility investors again became qualityconscious and largecaps regained their perch through november an interview with neal miller portfolio manager of fidelity new millennium fund q how did the fund perform neal a for the  months that ended november   the fund returned  the capital appreciation funds average returned  during this time according to lipper analytical services the standard  poors  index returned  q what factors influenced the funds performance a one major disappointment was the performance of smallcompany stocks relative to stocks of larger companies at the beginning of the period investors were still favoring a narrow group of very large wellknown companies in the summer months however smallcap stocks gained momentum in august and september the russell  index  which measures the performance of smallcap stocks  outgained the sp  which measures the performance of larger stocks turmoil in asian markets during the last two months of the period though brought small stocks back to earth in times of volatility wary investors tend to gravitate toward higherquality conservatively priced blue chip stocks and when investors bought these kinds of stocks they tended to sell technology issues where the fund had significant exposure q does that explain why the funds technology exposure was reduced from around  a year ago to approximately  a i had begun reducing the funds technology positions prior to the turmoil in asia  which has been a significant technology consumption and production source  mostly because i perceived overall market demand to be weakening along with low demand other disturbing trends included software delays the slower adaptation of video technology into the marketplace and falling personal computer prices that cut into profits while technology is always an important sector for the fund the funds weighting will typically depend on specific product initiatives as well as the relative prospects and prices within the industry q asm lithography was the funds largest single position at the end of the period why was this stock attractive a this stock was one of the best performing positions during the period on a recent trip to asia i met with several people involved in the semiconductor business all said that lithography  the process of producing patterns on semiconductor wafers for use as integrated circuits  would be the most important aspect of technology going forward asm lithography  which is based in the netherlands  has pioneered a process using ultraviolet light sources that could be very much in demand the company also has a very favorable competitive position with this particular technology q can you highlight some of the stocks that did well what about disappointments a three that immediately come to mind as being positive contributors included keane us airways and herman miller which specializes in office furnishings keane  which provides information technology services  had its earnings driven by three factors consulting on the year  problem existing customers outsourcing additional work to keane and the capture of new customers us airways  which used to be us air  performed well as new management came in and made some quality decisions about how to allocate its capital one such smart move was purchasing the remainder of its related shuttle service on the east coast in which the company previously had only a minority interest lastly herman miller benefited from strong demand for workplace systems and furniture as far as laggards go micron technology and klatencor were two technologyrelated holdings that suffered from the asian crisis q whats your outlook a after all thats happened in the past few months im still optimistic on the nearterm future for stocks id temper that by adding that we are entering a political period in the us where the president can make some difficult but prudent economic decisions since he wont be running for reelection in terms of fiscal and monetary policy  along with the asian backdrop where cheap exports should have a deflationary effect  the risk that interest rates will rise going forward appears to be minimal because inflation seems to be under control the technology sector needs to get its house in order and if tech companies can focus on new product innovation im confident that ill be able to find some opportunities the views expressed in this report reflect those of the portfolio manager only through the end of the period of the report as stated on the cover the managers views are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions steve wymer on international market volatility the economic crisis that enveloped the asiapacific region in october and november affected many us companies especially technology firms that sell locally in asia or export their products to that area due to its growth focus nature the fund has historically had considerable exposure to growthoriented technology companies at this point it seems like the environment for tech stocks is worse than companies are admitting when severe economic downturns occur it usually takes a while for companies to assess the real impact but my sense is that asias problems have had a harmful domino effect theres always a chance for rapid improvement but i dont see anything nearterm that indicates a turnaround right now nobody wants to touch asia with a foot pole what does all this mean for the fund one positive aspect of foreign market volatility is that it often creates buying opportunities stocks have become cheaper im going to keep a close eye on asia to see if any signs of stabilization crop up as with the latin american currency crisis in  us stocks with exposure to beaten down markets tend to rise quite quickly when improvement is visible fund facts goal to increase the value of

in us markets in late october and into november the standard  poors  index has risen more than  yeartodate almost three times its historical annual average meanwhile bond markets  primarily influenced by a relatively steady flow of positive news on the inflation front  continued to post solid returns through the first  months of  while its impossible to predict the future direction of the markets with any degree of certainty there are certain basic principles that can help investors plan for their future needs first investors are encouraged to take a longterm view of their portfolios if you can afford to leave your money invested through the inevitable up and down cycles of the financial markets you will greatly reduce your vulnerability to any single decline we know from experience for example that stock prices have gone up over longer periods of time have significantly outperformed other types of investments and have stayed ahead of inflation second you can further manage your investing risk through diversification a stock mutual fund for instance is already diversified because it invests in many different companies you can increase your diversification further by investing in a number of different stock funds or in such other investment categories as bonds if you have a short investment time horizon you might want to consider moving some of your investment into a money market fund which seeks income and a stable share price by investing in highquality shortterm investments of course its important to remember that there is no assurance that a money market fund will achieve its goal of maintaining a stable net asset value of  per share and that these types of funds are neither insured nor guaranteed by any agency of the us government finally no matter what your time horizon or portfolio diversity it makes good sense to follow a regular investment plan investing a certain amount of money in a fund at the same time each month or quarter and periodically reviewing your overall portfolio by doing so you wont get caught up in the excitement of a rapidly rising market nor will you buy all your shares at market highs while this strategy  known as dollar cost averaging  wont assure a profit or protect you from a loss in a declining market it should help you lower the average cost of your purchases if you have questions please call us at  we are available  hours a day seven days a week to provide you the information you need to make the investments that are right for you best regards edward c johnson d performance the bottom line there are several ways to evaluate a funds historical performance you can look at the total percentage change in value the average annual percentage change or the growth of a hypothetical  investment total return reflects the change in the value of an investment assuming reinvestment of the funds dividend income and capital gains the profits earned upon the sale of securities that have grown in value cumulative total returns periods ended november   past  past  life of year years fund fidelity emerging growth    fidelity emerging growth    including  sales charge russell registered trademark    midcap funds average   na cumulative total returns show the funds performance in percentage terms over a set period  in this case one year five years or since the fund started on december   for example if you had invested  in a fund that had a  return over the past year the value of your investment would be  you can compare the funds returns to the performance of the russell  index  an unmanaged index of  small capitalization stocks to measure how the funds performance stacked up against its peers you can compare it to the midcap funds average which reflects the performance of mutual funds with similar objectives tracked by lipper analytical services inc the past one year average represents a peer group of  mutual funds these benchmarks include reinvested dividends and capital gains if any and exclude the effect of sales charges average annual total returns periods ended november   past  past  life of year years fund fidelity emerging growth    fidelity emerging growth    including  sales charge russell     midcap funds average   na average annual total returns take the funds cumulative return and show you what would have happened if the fund had performed at a constant rate each year note lipper calculates average annual total returns by annualizing each funds total return then taking an arithmetic average this may produce a slightly different figure than that obtained by averaging the cumulative total returns and annualizing the result  over life of fund imahdr prasun shrcht    s emerging growth russell   rs

          imatrl prasun shrcht    r  over life of fund lets say hypothetically that  was invested in fidelity emerging growth fund on december   when the fund started and the current  sales charge was paid as the chart shows by november   the value of the investment would have grown to   a  increase on the initial investment for comparison look at how the russell  index did over the same period with dividends and capital gains if any reinvested the same  investment would have grown to   a  increase understanding performance how a fund did yesterday is no guarantee of how it will do tomorrow the stock market for example has a history of longterm growth and shortterm volatility in turn the share price and return of a fund that invests in stocks will vary that means if you sell your shares during a market downturn you might lose money but if you can ride out the markets ups and downs you may have a gain checkmark fund talk the managers overview market recap the  months that ended november   was a period that truly tested the us stock markets resolve but despite frequent shifts in sentiment an interestrate hike and global volatility concerns us stocks still managed to perform well the standard  poors  index  a broad gauge of the us stock market  returned  during the period well above the markets longterm annual average of around  in the first half of the period largecap stocks were responsible for much of the markets gain as investors were drawn to stocks with recognizable names and consistent earningsgrowth track records consequently stock prices soared and enthusiasm was high the federal reserve board  in an attempt to halt inflation before it appeared  raised a key shortterm interest rate by  in march the market paused briefly but then kept rolling as the dow jones industrial average reached the point mark for the first time ever in august with several multinational companies announcing earnings shortfalls in midaugust smallcap stocks came into favor among investors during august and september the russell  index  which measures smallcap stock performance  was up  while the sp was down  volatility in asian markets in late october sent skittish investors running for cover the dow slid  points in one day then snapped back the next reclaiming plus points sensing continued fallout from this volatility investors again became qualityconscious and largecaps regained their perch through november an interview with erin sullivan portfolio manager of fidelity emerging growth fund q how did the fund perform erin a for the  months that ended november   the fund had a total return of  during the same period the russell  index returned  and the midcap funds average tracked by lipper analytical services returned  q why did the fund underperform the index and its peer group a poor stock selection in the health care sector hurt performance especially since the fund was overweighted in that sector  relative to the index  during the period at the same time the funds underweighted position in the strongperforming energy sector also detracted from performance by definition this type of fund usually does not own many traditional energy stocks because many of them represent mature rather than emerginggrowth industries generally the fund invests in young fastgrowing small and midcapitalization companies that typically have high pricetoearnings multiples  meaning they trade at high valuations relative to their current earnings growth the reason behind these valuations is that investors are willing to pay more now for aboveaverage earnings growth in the future unfortunately these highmultiple stocks tend to suffer larger corrections when other stocks in their industry report disappointing earnings or during periods of economic uncertainty such as the one we saw at the end of the period q which individual holdings helped performance a the strongest contributors were personal computer pc manufacturers such as compaq computer and dell computer and pc retailers such as compusa strong pc demand drove revenue and earnings growth for these companies and in turn boosted their share prices also in the technology sector nokia a finnish telecommunications company benefited from strong demand for handsets and other cellular communications equipment i sold the funds stakes in compaq and dell by the end of the period to reap the profits from their shareprice appreciation in addition some retail stocks benefited from consolidation in this industry for example consolidated stores recently announced that it would acquire macfrugals bargains these mergers should provide opportunities for buying synergies and cost cutting q which holdings hurt performance a oxford healths stock plummeted  in one day after the company announced that an accounting error had caused it to severely misstate its quarterly earnings needless to say holding the stock during that period hurt the fund usa waste a wastemanagement company also was a detractor although the company reported ontarget earnings during the period its stock was battered by concerns about other players in the industry that faced accounting or management problems in addition ascend communications a networking company suffered from weakerthanexpected industry demand and product transition difficulties q the fund reduced its position in the technology sector to about  at the end of the period from about  on may  why did you make such a dramatic shift a i significantly reduced the funds position in technology over the last several weeks of the period due to concerns that weakness in asian economies would hurt demand for example the demand for networking infrastructure and cellular handsets was growing rapidly in asian countries however now that many of these regions are facing severe economic difficulties governments and companies probably will pull back spending on this kind of technology also as i mentioned before the fund took profits in some of the technology stocks that had appreciated considerably q whats your outlook a i think the economic difficulties in asia need to be watched closely particularly as a barometer for technology demand in the meantime i think applicationsoftware companies in the us should benefit as trends toward clientserver infrastructures continue and the demand for year  solutions increases in addition i expect consolidation through merger and acquisitions in the retail and health care sectors to continue overall i believe that the market valuations of many companies are high so any company or industry could be subject to a severe correction if earnings disappointments arise the views expressed in this report reflect those of the portfolio manager only through the end of the period of the report as stated on the cover the managers views are subject to change at any time based on market and other conditions steve wymer on international market volatility the economic crisis that enveloped the asiapacific region in october and november affected many us companies especially technology firms that sell locally in asia or export their products to that area due to its growth focus nature the fund has historically had considerable exposure to growthoriented technology companies at this point it seems like the environment for tech stocks is worse than companies are admitting when severe economic downturns occur it usually takes a while for companies to assess the real impact but my sense is that asias problems have had a harmful domino effect theres always a chance for rapid improvement but i dont see anything nearterm that indicates a turnaround right now nobody wants to touch asia with a foot pole what does all this mean for the fund one positive aspect of foreign market volatility is that it often creates buying opportunities stocks have become cheaper im going to keep a close eye on asia to see if any signs of stabilization crop up as with the latin american currency crisis in  us stocks with exposure to beaten down markets tend to rise quite quickly when improvement is visible fund facts goal to increase the value of the funds

corporation is a bank  annual report chairman’s message photograph of edward c johnson ddear shareholder during the past year or so much has been reported about the mutual fund industry and much of it has been more critical than i believe is warranted allegations that some companies have been less than forthright with their shareholders have cast a shadow on the entire industry i continue to find these reports disturbing and assert that they do not create an accurate picture of the industry overall therefore i would like to remind every one where fidelity stands on these issues i will say two things specifically regarding allegations that some mutual fund companies were in violation of the securities and exchange commission’s forward pricing rules or were involved in so called “market timing” activities first fidelity has no agreements that permit customers who buy fund shares after  pm to obtain the  pm price this is not a new policy this is not to say that some one could not deceive the company through fraudulent acts however we are extremely diligent in preventing fraud from occurring in this manner and in every other but i underscore again that fidelity has no so called “agreements” that sanction illegal practices second fidelity continues to stand on record as we have for years in opposition to predatory short term trading that adversely affects shareholders in a mutual fund back in the s we initiated a fee which is returned to the fund and therefore to investors to discourage this activity further we took the lead several years ago in developing a fair value pricing policy to prevent market timing on foreign securities in our funds i am confident we will find other ways to make it more difficult for predatory traders to operate however this will only be achieved through close cooperation among regulators legislators and the industry yes there have been unfortunate instances of unethical and illegal activity within the mutual fund industry from time to time that is true of any industry when this occurs confessed or convicted offenders should be dealt with appropriately but we are still concerned about the risk of over regulation and the quick application of simplistic solutions to intricate problems every system can be improved and we support and applaud well thought out improvements by regulators legislators and industry representatives that achieve the common goal of building and protecting the value of investors’ holdings for nearly  years fidelity has worked very hard to improve its products and service to justify your trust when our family founded this company in  we had only a few hundred customers today we serve more than  million customers including individual investors and participants in retirement plans across america let me close by saying that we do not take your trust in us for granted and we realize that we must always work to improve all aspects of our service to you in turn we urge you to continue your active participation with your financial matters so that your interests can be well served best regards s edward c johnson dedward c johnson d annual report  performance the bottom line average annual total return reflects the change in the value of an investment assuming reinvestment of the fund’s dividend income and capital gains the profits earned upon the sale of securities that have grown in value and assuming a constant rate of perfor mance each year the  table and the fund’s returns do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares during periods of reimbursement by fidelity a fund’s total return will be greater than it would be had the reimbursement not occurred how a fund did yesterday is no guarantee of how it

since  for the  months ending november   the fund returned  well behind the  return of the russell midcap® growth index and the  gain of the lippersm mid cap funds average most of the underperformance versus the index occurred during the first half of the period when several holdings in the pharmaceuticals and biotechnol ogy group particularly biogen idec and ireland based elan suffered steep

numerous factors may not be relied on as an indication of trading intent on behalf of any fidelity fund annual report   shareholder expense example as a shareholder of the fund you incur two types of costs  transaction costs including redemption fees and  ongoing costs including management fees and other fund ex penses this example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs in dollars of investing in the fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds the example is based on an investment of  invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period june   to november   actual expenses the first line of the table below provides information about actual account values and actual expenses you may use the information in this line together with the amount you invested to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period simply divide your account value by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number in the first line under the heading entitled “expenses paid during period” to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period a small balance maintenance fee of  that is charged once a year may apply for certain accounts with a value of less than  this fee is not included in the table below if it was the estimate of expenses you paid during the period would be higher and your ending account value lower by this amount hypothetical example for comparison purposes the second line of the table below provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the fund’s actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of  per year before expenses which is not the fund’s actual return the hypotheti cal account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period you may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the fund and other funds to do so compare this  hypotheti cal example with the  hypothetical examples that appear in the shareholder reports of the other funds a small balance maintenance fee of  that is charged once a year may apply for certain accounts with a value of less than  this fee is not included in the table below if it was the estimate of expenses you paid during the period would be higher and your ending account value lower by this amount please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transaction costs therefore the second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help you determine the relative total costs of owning different funds in addition if these transactional costs were included your costs

a fund of fidelity mt vernon street trust the trust and is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares the trust is regis tered under the investment company act of  as amended the  act as an open end management investment company organized as a massachusetts business trust the fund may invest in affiliated money market central funds money market central funds which are open end investment companies available to investment companies and other accounts managed by fidelity management  research company fmr and its affiliates the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require management to make certain estimates and assumptions at the date of the financial statements the following summarizes the significant accounting policies of the fund security valuation investments are valued and net asset value nav per share is calculated nav calculation as of the close of business of the new york stock exchange nyse normally  pm eastern time wherever possible the fund uses independent pricing services approved by the board of trustees to value its investments equity securities including restricted securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded in the event there were no sales during the day or closing prices are not available securities are valued at the last quoted bid price investments in open end mutual funds are valued at their closing net asset value each business day short term securities with remaining maturities of sixty days or less for which quotations are not readily available are valued at amortized cost which approximates value when current market prices or quotations are not readily available or do not accurately reflect fair value valuations may be determined in accordance with procedures adopted by the board of trustees for example when developments occur between the close of a market and the close of the nyse that may materially affect the value of some or all of the securities or when trading in a security is halted those securities may be fair valued factors used in the determination of fair value may include monitoring news to identify significant market or security specific events such as changes in the value of us securi ties market reviewing developments in foreign markets and evaluating the performance of adrs futures contracts and exchange traded funds because the fund’s utilization of fair value pricing depends on market activity the frequency with which fair value pricing is used can not be predicted and may be utilized to a significant extent the value of securities used for nav calculation under fair value pricing may differ from published prices for the same securities annual report   significant accounting policies continued foreign currency the fund uses foreign currency contracts to facilitate transactions in foreign denominated securities losses from these transactions may arise from changes in the value of the foreign currency or if the counterparties do not perform under the contracts’ terms foreign denominated assets including investment securities and liabilities are trans lated into us dollars at the exchange rate at period end purchases and sales of invest ment securities income and dividends received and expenses denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate in effect on the transac tion date the effects of exchange rate fluctuations on investments are included with the net realized and unrealized gain loss on investment securities other foreign currency transactions resulting in realized and unrealized gain loss are disclosed separately investment transactions and income security transactions are accounted for as of trade date gains and losses on securities sold are determined on the basis of identified cost and may include proceeds received from litigation dividend income is recorded on the ex dividend date except for certain dividends from foreign securities where the ex dividend date may have passed which are recorded as soon as the fund is informed of the ex dividend date non cash dividends included in dividend income if any are recorded at the fair market value of the securities received distributions received on securities that represent a return of capital or capital gain are recorded as a reduction of cost of investments andor as a realized gain the fund estimates the components of distributions received that may be considered return of capital distributions or capital gain distributions large non recurring dividends recognized by the fund are presented separately on the statement of operations as “special dividends” and the impact of these dividends is presented in the financial highlights interest income is accrued as earned interest income includes coupon interest and amortization of premium and accretion of discount on debt securities investment income is recorded net of foreign taxes withheld where recovery of such taxes is uncertain expenses most expenses of the trust can be directly attributed to a fund expenses which cannot be directly attributed are apportioned among each fund in the trust deferred trustee compensation under a deferred compensation plan the plan independent trustees must defer receipt of a portion of and may elect to defer receipt of an additional portion of their annual compensation deferred amounts are treated as though equivalent dollar amounts had been invested in shares of the fund or are invested in a cross

company by distributing all of its taxable income and realized gains under subchapter m of the internal revenue code as a result no provision for income taxes is required in the accompanying financial statements foreign taxes are provided for based on the fund’s understanding of the tax rules and rates that exist in the foreign markets in which it invests distributions are recorded on the ex dividend date income and capital gain distribu tions are determined in accordance with income tax regulations which may differ from generally accepted accounting principles capital accounts within the financial statements are adjusted for permanent book tax differences these adjustments have no impact on net assets or the results of operations temporary book tax differences will reverse in a

resources dedicated to investment management and support services the board reviewed the size education and experience of the investment advisers’ invest ment staff their use of technology and the investment advisers’ approach to recruiting training and retaining portfolio managers and other research advisory and manage ment personnel the board considered fidelity’s extensive global research capabilities that enable the investment advisers to aggregate data from various sources in an effort to produce positive investment results the board noted that fidelity’s analysts have access to a variety of technological tools that enable them to perform both fundamental and quantitative analysis and to specialize in various disciplines the board also considered that fidelity’s portfolio managers and analysts have access to daily portfolio attribution that allows for monitoring of a fund’s portfolio as well as an electronic communication system that provides immediate real time access

services performed by the investment advisers and their affiliates under the advisory contracts and under separate agreements covering transfer agency pricing and bookkeeping and securities lending services for the fund the board also considered the nature and extent of the investment advisers’ supervision of third party service providers principally custodians and subcustodians the board reviewed the allocation of fund brokerage including allocations to brokers affiliated with the investment advisers the use of brokerage commissions to pay fund expenses and the use of “soft” commission dollars to pay for research services the board also considered that fidelity voluntarily decided in  to stop using “soft” commission dollars to pay for market data and instead to pay for that data out of its own resources the board also considered the resources devoted to and the record of compliance with the fund’s compliance policies and procedures the board noted that the growth of fund assets across the complex allows fidelity to reinvest in the development of services designed to enhance the value or convenience of the fidelity funds as investment vehicles these services include  hour access to annual report  account information and market information through phone representatives and over the internet and investor education materials and asset allocation tools investment in a large fund family the board considered the benefits to shareholders of investing in a fidelity fund including the benefits of investing in a fund that is part of a large family of funds offering a variety of investment disciplines and providing for a large variety of mutual fund investor services for example fund shareholders are offered the privilege of exchanging shares of the fund for shares of other fidelity funds as set forth in the fund’s prospectus without paying a sales charge the board noted that since the last advisory contract renewals in july  fidelity has taken a number of actions that benefited particular funds including i voluntarily deciding in  to stop using “soft” commission dollars to pay for market data and instead to pay for that data out of its own resources ii contractually agreeing to impose management fee reductions and expense limitations on its five spartan stock index funds and its stock index fund available through variable insurance products iii contractually agreeing to eliminate the management fees on the fidelity freedom funds and the fidelity advisor freedom funds iv contractually agreeing to reduce the management fees on most of its investment grade taxable bond funds and v contractually agreeing to impose expense limitations on its retail and spartan investment grade taxable bond funds investment performance and compliance the board considered whether the fund has operated within its investment objective as well as its record of compliance with its investment restrictions it also reviewed the fund’s absolute investment performance as well as the fund’s relative investment performance measured against i a broad based securities market index and ii a peer group of mutual funds deemed appropriate by the board over multiple periods the following charts considered by the board show over the one  three  and five year periods ended december   the fund’s returns the returns of a broad based securities market index “benchmark” and a range of returns of a peer group of mutual funds identified by lipper inc as having an investment objec tive similar to that of the fund the box within each chart shows the th percentile return bottom of box and the th percentile return top of box of the lipper peer group returns shown above the box are in the first quartile and returns shown below the box are in the fourth quartile the percentage beaten number noted below each chart corresponds to the percentile box and represents the percentage of funds in the lipper peer group whose performance was equal to or lower than that of the fund  annual report board approval of investment advisory contracts and management fees continued the board reviewed the fund’s relative investment performance against its lipper peer group and stated that the performance of the fund was in the fourth quartile for the one  three  and five year periods the board also stated that the relative investment perfor mance of the fund was lower than its benchmark over time the board discussed with fmr actions to be taken by fmr to improve the fund’s disappointing performance the board also considered that the fund’s management fee is subject to upward or downward adjustment depending upon whether and to what extent the fund’s invest ment performance for the performance period exceeds or is exceeded by the record over the same period of a board approved performance adjustment index the board realizes that the performance adjustment provides fmr with a strong economic incen tive to seek to achieve superior performance for the fund’s shareholders and helps to more closely align the interests of fmr and the fund’s shareholders the board has had thorough discussions with fmr throughout the year about the board’s and fmr’s concerns about equity research equity fund performance and compliance with internal policies governing gifts and entertainment fmr has taken steps that it believes will refocus and strengthen equity research and equity portfolio management and compliance the board noted with favor fmr’s recent reorganization of its senior management team and fmr’s plans to dedicate additional resources to investment research and participated in the process that led to those changes based on its review and giving particular weight to the nature and quality of the resources dedicated by the investment advisers to maintain and improve relative performance the board concluded that the nature extent and quality of the services provided by fidelity will benefit the fund’s shareholders particularly in light of the annual report  board’s view that the fund’s shareholders benefit from investing in a fund that is part of a large family of funds offering a variety of investment disciplines and services competitiveness of management fee and total fund expenses the board considered the fund’s management fee and total expenses compared to “mapped groups” of competitive funds and classes fidelity creates “mapped groups” by combining similar lipper investment objective categories that have comparable management fee charac teristics combining lipper investment objective categories aids the board’s manage ment fee and total expense comparisons by broadening the competitive group used for comparison and by reducing the number of universes to which various fidelity funds are compared the board considered two proprietary management fee comparisons for the  month periods shown in the chart below the group of lipper funds used by the board for management fee comparisons is referred to below as the “total mapped group” and for the reasons explained above is broader than the lipper peer group used by the board for performance comparisons the total mapped group comparison focuses on a fund’s standing relative to the total universe of comparable funds available to investors in terms of gross management fees before expense reimbursements or caps “tmg ” represents the percentage of funds in the total mapped group that had management fees that were lower than the fund’s for example a tmg  of  means that  of the funds in the total mapped group had higher management fees than the fund the “asset size peer group” aspg comparison focuses on a fund’s standing relative to non fidelity funds similar in size to the fund within the total mapped group the aspg represents at least  of the funds in the total mapped group with comparable asset size and management fee characteristics subject to a minimum of  funds or all funds in the total mapped group if fewer than  additional information such as the aspg quartile “quadrant” in which the fund’s management fee ranked and the impact of the fund’s performance adjustment is also included in the chart and considered by the board  annual report board approval of investment advisory contracts and management fees continued the board noted that the fund’s management fee ranked below the median of its total mapped group and below the median of its aspg for  the board also noted the effect of the fund’s negative performance adjustment on the fund’s management fee ranking based on its review the board concluded that the fund’s management fee was fair and reasonable in light of the services that the fund receives and the other factors considered in its review of the fund’s total expenses the board considered the fund’s management fee as well as other fund expenses such as transfer agent fees pricing and bookkeeping fees and custodial legal and audit fees the board also noted the effects of any waivers and reimbursements on fees and expenses as well as the fund’s negative performance adjustment as part of its review the board also considered current and historical total expenses of the fund compared to competitive fund median expenses the fund is compared to those funds and classes in the total mapped group used by the board for management fee comparisons that have a similar sales load structure the board noted that the fund’s total expenses ranked below its competitive median for  in its review of total expenses the board also considered fidelity fee structures and other information on clients that fmr and its affiliates service in other competitive markets such as other mutual funds advised or subadvised by fmr or its affiliates pension plan clients and other institutional clients annual report  based on its review the board concluded that the fund’s total expenses were reasonable in light of the services that the fund and its shareholders receive and the other factors considered costs of the services and profitability the board considered the revenues earned and the expenses incurred by fidelity in conducting the business of developing market ing distributing managing administering and servicing the fund and its shareholders the board also considered the level of fidelity’s profits in respect of all the fidelity funds on an annual basis fmr presents to the board fidelity’s profitability for the fund fidelity calculates the profitability for each fund as well as aggregate profitability for groups of fidelity funds and all fidelity funds using a series of detailed revenue and cost allocation methodologies which originate with the audited books and records of fidelity the audit committee of the board reviews any significant changes from the prior year’s methodologies pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc independent registered accounting firm and auditor to fidelity and certain fidelity funds has been engaged annually by the board as part of the board’s assessment of the results of fidelity’s profitability analysis pwc’s engagement includes the review and assessment of fidelity’s methodologies used in determining the revenues and expenses attributable to fidelity’s mutual fund business and completion of agreed upon procedures surrounding the mathematical accuracy of fund profitability and its conformity to allocation methodologies after considering pwc’s reports issued under the engagement and information provided by fidelity the board believes that while other allocation methods may also be reasonable fidelity’s profitabil ity methodologies are reasonable in all material respects the board has also reviewed fidelity’s non fund businesses and any fall out benefits related to the mutual fund business as well as cases where fidelity’s affiliates may benefit from or be related to the fund’s business in addition a special committee of the board reviewed services provided to fidelity by its affiliates and determined that the fees that fidelity paid for such services were reasonable the board considered the costs of the services provided by and the profits realized by fidelity in connection with the operation of the fund and determined that the amount of profit is a fair entrepreneurial profit for the management of the fund economies of scale the board considered whether there have been economies of scale in respect of the management of the fidelity funds whether the fidelity funds including the fund have appropriately benefited from any such economies of scale and whether there is potential for realization of any further economies of scale the board considered the extent to which the fund will benefit from economies of scale through increased services to the fund through waivers or reimbursements or through fee or  annual report board approval of investment advisory contracts and management fees continued expense reductions including reductions that occur through operation of the transfer agent agreement the transfer agent fee varies in part based on the number of accounts in the fund if the number of accounts decreases or the average account size increases the overall transfer agent fee rate decreases the board recognized that the fund’s management contract incorporates a “group fee” structure which provides for lower fee rates as total fund assets under fmr’s manage ment increase and for higher fee rates as total fund assets under fmr’s management decrease the board considered that the group fee is designed to deliver the benefits of economies of scale to fund shareholders when total fund assets increase even if assets of any particular fund are unchanged or have declined because some portion of fidelity’s costs are attributable to services provided to all fidelity funds and all funds benefit if those costs can be allocated among more assets the board concluded that given the group fee structure fund shareholders will achieve a certain level of economies of scale as assets under fmr’s management increase at the fund complex level regardless of whether fidelity achieves any such economies of scale the board further concluded that any potential economies of scale are being shared between fund shareholders and fidelity in an appropriate manner additional information requested by the board in order to develop fully the factual basis for consideration of the advisory contracts the board requested additional information regarding i equity fund transfer agency fees ii fidelity’s fund profitability methodology and the impact of various changes in the methodology over time iii benefits to shareholders from economies of scale iv composition and characteristics of various fund and industry data used in comparisons and v com pensation of portfolio managers and research analysts based on its evaluation of all of the conclusions noted above and after considering all material factors the board ultimately concluded that the existing advisory fee structures are fair and reasonable and that the fund’s existing advisory contracts should be renewed annual report  managing your investments fidelity offers several ways to

no bank guaranteeneither the fund nor fidelity distributors corporation is a bank  annual report chairman’s message photograph of edward c johnson ddear shareholder during the past year or so much has been reported about the mutual fund industry and much of it has been more critical than i believe is warranted allegations that some companies have been less than forthright with their shareholders have cast a shadow on the entire industry i continue to find these reports disturbing and assert that they do not create an accurate picture of the industry overall therefore i would like to remind every one where fidelity stands on these issues i will say two things specifically regarding allegations that some mutual fund companies were in violation of the securities and exchange commission’s forward pricing rules or were involved in so called “market timing” activities first fidelity has no agreements that permit customers who buy fund shares after  pm to obtain the  pm price this is not a new policy this is not to say that some one could not deceive the company through fraudulent acts however we are extremely diligent in preventing fraud from occurring in this manner and in every other but i underscore again that fidelity has no so called “agreements” that sanction illegal practices second fidelity continues to stand on record as we have for years in opposition to predatory short term trading that adversely affects shareholders in a mutual fund back in the s we initiated a fee which is returned to the fund and therefore to investors to discourage this activity further we took the lead several years ago in developing a fair value pricing policy to prevent market timing on foreign securities in our funds i am confident we will find other ways to make it more difficult for predatory traders to operate however this will only be achieved through close cooperation among regulators legislators and the industry yes there have been unfortunate instances of unethical and illegal activity within the mutual fund industry from time to time that is true of any industry when this occurs confessed or convicted offenders should be dealt with appropriately but we are still concerned about the risk of over regulation and the quick application of simplistic solutions to intricate problems every system can be improved and we support and applaud well thought out improvements by regulators legislators and industry representatives that achieve the common goal of building and protecting the value of investors’ holdings for nearly  years fidelity has worked very hard to improve its products and service to justify your trust when our family founded this company in  we had only a few hundred customers today we serve more than  million customers including individual investors and participants in retirement plans across america let me close by saying that we do not take your trust in us for granted and we realize that we must always work to improve all aspects of our service to you in turn we urge you to continue your active participation with your financial matters so that your interests can be well served best regards s edward c johnson dedward c johnson d annual report  performance the bottom line average annual total return reflects the change in the value of an investment assuming reinvestment of the fund’s dividend income and capital gains the profits earned upon the sale of securities that have grown in value and assuming a constant rate of perfor mance each year the  table and the fund’s returns do not reflect the deduction of taxes that a shareholder would pay on fund distributions or the redemption of fund shares during periods of reimbursement by fidelity a fund’s total return will be greater than it would be had the

the value of your investment would have changed and also shows how the russell ® growth index performed over the same period  annual report  management’s discussion of fund performance comments from steven wymer portfolio manager of fidelity® growth company fund numerous events unfolded during the  month period ending november   that were major influences on the us equity markets issues exerting downward pressure on stocks included higher levels of inflation eight short term interest rate hikes by the federal reserve board exorbitant energy prices and a category  hurricane that devas tated both the city of new orleans and several nearby oil production and refinery facilities grabbing most of the markets’ upbeat headlines was consistent strength in consumer spending corporate earnings and gross domestic product gdp when all was said and done investors demonstrated their conviction in the economy pushing stocks higher across the board by period end the standard  poor’s sm index the nasdaq composite® index and the dow jones industrial averagesm approached or exceeded four and a half year highs for the  months overall the sp ® was up  the nasdaq® rose  and the dow advanced  threatening to eclipse the  threshold for the first time since  fidelity growth company fund gained  for the  months ending november   outpacing both the russell ® growth index and the lippersm growth funds average which had returns of  and  respectively the fund had a large over weighting in the information technology sector which provided the biggest contribution by far led exclusively by favorable stock picking in the softwareservices and tech hardware equipment areas with such names as google the internet search engine open source tech nology leader red hat and apple computer among the top picks good security selection in health care also provided a boost led mainly by my choices in the pharmaceuticals and biotechnology group including such stocks as celgene and vertex pharmaceuticals overall results were somewhat tempered by a handful of inopportune stock picks most notably our investment in elan the irish biotech firm whose fortunes fell under the weight of a well publicized voluntary drug recall in early  in the tech space detractors included canada’s research in motion maker of the blackberry wireless messaging device and network appliance the data storage

fidelity or any other person in the fidelity organization any such views are subject to change at any time based upon market or other conditions and fidelity disclaims any responsibility to update such views these views may not be relied on as investment advice and because investment decisions for a fidelity fund are based on numerous factors may not be relied on as an indication of trading intent on behalf of any fidelity fund annual report   shareholder expense example as a shareholder of the fund you incur two types of costs  transaction costs and  ongoing costs including management fees and other fund expenses this example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs in dollars of investing in the fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds the example is based on an investment of  invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period june   to november   actual expenses the first line of the table below provides information about actual account values and actual expenses you may use the information in this line together with the amount you invested to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period simply divide your account value by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number in the first line under the heading entitled “expenses paid during period” to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period a small balance maintenance fee of  that is charged once a year may apply for certain accounts with a value of less than  this fee is not included in the table below if it was the estimate of expenses you paid during the period would be higher and your ending account value lower by this amount hypothetical example for comparison purposes the second line of the table below provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the fund’s actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of  per year before expenses which is not the fund’s actual return the hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period you may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the fund and other funds to do so compare this  hypothetical example with the  hypothetical examples that appear in the share holder reports of the other funds a small balance maintenance fee of  that is charged once a year may apply for certain accounts with a value of less than  this fee is not included in the table below if it was the estimate of expenses you paid during the period would be higher and your ending account value lower by this amount please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transaction costs therefore the second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help you determine the

fund of fidelity mt vernon street trust the trust and is authorized to issue an unlimited number of shares the trust is regis tered under the investment company act of  as amended the  act as an open end management investment company organized as a massachusetts business trust the fund may invest in affiliated money market central funds money market central funds which are open end investment companies available to investment companies and other accounts managed by fidelity management  research company fmr and its affiliates the financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require management to make certain estimates and assumptions at the date of the financial statements the following summarizes the significant accounting policies of the fund security valuation investments are valued and net asset value nav per share is calculated nav calculation as of the close of business of the new york stock exchange nyse normally  pm eastern time wherever possible the fund uses independent pricing services approved by the board of trustees to value its investments equity securities including restricted securities for which market quotations are readily available are valued at the last reported sale price or official closing price as reported by an independent pricing service on the primary market or exchange on which they are traded in the event there were no sales during the day or closing prices are not available securities are valued at the last quoted bid price investments in open end mutual funds are valued at their closing net asset value each business day short term securities with remaining maturities of sixty days or less for which quotations are not readily available are valued at amortized cost which approximates value when current market prices or quotations are not readily available or do not accurately reflect fair value valuations may be determined in accordance with procedures adopted by the board of trustees for example when developments occur between the close of a market and the close of the nyse that may materially affect the value of some or all of the securities or when trading in a security is halted those securities may be fair valued factors used in the determination of fair value may include monitoring news to identify significant market or security specific events such as changes in the value of us securi ties market reviewing developments in foreign markets and evaluating the performance of adrs futures contracts and exchange traded funds because the fund’s utilization of fair value pricing depends on market activity the frequency with which fair value pricing is used can not be predicted and may be utilized to a significant extent the value of securities used for nav calculation under fair value pricing may differ from published prices for the same securities annual report   significant accounting policies continued foreign currency the fund uses foreign currency contracts to facilitate transactions in foreign denominated securities losses from these transactions may arise from

structure provides appropriate incentives fidelity resources dedicated to investment management and support services the board reviewed the size education and experience of the investment advisers’ invest ment staff their use of technology and the investment advisers’ approach to recruiting training and retaining portfolio managers and other research advisory and manage ment personnel the board considered fidelity’s extensive global research capabilities that enable the investment advisers to aggregate data from various sources in an effort to produce positive investment results the board noted that fidelity’s analysts have access to a variety of technological tools that enable them to perform both fundamental and quantitative analysis and to specialize in various disciplines the board also considered that fidelity’s portfolio managers and analysts have access to daily portfolio attribution that allows for monitoring of a fund’s portfolio as well as an electronic communication system that provides immediate real time access to research concerning issuers and credit enhancers shareholder and administrative services the board considered the nature extent quality and cost of administrative distribution and shareholder services performed by the investment advisers and their affiliates under the advisory contracts and under separate agreements covering transfer agency pricing and bookkeeping and securities lending services for the fund the board also considered the nature and extent of the investment advisers’ supervision of third party service providers principally custodians and subcustodians the board reviewed the allocation of fund brokerage including allocations to brokers affiliated with the investment advisers the use of brokerage commissions to pay fund expenses and the use of “soft” commission dollars to pay for research services the board also considered that fidelity voluntarily decided in  to stop using “soft” commission dollars to pay for market data and instead to pay for that data out of its own resources the board also considered the resources devoted to and the record of compliance with the fund’s compliance policies and procedures the board noted that the growth of fund assets across the complex allows fidelity to reinvest in the development of services designed to enhance the value or convenience of the fidelity funds as investment vehicles these services include  hour access to  annual report board approval of investment advisory contracts and management fees continued account information and market information through phone representatives and over the internet and investor education materials and asset allocation tools investment in a large fund family the board considered the benefits to shareholders of investing in a fidelity fund including the benefits of investing in a fund that is part of a large family of funds offering a variety of investment disciplines and providing for a large variety of mutual fund investor services for example fund shareholders are offered the privilege of exchanging shares of the fund for shares of other fidelity funds as set forth in the fund’s prospectus without paying a sales charge the board noted that since the last advisory contract renewals in july  fidelity has taken a number of actions that benefited particular funds including i voluntarily deciding in  to stop using “soft” commission dollars to pay for market data and instead to pay for that data out of its own resources ii contractually agreeing to impose management fee reductions and expense limitations on its five spartan stock index funds and its stock index fund available through variable insurance products iii contractually agreeing to eliminate the management fees on the fidelity freedom funds and the fidelity advisor freedom funds iv contractually agreeing to reduce the management fees on most of its investment grade taxable bond funds and v contractually agreeing to impose expense limitations on its retail and spartan investment grade taxable bond funds investment performance and compliance the board considered whether the fund has operated within its investment objective as well as its record of compliance with its investment restrictions it also reviewed the fund’s absolute investment performance as well as the fund’s relative investment performance measured against i a broad based securities market index and ii a peer group of mutual funds deemed appropriate by the board over multiple periods the following charts considered by the board show over the one  three  and five year periods ended december   the fund’s returns the returns of a broad based securities market index “benchmark” and a range of returns of a peer group of mutual funds identified by lipper inc as having an investment objec tive similar to that of the fund the box within each chart shows the th percentile return bottom of box and the th percentile return top of box of the lipper peer group returns shown above the box are in the first quartile and returns shown below the box are in the fourth quartile the percentage beaten number noted below each chart corresponds to the percentile box and represents the percentage of funds in the lipper peer group whose performance was equal to or lower than that of the fund annual report  the board reviewed the fund’s relative investment performance against its lipper peer group and stated that the performance of the fund was in the second quartile for the one and three year periods and the third quartile for the five year period the board also stated that the relative investment performance of the fund has compared favorably to its benchmark over time the board also considered that the fund’s management fee is subject to upward or downward adjustment depending upon whether and to what extent the fund’s invest ment performance for the performance period exceeds or is exceeded by the record over the same period of a board approved performance adjustment index the board realizes that the performance adjustment provides fmr with a strong economic incen tive to seek to achieve superior performance for the fund’s shareholders and helps to more closely align the interests of fmr and the fund’s shareholders the board has had thorough discussions with fmr throughout the year about the board’s and fmr’s concerns about equity research equity fund performance and compliance with internal policies governing gifts and entertainment fmr has taken steps that it believes will refocus and strengthen equity research and equity portfolio management and compliance the board noted with favor fmr’s recent reorganization of its senior management team and fmr’s plans to dedicate additional resources to investment research and participated in the process that led to those changes based on its review and giving particular weight to the nature and quality of the resources dedicated by the investment advisers to maintain and improve relative performance the board concluded that the nature extent and quality of the services provided by fidelity will benefit the fund’s shareholders particularly in light of the  annual report board approval of investment advisory contracts and management fees continued board’s view that the fund’s shareholders benefit from investing in a fund that is part of a large family of funds offering a variety of investment disciplines and services competitiveness of management fee and total fund expenses the board considered the fund’s management fee and total expenses compared to “mapped groups” of competitive funds and classes fidelity creates “mapped groups” by combining similar lipper investment objective categories that have comparable management fee charac teristics combining lipper investment objective categories aids the board’s manage ment fee and total expense comparisons by broadening the competitive group used for comparison and by reducing the number of universes to which various fidelity funds are compared the board considered two proprietary management fee comparisons for the  month periods shown in the chart below the group of lipper funds used by the board for management fee comparisons is referred to below as the “total mapped group” and for the reasons explained above is broader than the lipper peer group used by the board for performance comparisons the total mapped group comparison focuses on a fund’s standing relative to the total universe of comparable funds available to investors in terms of gross management fees before expense reimbursements or caps “tmg ” represents the percentage of funds in the total mapped group that had management fees that were lower than the fund’s for example a tmg  of  means that  of the funds in the total mapped group had higher management fees than the fund the “asset size peer group” aspg comparison focuses on a fund’s standing relative to non fidelity funds similar in size to the fund within the total mapped group the aspg represents at least  of the funds in the total mapped group with comparable asset size and management fee characteristics subject to a minimum of  funds or all funds in the total mapped group if fewer than  additional information such as the aspg quartile “quadrant” in which the fund’s management fee ranked and the impact of the fund’s performance adjustment is also included in the chart and considered by the board annual report  the board noted that the fund’s management fee ranked below the median of its total mapped group and below the median of its aspg for  the board also noted the effect of the fund’s positive performance adjustment on the fund’s management fee ranking based on its review the board concluded that the fund’s management fee was fair and reasonable in light of the services that the fund receives and the other factors considered in its review of the fund’s total expenses the board considered the fund’s management fee as well as other fund expenses such as transfer agent fees pricing and bookkeeping fees and custodial legal and audit fees the board also noted the effects of any waivers and reimbursements on fees and expenses as well as the fund’s positive performance adjustment as part of its review the board also considered current and historical total expenses of the fund compared to competitive fund median expenses the fund is compared to those funds and classes in the total mapped group used by the board for management fee comparisons that have a similar sales load structure the board noted that the fund’s total expenses ranked below its competitive median for  in its review of total expenses the board also considered fidelity fee structures and other information on clients that fmr and its affiliates service in other competitive markets such as other mutual funds advised or subadvised by fmr or its affiliates pension plan clients and other institutional clients  annual report board approval of investment advisory contracts and management fees continued based on its review the board concluded that the fund’s total expenses were reasonable in light of the services that the fund and its shareholders receive and the other factors considered costs of the services and profitability the board considered the revenues earned and the expenses incurred by fidelity in conducting the business of developing market ing distributing managing administering and servicing the fund and its shareholders the board also considered the level of fidelity’s profits in respect of all the fidelity funds on an annual basis fmr presents to the board fidelity’s profitability for the fund fidelity calculates the profitability for each fund as well as aggregate profitability for groups of fidelity funds and all fidelity funds using a series of detailed revenue and cost allocation methodologies which originate with the audited books and records of fidelity the audit committee of the board reviews any significant changes from the prior year’s methodologies pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc independent registered accounting firm and auditor to fidelity and certain fidelity funds has been engaged annually by the board as part of the board’s assessment of the results of fidelity’s profitability analysis pwc’s engagement includes the review and assessment of fidelity’s methodologies used in determining the revenues and expenses attributable to fidelity’s mutual fund business and completion of agreed upon procedures surrounding the mathematical accuracy of fund profitability and its conformity to allocation methodologies after considering pwc’s reports issued under the engagement and information provided by fidelity the board believes that while other allocation methods may also be reasonable fidelity’s profitabil ity methodologies are reasonable in all material respects the board has also reviewed fidelity’s non fund businesses and any fall out benefits related to the mutual fund business as well as cases where fidelity’s affiliates may benefit from or be related to the fund’s business in addition a special committee of the board reviewed services provided to fidelity by its affiliates and determined that the fees that fidelity paid for such services were reasonable the board considered the costs of the services provided by and the profits realized by fidelity in connection with the operation of the fund and determined that the amount of profit is a fair entrepreneurial profit for the management of the fund economies of scale the board considered whether there have been economies of scale in respect of the management of the fidelity funds whether the fidelity funds including the fund have appropriately benefited from any such economies of scale and whether there is potential for realization of any further economies of scale the board considered the extent to which the fund will benefit from economies of scale through increased services to the fund through waivers or reimbursements or through fee or annual report  expense reductions including reductions that occur through operation of the transfer agent agreement the transfer agent fee varies in part based on the number of accounts in the fund if the number of accounts decreases or the average account size increases the overall transfer agent fee rate decreases the board recognized that the fund’s management contract incorporates a “group fee” structure which provides for lower fee rates as total fund assets under fmr’s manage ment increase and for higher fee rates as total fund assets under fmr’s management decrease the board considered that the group fee is designed to deliver the benefits of economies of scale to fund shareholders when total fund assets increase even if assets of any particular fund are unchanged or have declined because some portion of fidelity’s costs are attributable to services provided to all fidelity funds and all funds benefit if those costs can be allocated among more assets the board concluded that given the group fee structure fund shareholders will achieve a certain level of economies of scale as assets under fmr’s management increase at the fund complex level regardless of whether fidelity achieves any such economies of scale the board further concluded that any potential economies of scale are being shared between fund shareholders and fidelity in an appropriate manner additional information requested by the board in order to develop fully the factual basis for consideration of the advisory contracts the board requested additional information regarding i equity fund transfer agency fees ii fidelity’s fund profitability methodology and the impact of various changes in the methodology over time iii benefits to shareholders from economies of scale iv composition and characteristics of various fund and industry data used in comparisons and v com pensation of portfolio managers and research analysts based on its evaluation of all of the conclusions noted above and after considering all material factors the board ultimately concluded that the existing advisory fee structures are fair and reasonable and that the fund’s existing advisory contracts should be renewed  annual report managing your investments fidelity offers several ways to conveniently manage your personal

fidelity distributors corporation is a bank  annual report chairman’s message photograph of edward c johnson ddear shareholder during the past year or so much has been reported about the mutual fund industry and much of it has been more critical than i believe is warranted allegations that some companies have been less than forthright with their shareholders have cast a shadow on the entire industry i continue to find these reports disturbing and assert that they do not create an accurate picture of the industry overall therefore i would like to remind every one where fidelity stands on these issues i will say two things specifically regarding allegations that some mutual fund companies were in violation of the securities and exchange commission’s forward pricing rules or were involved in so called “market timing” activities first fidelity has no agreements that permit customers who buy fund shares after  pm to obtain the  pm price this is not a new policy this is not to say that some one could not deceive the company through fraudulent acts however we are extremely diligent in preventing fraud from occurring in this manner and in every other but i underscore again that fidelity has no so called “agreements” that sanction illegal practices second fidelity continues to stand on record as we have for years in opposition to predatory short term trading that adversely affects shareholders in a mutual fund back in the s we initiated a fee which is returned to the fund and therefore to investors to discourage this activity further we took the lead several years ago in developing a fair value pricing policy to prevent market timing on foreign securities in our funds i am confident we will find other ways to make it more difficult for predatory traders to operate however this will only be achieved through close cooperation among regulators legislators and the industry yes there have been unfortunate instances of unethical and illegal activity within the mutual fund industry from time to time that is true of any industry when this occurs confessed or convicted offenders should be dealt with appropriately but we are still concerned about the risk of over regulation and the quick application of simplistic solutions to intricate problems every system can be improved and we support and applaud well thought out improvements by regulators legislators and industry representatives that achieve the common goal of building and protecting the value of investors’ holdings for nearly  years fidelity has worked very hard to improve its products and service to justify your trust when our family founded this company in  we had only a few hundred customers today we serve more than  million customers including individual investors and participants in retirement plans across america let me close by saying that we do not take your trust in us for granted and we realize that we must always work to improve all aspects of our service to you in turn we urge you to continue your active participation with your financial matters so that your interests can be well served best regards s edward c johnson dedward c johnson d annual report

average which returned   astute stock picking drove the lion’s share of the fund’s outperformance versus the index with the biggest contributions coming from the industrials materials and energy sectors among the strongest contributors were such names as joy global the leading maker of coal mining machinery titanium metals the world’s largest producer of titanium and smith international an energy services provider the fund added significantly to its health care weighting during the period and benefited from such holdings in health care equipment and services as managed care provider pacificare health systems and prescription benefit manager express scripts conversely the fund lost ground due to unfavorable security selection in consumer durables and in technology hardware and equipment due to disappointing results from harman interna tional industries and avid technology respectively one unfortunate pick in materials potash corp of saskatchewan also dampened returns the

behalf of any fidelity fund annual report   shareholder expense example as a shareholder of the fund you incur two types of costs  transaction costs and  ongoing costs including management fees and other fund expenses this example is intended to help you understand your ongoing costs in dollars of investing in the fund and to compare these costs with the ongoing costs of investing in other mutual funds the example is based on an investment of  invested at the beginning of the period and held for the entire period june   to november   actual expenses the first line of the table below provides information about actual account values and actual expenses you may use the information in this line together with the amount you invested to estimate the expenses that you paid over the period simply divide your account value by  for example an  account value divided by    then multiply the result by the number in the first line under the heading entitled “expenses paid during period” to estimate the expenses you paid on your account during this period a small balance maintenance fee of  that is charged once a year may apply for certain accounts with a value of less than  this fee is not included in the table below if it was the estimate of expenses you paid during the period would be higher and your ending account value lower by this amount hypothetical example for comparison purposes the second line of the table below provides information about hypothetical account values and hypothetical expenses based on the fund’s actual expense ratio and an assumed rate of return of  per year before expenses which is not the fund’s actual return the hypothetical account values and expenses may not be used to estimate the actual ending account balance or expenses you paid for the period you may use this information to compare the ongoing costs of investing in the fund and other funds to do so compare this  hypothetical example with the  hypothetical examples that appear in the share holder reports of the other funds a small balance maintenance fee of  that is charged once a year may apply for certain accounts with a value of less than  this fee is not included in the table below if it was the estimate of expenses you paid during the period would be higher and your ending account value lower by this amount please note that the expenses shown in the table are meant to highlight your ongoing costs only and do not reflect any transaction costs therefore the second line of the table is useful in comparing ongoing costs only and will not help you determine the

fund the board assisted by the advice of fund counsel and independent trustees’ counsel requests and considers a broad range of information throughout the year the board meets regularly each month except august and takes into account throughout the year matters bearing on advisory contracts the board acting directly and through its separate committees considers at each of its meetings factors that are relevant to the annual renewal of the fund’s advisory contracts including the services and support provided to the fund and its shareholders by fidelity at the time of the renewal the board had  standing committees each composed of independent trustees with varying backgrounds to which the board has assigned specific subject matter responsibilities in order to enhance effective decision making by the board each committee has adopted a written charter outlining the structure and purposes of the committee one such com mittee the equity contract committee meets periodically during the first six months of each year and as necessary to consider matters specifically related to the annual renewal of advisory contracts the committee requests and receives information on and makes recommendations to the independent trustees concerning the approval and annual review of the advisory contracts at its july  meeting the board of trustees including the independent trustees unanimously determined to renew the advisory contracts for the fund in reaching its determination the board considered all factors it believed relevant including  the nature extent and quality of the services to be provided to the fund and its shareholders by fidelity including the investment performance of the fund  the competitiveness of the management fee and total expenses of the fund  the total costs of the services to be provided by and the profits to be realized by the investment adviser and its affiliates from the relationship with the fund  the extent to which economies of scale would be realized as the fund grows and  whether fee levels reflect these economies of scale if any for the benefit of fund shareholders in determining whether to renew the advisory contracts for the fund the board ulti mately reached a determination with the assistance of fund counsel and independent trustees’ counsel that the renewal of the advisory contracts and the compensation to be received by fidelity under the management contract is consistent with fidelity’s fidu ciary duty under applicable law in addition to evaluating the specific factors noted above the board in reaching its determination is aware that shareholders in the fund have a broad range of investment choices available to them including a wide choice among mutual funds offered by competitors to fidelity and that the fund’s shareholders with the opportunity to review and weigh the disclosure provided by the fund in its annual report  prospectus and other public disclosures have chosen to invest in this fund managed by fidelity nature extent and quality of services provided by fidelity the board consid ered staffing within the investment adviser fmr and the sub advisers together the investment advisers including the background of the fund’s portfolio manager and the fund’s investment objective and discipline the independent trustees also had discus sions with senior management of fidelity’s investment operations and investment groups the board considered the structure of the portfolio manager compensation program and whether this structure provides appropriate incentives fidelity resources dedicated to investment management and support services the board reviewed the size education and experience of the investment advisers’ invest ment staff their use of technology and the investment advisers’ approach to recruiting training and retaining portfolio managers and other research advisory and manage ment personnel the board considered fidelity’s extensive global research capabilities that enable the investment advisers to aggregate data from various sources in an effort to produce positive investment results the board noted that fidelity’s analysts have access to a variety of technological tools that enable them to perform both fundamental and quantitative analysis and to specialize in various disciplines the board also considered that fidelity’s portfolio managers and analysts have access to daily portfolio attribution that allows for monitoring of a fund’s portfolio as well as an electronic communication system that provides immediate real time access to research concerning issuers and credit enhancers shareholder and administrative services the board considered the nature extent quality and cost of administrative distribution and shareholder services performed by the investment advisers and their affiliates under the advisory contracts and under separate agreements covering transfer agency pricing and bookkeeping and securities lending services for the fund the board also considered the nature and extent of the investment advisers’ supervision of third party service providers principally custodians and subcustodians the board reviewed the allocation of fund brokerage including allocations to brokers affiliated with the investment advisers the use of brokerage commissions to pay fund expenses and the use of “soft” commission dollars to pay for research services the board also considered that fidelity voluntarily decided in  to stop using “soft” commission dollars to pay for market data and instead to pay for that data out of its own resources the board also considered the resources devoted to and the record of compliance with the fund’s compliance policies and procedures the board noted that the growth of fund assets across the complex allows fidelity to reinvest in the development of services designed to enhance the value or convenience of the fidelity funds as investment vehicles these services include  hour access to  annual report board approval of investment advisory contracts and management fees continued account information and market information through phone representatives and over the internet and investor education materials and asset allocation tools investment in a large fund family the board considered the benefits to shareholders of investing in a fidelity fund including the benefits of investing in a fund that is part of a large family of funds offering a variety of investment disciplines and providing for a large variety of mutual fund investor services for example fund shareholders are offered the privilege of exchanging shares of the fund for shares of other fidelity funds as set forth in the fund’s prospectus without paying a sales charge the board noted that since the last advisory contract renewals in july  fidelity has taken a number of actions that benefited particular funds including i voluntarily deciding in  to stop using “soft” commission dollars to pay for market data and instead to pay for that data out of its own resources ii contractually agreeing to impose management fee reductions and expense limitations on its five spartan stock index funds and its stock index fund available through variable insurance products iii contractually agreeing to eliminate the management fees on the fidelity freedom funds and the fidelity advisor freedom funds iv contractually agreeing to reduce the management fees on most of its investment grade taxable bond funds and v contractually agreeing to impose expense limitations on its retail and spartan investment grade taxable bond funds investment performance and compliance the board considered whether the fund has operated within its investment objective as well as its record of compliance with its investment restrictions it also reviewed the fund’s absolute investment performance as well as the fund’s relative investment performance measured against i a broad based securities market index and ii a peer group of mutual funds deemed appropriate by the board over multiple periods the following charts considered by the board show over the one  three  and five year periods ended december   the fund’s returns the returns of a broad based securities market index “benchmark” and a range of returns of a peer group of mutual funds identified by lipper inc as having an investment objec tive similar to that of the fund the box within each chart shows the th percentile return bottom of box and the th percentile return top of box of the lipper peer group returns shown above the box are in the first quartile and returns shown below the box are in the fourth quartile the percentage beaten number noted below each chart corresponds to the percentile box and represents the percentage of funds in the lipper peer group whose performance was equal to or lower than that of the fund annual report  the board reviewed the fund’s relative investment performance against its lipper peer group and stated that the performance of the fund was in the fourth quartile for the one year period and the second quartile for the three and five year periodsthe board also stated that the relative investment performance of the fund was lower than its benchmark for certain periods although the three year cumulative total return of the fund compared favorably to its benchmark the board also considered that the fund’s management fee is subject to upward or downward adjustment depending upon whether and to what extent the fund’s invest ment performance for the performance period exceeds or is exceeded by the record over the same period of a board approved performance adjustment index the board realizes that the performance adjustment provides fmr with a strong economic incen tive to seek to achieve superior performance for the fund’s shareholders and helps to more closely align the interests of fmr and the fund’s shareholders the board has had thorough discussions with fmr throughout the year about the board’s and fmr’s concerns about equity research equity fund performance and compliance with internal policies governing gifts and entertainment fmr has taken steps that it believes will refocus and strengthen equity research and equity portfolio management and compliance the board noted with favor fmr’s recent reorganization of its senior management team and fmr’s plans to dedicate additional resources to investment research and participated in the process that led to those changes based on its review and giving particular weight to the nature and quality of the resources dedicated by the investment advisers to maintain and improve relative performance the board concluded that the nature extent and quality of the services  annual report board approval of investment advisory contracts and management fees continued provided by fidelity will benefit the fund’s shareholders particularly in light of the board’s view that the fund’s shareholders benefit from investing in a fund that is part of a large family of funds offering a variety of investment disciplines and services competitiveness of management fee and total fund expenses the board considered the fund’s management fee and total expenses compared to “mapped groups” of competitive funds and classes fidelity creates “mapped groups” by combining similar lipper investment objective categories that have comparable management fee charac teristics combining lipper investment objective categories aids the board’s manage ment fee and total expense comparisons by broadening the competitive group used for comparison and by reducing the number of universes to which various fidelity funds are compared the board considered two proprietary management fee comparisons for the  month periods shown in the chart below the group of lipper funds used by the board for management fee comparisons is referred to below as the “total mapped group” and for the reasons explained above is broader than the lipper peer group used by the board for performance comparisons the total mapped group comparison focuses on a fund’s standing relative to the total universe of comparable funds available to investors in terms of gross management fees before expense reimbursements or caps “tmg ” represents the percentage of funds in the total mapped group that had management fees that were lower than the fund’s for example a tmg  of  means that  of the funds in the total mapped group had higher management fees than the fund the “asset size peer group” aspg comparison focuses on a fund’s standing relative to non fidelity funds similar in size to the fund within the total mapped group the aspg represents at least  of the funds in the total mapped group with comparable asset size and management fee characteristics subject to a minimum of  funds or all funds in the total mapped group if fewer than  additional information such as the aspg quartile “quadrant” in which the fund’s management fee ranked and the impact of the fund’s performance adjustment is also included in the chart and considered by the board annual report  the board noted that the fund’s management fee ranked below the median of its total mapped group and below the median of its aspg for  the board also noted the effect of the fund’s positive performance adjustment on the fund’s management fee ranking based on its review the board concluded that the fund’s management fee was fair and reasonable in light of the services that the fund receives and the other factors considered in its review of the fund’s total expenses the board considered the fund’s management fee as well as other fund expenses such as transfer agent fees pricing and bookkeeping fees and custodial legal and audit fees the board also noted the effects of any waivers and reimbursements on fees and expenses as well as the fund’s positive performance adjustment as part of its review the board also considered current and historical total expenses of the fund compared to competitive fund median expenses the fund is compared to those funds and classes in the total mapped group used by the board for management fee comparisons that have a similar sales load structure the board noted that the fund’s total expenses ranked below its competitive median for  in its review of total expenses the board also considered fidelity fee structures and other information on clients that fmr and its affiliates service in other competitive markets such as other mutual funds advised or subadvised by fmr or its affiliates pension plan clients and other institutional clients  annual report board approval of investment advisory contracts and management fees continued based on its review the board concluded that the fund’s total expenses were reasonable in light of the services that the fund and its shareholders receive and the other factors considered costs of the services and profitability the board considered the revenues earned and the expenses incurred by fidelity in conducting the business of developing market ing distributing managing administering and servicing the fund and its shareholders the board also considered the level of fidelity’s profits in respect of all the fidelity funds on an annual basis fmr presents to the board fidelity’s profitability for the fund fidelity calculates the profitability for each fund as well as aggregate profitability for groups of fidelity funds and all fidelity funds using a series of detailed revenue and cost allocation methodologies which originate with the audited books and records of fidelity the audit committee of the board reviews any significant changes from the prior year’s methodologies pricewaterhousecoopers llp pwc independent registered accounting firm and auditor to fidelity and certain fidelity funds has been engaged annually by the board as part of the board’s assessment of the results of fidelity’s profitability analysis pwc’s engagement includes the review and assessment of fidelity’s methodologies used in determining the revenues and expenses attributable to fidelity’s mutual fund business and completion of agreed upon procedures surrounding the mathematical accuracy of fund profitability and its conformity to allocation methodologies after considering pwc’s reports issued under the engagement and information provided by fidelity the board believes that while other allocation methods may also be reasonable fidelity’s profitabil ity methodologies are reasonable in all material respects the board has also reviewed fidelity’s non fund businesses and any fall out benefits related to the mutual fund business as well as cases where fidelity’s affiliates may benefit from or be related to the fund’s business in addition a special committee of the board reviewed services provided to fidelity by its affiliates and determined that the fees that fidelity paid for such services were reasonable the board considered the costs of the services provided by and the profits realized by fidelity in connection with the operation of the fund and determined that the amount of profit is a fair entrepreneurial profit for the management of the fund economies of scale the board considered whether there have been economies of scale in respect of the management of the fidelity funds whether the fidelity funds including the fund have appropriately benefited from any such economies of scale and whether there is potential for realization of any further economies of scale the board considered the extent to which the fund will benefit from economies of scale through increased services to the fund through waivers or reimbursements or through fee or annual report  expense reductions including reductions that occur through operation of the transfer agent agreement the transfer agent fee varies in part based on the number of accounts in the fund if the number of accounts decreases or the average account size increases the overall transfer agent fee rate decreases the board recognized that the fund’s management contract incorporates a “group fee” structure which provides for lower fee rates as total fund assets under fmr’s manage ment increase and for higher fee rates as total fund assets under fmr’s management decrease the board considered that the group fee is designed to deliver the benefits of economies of scale to fund shareholders when total fund assets increase even if assets of any particular fund are unchanged or have declined because some portion of fidelity’s costs are attributable to services provided to all fidelity funds and all funds benefit if those costs can be allocated among more assets the board also considered that although the fund is partially closed to new investors it continues to incur investment manage ment expenses and marketing and distribution expenses related to the retention of existing shareholders and assets the board further noted that the fund may continue to realize benefits from the group fee structure even though assets may not be expected to grow significantly at the fund level the board concluded that given the group fee structure fund shareholders will achieve a certain level of economies of scale as assets under fmr’s management increase at the fund complex level regardless of whether fidelity achieves any such economies of scale the board further concluded that any potential economies of scale are being shared between fund shareholders and fidelity in an appropriate manner additional information requested by the board in order to develop fully the factual basis for consideration of the advisory contracts the board requested additional information regarding i equity fund transfer agency fees ii fidelity’s fund profitability methodology and the impact of various changes in the methodology over time iii benefits to shareholders from economies of scale iv composition and characteristics of various fund and industry data used in comparisons v compensation of portfolio managers and research analysts and vi the impact of partially closing the fund to new investors based on its evaluation of all of the conclusions noted above and after considering all material factors the board ultimately concluded that the existing advisory fee structures are fair and reasonable and that the fund’s existing advisory contracts should be renewed  annual report managing your investments fidelity offers several ways to conveniently manage your personal investments via your telephone or pc you can
