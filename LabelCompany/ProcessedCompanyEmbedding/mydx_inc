white paper          featured in hbo – daily vice season  – episode  empowering an industry our ultimate goal is to empower the industry we do so by providing the easiesttouse and most reliable portable cannabis analyzer this gives manufacturers distributors regulators and consumers the information they need to make smarter decisions about their cannabis in doing so we hope to establish cannabis as a legitimate medicine as well as to help legitimize the industry as a whole we strive for scientific coherency accuracy and transparency know what you are growing optimize plant growth conditions increase your profits as result of a higher quality product know what you are buying and selling track usergenerated strain reviews promote your strains and attract new customers legitimize your product by printing labels test your cannabis on site and upon request know what you’re putting into your mind  body test the profile of your strains and track how it makes you feel find the best strain profiles that works for you know what is being made and consumed track production lots with “chemical fingerprint” print labels in real time total canna profile™ tcp™ cannabis contains over  compounds including cannabinoids flavonoids terpenes fatty acids and more all with potential medical uses these compounds work together to create an entourage effect – the total physiological effects resulting from a particular strain this entourage effect is a direct result of the chemical composition of the cannabis in question a total canna profile™ tcp is a more comprehensive view of the majority of the chemical components and therefore knowing the tcp and tracking the tcp effects allows users to more reliably predict the physiological impact of cannabis on their minds and bodies the mydx total canna profile™ tcp is a proprietary cannabis index based on a set of algorithms and associated data resulting from using the mydx handheld analyzer and mobile app the tcp is essentially a summary of the  cannabinoids and terpenes and other compounds detected by our sensor  it’s like a unique fingerprint  the tcp provides a user with the ability to find a cannabis strain that works for them and correlate it with a desired effect whether that be symptom relief or simply how it makes them feel personal profile – everyone reacts differently to cannabis and on top of that different cannabis strains can cause a myriad of different effects therefore questions such as “what cannabis strain is best” can only be answered from the perspective of the individual consuming it your cannabis experience relies on your own endocannabinoid system your mental state prior to consuming cannabis as well as the concentrations of natural compounds found in cannabis such as cannabinoids and terpenes the result is a complex and personalized experience that can be difficult to capture and classify mydx™ will allow you to do just that you can track and predict how a strain might make you feel and what symptoms it might help relieve in this way the mydx analyzer can help provide answers to the ageold questions “how will this sample make me feel” or “what symptoms will this sample help me relieve cannabinoids cannabinoids such as tetrahydrocannabinol thc and cannabidiol cbd are molecules that target receptors found throughout the body providing relief to an array of symptoms including pain nausea and inflammation the principal  cannabinoids found in cannabis are thc cbd and cannabinol cbn it is important to note that many other relevant cannabinoids such as thcv which has been reported as an appetite suppressant as compared to thc which is typically reported as an appetite stimulant are very much relevant and might be reflected in our tcp sensor response  however we do not at this time report a thcv values in our system as part of the tcp report summary of the principal cannabinoids terpenes terpenes are what give cannabis its amazingly complex taste and smell without terpenes cannabis would be very bland because thc and other cannabinoids have no distinguishable odor or taste alphapinene myrcene limonene and linalool may not roll off the tongue but their sensory descriptors like piney musky fruity tropical spicy floral and citrusy immediately conjure up memories of familiar tastes and aromas it’s then no surprise to learn that terpenes aren’t unique to cannabis – they can be found in everything from plants and herbs to fruits and spices terpenes are an important component to the overall cannabis experience not only influencing a strain’s taste and smell but also influencing its effects on the body summarized in the table below the total medicinal effect of all of the components in cannabis is referred to as the “entourage effect” this documented phenomenon is what distinguishes one strain from another and research shows it relies heavily on the physiological effects produced by terpenes summary of the five most common terpenes entourage effect sometimes you just find a strain that totally works for you it’s all about the right ratio of terpenes and cannabinoids and the entourage effects that ratio produces the result is a unique cannabis experience that essentially distinguishes the wide variety of strains and their chemotypes clearly the entourage effect should not be underestimated research shows that these synergistic effects lead to three to four times the medical efficacy meaning a full cannabis extract will be three to four times as effective as a thconly extract synergistic compounds also help mitigate some of the negative side effects of the primary constituents thc in this case summary of the entourage effect mydx welcome to cannabis  when all of these variables are analyzed in the context of the data contained within a tcp users experience a new way of consuming cannabis cannabis  wherein the user can directly track predict and record the effectiveness of a strain or tcp depending on their own specific needs essentially this is cannabis tailored to the users’ needs in order to help users get their desired cannabis experience mydx utilizes all of this information to relate cannabinoid and terpenes content into feelings and symptom relief the two tables below summarize these findings mydx leverages the data above a hippa compliant and secured crowdsourced database the resulting tcp and proprietary algorithms to relate the concentrations measured into how that strain might make users feel and what symptoms it can potentially relieve as the crowdsourced database grows so will mydx’s ability to relate tcps to users’ experiences similarly the more a user tests and tracks their experiences the better mydx will become at predicting the characteristics of future cannabis samples by finding similar tcps mydx allows users to more consistently find strains that deliver their desired effects key features of mydxcannadx mydx offers four main features to users the ability to analyze cannabis samples for a tcp to track how that tcp affected them to seek similar tcps to ones that worked for them and to get information on where to find those strains or tcps that delivered the experience they desire the app screenshots below highlight these features     mydx provides the entire cannabis industry with the tools and knowledge needed to truly get the most out of their cannabis we aim to bring manufacturers distributors consumers and regulators together under a common goal of transparency consistency and reliability  disclaimer it is important for consumers to
