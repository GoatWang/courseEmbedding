initially made controls for waterwheels first patent no  and then moved to hydro turbines in the s and s woodward began designing controls for diesel and other reciprocating engines and for industrial turbines also in the s woodward developed a governor for variablepitch aircraft propellers and when the united states militarys first turbinepowered aircraft successfully flew its ge engine had a woodward control starting in the s woodward began designing electronic controls first analog and then digital units contents  historical information  modern day company  references  woodward family

son elmer patented the first successful mechanical compensating governor for hydraulic turbines us patent no  in  the company became more diversified by expanding its product line to include diesel engine controls us patent no  and aircraft propeller governors british patent no  woodward governors followed the rapid advancement of diesel engine applications for railroads maritime and electrical generation in many fields the advent of gas turbine engines for aircraft and industrial uses offered still more opportunities for woodward designed fuel controls and of course the science of electronics has added impetus to this industry elmer e woodward conceived designed and developed the first successful propeller control in  this model pw propeller governor is on display at the

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
