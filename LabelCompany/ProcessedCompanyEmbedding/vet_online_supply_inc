next five reasons why we love mutts thursday july    pm estedt   july st is national mutt day but we think that mutts deserve our love every day unfortunately medium and largesized mutts represent the largest percentage of dogs that are euthanized which is a shame as mutts are great dogs to own if you own a mutt you already know how awesome these dogs can be but we wanted to take a second and let everyone else in on the secret   what is a mutt   a mutt is a mixed breed dog mutts come in all shapes and size they make up  of all dogs in shelters and they are more likely to go unadopted or become homeless than purebreds national mutt day takes place on two dates july st and december nd to raise awareness about mutts and encourage the general public to adopt them at local shelters   why should you adopt a mutt   there are many more reasons to adopt a mutt than five but we know you’re busy if you’re thinking about adopting a dog here are some great reasons why you should adopt a mutt   you will have a dog like no other no two mutts are the same mutts have unique fur colors and patterns and their features will vary if you want a dog that will turn heads and get compliments on walks or at the dog park adopting a mutt is the way to go   mutts are generally healthier mutts are made up from a diverse gene pool so they are less prone to specific diseases that affect certain breeds this means they are generally healthier and live longer   your mutt will be more flexible some purebreds have strong programming to be in a specific environment have a welldefined temperament and perform certain tasks mutts don’t have such strong programming so they are more likely to be cool with a variety of different environments making them the perfect housemate   you will pay less to adopt a mutt if costs are a concern mutts are the way to go you can adopt a mutt at a shelter for a few hundred dollars a purebred could cost hundreds or even thousands of dollars more   you will be saving a life as we mentioned mutts make up the majority of dogs in animal shelters when you adopt a mutt you are saving a life so we can think of no stronger reason to bring a mutt into your home   at vet supply source we have dog grooming supplies and more to keep your dog looking his or her best we also carry flea and tick prevention for dogs to ensure your dog stays healthy we guarantee that your mutt will appreciate it and he or she will give you back so much more in kisses we encourage you to learn more about national mutt day here   tags mutts dog grooming supplies flea and tick treatment for dogs comments  posted in all posts by webimax access five things you need before you adopt a shelter cat monday june    pm estedt   so you decided that now is the time to adopt a shelter cat we commend you on your decision – especially since june is national adopt a shelter cat month unfortunately far too many cats do not get adopted and shelters across the country are full national adopt a shelter cat is an awareness campaign where the public can get educated on adoption and the many benefits that come with it    however before you go to the shelter to pick up your furry friend we just wanted to take a second and talk about a few of the things you will need the first few days of cat ownership can be difficult for both you and the cat oftentimes cats will need some time to get used to their surroundings they may find a hiding spot and stay there for a while until they’re ready to come out and introduce themselves formally by preparing in advance you can make the transition much easier but what cat supplies should you buy beforehand here are a few musts that your cat will appreciate   a litter box or two the rule of thumb is to have a litter box for every cat you own plus an extra one so if this is your first cat you will need two you will need cat litter too clumping litter is preferable as it will neutralize any odors in addition to that nonclumping cat litter often contains silica which is a big nono for you and your cat   a scratching post cats need to scratch if they don’t have a scratching post they will use your furniture or carpet it is much cheaper to just buy a post rather than all new furniture   a cat carrier you will need a carrier to take your cat to the vet which is something you should do in the first week you adopt a cat also a cat carrier often serves as a good resting spot for your cat cats love small spaces   cat toys cats are predators which means they are always on the hunt since they are now indoors they will need something to do cat toys satisfy their instinctual hunting drive and they are also a way for your cat to get some exercise and mental stimulation   food the longterm health of your cat will largely be determined by what you feed him or her cats are carnivores which means they have different dietary needs than humans or even dogs your cat unfortunately can’t become a vegan ask your vet what food he or she would recommend and be sure to keep your cat on a regular feeding schedule and don’t get scared if your cat doesn’t want to eat for the first day or two it’s all part of the adjustment period  tags national adopt a shelter cat month cat supplies  comments  posted in all posts by webimax access why preventing fleas is so much easier than treating an infestation wednesday may    am estedt   the weather is getting warm which means flea prevention is all the more important if you own a dog if you haven’t treated your dog for fleas over the winter and have been lucky so far consider yourself just that –lucky  fleas enjoy this time of year as it’s not too warm yet but it is warm enough where there won’t be a freeze they typically fare best in moist cool places like your shrubs trees and leaf piles and guess where dogs like to sniff around and do their business   why it’s so hard to treat an infestation   fleas can jump onto your dog anytime your dog goes outside even if your dog only goes out for a minute to use the bathroom this is plenty of time for fleas to hop on board you can also bring fleas into the home as fleas can get on your socks or clothing if you head outdoors   once they come into your house fleas make themselves at home the typical flea can lay up to  eggs per day and those eggs may hatch in days weeks or months in fact  of the fleas in any given home are in the larval stage and may remain so for months if there is an infestation it is imperative that it is treated as quickly as possible as fleas can spread diseases to both pets and humans in many cases the household will have to call pest control to completely get rid of the problem which could be prohibitively expensive as well as frustrating   this is why we think it’s best that you pay attention to prevention so you don’t have to worry about treating an infestation first and foremost get flea treatment for your dogs so they are protected if fleas try to attach to them if you are unsure of which medication would work best you should consult your veterinarian to see what he or she thinks   in addition you should try to vacuum as much as possible as fleas are in cocoons in our carpeting bedding couches and linens vacuuming and cleaning these and other parts of your household could significantly reduce the amount of fleas in your home don’t forget to clean up the areas where your dog likes to hang out and sleep clean these spots often as fleas will tend to be found here in numbers as well  tags flea treatment for dogs flea prevention  comments  posted in all posts by webimax access five reasons to adopt a pet on national adopt a shelter pet day tuesday april    pm estedt   on april th shelters across the country will hopefully see lines out the door as it will be national adopt a shelter pet day at vet supply source we love our adopted furry friends and we hope many more find homes in the upcoming weeks obviously owning a pet comes with many responsibilities but if you have thought about it and think you’re ready you may want to consider adopting a pet here are a few reasons why we think it’s a great idea to adopt   you’ll save a life one of the main reasons why national adopt a shelter pet day was established was to create awareness about how overcrowded our shelters currently are did you know that more than  million cats and dogs are unfortunately euthanized every year due to overcrowded shelters this number could be reduced dramatically if more people decided to adopt   you’ll save money speaking of saving the cost of adopting a pet is usually much less than buying one from a store or breeder the adoption price will often cover many upfront costs including spayingneutering initial vaccines microchipping and more   you’ll feel better you won’t just feel better about saving a life you may feel better physically and emotionally too all pets but especially adopted pets give their new family unconditional love which in turn can lower stress levels and provide owners with a greater sense of purpose plus those walks every day will help you get off the couch more as well   you’ll be saved the troubles of housetraining this will depend on a number of factors but in many cases adoptable cats and dogs are already housetrained which will save you and your household the trouble   you’ll help more than one animal remember when we said that our shelters are overcrowded when you adopt a cat or a dog from a shelter you won’t just save the immediate life of the pet you decide to adopt you will also make room so another cat or dog can potentially get adopted too   what to do before you adopt   before you adopt it might be a good idea to plan ahead of time you will need dog grooming supplies toys food andor cat supplies a place your pet can call its own to eat and sleep a vet whom you like and more if you have other pets they will need to be introduced slowly to the new furry member of the household as well while it sometimes can some take time for the new dog or cat to get adjusted we’re sure he or she will get acclimated before you know it   tags national adopt a shelter pet day dog supplies cat supplies comments  posted in all posts by webimax access four tips for keeping your pets breath smelling fresh monday april    am estedt if you dont brush your teeth and floss youre going to hear it from your dentist regular brushing and flossing as well as avoiding added sugars and acidic foods is the best prescription for healthy teeth and gums when you skip maintenance or regular dentist visits this is when you run into trouble the same holds true for your pets if you notice that your pets breath is getting a little funkier of late you shouldnt ignore it bad breath isnt just an annoyance it could be a sign of a greater health condition in addition to that plaque and tartar buildup could potentially cause periodontal disease which is painful for your pet and can spread to other organs in your pets body so its time to get serious about your pets dental health and now is a perfect time february is national pet dental health month and what better way to celebrate than getting your pets breath under control if youre wondering where to start here are a few tips to keep in mind start slowly with the introduction to brushing unless you are the luckiest pet owner in the world your cat or dog is not going to welcome the toothbrush with open paws its going to be a slow process that will probably involve a lot of treats let them smell the brush and touch it and then reward them with a treat slowly get them comfortable to the point where you can brush their teeth for about thirty seconds on each side if they get scared or bite or claw you you might have to start again or try a different route purchase dental treats toys and food although these are not as effective as brushing they can help just be sure they are designed for oral health and have been certified by the veterinary oral health council use a dental rinse dental rinses are becoming increasingly popular for pets that have no interest in having their teeth brushed ask your veterinarian if this is an option speaking of that… take you pet to the vet for a dental exam your vet will review your pets history and examine the pet for any issues your vet will look for inflamed gums chipped teeth plaque and tartar and more  your vet will also check your pet for lumps and other symptoms to rule out cancer and other harmful conditions that could be affecting dental health he or she may also recommend a cleaning which although will require sedation may help your pet significantly in the long run are you looking for affordable pet supplies online for your pets dental health vet supply source has you covered find pet oral health

landlord or roommates to make it work for everyone involved can you afford to own a puppy owning a pet requires a significant financial commitment for fifteen years or even more there is the adoption fee but this is only the beginning your pup will need to go to the vet for shots wellness visits and when he or she gets sick your pup will need food toys and treats as well as potentially professional training and dog walking and grooming services while there are ways to find savings online for dog supplies you should budget beforehand to make sure you are able to afford the costs of puppydog ownership do you really want a puppy owning a puppy and later a dog requires more than just a financial commitment it requires significant time and availability as well your pup will need to

puppies they will take many factors into consideration when selecting an adoptive family and will turn people away if their lifestyle or home situation does not fall in line with the breed they are raising additionally responsible breeders dont sell multiple dog breeds they typically only specialize in one or two main breeds and they will demonstrate an extensive knowledge on that breeds history traits conformation and temperament on top of that they will allow you to visit their home so you can see the dogs living conditions they also have their dogs’ health evaluated frequently and make

records referral options and appointment scheduling the innovative design group exceptional support staff and client focused team at evetpractice are among the best in the business  audrey j wystrach dvmownerdoctor  zippivet pet hospitals  austin tx evetpractice is the best veterinary software available if you are looking for a software for your clinic stop looking and get evet not only is the program itself incredible online cloud based accessible from anywhere and with so many options available but the support is unreal these guys will literally do everything they can to help every single customer the software has made my practice so easy to run saved me tons of money and is so dependable the customer support is available with a live chat anytime you are having an issue and they bent over backwards for me to help me include french in the program and they would do the same for any clinic i can’t say enough good things about this software dr james drookerownerdoctor  clinique vétérinaire de pointe stcharles  montréal qc for someone that has been a veterinary hospital owner since  i came to the conclusion that i just had to suffer with less than adequate veterinary practice software until my business partner came across evetpractice late last year and boy am i glad he did i know for all practice owners and office managers changing practice software can be horrifying because we all hate change but that’s evetpractice’s strong suit – ease of changeover because of absolutely outstanding customer service our story is simple our software was crashing around us because our old vendor had not planned on the next imac update and we had to switch in  week yes  days and amazingly evetpractice made it happen – conversion of old data online training and the willingness to customize some reports that we simply couldn’t do without am i happy hell yes do i want to tell my competitors hell no but it is great software very flexible intuitive and easily customizable our record keeping is better but our doctors do go a little slower but our medical records are much better which saves us all time in the long run and since we’ve gone to emr we haven’t misplaced one file the integration of lab work into the medical records also makes client communication much easier and better and my doctors love using the software from home to follow cases i couldn’t be happier and would be pleased to answer any questions a prospective user of this software would have i’m on the dean’s advisory council at the oregon state university college of veterinary medicine and i’m recommend they switch to evetpractice – that’s how much i like it john maddiganowner manager  willamette valley animal hospital  keizersalem oregon with a practice with  separate locations – there is always “extra” worry when it comes time for a data conversion evet was very attentive to our concerns and made the transition as seamless as possible any issues that arose were small ones and were taken care of almost immediately as with any new system there is always a learning curve – and eddie and his team have shown the utmost in patience as we made good use of their live support system response time is really remarkable – and suggestions for customization are always meet with a positive and timely response the lab dashboard has really streamlined our communication with our clients regarding lab work and all communications are easily accessible via the “communication log” the ability to create our own templates for reminders emails documents and reports was really one of the strongest points for our choosing evet with a little coaching from the evet team we are creating custom forms for all aspects of our office – something that we were unable to do with our previous system because we are not a paperless office yet – there are some features of evet that are not as user friendly as they would be for a completely cloudbased emr office but i have no doubt that as we continue to work towards our goal of a paperless environment – evet and their excellent support staff will be there to make the transition as smooth as possible anne cadretteveterinary technicianoffice manager  the cat doctor of bedford and nashua  bedford ma and nashua nh evetpractice is by far much superior to any other veterinary software on the market in my opinion we have used a major brand software for our practice for five years before switching and i can tell you that the team at evet are years ahead of the competition evetpractice is a software for veterinarians that want to move forward with practice efficiency and electronic medical record keeping it is so easy to use anyone can use it with just a small amount of training i was extremely nervous about making a software change but the transition was very smooth and we really did not have any big issues the ever present chat box open on the screen allow for immediate help whenever a question is encountered if software changes need to be made they are willing to target those and make any suggested reasonable changes to make the software better i would not hesitate to change software to evetpractice if you want to move forward and take your veterinary practice to the highest level craig harrell dvmowner  singing river animal clinic  lucedale ms wonderful customer service–very responsive and helpful when we have a problem or mess things up program is very user friendly customizable and intuitive –the iphone equivalent of the veterinary practice software world lindsey petras dvmowner  grants mill animal hospital  irondale al i want to congratulate the folks at evetpractice for achieving what the competition has not been able to yet a reliable efficient intuitive and powerful software without the hassles of having servers or other major hardware our practice is run fully on laptops and tablets we couldn’t be happier with our choice especially because of the personalized quick and friendly support provided by the tech support staff amongst the many difficult decisions i have had to make when opening a new practice choosing evetpractice was spot on david carmona dvmowner  veterinary wellness center of surfside  surfside fl going with evetpractice has been a great decision for our practice this is an innovative reasonably priced software that we would definitely recommend to others we have never before dealt with such an amazing customer service staff they not only guided us through the transition but are now always ready to answer our questions they even listen to our suggestions and have made additions and changes to accommodate us where possible we see this as a long term relationship with a great company lisa crabillowner  haslet veterinary clinic  haslet tx evetpractice is working quite well for us we currently have two brick  mortar practices but chose evetpractice more so because of our other “practices” we hold mobile vaccination clinics around the state and the web based software is saving us from the constant syncing of equipment that we had to do with our previous software we have found evp to be much more attentive to our needs as a unique veterinary practice because we have crews working around the state simultaneously it creates situations for us that perhaps are not experienced by other clinics we are definitely happy with evetpractice and would certainly recommend it to others the support team has been the best we’ve ever worked with they have been incredible in their support and attentiveness to our wants and needs the software is improving constantly and they truly seem to be developing a system that will work well for our field i can also say that for those of us that have used multiple veterinary software programs over the years this one has been the easiest to learn even for our newer staff the learning curve was not nearly what we’ve experienced with other software russell bush dvm  mark a vara dvmvanguard veterinary associates  san antonio texas in retrospect switching to a new veterinary management software and going paperless and changing some procedures and straightening out all of our messy data in only  weeks was a bit insane the smart thing we did was to have evetpractice on site for training and go live although evetpractice could not be more different than idexx cornerstone it is also very logical our staff was amazing at picking up the new system and evet’s support was even better the data transfer was clean our downtime was only a half day because we wanted to do a full inventory and within  days we are all pros at the evet system the ease of use is evets strength it does not have the massive reporting module that cornerstone has but has had the reports that i need also evet is faster than cornerstone even though the servers it runs are  states away no more nightly reboots and end of day processing for us we are a single three doctor practice do not hesitate to give evetpractice a try if you are considering upgrading veterinary management systems jeff gorrowner  wausau animal hospital  wausau wi our animal hospital transitioned to evetpractice to take us “paperless” from traditional paper medical records and from intravet for practice management there was a steep learning curve for our staff and doctors to go from paper to paperless along with going from intravet to evetpractice for the invoicing and reporting fortunately the staff and owners at evetpractice have made the process as painless as possible whenever there is large amounts of data converted from one system to another there will be some hiccups but fortunately those were very few with our conversion and all issues were resolved very quickly and efficiently some strengths of evetpractice include the amazing flexibility of setup for your individual practice superresponsive customertechnical support access to records online anywhere and intuitive medical records every time we have asked for a specific functionality the answer has been affirmative and a solution has been created for our needs very quickly the cost of implementing evetpractice was quite affordable our biggest cost was upgrading our computers network and internet access to make sure that we didn’t have any issues getting online to have access to our cloudbased system weaknesses have been few – biggest from my point of view is the lack of “canned” reports that take only  or  mouseclicks to generate quickly and conveniently i would not let that deter anyone from giving evetpractice a try because the reporting is very flexible and you can pull out almost any information you are looking for it just may take a little longer than with some other systems that reporting functionality is the only reason to not give  stars overall overall we have been very pleased with our choice of evetpractice dan smith dvmowner  alburtis animal hospital  alburtis pa we converted from a  year old veterinary practice management software called avs it had  years of reminders codes and history we were concerned about the conversion but the evetpractice team made it seamless all of our data is intact the interface is extremely intuitive the customer service is unmatched when there have been issues we are constantly amazed at how fast they respond and update things we took a risk in going with a small cloud based company but we truly believe that this is the future i am even more convinced that evetpractice is the future dr tad moseleyanimal health center  valdosta georgia i have been using evetpractice for  months my favorite feature of the program is its accessibility overall the site is easy to learn how to use the customer service that this company provides is unbelievable it’s refreshing to know a company will still respond to your problems and needs as quickly as the team at evetpractice does however i do feel that some of the features could be more streamlined i’m hoping that tech support will eventually make a few of these bigger changes for me overall i am so happy i made the change it has made my practice more efficient and shows our clients a more professional image nancy powel dvmowner  maryland mobile veterinary clinic llc  westminster md opening a new animal hospital is a huge undertaking as you must consider every aspect not only involved with a new business but a medical practice as well eddie heinz with evet practice turned the task of choosing what software would be the best choice for our practice to a no brains decision the program is very user friendly but should you run into questions or problems eddie is readily available to assist he also has taken suggestions and requests for additions to the software that have had to enabled us to be more efficient within our practice kuddos to eddie heinz and evet practice we highly recommend them both dr shane henrykaty henryriver region animal hospital  crystal river florida evetpracticecom was a young company when i began my mobile veterinary practice and i can say that it has been wonderful to grow with them cloudbased software is a great solution for me i love that it is virtually paperless in so many areas including records emailing receipts  rabies certificates to owners having lab results delivered into my patients records sending referral information via email – again all beneficial for my mobile practice and my time and the software has evolved on a daily basis i have made requests and suggestions – many clients have done the same – and the software is updated and modified continually to enhance the offering and the ease of using the system you feel that it is being customized just for you and in many cases it is you will never find better customer service than you will experience with evetpracticecom i love the system and you will too dr susan haightmy pets mobile vet  alpharetta georgia will give customer service a  star  rating we liked this software for our practice initially because it was so complete versatile and matched our budget after speaking with them even before we bought a contract we asked about some features – and they changed features

conversion to evetpractice in december  after  years with cornerstone  i have been very pleased with all aspects including support of this cloudbased system for both my referral and primary care practices  the system can be easily customized to fit particular needs and there is a continual additions and improvements to the software based on the feedback from users rick wall dvm dacvsmr ccrpownerdoctor  animal clinics of the woodlands  the woodlands tx we are a modern convenient and customerfocused veterinary practice evetpractice allows us to be  paperless creative with our communication and technology focused we found the missing link we were looking for to increase our production while working with medical records referral options and appointment scheduling the innovative design group exceptional support staff and client focused team at evetpractice are among the best in the business  audrey j wystrach dvmownerdoctor  zippivet pet hospitals  austin tx evetpractice is the best veterinary software available if you are looking for a software for your clinic stop looking and get evet not only is the program itself incredible online cloud based accessible from anywhere and with so many options available but the support is unreal these guys will literally do everything they can to help every single customer the software has made my practice so easy to run saved me tons of money and is so dependable the customer support is available with a live chat anytime you are having an issue and they bent over backwards for me to help me include french in the program and they would do the same for any clinic i can’t say enough good things about this software dr james drookerownerdoctor  clinique vétérinaire de pointe stcharles  montréal qc for someone that has been a veterinary hospital owner since  i came to the conclusion that i just had to suffer with less than adequate veterinary practice software until my business partner came across evetpractice late last year and boy am i glad he did i know for all practice owners and office managers changing practice software can be horrifying because we all hate change but that’s evetpractice’s strong suit – ease of changeover because of absolutely outstanding customer service our story is simple our software was crashing around us because our old vendor had not planned on the next imac update and we had to switch in  week yes  days and amazingly evetpractice made it happen – conversion of old data online training and the willingness to customize some reports that we simply couldn’t do without am i happy hell yes do i want to tell my competitors hell no but it is great software very flexible intuitive and easily customizable our record keeping is better but our doctors do go a little slower but our medical records are much better which saves us all time in the long run and since we’ve gone to emr we haven’t misplaced one file the integration of lab work into the medical records also makes client communication much easier and better and my doctors love using the software from home to follow cases i couldn’t be happier and would be pleased to answer any questions a prospective user of this software would have i’m on the dean’s advisory council at the oregon state university college of veterinary medicine and i’m recommend they switch to evetpractice – that’s how much i like it john maddiganowner manager  willamette valley animal hospital  keizersalem oregon with a practice with  separate locations – there is always “extra” worry when it comes time for a data conversion evet was very attentive to our concerns and made the transition as seamless as possible any issues that arose were small ones and were taken care of almost immediately as with any new system there is always a learning curve – and eddie and his team have shown the utmost in patience as we made good use of their live support system response time is really remarkable – and suggestions for customization are always meet with a positive and timely response the lab dashboard has really streamlined our communication with our clients regarding lab work and all communications are easily accessible via the “communication log” the ability to create our own templates for reminders emails documents and reports was really one of the strongest points for our choosing evet with a little coaching from the evet team we are creating custom forms for all aspects of our office – something that we were unable to do with our previous system because we are not a paperless office yet – there are some features of evet that are not as user friendly as they would be for a completely cloudbased emr office but i have no doubt that as we continue to work towards our goal of a paperless environment – evet and their excellent support staff will be there to make the transition as smooth as possible anne cadretteveterinary technicianoffice manager  the cat doctor of bedford and nashua  bedford ma and nashua nh evetpractice is by far much superior to any other veterinary software on the market in my opinion we have used a major brand software for our practice for five years before switching and i can tell you that the team at evet are years ahead of the competition evetpractice is a software for veterinarians that want to move forward with practice efficiency and electronic medical record keeping it is so easy to use anyone can use it with just a small amount of training i was extremely nervous about making a software change but the transition was very smooth and we really did not have any big issues the ever present chat box open on the screen allow for immediate help whenever a question is encountered if software changes need to be made they are willing to target those and make any suggested reasonable changes to make the software better i would not hesitate to change software to evetpractice if you want to move forward and take your veterinary practice to the highest level craig harrell dvmowner  singing river animal clinic  lucedale ms wonderful customer service–very responsive and helpful when we have a problem or mess things up program is very user friendly customizable and intuitive –the iphone equivalent of the veterinary practice software world lindsey petras dvmowner  grants mill animal hospital  irondale al i want to congratulate the folks at evetpractice for achieving what the competition has not been able to yet a reliable efficient intuitive and powerful software without the hassles of having servers or other major hardware our practice is run fully on laptops and tablets we couldn’t be happier with our choice especially because of the personalized quick and friendly support provided by the tech support staff amongst the many difficult decisions i have had to make when opening a new practice choosing evetpractice was spot on david carmona dvmowner  veterinary wellness center of surfside  surfside fl going with evetpractice has been a great decision for our practice this is an innovative reasonably priced software that we would definitely recommend to others we have never before dealt with such an amazing customer service staff they not only guided us through the transition but are now always ready to answer our questions they even listen to our suggestions and have made additions and changes to accommodate us where possible we see this as a long term relationship with a great company lisa crabillowner  haslet veterinary clinic  haslet tx evetpractice is working quite well for us we currently have two brick  mortar practices but chose evetpractice more so because of our other “practices” we hold mobile vaccination clinics around the state and the web based software is saving us from the constant syncing of equipment that we had to do with our previous software we have found evp to be much more attentive to our needs as a unique veterinary practice because we have crews working around the state simultaneously it creates situations for us that perhaps are not experienced by other clinics we are definitely happy with evetpractice and would certainly recommend it to others the support team has been the best we’ve ever worked with they have been incredible in their support and attentiveness to our wants and needs the software is improving constantly and they truly seem to be developing a system that will work well for our field i can also say that for those of us that have used multiple veterinary software programs over the years this one has been the easiest to learn even for our newer staff the learning curve was not nearly what we’ve experienced with other software russell bush dvm  mark a vara dvmvanguard veterinary associates  san antonio texas in retrospect switching to a new veterinary management software and going paperless and changing some procedures and straightening out all of our messy data in only  weeks was a bit insane the smart thing we did was to have evetpractice on site for training and go live although evetpractice could not be more different than idexx cornerstone it is also very logical our staff was amazing at picking up the new system and evet’s support was even better the data transfer was clean our downtime was only a half day because we wanted to do a full inventory and within  days we are all pros at the evet system the ease of use is evets strength it does not have the massive reporting module that cornerstone has but has had the reports that i need also evet is faster than cornerstone even though the servers it runs are  states away no more nightly reboots and end of day processing for us we are a single three doctor practice do not hesitate to give evetpractice a try if you are considering upgrading veterinary management systems jeff gorrowner  wausau animal hospital  wausau wi our animal hospital transitioned to evetpractice to take us “paperless” from traditional paper medical records and from intravet for practice management there was a steep learning curve for our staff and doctors to go from paper to paperless along with going from intravet to evetpractice for the invoicing and reporting fortunately the staff and owners at evetpractice have made the process as painless as possible whenever there is large amounts of data converted from one system to another there will be some hiccups but fortunately those were very few with our conversion and all issues were resolved very quickly and efficiently some strengths of evetpractice include the amazing flexibility of setup for your individual practice superresponsive customertechnical support access to records online anywhere and intuitive medical records every time we have asked for a specific functionality the answer has been affirmative and a solution has been created for our needs very quickly the cost of implementing evetpractice was quite affordable our biggest cost was upgrading our computers network and internet access to make sure that we didn’t have any issues getting online to have access to our cloudbased system weaknesses have been few – biggest from my point of view is the lack of “canned” reports that take only  or  mouseclicks to generate quickly and conveniently i would not let that deter anyone from giving evetpractice a try because the reporting is very flexible and you can pull out almost any information you are looking for it just may take a little longer than with some other systems that reporting functionality is the only reason to not give  stars overall overall we have been very pleased with our choice of evetpractice dan smith dvmowner  alburtis animal hospital  alburtis pa we converted from a  year old veterinary practice management software called avs it had  years of reminders codes and history we were concerned about the conversion but the evetpractice team made it seamless all of our data is intact the interface is extremely intuitive the customer service is unmatched when there have been issues we are constantly amazed at how fast they respond and update things we took a risk in going with a small cloud based company but we truly believe that this is the future i am even more convinced that evetpractice is the future dr tad moseleyanimal health center  valdosta georgia i have been using evetpractice for  months my favorite feature of the program is its accessibility overall the site is easy to learn how to use the customer service that this company provides is unbelievable it’s refreshing to know a company will still respond to your problems and needs as quickly as the team at evetpractice does however i do feel that some of the features could be more streamlined i’m hoping that tech support will eventually make a few of these bigger changes for me overall i am so happy i made the change it has made my practice more efficient and shows our clients a more professional image nancy powel dvmowner  maryland mobile veterinary clinic llc  westminster md opening a new animal hospital is a huge undertaking as you must consider every aspect not only involved with a new business but a medical practice as well eddie heinz with evet practice turned the task of choosing what software would be the best choice for our practice to a no brains decision the program is very user friendly but should you run into questions or problems eddie is readily available to assist he also has taken suggestions and requests for additions to the software that have had to enabled us to be more efficient within our practice kuddos to eddie heinz and evet practice we highly recommend them both dr shane henrykaty henryriver region animal hospital  crystal river florida evetpracticecom was a young company when i began my mobile veterinary practice and i can say that it has been wonderful to grow with them cloudbased software is a great solution for me i love that it is virtually paperless in so many areas including records emailing receipts  rabies certificates to owners having lab results delivered into my patients records sending referral information via email – again all beneficial for my mobile practice and my time and the software has evolved on a daily basis i have made requests and suggestions – many clients have done the same – and the software is updated and modified continually to enhance the offering and the ease of using the system you feel that it is being customized just for you and in many cases it is you will never find better customer service than you will experience with evetpracticecom i love the system and you will too dr susan haightmy pets mobile vet  alpharetta georgia will give customer service a  star  rating we liked this software for our practice initially because it was so complete versatile and matched our budget after speaking with them even before we bought a contract we asked about some features – and they changed features based on our suggestions since then the company engineers work around the clock it seems to help with our issues – mostly by inventing new items buttons windows and features to meet every suggestion or issue we have the customer service is by far outstanding once we got over a few operating bumps hardware configurations and understand the program now we feel like it is custom designed just for us we have considerably reduced operating costs in time and paper
