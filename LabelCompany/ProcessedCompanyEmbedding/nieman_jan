management and embrace it as a relevant and critical career path shouldn’t people in these roles be trained to have the storytelling ethical and legal mindset of a media professional”            new roles have emerged in journalism to support digital products that integrate data and engagement those with web and mobile development skills have been called upon to create special project sites mobile apps and interactive user experiences most creators of these media products haven’t been considered journalists and have largely been ignored in journalism research and curriculum these product management roles are often viewed as technologysupport not fundamental to the journalism being produced but these publicfacing products help develop new audiences and provide opportunities for participation contribution and interaction with the media the audiencecentric nature of these technology products makes them as much “journalism” as traditional stories and those who work on teams developing these products are often making editorial judgments and decisions in  media organizations and journalism schools will begin to comprehend and define product management and embrace it as a relevant and critical career path shouldn’t people in these roles be trained to have the storytelling ethical and legal mindset of a media professional what is the market for individuals with strong tech savvy and media sensibility how can we incorporate this mindset in journalism curriculum for example the simple decision of providing social sharing icons on one’s website requires someone who understands the specific functionality can decide which sites to represent knows what the user will be able to do on each site and can plan the organization’s interaction with the content analytics associated with this feature need to be gathered and comprehended and the role of this activity needs to be incorporated into the organization’s broader social media strategy here’s another example in developing datadriven news interactives decisions must be made as to how the application will be used how the user can customize the presentation and what data and content are to be presented these activities go much further than simply coding a website are these decisions always being made by individuals who understand journalistic mission and ethics or are news organizations often outsourcing these roles and hoping for the best it is evident by the proliferation of technology products presented by news organizations that the role of product management is being fulfilled but the specific elements of these roles are unclear and nebulously defined the combination of strategy leadership communication and technology will become a highly sought skillset in the next year media organizations will seek to better understand these emerging roles and consider the journalistic qualities that should be present in decisions associated with technology products particularly as related to the audience’s civic and democratic participation journalism educators should begin to include media product and engagement management topics in their courses and start thinking about curriculum change and faculty recruitment necessary to support the preparation for these roles cindy royal is an associate professor at the school of journalism and mass communication at texas state university dec

appropriately marketing directly to consumers and really selling subscriptions at full price” by laura hazard owen laurahazardowen jan    am jan    am new york magazine will be  years old next year and though in that time it’s suffered a couple bumps and bruises — its print edition went biweekly in  — it’s often come out stronger on the other side it got more honors than any other publication at the national magazine awards last year nymagcom pulled in  million monthly unique visitors in november a new record for the company and up  percent over the nonelectionyear  last april pamela wasserstein became new york’s ceo wasserstein who had led strategy at the publication and before that run corporate development at tribeca enterprises is the daughter of the late bruce wasserstein who bought new york for  million in  related articlenew york magazine turns a history of shopping recommendations into a new online revenue streamoctober  “the magazine has been on fire” wasserstein told me “i imagine that part of the reason that writers like rebecca traister and andrew sullivan and frank rich work with us is that it’s relatively unique to have the opportunity and flexibility to respond immediately to news to sit back for two days and think about something and then reach an audience or to spend a few months tooling around on something and have it be our cover story” wasserstein and i spoke about new york’s newly launched membership program its ecommerce initiatives and what’s coming in  our conversation edited for length and clarity is below laura hazard owen when you moved from head of strategy to ceo what did you identify as things to work on right away pamela wasserstein the strategist was one initiative early in  we started actively tapping and closely analyzing that kind of affiliatefocused service content branded content was another area that just makes so much sense for our brand in particular we’re doing a video project for guinness using our science of us brand that talks about the properties of liquid nitrogen jeopardy champion ken jennings worked on it with us it’s just kind of fun and educational in the spring we worked with ibm to highlight their partnership with marchesa the fashion brand for the met ball when marquesa designed a dress that was powered by ibm’s watson owen you also just launched a membership program for  a month or  a year in november wasserstein it’s an effort to serve primarily our new york citybased audience that turns to new york for discovery of what’s new what’s next what’s cool what’s insidery in the experience of living here it’s oriented toward unique experiences — either ones that we are creating ourselves or often ones that we’re curating and arranging for special access for members we have a couple hundred members it very very softlaunched in midnovember and it only got a homepage and some onsite promotion in december we initially promoted it just to friends and family and some percentage of email newsletter subscribers to start building up a test group we’re going to keep it pretty small and intimate at least for a few months to make sure we’re getting the programming mix right and then probably market it more broadly part of the value proposition is that there is a sense of community to it so we want to be careful about scaling it too quickly we’re trying to think about how we can provide unique value in creative ways adding little nuggets of value we have a private instagram account for members we did an ask the strategist thing where the strategist can solve your local shopping needs owen what’s your strategy for email newsletters are you thinking about doing original newsletter content wasserstein at the moment our newsletters are principally a curated set of links and easy digests of what’s in the news and you can either read the headlines and be in the know or hopefully go back and get the full story on our site we have experimented a little bit with more writtenthrough newsletters and i think in  you’ll continue to see us playing with some of those concepts i’m sure your experience is similar to mine where i get so many newsletters in the morning at this point — we just want to make sure that if we’re putting something out there it’s providing something different and filling a need i do think there are some more voicey news products that we might put out that could achieve that but there’s a high bar owen how are you thinking about the verticals how are you deciding which new ones to launch wasserstein this year we launched select all and the strategist they came about in different ways technology and the intersection of technology and culture the subject matter of select all has been an area of interest for a long time and technology had felt like a bit of a hole for us there’s also an endemic advertiser base there which is not everything but is a consideration initially we did it as a popup blog under a different name that was a sponsored thing and that gave us a chance to experiment a little bit and see what specifically in that content area was really resonating with our audience that content did seem to connect in a pretty compelling way so we came back two months later and formally launched it as a fullfledged site the strategist was a little bit different that was about bringing more service content and creating a home for the product curation that we were already doing organically across our verticals developing a destination for that kind of content owen which of your verticals is the largest in terms of traffic wasserstein vulture and the cut is really right next to it the cut has seen enormous traffic growth this year in particular this fall largely due to political and news content which is pretty exciting they have a wonderful authority in politics while also having a distinctly female outlook and given the state of politics and culture today i think that that’s a really important perspective that there are many people hungry for so looking toward  that space is going to be an area that we’ll be investing in and focused on — both digitally and probably with live events as well actually just around news and politics it’s been a pretty stellar year audiencewise in november we hit nearly  million on comscore across all our verticals that was up  percent from the previous year owen how are you thinking about the print magazine these days you said recently that digital would make up around  percent of total ad sales in  wasserstein yeah it’s about  on the magazine side the revenue mix is moving more toward the consumer base — we have a pretty strong ad base as well but we’re making sure that we’re appropriately marketing directly to consumers and really selling subscriptions at full price the magazine has been on fire it was just named magazine of the year by adweek not to put words in their mouths but i imagine that part of the reason that writers like rebecca traister and andrew sullivan and frank rich work with us is that it’s relatively unique to have the opportunity and flexibility to respond immediately to news to sit back for two days and think about something and then reach an audience or to spend a few months tooling around on something and have it be our cover story having all those channels is important for our talent and for our audiences and for our stature in the cultural ecosystem owen do you ever think about putting some of the magazine content like the features behind a paywall wasserstein of course over the years we’ve thought about paywalls but we only publish the print magazine every other week if there are three or four features in an issue so six to eight in a month taking only features behind a metered paywall would probably be tough our features are often some of our biggest digital audience drivers there’s continuing to be innovation in payment for digital content and it’s something we watch but we don’t have an immediate plan for it owen you have two podcasts right now sex lives and vulture tv it seems as if there might be room for expansion wasserstein frankly we probably haven’t been as focused on developing a full deep lineup of podcasts as others but there are potentially more podcasts in the works in part guided by the interests of our writers and editors which is a great way to do it because if someone’s passionate about creating something it’s more likely that the product is going to be wonderful and connect with audiences well owen what about distributed publishing are you on facebook instant articles for instance wasserstein daily intelligencer and science of us are on instant articles the cut vulture grub street and select all are not we’re looking in part at what’s the impact in revenue and traffic of being on instant articles i don’t think we’ve seen a big difference either way certainly we’re very committed to facebook overall as a source of traffic that said we’re also committed to our onsite experience we’re not looking to be a fully socially distributed kind of company we have pretty robust direct homepage traffic there’s a real audience there for whom we specifically are a destination of course people love our content but it’s gratifying to see that they also really love us and seek us out photo of new york magazine building by barry
