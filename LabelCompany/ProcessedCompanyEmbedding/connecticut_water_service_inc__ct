at room temperature for cooking purposes and the other chilled to about  degrees leading to each reservoir are two lines that hold about  ounces of water in some cases the cold line may accidentally chill the room temperature line resulting in cold water coming from both spigots once the  ounces of water from both lines are released room temperature water will dispense directly from the reservoir

bottle from the dispenser look inside the reservoir if there is a full reservoir of water and the dispenser is no longer leaking the bottle was the source of the leak not the dispenser let your

dispenser has two distinct reservoirs that hold water at two different temperatures one at room temperature for cooking purposes and the other chilled to about  degrees leading to each reservoir are two lines that hold about  ounces of water in some cases the cold line may accidentally chill the room temperature line resulting in cold water coming from both spigots once the  ounces of water from both lines are released room temperature water will dispense directly from the reservoir why is water boiling inside the bottle on my dispenser while this happens infrequently and is not dangerous it can be surprising to see when an air pocket forms in the reservoir of a hot and cold dispenser the heating element is exposed and creates enough heat to boil the water in the bottle above if this

appropriate temperature how hot will the hot water from the dispenser be in a hot and cold dispenser the temperature of the hot water is between  and  degrees it should be dispensed with caution and

longer leaking the bottle was the source of the leak not the dispenser let your delivery person know that the bottle had a leak and we will replace the bottle of water at no charge to you if the
