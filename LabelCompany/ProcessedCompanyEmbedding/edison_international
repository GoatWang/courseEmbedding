california’s environmental goals electric vehicles currently reduce greenhouse gases by more than  percent and smogproducing air pollutants by  percent compared to gaspowered cars as more renewable resources are added to the grid electric vehicles will increasingly benefit the environment the natural role for electric utilities in electric transportation is delivering clean electricity to

electric fuel to evs we have just  years until  – the date when california has committed to meet the next phase of its ghg reduction goals if the state utilities and other stakeholders do not act now time will quickly run out to achieve these laudable ghg reduction goals these parties cannot work alone they must be willing to collaborate and share lessons learned while developing programs to

energy companies must transform the existing local power grid into a “plug and play” platform that accommodates and integrates these new energy technologies technology is transforming the grid technology is giving customers choices about what devices they need or want to plug into the grid and it’s the utilities job to facilitate those choices customer adoption of solar is growing exponentially the state of california has about  percent of the nation’s distributed energy resources sce is helping customers install private solar at a rate of more than  per month the grid must be modernized to facilitate customer choice the grid was designed for oneway flow of power from generator to customer it must be converted to a twoway flow to enable new energy technologies modernizing
