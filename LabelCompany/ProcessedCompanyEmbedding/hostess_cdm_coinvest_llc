form k quarterly reports on form q and current reports on form k filed with the sec all of which we incorporate by reference herein as well as the other information included in this prospectus and any applicable prospectus supplement before making an investment decision any of the risk factors could significantly and negatively affect our business financial condition results of operations cash flows and prospects and the trading price of our securities you could lose all or part of your investment risks related to our business maintaining extending and expanding our reputation and brand image are essential to our business success we have many iconic brands with longstanding consumer recognition our success depends on our ability to maintain our brand image for our existing products extend our brands to new platforms and expand our brand image with new product offerings we seek to maintain extend and expand our brand image through marketing investments including advertising and consumer promotions and product innovation increasing attention on the role of food marketing could adversely affect our brand image it could also lead to stricter regulations and greater scrutiny of marketing practices existing or increased legal or regulatory restrictions on our advertising consumer promotions and marketing or our response to those restrictions could limit our efforts to maintain extend and expand our brands moreover adverse publicity about regulatory or legal action against us could damage our reputation and brand image undermine our customers confidence and reduce longterm demand for our products even if the regulatory or legal action is unfounded or not material to our operations in addition our success in maintaining extending and expanding our brand image depends on our ability to adapt to a rapidly changing media environment we increasingly rely on social media and online dissemination of advertising campaigns the growing use of social and digital media increases the speed and extent that information or misinformation and opinions can be shared negative posts or comments about us our brands or our products on social or digital media whether or not valid could seriously damage our brands and reputation if we do not maintain extend and expand its brand image then our product sales financial condition and operating results could be materially and adversely affected our intellectual property rights are valuable and our failure to protect them could reduce the value of our products and brands we consider our intellectual property rights particularly and most notably our trademarks but also our trade secrets and copyrights to be a significant and valuable part of our business we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by taking advantage of a combination of trademark copyright and trade secret laws thirdparty nondisclosure and assignment agreements and policing of thirdparty misuse of our intellectual property our failure to obtain or adequately protect our intellectual property rights or any change in law or other changes that serve to lessen or remove the current legal protections of our intellectual property may diminish our competitiveness and could materially harm our business we may be unaware of thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement relating to our brands or products any litigation regarding intellectual property could be costly and timeconsuming and could divert managements and other key personnels attention from our business operations thirdparty claims of intellectual property infringement might require us to pay monetary damages or enter into costly license agreements we also may be subject to injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products any of these occurrences could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and operating results    table of contents we must leverage our brand value to compete against lowerpriced alternative brands in nearly all of our product categories we compete with lowerpriced alternative products our products must provide higher value andor quality to our consumers than alternatives particularly during periods of economic uncertainty consumers may not buy our products if relative differences in value andor quality between our products and retailer or other economy brands change in favor of competitors products or if consumers perceive this type of change if consumers choose the lowerpriced brands then we could lose market share or sales volumes which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results we must correctly predict identify and interpret changes in consumer preferences and demand and offer new products to meet those changes consumer preferences for food and snacking products change continually our success will depend on our ability to predict identify and interpret the tastes dietary habits packaging and other preferences of consumers and to offer products that appeal to these preferences moreover weak economic conditions recession or other factors could affect consumer preferences and demand if we do not offer products that appeal to consumers or if we misjudge consumer demand for our products our sales and market share will decrease and our profitability could suffer we continually introduce new products or product extensions and our operating results and growth will depend upon the market reception of such new products there can be no assurance that new products will find widespread acceptance among consumers and unsuccessful product launches may decrease our profitability and damage our brands reputation in addition prolonged negative perceptions concerning the health implications of certain food products could influence consumer preferences and acceptance of some of our products and marketing programs for example consumers are increasingly focused on health and wellness including weight management and reducing sugar consumption we might be unsuccessful in our efforts to effectively respond to changing consumer preferences and social expectations continued negative perceptions and failure to satisfy consumer preferences could materially and adversely affect our reputation product sales financial condition and operating results we operate in a highly competitive industry the sweet baked goods business is highly competitive numerous brands and products compete for shelf space and sales with competition based primarily on product quality brand recognition and loyalty price trade promotion consumer promotion customer service and the ability to identify and satisfy emerging consumer preferences we face competition from other large national bakeries smaller regional operators supermarket chains with their own private labeled brands grocery stores with their own instore bakery departments and diversified food companies our competitors include a significant number of companies of varying sizes including divisions subdivisions or subsidiaries of larger companies many of these competitors have multiple product lines substantially greater financial and other resources available to them and may be substantially less leveraged than us we may not be able to compete successfully with these companies competitive pressures or other factors could cause us to lose market share which may require us to lower prices increase marketing and advertising expenditures or increase the use of discounting or promotional campaigns each of which would materially and adversely affect our margins and could result in a decrease in our operating results and profitability our growth may be limited by our inability to add additional shelf or retail space for our products our results will depend on our ability to drive revenue growth in part by expanding the distribution channels for our products however our ability to do so may be limited by our inability to secure additional shelf    table of contents or retail space for our products shelf and retail space for sweet baked goods is limited and subject to competitive and other pressures and there can be no assurance that retail operators will provide us sufficient shelf space for our products to enable us to meet our growth objectives our success will depend on our continued ability to produce and successfully market products with extended shelf life we have invested to extend our product shelf life while maintaining our products taste texture and quality the extended shelf life is an important component of our directtodistribution model our ability to produce and successfully market existing and new products with this extended shelf life while maintaining taste texture and quality is essential to our success if we are unable to continue to produce products with extended shelf life or if the products are not accepted by consumers we could be forced to make changes to our distribution model and that could have an adverse effect on product sales financial condition and operating results we may be unable to drive revenue growth in our key products or add products that are fastergrowing and more profitable the sweet baked goods industrys overall growth is linked to population growth our future results will depend on our ability to drive revenue growth in our key products because our operations are concentrated in north america where growth in the sweet baked goods industry has been moderate our success also depends in part on our ability to enhance our portfolio by adding innovative new products there can be no assurance that new products will find widespread acceptance among consumers our failure to drive revenue growth in our key products or develop innovative new products could materially and adversely affect our profitability financial condition and operating results commodity energy and other input prices are volatile and may rise significantly we purchase and use large quantities of commodities including flour sweeteners edible oils and cocoa to manufacture our products in addition we purchase and use significant quantities of paper corrugate films and plastics to package our products we are also exposed to changes in energy prices which impact both our manufacturing and distribution costs prices for commodities other supplies and energy are volatile and can fluctuate due to conditions that are difficult to predict including global competition for resources currency fluctuations severe weather or global climate change consumer industrial or investment demand and changes in governmental regulation and trade alternative energy and agricultural programs rising commodity energy and other input costs could materially and adversely affect our cost of operations including the manufacture transportation and distribution of our products which could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results although we monitor our exposure to commodity prices as an integral part of our overall risk management program and seek to utilize forward buying strategies through shortterm and longterm advance purchase contracts to lock in prices for certain highvolume raw materials packaging components and fuel inputs these strategies may not protect us from increases in specific raw materials costs continued volatility or sustained increases in the prices of commodities and other supplies we purchase could increase the costs of our products and our profitability could suffer moreover increases in the prices of our products to cover these increased costs may result in lower sales volumes if we are not successful in our hedging activities or if we are unable to price our products to cover increased costs then commodity and other input price volatility or increases could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results if we lose one or more of our major customers or if any of our major customers experience significant business interruption our operating results could be adversely affected we have several large customers that account for a significant portion of our sales walmart and its affiliates are our largest customers and represented approximately  of net revenues in  cumulatively including walmart our top ten customers accounted for approximately  of net revenues in     table of contents we do not have longterm supply contracts with any of our major customers the loss of one or more major customers a material reduction in sales to these customers as a result of competition from other food manufacturers or the occurrence of a significant business interruption of our customers operations would result in a decrease in our revenues operating results and earnings our geographic focus makes us particularly vulnerable to economic and other events and trends in north america we operate in north america and therefore are particularly susceptible to adverse regulations economic climate consumer trends market fluctuations including commodity price fluctuations or supply shortages of our key ingredients and other adverse events the concentration of our businesses in north america could present challenges and may increase the likelihood that an adverse event in north america would materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results the consolidation of retail customers could adversely affect us retail customers may continue to consolidate resulting in fewer customers for our business consolidation also produces larger retail customers that may seek to leverage their position to improve their profitability by demanding improved efficiency lower pricing increased promotional programs or specifically tailored products in addition larger retailers have the scale to develop supply chains that permit them to operate with reduced inventories or to develop and market their own retailer brands retail consolidation and increasing retailer power could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results retail consolidation also increases the risk that adverse changes in our customers business operations or financial performance will have a corresponding material and adverse effect on us for example if our customers cannot access sufficient funds or financing then they may delay decrease or cancel purchases of our products or delay or fail to pay us for previous purchases which could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results our results could be adversely impacted as a result of increased labor and employeerelated expenses inflationary pressures and any shortages in the labor market could increase labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our consolidated operating results or financial condition our labor costs include the cost of providing employee benefits including health and welfare and severance benefits the annual costs of benefits vary with increased costs of health care and the outcome of collectivelybargained wage and benefit agreements higher health care costs and labor costs due to statutory and regulatory changes could adversely affect our business with the passage in  of the us patient protection and affordable care act the  aca  we are required to provide affordable coverage as defined in the aca to all employees or otherwise be subject to a payment per employee based on the affordability criteria in the aca many of these requirements are being phased in over a period of time additionally some states and localities have passed state and local laws mandating the provisions of certain levels of health benefits by some employers increased health care and insurance costs could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and operating results in addition changes in federal or state workplace regulations could adversely affect our ability to meet our financial targets various federal and state labor laws govern our relationships with our employees and affect operating costs these laws include employee classifications as exempt or nonexempt minimum wage requirements unemployment tax rates workers compensation rates overtime family leave safety standards payroll taxes    table of contents citizenship requirements and other wage and benefit requirements for employees classified as nonexempt as our employees are paid at rates set above but related to the applicable minimum wage further increases in the minimum wage could increase our labor costs significant additional government regulations could materially adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results a portion of our workforce belongs to unions failure to successfully negotiate collective bargaining agreements or strikes or work stoppages could cause our business to suffer approximately  of our employees as of september   are covered by collective bargaining agreements and other employees may seek to be covered by collective bargaining agreements strikes or work stoppages or other business interruptions could occur if we are unable to renew these agreements on satisfactory terms or enter into new agreements on satisfactory terms which could impair manufacturing and distribution of our products or result in a loss of sales which could adversely impact our business financial condition or operating results the terms and conditions of existing renegotiated or new collective bargaining agreements could also increase our costs or otherwise affect our ability to fully implement future operational changes to enhance our efficiency or to adapt to changing business needs or strategy we may be subject to product liability claims should the consumption of any of our products cause injury illness or death we sell food products for human consumption which involves risks such as product contamination or spoilage misbranding product tampering and other adulteration of food products consumption of a misbranded adulterated contaminated or spoiled product may result in personal illness or injury we could be subject to claims or law suits relating to an actual or alleged illness or injury and we could incur liabilities that are not insured or exceed its insurance coverage even if product liability claims against us are not successful or fully pursued these claims could be costly and time consuming and may require our management to spend time defending the claims rather than operating the business in addition publicity regarding these claims could adversely affect our reputation our recent product recall increased our costs and may negatively impact our brands reputation and future recalls could adversely affect our business on june   we announced the recall of approximately  cases of various products that we believe may contain peanut residue from flour these products could pose a risk to consumers with peanut allergies because the products potentially contained low levels of undeclared peanut residue while we believe we have taken all appropriate steps to address this issue the recall resulted in increased costs and could negatively affect our brands reputation in the future a product that has been actually or allegedly misbranded or becomes adulterated could result in product withdrawals or recalls destruction of product inventory negative publicity temporary plant closings substantial cost of compliance or remediation and potentially significant product liability judgments against us any of these events could result in a loss of demand for our products which would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition operating results or cash flows we could also be adversely affected if consumers lose confidence in our product quality safety and integrity generally unanticipated business disruptions could adversely affect our ability to provide our products to our customers factors that are hard to predict or beyond our control like weather natural disasters fire explosions terrorism political unrest generalized labor unrest or health pandemics could damage or disrupt our operations in addition our operations could be disrupted by a material equipment failure we do not have significant redundant operating equipment to allow for such disruptions accordingly if we do not effectively respond to disruptions in our operations for example by replacing capacity at our manufacturing locations or cannot    table of contents quickly repair damage to our information production or supply systems we may be late in delivering or unable to deliver products to our customers if that occurs we may lose our customers confidence and longterm consumer demand for our products could decline these events could materially and adversely affect our product sales financial condition and operating results we rely on third parties for significant services that are important to our business and their failure to perform could adversely affect our business financial condition and operating results we operate a directtowarehouse distribution system that utilizes thirdparty centralized distribution centers and common carriers to transport a substantial majority of our products while this has expanded our distribution reach and reduced delivery costs we are dependent upon third parties to effectively distribute our products any failure by us to deliver our products in a timely manner would have an adverse impact on our sales and our reputation in addition we rely on third parties for sales and marketing services we do not have longterm contracts with any of these third party service providers accordingly any termination by a third party provider of their services to us or any failure by these third parties to perform their obligations to us would have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions could subject us to civil and criminal penalties as a large food company we operate in a highly regulated environment with constantly evolving legal and regulatory frameworks various laws and regulations govern food production storage distribution sales advertising and marketing as well as licensing trade labor tax and environmental matters and health and safety practices government authorities regularly change laws and regulations and their interpretations consequently we are subject to heightened risk of legal claims or other regulatory enforcement actions although we have implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations there can be no assurance that our employees contractors or agents will not violate our policies and procedures moreover a failure to maintain effective control processes could lead to violations unintentional or otherwise of laws and regulations legal claims or regulatory enforcement actions arising out of our failure or alleged failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could subject us to civil and criminal penalties that could materially and adversely affect our product sales reputation financial condition and operating results our insurance may not provide adequate levels of coverage against claims we believe that we maintain insurance customary for businesses of our size and type however there are types of losses we may incur that cannot be insured against or that we believe are not economically reasonable to insure such losses could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results we are subject to laws and regulations relating to protection of the environment worker health and workplace safety costs to comply with these laws and regulations or claims with respect to environmental health and safety matters could have a significant negative impact on our business our operations are subject to various federal state and local laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment including those governing the discharge of pollutants into the air and water the management and disposal of solid and hazardous materials and wastes employee exposure to hazards in the workplace and the cleanup of contaminated sites we are required to obtain and comply with environmental permits for many of our operations and sometimes we are required to install pollution control equipment or to implement operational changes to limit air emissions or wastewater discharges andor decrease the likelihood of accidental releases of hazardous materials we could incur substantial costs including cleanup costs civil or criminal fines or penalties and thirdparty claims for property damage or personal injury as a result of any violations of environmental laws and regulations noncompliance with environmental permit conditions or contamination for which we may be responsible that is identified or that may occur in the future such costs may be material    table of contents under federal and state environmental laws we may be liable for the costs of investigation removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances as well as related costs of investigation and damage to natural resources at various properties including our current and former properties and the former properties of our predecessors as well as offsite waste handling or disposal sites that we or our predecessors have used liability may be imposed upon us without regard to whether we knew of or caused the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances any such locations or locations that we may acquire in the future may result in liability to us under such laws or expose us to thirdparty actions such as tort suits based on alleged conduct or environmental conditions in addition we may be liable if hazardous or toxic substances migrate from properties for which we may be responsible to other properties in addition to regulations applicable to our operations failure by any of our suppliers to comply with regulations or allegations of compliance failure may disrupt our operations and could result in potential liability even if we were able to obtain insurance coverage or compensation for any losses or damages resulting from the noncompliance of a supplier with applicable regulations our brands and reputation may be adversely affected by negative perceptions of our brands stemming from such compliance failures we cannot predict what environmental or health and safety legislation or regulations will be enacted in the future or how existing or future laws or regulations will be enforced administered or interpreted we also cannot predict the amount of future expenditures that may be required in order to comply with such environmental or health and safety laws or regulations or to respond to environmental claims our operations are subject to regulation by the us food and drug administration fda federal trade commission ftc and other governmental entities and such regulations are subject to change from time to time which could impact how we manage our production and sale of products our operations are subject to extensive regulation by the fda the ftc and other national state and local authorities for example we are subject to the food drug and cosmetic act and regulations promulgated thereunder by the fda this comprehensive regulatory

achieve our business goals and higher employee turnover including of employees with key capabilities furthermore we might be unable to manage changes in or that affect our workforce appropriately or satisfy the legal requirements associated with how we manage and compensate our employees these risks could materially and adversely affect our reputation ability to meet the needs of our customers product sales financial condition and operating results our substantial leverage could adversely affect our ability to raise additional capital to fund its operations limit our ability to react to changes in the economy or our industry expose us to interest rate risk to the extent of our variable rate debt and prevent us from meeting our obligations under our indebtedness we are highly leveraged our high degree of leverage could have important consequences including        requiring a substantial portion of cash flow from operations to be dedicated to the payment of principal and interest on our indebtedness thereby reducing our ability to use our cash flow to fund our operations capital expenditures and future business opportunities or to pay dividends        exposing us to the risk of increased interest rates because certain of our borrowings including certain borrowings under our credit facilities are at variable rates        making it more difficult for us to make payments on its indebtedness    table of contents      increasing our vulnerability to general economic and industry conditions        restricting our from making strategic acquisitions or causing us to make nonstrategic divestitures        subjecting us to restrictive covenants that may limit our flexibility in operating our business        limiting our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital capital expenditures product development debt service requirements acquisitions and general corporate or other purposes and        placing us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our competitors who are less highly leveraged despite our significant leverage we may be able to incur significant additional amounts of debt which could further exacerbate the risks associated with our significant leverage the jobs act permits emerging growth companies like us to take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies we qualify as an emerging growth company as defined in section a of the securities act as modified by the jumpstart our business startups act of  which we refer to as the  jobs act  as such we take advantage of certain exemptions from various reporting requirements applicable to other public companies that are not emerging growth companies for as long as we continue to be an emerging growth company including i the exemption from the auditor attestation requirements with respect to internal control over financial reporting under section  of the sarbanesoxley act ii the exemptions from sayonpay sayonfrequency and sayongolden parachute voting requirements and iii reduced disclosure obligations regarding executive compensation in our periodic reports and proxy statements as a result our stockholders may not have access to certain information they deem important we will remain an emerging growth company until the earliest of i the last day of the fiscal year a following august   the fifth anniversary of our ipo b in which we have total annual gross revenue of at least  billion or c in which we are deemed to be a large accelerated filer which means the market value of our class a common stock that is held by nonaffiliates exceeds  million as of the last business day of our prior second fiscal quarter and ii the date on which we have issued more than  billion in nonconvertible debt during the prior threeyear period because we had net revenues during our last fiscal year of approximately  million if we expand our business or increase our revenues we may cease to be an emerging growth company prior to august   in addition section  of the jobs act also provides that an emerging growth company can take advantage of the exemption from complying with new or revised accounting standards provided in section ab of the securities act as long as we are an emerging growth company an emerging growth company can therefore delay the adoption of certain accounting standards until those standards would otherwise apply to private companies the jobs act provides that a company can elect to opt out of the extended transition period and comply with the requirements that apply to nonemerging growth companies but any such election to opt out is irrevocable we have elected not to opt out of such extended transition period which means that when a standard is issued or revised and it has different application dates for public or private companies we as an emerging growth company can adopt the new or revised standard at the time private companies adopt the new or revised standard this may make comparison of our financial statements with another public company which is not an emerging growth company or is an emerging growth company which has opted out of using the extended transition period difficult or impossible because of the potential differences in accounting standards used we cannot predict if investors will find our class a common stock less attractive because we will rely on these exemptions if some investors find our class a common stock less attractive as a result there may be a less active trading market for our class a common stock and our stock price may be more volatile    table of contents unanticipated changes in effective tax rates or adverse outcomes resulting from

quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly and could fall below the expectations of securities analysts and investors due to seasonality and other factors some of which are beyond our control resulting in a decline in our stock price our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly because of several factors including        labor availability and costs for hourly and

macroeconomic conditions both nationally and locally        negative publicity relating to products we serve        changes in consumer preferences and competitive conditions        expansion to

antitakeover provisions contained in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws as well as provisions of delaware law could impair a takeover attempt our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that may discourage unsolicited takeover proposals that stockholders may consider to be in their best interests we are also subject to antitakeover provisions under delaware law which could delay or prevent a change of control together these provisions may make more difficult the removal of management and may discourage transactions that otherwise could involve payment of a premium over prevailing market prices for our securities these provisions will include        a staggered board providing for three classes of directors which limits the ability of a stockholder or group to gain control of our board        no cumulative voting in the election of directors which limits the ability of minority stockholders to elect director candidates        the right of our board to elect a

own slate of directors or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us risks related to the business combination our ability to be successful will depend upon the efforts of our key personnel including the key personnel of hostess who have stayed with us following the business combination the loss of key personnel could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our postcombination business and its financial condition could suffer as a result our success is dependent upon the efforts of our key personnel including the key personnel from hostess who joined us following the business combination although some of our key personnel have remained with us in senior management or advisory positions following our business combination it is possible that we will lose some key personnel the loss of which could negatively impact the operations and profitability of our business our success depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of senior management certain of whom would be difficult to replace departure by certain of our officers could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition or operating results we do not maintain keyman life insurance on any of our officers the services of such personnel may not continue to be available to us we may be required to pay the legacy hostess equityholders for a significant portion of the tax benefit relating to any additional tax depreciation or amortization deductions we claim as a result of any step up in the tax basis of the assets of our operating subsidiaries resulting from the cdm holders exchange of shares of class b common stock and class b units for shares of our class a common stock class b units in hostess holdings may be exchanged together with the cancellation of shares of class b common stock by the holders thereof for at the companys election shares of class a common stock on a oneforone basis subject to customary antidilution adjustments or the cash equivalent of such shares the exchanges may result in increases to our share of the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of our operating subsidiaries that otherwise would not have been available although the us internal revenue service may challenge all or part of that tax basis increase and a court could sustain such a challenge by the us internal revenue service these increases in tax basis if sustained may reduce the amount of tax that we would otherwise be required to pay in the future we are party to a tax receivable agreement that provides for the payment by us to the legacy hostess equityholders of  of the net cash savings if any in us federal state and local income tax that the company actually realizes or is deemed to realize in

cash savings if any in income tax that we realize    table of contents we may be required to take writedowns or writeoffs restructuring and impairment or other charges that could have a significant negative effect on our financial condition results of operations and our stock price which could cause you to lose some or all of your investment although we conducted due diligence on hostess in connection with the business combination we cannot assure you that this diligence surfaced all material issues that may be present in hostess business that it would be possible to uncover all material issues through a customary amount of due diligence or that factors outside of hostess business and outside of our and hostess control will not later arise as a result of these factors we may be forced to later writedown or writeoff assets restructure operations or incur impairment or other charges that could result in losses unexpected risks may arise and previously known risks may materialize in a manner not consistent with our risk analysis even though these charges may be noncash items and not have an immediate impact on our liquidity the fact that we report charges of this nature could contribute to negative market perceptions about the company or its securities accordingly our stockholders could suffer a reduction in the value of their shares such stockholders are unlikely to have a remedy for such reduction in value unless they are able to successfully claim that the reduction was due to the breach by our officers or directors of a duty of care or other fiduciary duty owed to them or if they are able to successfully bring a private claim under securities laws that the proxy statement relating to the business combination contained an actionable material misstatement or material omission we have no operating or financial history and our results of operations may differ significantly from the unaudited pro forma financial data included in our current report on form k filed with the sec on november   incorporated by reference in this prospectus prior to the business combination we were a blank check company and we had no operating history and no revenues the materials incorporated by reference into this prospectus include unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements for the postcombination company the unaudited pro forma condensed combined statement of operations of the postcombination company combines the historical audited results of operations of the company for the period ended december   and the unaudited results of the company for the nine months ended september   with the historical audited results of operations of hostess holdings for the year ended december   and the unaudited results of hostess holdings for the nine months ended september   respectively and gives pro forma effect to the business combination as if it had been consummated on january   the unaudited pro forma condensed combined balance sheet of the postcombination company combines the historical balance sheets of the company as of september   and of hostess holdings as of september   and gives pro forma effect to the business combination as if it had been consummated on september   the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are presented for illustrative purposes only are based on certain assumptions address a hypothetical situation and reflect limited historical financial data therefore the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements are not necessarily indicative of the results of operations and financial position that would have been achieved had the business combination been consummated on the dates indicated above or the future consolidated results of operations or financial position of the postcombination company accordingly the postcombination companys business assets cash flows results of operations and financial condition may differ significantly from those indicated by the unaudited pro forma condensed combined financial statements incorporated by reference in this document if the business combinations benefits do not meet the expectations of investors stockholders or financial analysts the market price of our securities may decline if the benefits of the business combination do not meet the expectations of investors or securities analysts the market price of our securities may decline fluctuations in the price of our securities could contribute to the loss of all or part of your investment immediately prior to the business combination there was no public market for hostess stock and trading in the    table of contents shares of our class a common stock was not active as an active market for our securities develops and continues the trading price of our securities could be volatile and subject to wide fluctuations in response to various factors some of which are beyond our control any of the factors listed below could have a material adverse effect on your investment in our securities and our securities may trade at prices significantly below the price you paid for them in such circumstances the trading price of our securities may not recover and may experience a further decline factors affecting the trading price of our securities may include        actual or anticipated fluctuations in our quarterly financial

amounts of common stock by our directors officers or significant stockholders or the perception that such sales could occur and        general economic and political conditions such as recessions interest rates fuel prices international currency fluctuations and acts of war or terrorism broad market and industry factors may materially harm the market price of our securities irrespective of our operating performance the stock market in general and nasdaq have experienced price and volume fluctuations that have often been unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the particular companies affected the trading prices and valuations of these stocks and of our securities may not be predictable a loss of investor confidence in the market for the stocks of other companies which investors perceive to be similar to the postcombination company could depress our stock price regardless of our business prospects financial conditions or results of operations a decline in the market price of our securities also could adversely affect our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to obtain additional financing in the future in the past securities class action litigation has often been initiated against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and divert our managements attention and resources and could also require us to make substantial payments to satisfy judgments or to settle litigation    table of contents risks related to our class a common stock resales of the shares of class a common stock included in the stock consideration could depress the market price of our class a common stock there may be a large number of shares of class a common stock sold in the market in the near future these sales or the perception in the market that the holders of a large number of shares intend to sell shares could reduce the market price of our class a common stock our initial stockholders including our sponsor as well as apollo and the cdm holders hold approximately  of our common stock including approximately  of our class a common stock and  of our class b common stock all such shares of class a common stock held by or obtainable in exchange for class b common stock and class b units held by our sponsor apollo and the cdm holders have been registered for resale under the securities act on the registration statement of which this prospectus is part pursuant to the terms of the registration rights agreement the restricted stockholders are bound by restrictions on the transfer of their shares of class a common stock and class b common stock subject to the exceptions set forth therein for at least six months following the closing of the business combination in addition our initial stockholders entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant to which they agreed that the founder shares which were converted into shares of class a common stock at the closing of the business combination may not be transferred until the earlier to occur of i six months after the closing of the business combination or ii the date on which the company completes a liquidation merger stock exchange or other similar transaction after the closing of the business combination that results in all of the companys public stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of common stock for cash securities or other property notwithstanding the foregoing if the last sale price of our class a common stock equals or exceeds  per share as adjusted for stock splits stock dividends reorganizations recapitalizations and the like for any  trading days within any trading day period commencing at least  days after the closing of the business combination the founder shares will be released from these transfer restrictions we have approximately  shares of class a common stock outstanding including the restricted stock we also intend to register all shares of class a common stock that we may issue under the incentive plan once we register these shares they can be freely sold in the public market upon issuance subject to volume limitations applicable to affiliates such sales of shares of class a common stock or the perception of such sales may depress the market price of our class a common stock our only significant asset is our ownership interest in our operating subsidiaries and such ownership may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our common stock or satisfy our other financial obligations including our obligations under the tax receivable agreement we have no direct operations and no significant assets other than our ownership interest in our operating subsidiaries we depend on our operating subsidiaries for distributions loans and other payments to generate the funds necessary to meet our financial obligations including our expenses as a publicly traded company to pay any dividends with respect to our common stock and to satisfy our obligations under the tax receivable agreement the financial condition and operating requirements of our operating subsidiaries may limit our ability to obtain cash from our operating subsidiaries the earnings from or other available assets of our operating subsidiaries may not be sufficient to pay dividends or make distributions or loans to enable us to pay any dividends on our common stock or satisfy our other financial obligations including our obligations under the tax receivable agreement the ability of our operating subsidiaries other than subsidiaries which have been designated as unrestricted pursuant to our ability to do so in certain limited circumstances to make distributions loans and other payments to us for the purposes described above and for any other purpose are governed by the terms of the rollover credit agreements and will be subject to the negative covenants set forth therein any loans or other extensions    table of contents of credit will be subject to the investment covenants under the rollover credit agreements which provide for several exceptions including among others i a general investment basket equal to the greater of a fixed dollar amount and a percentage of ebitda and ii an unlimited investment basket based on satisfying a total net leverage ratio on a pro forma basis similarly any dividends distributions or similar payments will be subject to the dividends and distributions covenant under the rollover credit agreements which also provide for several exceptions including among others i for payment of overhead and certain fees and expenses of parent companies ii for tax distributions subject to certain limitations iii a general dividend and distribution basket equal to the greater of a fixed dollar amount and a percentage of ebitda and iv an unlimited dividend and distribution basket based on satisfying a total net leverage ratio of a pro forma basis if our dividend policy is materially different than the distribution policy of hostess holdings upon the exchange of any class b units the limited partners of hostess holdings could receive a disproportionate interest in the aggregate distributions by our operating subsidiaries that have not been distributed by us we and the cdm holders are limited partners of hostess holdings to the extent hostess holdings distributes to its limited partners a greater share of income received from our operating subsidiaries than we distribute to our stockholders then any of the cdm holders who participate in such distribution by hostess holdings and subsequently exercise their rights to exchange limited partnership units in hostess holdings for class a common stock may receive a disproportionate interest in the aggregate distributions by our operating subsidiaries that have not been distributed by us the reason is that such cdm holder could receive both i the benefit of a distribution by hostess holdings to its limited partners including such cdm holder and ii the benefit of a distribution by the company to the holders of class a common stock including such cdm holder consequently if our dividend policy does not match the distribution policy of hostess holdings other holders of class a common stock as of the date of an exchange could experience a reduction in their interest in the profits previously distributed by our operating subsidiaries that have not been distributed by us our current dividend policy could result in distributions to our common stockholders that are different from the distributions made by hostess holdings to its limited partners a market for our securities may not continue which would adversely affect the liquidity and price of our securities the price of our securities may fluctuate significantly due to the markets reaction to the business combination and general market and economic conditions an active trading market for our securities may never develop or if developed it may not be sustained in addition the price of our securities can vary due to general economic conditions and forecasts our general business condition and the release of our financial reports additionally if our securities are not listed on or become delisted from nasdaq for any reason and are quoted on the otc bulletin board an interdealer automated quotation system for equity securities that is not a national securities exchange the liquidity and price of our securities may be more limited than if we were quoted or listed on nasdaq or another national securities exchange you may be unable to sell your securities unless a market can be established or sustained if securities or industry analysts do not publish or cease publishing research or reports about us our business or our market or if they change their recommendations regarding our class a common stock adversely then the price and trading volume of our class a common stock could decline the trading market for our class a common stock will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts may publish about us our business our market or our competitors securities and industry analysts do not currently and may never publish research on us if no securities or industry analysts commence coverage of us our stock price and trading volume would likely be negatively impacted if any of the analysts who may cover us change their recommendation regarding our stock adversely or provide more favorable relative recommendations about our competitors the price of our class a common stock would likely decline if any analyst who may cover us were to cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on it we could lose visibility in the financial markets which could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline    table of contents use of proceeds all of the shares of class a common stock offered

serve until the  annual meeting and class iii directors will serve until the  annual meeting there is no cumulative voting with respect to the election of directors with the result that directions will be elected by a plurality of the votes cast at an annual meeting of stockholders by holders of our common stock founder shares in connection with the consummation of the business combination our founder shares automatically converted into shares of class a common stock our initial stockholders hold approximately  of the total number of all shares of common stock outstanding after consummation of the business combination consisting of the founder shares which were automatically converted into shares of class a stock at the closing of the business combination and the shares of class a stock purchased by our sponsor pursuant to its subscription agreement with certain limited exceptions these shares are not transferable assignable or salable except to our officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with our sponsor each of whom will be subject to the same transfer restrictions until six months after the completion of the business combination or earlier if x the last sale price of the class a common stock equals or exceeds  per share as adjusted for stock splits stock dividends reorganizations recapitalizations and the like for any  trading days within any trading day period commencing may   or y the date on which we complete a liquidation merger stock exchange or other similar transaction that results in all of our public stockholders having the right to exchange their shares of class a common stock for cash securities or other property preferred stock our certificate of incorporation provides that shares of preferred stock may be issued from time to time in one or more series our board is authorized to fix the voting rights if any designations powers preferences the relative participating optional or other special rights and any qualifications limitations and restrictions thereof applicable to the shares of each series our board is able without stockholder approval to issue preferred stock with voting and other rights that could adversely affect the voting power and other rights of the holders of the common stock and could have antitakeover effects the ability of our board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change of control of us or the removal of existing management we have no preferred stock outstanding at the date hereof although we do not currently intend to issue any shares of preferred stock we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future warrants public warrants each public warrant entitles the registered holder to purchase onehalf of one share of our class a common stock at a price of  per half share subject to adjustment as discussed below at any time commencing on december    ie  the later of  months from the closing of the ipo or  days after the completion of the business combination for example if a warrant holder holds two public warrants such public warrants will    table of contents be exercisable for one share of the companys class a common stock public warrants must be exercised for a whole share the public warrants will expire november    ie  five years after the completion of the business combination at  pm new york city time or earlier upon redemption or liquidation we are not obligated to deliver any shares of class a common stock pursuant to the exercise of a public warrant and will have no obligation to settle such warrant exercise unless a registration statement under the securities act with respect to the shares of class a common stock underlying the warrants is then effective and a prospectus relating thereto is current subject to our satisfying our obligations described below with respect to registration no public warrant will be exercisable for cash or on a cashless basis and we will not be obligated to issue any shares to holders seeking to exercise their public warrants unless the issuance of the shares upon such exercise is registered or qualified under the securities laws of the state of the exercising holder or an exemption is available in the event that the conditions in the two immediately preceding sentences are not satisfied with respect to a public warrant the holder of such public warrant will not be entitled to exercise such public warrant and such public warrant may have no value and expire worthless in the event that a registration statement is not effective for the exercised warrants the purchaser of a unit containing such public warrant will have paid the full purchase price for the unit solely for the share of class a common stock underlying such unit this registration statement of which this prospectus is part provides for the registration under the securities act of the shares of class a common stock issuable upon exercise of the public warrants we will use our best efforts to maintain the effectiveness of such registration statement and a current prospectus relating thereto until the expiration of the public warrants in accordance with the provisions of the warrant agreement notwithstanding the above if our class a common stock is at the time of any exercise of a public warrant not listed on a national securities exchange such that it satisfies the definition of a covered security under section b of the securities act we may at our option require holders of public warrants who exercise their public warrants to do so a cashless basis in accordance with section a of the securities act and in the event we so elect we will not be required to file or maintain in effect a registration statement but will use our best efforts to qualify the shares under applicable blue sky laws to the extent an exemption is not available once the public warrants become exercisable we may call the public warrants for redemption        in whole and not in part        at a price of  per warrant        upon not less than  days prior written notice of redemption to each warrant holder and        if and only if the last reported sale price of the class a common stock equals or exceeds  per share for any  trading days within a  trading day period ending on the third trading day prior to the date we send the notice of redemption to the warrant holder if and when the public warrants become redeemable by us we may exercise our redemption right even if we are unable to register or qualify the underlying securities for sale under all applicable state securities laws we have established the last of the redemption criterion discussed above to prevent a redemption call unless there is at the time of the call a significant premium to the public warrant exercise price if the foregoing conditions are satisfied and we issue a notice of redemption of the public warrants each public warrant holder will be entitled to exercise his her or its public warrant prior to the scheduled redemption date however the price of the class a common stock may fall below the  redemption trigger price as well as the  public warrant exercise price for whole shares after the redemption notice is issued if we call the public warrants for redemption as described above our management will have the option to require any holder that wishes to exercise his her or its public warrant to do so on a cashless basis in determining whether to require all holders to exercise their public warrants on a cashless basis our management will consider among other factors our cash position the number of public warrants that are    table of contents outstanding and the dilutive effect on our stockholders of issuing the maximum number of shares of class a stock issuable upon the exercise of our public warrant if our management takes advantage of this option all holders of public warrants would pay the exercise price by surrendering their public warrants for that number of shares of class a common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing x the product of the number of shares of class a common stock underlying the public warrant multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the public warrant and the fair market value defined below by y the fair market value the fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the class a stock for the ten trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of redemption is sent to the holders of public warrants if our management takes advantage of this option the notice of redemption will contain the information necessary to calculate the number of shares of class a common stock to be received upon exercise of the public warrants including the fair market value in such case requiring a cashless exercise in this manner will reduce the number of shares to be issued and thereby lessen the dilutive effect of a warrant redemption we believe this feature is an attractive option to us if we do not need the cash from the exercise of the public warrants after our initial business combination if we call our public warrants for redemption and our management does not take advantage of this option our sponsor and its permitted transferees would still be entitled to exercise their private warrants for cash or on a cashless basis using the same formula described above that other public warrant holders would have been required to use had all public warrant holders been required to exercise their public warrant on a cashless basis as described in more detail below a holder of a public warrant may notify us in writing in the event it elects to be subject to a requirement that such holder will not have the right to exercise such public warrant to the extent that after giving effect to such exercise such person together with such persons affiliates to the public warrant agents actual knowledge would beneficially own in excess of  or such other amount as a holder may specify of the shares of class a common stock outstanding immediately after giving effect to such exercise if the number of outstanding shares of class a common stock is increased by a stock dividend payable in shares of class a common stock or by a splitup of shares of class a common stock or other similar event then on the effective date of such stock dividend splitup or similar event the number of shares of class a common stock issuable on exercise of each public warrant will be increased in proportion to such increase in the outstanding shares of class a common stock a rights offering to holders of class a common stock entitling holders to purchase shares of class a common stock at a price less than the fair market value will be deemed a stock dividend of a number of shares of class a common stock equal to the product of i the number of shares of class a common stock actually sold in such rights offering or issuable under any other equity securities sold in such rights offering that are convertible into or exercisable for class a common stock multiplied by ii one minus the quotient of x the price per share of class a common stock paid in such rights offering divided by y the fair market value for these purposes i if the rights offering is for securities convertible into or exercisable for class a common stock in determining the price payable for class a common stock there will be taken into account any consideration received for such rights as well as any additional amount payable upon exercise or conversion and ii fair market value means the volume weighted average price of class a common stock as reported during the ten trading day period ending on the trading day prior to the first date on which the shares of class a common stock trade on the applicable exchange or in the applicable market regular way without the right to receive such rights in addition if we at any time while the public warrants are outstanding and unexpired pay a dividend or make a distribution in cash securities or other assets to the holders of class a common stock on account of such shares of class a common stock or other shares of our capital stock into which the public warrants are convertible other than a as described above b certain ordinary cash dividends c to satisfy the redemption rights of the holders of class a common stock in connection with the business combination or d as a result of the repurchase of shares of class a common stock by the company in connection with the presentation business combination is presented to the stockholders of the company for approval then the public warrant exercise price will be decreased effective immediately after the effective date of such event by the amount of cash andor the fair market value of any securities or other assets paid on each share of class a common stock in respect of such event    table of contents if the number of outstanding shares of our class a common stock is decreased by a consolidation combination reverse stock split or reclassification of shares of class a common stock or other similar event then on the effective date of such consolidation combination reverse stock split reclassification or similar event the number of shares of class a common stock issuable on exercise of each public warrant will be decreased in proportion to such decrease in outstanding shares of class a common stock whenever the number of shares of class a common stock purchasable upon the exercise of the public warrants is adjusted as described above the public warrant exercise price will be adjusted by multiplying the public warrant exercise price immediately prior to such adjustment by a fraction x the numerator of which will be the number of shares of class a common stock purchasable upon the exercise of the public warrants immediately prior to such adjustment and y the denominator of which will be the number of shares of class a common stock so purchasable immediately thereafter in case of any reclassification or reorganization of the outstanding shares of class a common stock other than those described above or that solely affects the par value of such shares of class a common stock or in the case of any merger or consolidation of us with or into another corporation other than a consolidation or merger in which we are the continuing corporation and that does not result in any reclassification or reorganization of our outstanding shares of class a common stock or in the case of any sale or conveyance to another corporation or entity of the assets or other property of us as an entirety or substantially as an entirety in connection with which we are dissolved the holders of the public warrants will thereafter have the right to purchase and receive upon the basis and upon the terms and conditions specified in the public warrants and in lieu of the shares of our class a common stock immediately theretofore purchasable and receivable upon the exercise of the rights represented thereby the kind and amount of shares of stock or other securities or property including cash receivable upon such reclassification reorganization merger or consolidation or upon a dissolution following any such sale or transfer that the holder of the public warrants would have received if such holder had exercised its public warrants immediately prior to such event however if such holders were entitled to exercise a right of election as to the kind or amount of securities cash or other assets receivable upon such consolidation or merger then the kind and amount of securities cash or other assets for which each public warrant will become exercisable will be deemed to be the weighted average of the kind and amount received per share by such holders in such consolidation or merger that affirmatively make such election and if a tender exchange or redemption offer has been made to and accepted by such holders under circumstances in which upon completion of such tender or exchange offer the maker thereof together with members of any group within the meaning of rule db under the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act of which such maker is a part and together with any affiliate or associate of such maker within the meaning of rule b under the exchange act and any members of any such group of which any such affiliate or associate is a part own beneficially within the meaning of rule d under the exchange act more than fifty percent  of the outstanding shares of class a common stock the holder of a public warrant will be entitled to receive the highest amount of cash securities or other property to which such holder would actually have been entitled as a stockholder if such public warrant holder had exercised the public warrant prior to the expiration of such tender or exchange offer accepted such offer and all of the class a common stock held by such holder had been purchased pursuant to such tender or exchange offer subject to adjustments from and after the consummation of such tender or exchange offer as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in the public warrant agreement additionally if less than seventy percent  of the consideration receivable by the holders of class a common stock in such a transaction is payable in the form of class a common stock in the successor entity that is listed for trading on a national securities exchange or is quoted in an established overthecounter market or is to be so listed for trading or quoted immediately following such event and if the registered holder of the public warrant properly exercises the public warrant within  days following public disclosure of such transaction the public warrant exercise price will be reduced as specified in the public warrant agreement based on the per share consideration minus blackscholes warrant value as defined in the public warrant agreement of the public warrant    table of contents the public warrants have been issued in registered form under a warrant agreement between continental stock transfer  trust company as warrant agent and us you should review a copy of the warrant agreement which is filed as an exhibit to the registration statement of which this prospectus is part for a complete description of the terms and conditions applicable to the public warrants the warrant agreement provides that the terms of the public warrants may be amended without the consent of any holder to cure any ambiguity or correct any defective provision but requires the approval by the holders of at least  of the then outstanding public warrants to make any change that adversely affects the interests of the registered holders of public warrants the public warrants may be exercised upon surrender of the public warrant certificate on or prior to the expiration date at the offices of the public warrant agent with the exercise form on the reverse side of the public warrant certificate completed and executed as indicated accompanied by full payment of the exercise price or on a cashless basis if applicable by certified or official bank check payable to us for the number of public warrants being exercised the public warrant holders do not have the rights or privileges of holders of class a common stock and any voting rights until they exercise their public warrants and receive shares of class a common stock after the issuance of shares of class a common stock upon exercise of the public warrants each holder will be entitled to one vote for each share held of record on all matters to be voted on by stockholders public warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of shares of class a common stock no fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the public warrants if upon exercise of the public warrants a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional interest in a share we will upon exercise round down to the nearest whole number the number of shares of class a common stock to be issued to the public warrant holder as a result public warrant holders not purchasing an even number of public warrants must sell any odd number of public warrants in order to obtain full value from the fractional interest that will not be issued private warrants our sponsor purchased  private warrants at a price of  per private warrant for an aggregate purchase price of  in a private placement that occurred prior to the ipo the private warrants including the class a common stock issuable upon exercise of the private warrants are not transferable assignable or salable until december    ie   days after the completion of the business combination except among other limited exceptions to our officers and directors and other persons or entities affiliated with our sponsor and they will not be redeemable by us so long as they are held by the sponsor or its permitted transferees otherwise the private warrants have terms and provisions that are identical to those of the public warrants at the closing of the business combination our sponsor transferred  private warrants to mr metropoulos if the private warrants are held by holders other than the sponsor or its permitted transferees the private warrants will be redeemable by us and exercisable by the holders on the same basis as the public warrants if holders of the private warrants elect to exercise them on a cashless basis they would pay the exercise price by surrendering his her or its warrants for that number of shares of class a common stock equal to the quotient obtained by dividing x the product of the number of shares of class a common stock underlying the warrants multiplied by the difference between the exercise price of the warrants and the fair market value defined below by y the fair market value the fair market value shall mean the average reported last sale price of the class a common stock for the ten trading days ending on the third trading day prior to the date on which the notice of warrant exercise is sent to the warrant agent the reason that we have agreed that these warrants will be exercisable on a cashless basis so long as they are held by our sponsor and permitted transferees is because it is not known at this time whether they will be affiliated with us following a business combination if they remain affiliated with us their ability to sell our securities in the open market will be significantly limited we have policies in place that prohibit insiders from selling our securities except during specific periods of time even during such periods of time when insiders are permitted to sell our securities an insider cannot trade in our securities if he or she is in possession of material nonpublic information    table of contents accordingly unlike public stockholders who could exercise their warrants and sell the shares of class a common stock received upon such exercise freely in the open market in order to recoup the cost of such exercise the insiders could be significantly restricted from selling such securities as a result we believe that allowing the holders to exercise such warrants on a cashless basis is appropriate dividends we have not paid any cash dividends on our common stock to date the payment of cash dividends in the future will be dependent upon our revenues and earnings if any capital requirements and general financial condition the payment of any cash dividends is within the discretion of our board in addition our board is not currently contemplating and does not anticipate declaring any stock dividends in the foreseeable future further if we incur any indebtedness our ability to declare dividends may be limited by restrictive covenants we may agree to in connection therewith transfer agent and warrant agent the transfer agent for our common stock and warrant agent for our warrants is continental stock transfer  trust company we have agreed to indemnify continental stock transfer  trust company in its roles as transfer agent and warrant agent its agents and each of its stockholders directors officers and employees against all liabilities including judgments costs and reasonable counsel fees that may arise out of acts performed or omitted for its activities in that capacity except for any liability due to any gross negligence willful misconduct or bad faith of the indemnified person or entity certain antitakeover provisions of delaware law the companys certificate of incorporation and bylaws we have opted out of section  of the delaware general corporation law which we refer to as  section   regulating corporate takeovers such election becoming effective on november   instead our certificate of incorporation contains a provision that is substantially similar to section  but excludes our sponsor apollo and the cdm holders each of their successors certain affiliates and each of their respective transferees from the definition of interested stockholder section  prevents certain delaware corporations under certain circumstances from engaging in a business combination with        a stockholder who owns fifteen percent  or more of our outstanding voting stock otherwise known as an interested stockholder        an affiliate of an interested stockholder or        an associate of an interested stockholder for three years following the date that the stockholder became an interested stockholder a business combination includes a merger or sale of more than ten percent  of our assets however the above provisions of section  do not apply if        our board approves the transaction that made the stockholder an interested stockholder prior to the date of the transaction        after the completion of the transaction that resulted in the stockholder becoming an interested stockholder that stockholder owned at least eightyfive percent  of our voting stock outstanding at the time the transaction commenced other than statutorily excluded shares of common stock or        on or subsequent to the date of the transaction the business combination is approved by our board and authorized at a meeting of our stockholders and not by written consent by an affirmative vote of at least twothirds of the outstanding voting stock not owned by the interested stockholder    table of contents our certificate of incorporation provides that our board is classified into three classes of directors as a result in most circumstances a person can gain control of our board only by successfully engaging in a proxy contest at three or more annual meetings our certificate of incorporation requires the approval by affirmative vote of the holders of at least twothirds of our common stock to make any amendment to key provisions of our certificate of incorporation or bylaws in addition our certificate of incorporation does not provide for cumulative voting in the election of directors our board is empowered to elect a director to fill a vacancy created by the expansion of the board or the resignation death or removal of a director in certain circumstances and our advance notice provisions require that stockholders must comply with certain procedures in order to nominate candidates to our board or to propose matters to be acted upon at a stockholders meeting our authorized but unissued common stock and preferred stock are available for future issuances without stockholder approval and could be utilized for a variety of corporate purposes including future offerings to raise additional capital acquisitions and employee benefit plans the existence of authorized but unissued and unreserved common stock and preferred stock could render more difficult or discourage an attempt to obtain control of us by means of a proxy contest
