applied listing both the inventor and the company as copatent holders the estimated cost of a us patent application is between  and  us the company does not intend to market any of the products it accepts for patent application once a patent pending has been issued it is the company  s intent to sell the patent application to an individual or company who already operates within the same industry the company will negotiate with each inventor on the company  s equity share but the company  s standard offer will be  ownership in the invention  if the company is successful in taking an equity position it will provide the funds for making the patent application use its knowledge and expertise in arranging the filing of the patent application and it will sell the patent  all of these efforts will be the company  s alone with no participation or efforts of any other party the company will use the internet to markets services as well and attend some tradeshows that are specific to

relating to our companys future economic  performance  plans and objectives of management for future operations projections of revenue  mix  and  other financial items that are  based on the beliefs

expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify forwardlooking statements  the cautionary statements set forth in this section are intended to emphasize that actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement our auditor  s report on our december   financial statements expresses an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business since our officer and director may be unwilling or unable to loan or advance us additional capital we believe that if we do not raise additional capital over the next  months we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our business plans see  december   audited financial statements  auditors report    liquidity and capital resources as of december   all marketing solutions had nil cash on hand and in the bank and  of cash on hand and in the bank as of december   management believes this amount will not satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months or until such time that additional proceeds are raised we plan to satisfy our future cash requirements  primarily the working capital required for the development of our course guides and marketing campaign and to offset legal and accounting fees  by additional equity financing this will likely be in the form of private placements of common stock management believes that if subsequent private placements are successful we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof however additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements if all marketing solutions is unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a private placement offering it will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing which would be highly difficult for a new development stage company to secure therefore the company is highly dependent upon the success of the anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in all marketing solutions having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing which may not even be available to the company however if such financing were available because all marketing solutions is a development stage company with no revenue to date it would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate at such time these funds are required management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load if all marketing solutions cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its common stock or secure debt financing it would be required to cease business operations as a result investors in all marketing solutions common stock would lose all of their investment results of operations since december

sheet arrangements as of the date of this annual report the current funds available to the company will not be sufficient to continue operations the cost to establish the company and begin operations is estimated to be  over the next twelve months and the cost of maintaining our reporting status is estimated to be  over this same period the officer and director during this period nikola pizurica has undertaken to provide the company with operating capital to sustain the company  s business over the next twelve month period as the expenses are incurred in the form of a nonsecured loan however there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement  management believes that if the company cannot raise sufficient revenues or maintain its reporting status with the sec it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the company  as such any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety     other than the above described situation the company does not have

using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which those differences are expected to be recovered or settled  deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized  the effect on deferred tax

the respective carrying value of certain onbalancesheet financial instruments approximated their fair values these financial instruments include cash prepaid expenses and accounts payable fair values

issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission based on this assessment management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december   management  s annual report on internal control over financial reporting the matters involving internal controls and procedures that the company  s management considered to be material weaknesses under the standards of the public company accounting oversight board were  lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the companys board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures  inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives  insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of us gaap and sec disclosure requirements and  ineffective controls over period end financial disclosure and reporting processes the aforementioned material weaknesses were identified by the companys chief financial officer in connection with the audit of our financial statements as of december   and communicated the matters to our management management believes that the material weaknesses set forth in items   and  above did not have an affect on the companys financial results however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and lack of a majority of outside directors on the companys board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures can result in the companys determination to its financial statements for the future years   we are committed to improving our financial organization as part of this commitment we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to the company i appointing one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be

procedures and ii preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists which will set forth procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of us gaap and sec disclosure requirements management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on the companys board in addition management believes that preparing and implementing sufficient written policies and checklists will remedy the following material weaknesses i insufficient written policies and procedures for accounting and financial reporting with respect to the requirements and application of us gaap and sec disclosure requirements and ii ineffective controls over period end financial close and reporting processes further management believes that the hiring of additional personnel who have the technical expertise and knowledge will result proper segregation of duties and provide more checks and balances within the department additional personnel will also provide the cross training needed to support the company if personnel turn over issues within the department occur this coupled with the appointment of additional outside directors will greatly decrease any control and procedure issues the company may encounter in the future we will continue to monitor and evaluate the effectiveness of our internal controls and procedures and our internal controls over

managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this interim report contains forward looking statements relating to our companys future economic performance plans and objectives of management for future operations projections of revenue mix and other financial items that are based on the beliefs of as well as assumptions made by and information currently known to our management the words expects intends believes anticipates may could should and similar expressions and variations thereof are intended to identify forwardlooking statements the cautionary statements set forth in this section are intended to emphasize that actual results may differ materially from those contained in any forward looking statement our auditors report on our december   financial statements expresses an opinion that substantial doubt exists as to whether we can continue as an ongoing business since our officer and director may be unwilling or unable to loan or advance us additional capital we believe that if we do not raise additional capital over the next  months we may be required to suspend or cease the implementation of our business plans see december   audited financial statements  auditors report liquidity and capital resources as of december   all marketing solutions had nil cash on hand and in the bank and  of cash on hand and in the bank as of december   management believes this amount will not satisfy our cash requirements for the next twelve months or until such time that additional proceeds are raised we plan to satisfy our future cash requirements  primarily the working capital required for the development of our course guides and marketing campaign and to offset legal and accounting fees  by additional equity financing this will likely be in the form of private placements of common stock management believes that if subsequent private placements are successful we will be able to generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof however additional equity financing may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and thus we could fail to satisfy our future cash requirements if all marketing solutions is unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a private placement offering it will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing which would be highly difficult for a new development stage company to secure therefore the company is highly dependent upon the success of the anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in all marketing solutions having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing which may not even be available to the company however if such financing were available because all marketing solutions is a development stage company with no revenue to date it would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate at such time these funds are required management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load if all marketing solutions cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its common stock or secure debt financing it would be required to cease business operations as a result investors in all marketing solutions common stock would lose all of their investment results of operations since december   inception through december   the company has no revenues and has accumulated losses since inception of  for fiscal year ended december   we incurred operating expenses in the amount of  and a net loss of and  as compared to operating expenses of  and a net loss of  for the year ended december   the net loss

accounting fees related party expense of  comprised primarily of accounting expense off balance sheet arrangements as of the date of this annual report the current funds available to the company will not be sufficient to continue operations the cost to establish the company and begin operations is estimated to be  over the next twelve months and the cost of maintaining our reporting status is estimated to be  over this same period the officer and director during this period nikola pizurica has undertaken to provide the company with operating capital to sustain the companys business over the next twelve month period as the expenses are incurred in the form of a nonsecured loan however there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement management believes that if the company cannot raise sufficient revenues or maintain its reporting status with the sec it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the company as such any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety other than the above described situation the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect
