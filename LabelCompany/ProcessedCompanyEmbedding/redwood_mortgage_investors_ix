redwood mortgage corp manager    march  redwood mortgage investors ix a delaware limited liability company fair value per unit at december   background redwood mortgage corp rmc or manager obtained information regarding the fair value of a unit of membership interest and of net assets at december   the valuation date for redwood mortgage investors ix a delaware limited liability company rmi ix a qualified nationally prominent firm performed the analysis in accordance with scope criteria objectives and an overall approach set by rmc the purpose of their valuation was to provide an opinion of the fair value of a unit of membership interest which is determined principally by the fair value of the commercial mortgage loans held in portfolio collectively referred to as the “subject items” and the liquidity available to the members inclusive of redemption price and distribution factors the firm understood that the valuation report would be used by the manager for financial and regulatory reporting purposes specifically finra rule  and nasd rule  income including discounted cash flow methods market and cost approaches were utilized as appropriate in deriving the fair values fair value of a unit of membership interest for rmi ix based on the analysis summarized below rmc concurred with the firm’s conclusion that the fair value of a unit of membership interest as of the valuation date is  rmi ix membership units have certain restrictions as to transferability and redemption including maximums on individual and total annual and quarterly redemption amounts to provide liquidity members have the option after one year to sell their shares back to the company for  per unit adjusted for the years held one year –  of the lesser of the purchase price or the account balance two years –  three years –  four years –  five years and longer –  the following three methods for valuing the  per unit redemption price – considering these restrictions – are outlined below      the blackscholesmerten optionpricing model was used as a proxy or method to calculate the unit value the blackscholesmerton model is a mathematical formula used to calculate a theoretical call value using key determinants of an option’s price stock price strike price volatility time to expiration and shortterm riskfree interest rate the volatility is derived from the trading volatilities of companies comparable to rmi ix for a term commensurate with the expected term of maturity using these inputs the blackscholesmerton model produces an option value of  same as at year end       based on the average age of an investment in rmi ix of  years the redemption rate discount as outlined above would be at approximately  percent of the current membership units and a weighted average of  years until the shares can be redeemed at the contractual  based on the net asset value being above par and the limited redemptions since inception it appears highly likely the members would not redeem until fully vested the firm calculated the present value of the  unit value using a risk free rate of return over the remaining month period of  percent resulting in a calculated partnership unit value as of the valuation date of  same as at year end       based on the average age of an investment in rmi ix of  years the weighted average redemption percentage is  the rounded value of a unit based on this method for a  redemption amount before discount would be   at year end  this amount is considered to be the floor value valuation of the commercial mortgage loan portfolio the fair value of the loan portfolio is approximately  million representing a premium of approximately  million  from the book value redwood mortgage investors ix llc per unit fair value    p a g e      at december   rmi ix had a loan portfolio with a gross balance of  million these commercial mortgage loans were secured by singlefamily residences  percent apartments and condominiums  percent mixed use and retail  percent and other office commercial  industrial warehouse etc making up the remaining  percent the balances and key characteristics of each loan strata came from rmi ix’s loan trial balance and were classified into pools of like assets and then valued as appropriate the valuation work was completed in accordance with asc  from the codification of accounting standards published by the fasb which calls for a priority of valuation methods in the context of a loan portfolio valuation level  inputs are direct sale quotes for the specific loans level  inputs are sales of comparable loans and level  inputs require the use of management assumptions in determining the fair value of the loans the critical reasons for the lack of level  or  quotes are as follows     •   nonstandardization  mortgage and commercial real estate credit generally is specific to an in house lending policy borrower needs local market conditions and for rmc’s loans in particular which are of shorter term and lower ltv’s  the unique characteristics of the real property collateralizing the loans with the exception of certain types of mortgage credit the terms and conditions usually do not fit a conforming standard that are consistent across loans as such mortgage and commercial real estate loans often are not liquid and an inducement to investors requires a significant premium interests in some large loans are traded in the secondary market but generally with very low frequency the vast majority of loans never trade after origination and syndication     •   market preferences  in times of market turmoil fixedincome investors often pursue less risky investments such as us government bonds and bills agency securities and investment grade corporate bonds and notes to induce market investors to

management estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” requires management to make estimates and assumptions about the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements such estimates relate principally to the determination of the fair value of loans primarily loans designated impaired and the fair value of the related real estate collateral and real estate owned if any actual results could differ significantly from these estimates    redwood mortgage corp notes to the balance sheet december     note  – summary of significant accounting policies continued    fair value estimates gaap defines fair value as the exchange price that would be received for an asset or paid to transfer a liability an exit price in the principal or most advantageous market for the asset or liability in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date ie the balance sheet date an orderly transaction is a transaction that assumes exposure to the market for a period prior to the measurement date to allow for marketing activities that are usual and customary for transactions involving such assets and liabilities it is not a forced transaction market participants are buyers and sellers in the principal market that are i independent ii knowledgeable iii able to transact and iv willing to transact the company has no assets or liabilities recorded at fair value on a recurring basis fair values of assets and liabilities are determined based on the fair value hierarchy established in gaap the hierarchy is comprised of three levels of inputs to be used     •   level  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access at the measurement date an active market is a market in which transactions occur with sufficient frequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis     •   level  inputs are inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly in active markets and quoted prices for identical assets or liabilities that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable or inputs derived from or corroborated by market data     •   level  inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability unobservable inputs reflect the company’s own assumptions about the assumptions market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability including assumptions about risk unobservable inputs are developed based on the best information available in the circumstances and may include the partnership’s own data  brokerage rights mortgages net  formation loans rmc as a result of provisions in the agreements with the affiliated mortgage funds recognized as an asset its exclusive rights    to act as the loan broker in arranging mortgage loans    to act as servicing agent for all mortgages owned by the affiliated mortgage funds and    to be compensated by the affiliated mortgage funds for  loan brokerage commissions and  mortgage service fees loan brokerage commissions are paid to rmc when a loan is funded and mortgage servicing fees are earned by rmc during the time loans are outstanding the asset is referred to as brokerage rights mortgages    redwood mortgage corp notes to the balance sheet december     note  – summary of significant accounting policies continued  brokerage rights mortgages net  formation loans continued   the initial carrying values of these brokerage rights are the total of the amounts rmc pays for commissions and fees to brokerdealers on sales of limited partner or member interests in the affiliated mortgage funds plus unreimbursed organization and offering expenses o  o expenses if any from any offering of limited partners or member interests rmc advances certain o  o expenses on behalf of rmi ix as it had done for the other affiliated mortgage funds rmi ix is obligated to reimburse rmc for o  o expenses up to an amount equal to  of gross offering proceeds from sales of member units until rmc has been fully reimbursed thereafter rmi ix pays these costs directly the brokerage rights mortgages are amortized on an accelerated method over the approximated period loan brokerage commissions and servicing fees are expected to be earned by rmc rmc finances the payments of the commissions to brokerdealers during the offering period with advances from the particular affiliated mortgage fund collectively these advances are the formation loans the formation loans are noninterest bearing and are repaid as provided for by the entities’ operating agreements principally from the loan brokerage commissions earned by rmc accordingly from time to time as rmc has gone through periods of not earning or receiving loan brokerage commissions the repayment terms of the formation loans may be modified as proposed by the general partners as circumstances may warrant interest has been imputed on the formation loans at the market rate of interest in effect in the years of the offerings if the general partnersmanaging members are removed and rmc is no longer receiving payments for services rendered the related formation loan is forgiven and would be an offset to any impairment otherwise resulting to the carrying value of the brokerage rights mortgage loans at least annually rmc reviews the estimated amounts of future loan originations and the balances of loans being serviced to determine that the sum of the undiscounted net cash flows therefrom exceeds the carrying value of the brokeragerelated rights cash and cash equivalents the company considers all highly liquid financial instruments with maturities of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents periodically company cash balances in banks exceed federally insured limits loans advances and interest income loans and advances generally are stated at the unpaid principal balance principal real

carrying value of real estate to expected undiscounted future cash flows for the purpose of assessing the recoverability of the recorded amounts if the carrying value exceeds future undiscounted cash flows the assets are reduced to estimated fair value    redwood mortgage corp notes to the balance sheet december     note  – summary of significant accounting policies continued   fixed assets fixed
