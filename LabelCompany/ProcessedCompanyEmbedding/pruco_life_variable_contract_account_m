global advisors limited “templeton global” serve as subadvisers to the replacement fund and are affiliates of the existing fund administrator franklin advisers franklin mutual and templeton global are collectively referred to as the “ft subadvisers”  the substitution will replace an investment option ie the existing fund administered by an entity ie franklin templeton services llc that is not

option ie the replacement fund that is managed by investment managers ie prudential investments llc and ast investment services inc that are affiliated with the prudential insurance companies the investment managers may hire and replace unaffiliated subadvisers with the approval of asts board of trustees pursuant to an exemptive order issued to a predecessor prudential financial investment adviser inv co rel no  sept   the “multimanager order” the investment managers are authorized to enter into and amend subadvisory agreements without shareholder approval under certain conditions however substitution applicants and ast represent that the replacement fund will not change a subadviser add a new subadviser or otherwise rely on the multimanager order without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in subadviser the new subadviser or the replacement funds ability to add or to replace a subadviser in reliance on the multimanager order at an ast shareholder meeting the record date for which shall be after the proposed substitution has been effected in addition prior to the substitution the substitution applicants state that each contract owner will have been provided with the replacement fund prospectus describing the existence substance and effect of the multimanager order  the contracts are individual and group flexible premium variable variable with fixed options and variable with fixed and market value adjusted fixed options contracts the contracts permit the insurance companies to substitute shares of one fund with shares of another including a fund of a different registered investment company the prospectuses for the contracts and the separate accounts contain disclosures of this right the contracts which offer the existing fund securities are registered in the form n registration statements listed in footnotes  through  of the application  the existing fund is a “fund of funds” meaning that it seeks to achieve its investment goal by investing its assets in a combination of class  shares of the franklin income securities fund “franklin income”   mutual shares securities fund “mutual shares”   and templeton growth securities fund “templeton growth” and collectively with franklin income and mutual shares the “underlying ft funds” franklin income is managed by franklin advisers mutual shares is managed by franklin mutual and templeton growth is managed by templeton global the existing fund makes equal allocations to each of the underlying ft funds on a fixed percentage basis although the replacement fund will not operate as a “fund of funds” like the existing fund its overall investment strategy will be substantially identical to that of the existing fund franklin income franklin mutual and templeton global serve as subadvisers to the replacement fund each ft subadviser handles the daytoday investment management of approximately  of the replacement funds assets based upon the application of the specific investment strategy that it uses in connection with the corresponding underlying ft fund like the existing fund the percentage of replacement fund assets that is allocated to each investment strategy will be monitored and those allocations will be rebalanced when they are more than  above or below the goal of equal allocations to each of the three investment strategies a comparison of the investing strategies and risks of the existing fund and the replacement fund is included in the application the following table compares the fees and expenses of the existing fund and the replacement fund as of december     existing fund class replacement fundmanagement feesnonedistribution and service b feesnoneother expensesacquired fund fees and expenses—total annual fund operating expensesfee waiver andor expense reimbursement−−total annual fund operating expenses after fee waiver andor expense reimbursement  the existing fund does not pay a management fee but as a shareholder in the underlying funds indirectly bears its proportionate share of any management fees and other expenses paid by the underlying funds the management fees of each of the underlying funds based on each underlying funds average net assets for the fiscal year ended december   are franklin income securities fund  mutual shares securities fund  and templeton growth securities fund   the substitution applicants state that the substitutions are expected to benefit contract owners in a number of ways the replacement fund is a new series of ast and thus the replacement fund is part of the prudential annuity family of funds as such the insurance companies generally expect to learn of any changes affecting the replacement fund well in advance of their effectiveness thereby allowing the insurance companies to use the most efficient and least costly means to administer such changes eg by including the changes in other routine filings and planned mailings to contract owners the insurance companies believe that contract owners will benefit from this streamlining as the insurance companies enhance their communication efforts to contract owners and sales representatives regarding investment options further since the replacement fund is part of the prudential annuity family of funds the investment managers will provide rigorous oversight and monitoring of the replacement funds investment performance and its compliance with investment objectives policies and restrictions in addition the replacement fund unlike the existing fund is not a “fund of funds” and therefore can generally operate with more flexibility as described in more detail in the application a portion of the assets attributable to each of the three investment strategies used in connection with the replacement fund will be invested in certain types of derivatives and shortterm instruments to help maintain adequate portfolio liquidity such investments will provide for more effective and efficient fund management and operation during times of market volatility than the current fundoffunds structure further the replacement fund as a series of ast will have access to the prudential financial fund complexs credit facility which will also serve to potentially create efficiencies and cause less disruption to the orderly investment management of the replacement fund in times of market volatility and increased redemption activity the insurance companies will also realize the benefit of reduced production and mailing expenses with respect to the prospectus given that the replacement fund will be a series of ast with all disclosures concerning the replacement fund being included in the combined ast prospectus contract owners will benefit from consolidated and consistent fund disclosure the insurance company applicants believe that the replacement fund represents the best available match consistent with the goal of providing contract owners with a substitute investment option offering a lower expense ratio than the expense ratio of the existing fund further contract owners will be allowed a free transfer out of the existing fund before the substitution or out of the replacement fund after the substitution to any other investment option available under the applicable contract therefore any contract owner will be able without charge to switch to another investment option  for these reasons and the reasons discussed below the substitution applicants believe that substituting the replacement fund for the existing fund is appropriate and in the best interest of contract owners because the existing fund does not have an investment manager it does not directly pay any investment management fees the existing fund does however indirectly pay investment management fees in connection with its investments in the underlying ft funds in addition as shown in more detail in the application the estimated total operating expense ratio for the replacement fund will be lower than the net expense ratio for class  shares of the existing fund as set forth in its current prospectus there will be no increase in contract fees and expenses including mortality and expense risk fees and administration and distribution fees charged to the separate accounts as a result of the substitutions the substitution applicants believe that the replacement fund has an investment objective policies and a risk profile that are substantially the same as the existing fund thus making the replacement fund an appropriate candidate as a substitute in addition after the substitutions neither the investment managers nor any of their affiliates will receive compensation from the charges to the separate accounts related to the contracts or from revenue sharing from the replacement funds in excess of the compensation currently received from the administrator or distributors of the existing fund  by a supplement to the prospectuses for the contracts and the separate accounts each insurance company has notified all owners of the contracts affected by the substitutions of its intention to take the necessary actions including seeking the order requested by the application to substitute shares of the funds as described herein the supplement advised contract owners that from the date of the supplement until the date of the proposed substitution owners are permitted to make one transfer of contract value or annuity unit exchange out of the existing fund subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfer or exchange being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers or exchanges permitted without a transfer charge the supplement informed contract owners that the insurance company will not exercise any rights reserved under any contract to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least  days after the proposed substitution the supplement also informed contract owners that for at least  days following the proposed substitution the insurance companies will permit contract owners affected by the substitution to make one transfer of contract value or annuity unit exchange out of the replacement fund subaccount to one or more other subaccounts without the transfer or exchange being treated as one of a limited number of permitted transfers or exchanges or a limited number of transfers or exchanges permitted without a transfer charge  the proposed substitution will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the separate accounts  the substitution will be effected by a combination of inkind and cash transactions it is anticipated that the majority of the transactions will be effected inkind with the remainder being effected in cash with respect to inkind transactions it is intended that after receipt of the insurance companies redemption request the existing fund will redeem shares it holds in the ft underlying funds which request will be fulfilled by the ft underlying funds primarily in the form of underlying securities the existing fund will then fulfill the insurance companies redemption request with these inkind securities received from the ft underlying funds these inkind securities will then be contributed to the replacement fund to purchase shares of that fund all inkind redemptions from the existing fund of which any of the substitution applicants is an affiliated person will be effected in accordance with the conditions set forth in the commissions noaction letter issued to signature financial group inc available december   to the extent that the redemption request cannot be completed wholly through inkind securities the remainder of the substitution will be effected through the insurance companies redeeming shares of the existing fund for cash and using the cash to purchase shares of the replacement fund  contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed substitution nor will their rights or insurance companys obligations under the contracts be altered in any way all expenses incurred in connection with the proposed substitution including brokerage legal accounting and other fees and expenses will be paid by the insurance companies in addition the proposed substitution will not impose any tax liability on contract owners the proposed substitution will not cause the contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing contract owners to be greater after the proposed substitution than before the proposed substitution no fees will be charged on the transfers made at the time of the proposed substitution because the proposed substitution will not be treated as a transfer for the purpose of assessing transfer charges or for determining the number of remaining permissible transfers in a contract year  in addition to the prospectus supplements distributed to owners of contracts within five business days after the proposed substitution is completed contract owners will be sent a written notice informing them that the substitution was carried out and that they may make one transfer of any contract value invested in the replacement fund subaccount on the date of the notice to one or more other subaccounts available under their contract at no cost and without regard to the usual limit on the frequency of transfers among subaccounts or from the variable account options to the fixed account options the notice will also reiterate that other than with respect to “market timing” activity the insurance companies will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers or to impose any charges on transfers until at least  days after the proposed substitution the insurance companies will also send each contract owner a current prospectus for the replacement fund to the extent that they have not previously received a copy each insurance company also is seeking approval of the proposed substitution from any state insurance regulators whose approval may be necessary or appropriate legal analysis and conditions section c relief  the substitution applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section c of the act approving the proposed substitution section c of the act requires the depositor of a registered unit investment trust holding the securities of a single issuer to obtain commission approval before substituting the securities held by the trust  the contracts permit the applicable insurance company subject to compliance with applicable law to substitute shares of another investment company for shares of an investment company held by a subaccount of the separate accounts the prospectuses for the contracts and the separate accounts contain disclosure of this right the replacement fund is anticipated to have a lower total expense ratio than the existing fund the insurance companies believe that it is in the best interests of the contract owners to substitute the replacement fund for the existing fund the substitution applicants believe that the ft subadvisers will over the long term be positioned to provide at least comparable performance to that of the existing fund through their equal investments in the underlying ft funds because the underlying ft funds are managed by the same entities  the proposed substitution is not of the type that section c was designed to prevent unlike traditional unit investment trusts where a depositor could only substitute an investment security in a manner which permanently affected all the investors in the trust the contracts provide each contract owner with the right to exercise his or her own judgment and transfer contract or cash values into other subaccounts moreover the contracts will offer contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts into any of the remaining subaccounts without cost or other disadvantage the proposed substitution therefore will not result in the type of costly forced redemption which section c was designed to prevent the proposed substitution also is unlike the type of substitution which section c was designed to prevent in that by purchasing a contract contract owners select much more than a particular investment company in which to invest their account values they also select the specific type of insurance coverage offered by an insurance company under their contract as well as numerous other rights and privileges set forth in the contract  the substitution applicants and ast agree that for the two year period commencing on the date of the substitution the total annual fund operating expenses of the replacement fund net of reimbursement and waivers will be capped at a level equal to the existing funds total annual fund operating expenses net of reimbursement and waivers of  of average daily net assets in addition the substitution applicants and ast have agreed to permanently cap the management fee of the replacement fund at  of average daily net assets  the substitution applicants submit that the proposed substitution meets the standards set forth in section c and assert that the replacement of the existing fund with the replacement fund is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the  act section b relief  the section  applicants request an order under section b of the act exempting them from the provisions of section a to the extent necessary to permit the prudential insurance companies to carry out the proposed substitution as described herein  section a of the act in relevant part prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such person acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company section a of the act generally prohibits the persons described above acting as principals from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered company  because shares held by a separate account of an insurance company are legally owned by the insurance company the prudential insurance companies and their affiliates collectively own of record substantially all of the shares of each of the various series of ast and will also own such with respect to the replacement fund upon its commencement of operations therefore ast and each of its respective series could be deemed to be under the control of the prudential insurance companies for purposes of the act notwithstanding the fact that contract owners may be considered the beneficial owners of those shares held in the separate accounts for certain purposes if ast and each of its respective series are deemed to be under the control of the prudential insurance companies for purposes of the act then each prudential insurance company could be deemed to be an affiliated person of ast and each of its respective series within the meaning of section a of the act likewise if the prudential insurance companies are deemed to control ast and each of its respective series for purposes of the act then ast and each of its respective series could be deemed to be affiliated persons of the prudential insurance companies within the meaning of section a of the act regardless of whether or not the prudential insurance companies are considered to control ast and each of its respective series within the meaning of section a of the act because the prudential insurance companies own of record more than  of the shares of each series of ast the prudential insurance companies could be deemed to be affiliated persons of ast and each of its respective series within the meaning of section a of the act notwithstanding the foregoing because the prudential insurance companies and the investment managers are under the common control of prudential financial the prudential insurance companies could be deemed to be affiliated persons of an affiliated person ie the investment managers of a registered investment company ie ast and each of its respective series for purposes of section a of the act because the substitution may be effected in whole or in part by means of inkind redemptions of shares of the existing fund and inkind purchases of shares of the replacement fund the substitution may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated persons the proposed transactions could be deemed to involve the transfer of portfolio securities held by the underlying ft funds through the existing fund to the prudential insurance companies and the simultaneous purchase by the prudential insurance companies of shares of the replacement fund using such portfolio securities as consideration as a practical matter the custodian for the replacement fund will receive such transferred assets from the custodians for the existing fund and underlying ft funds accordingly as the prudential insurance companies and the existing fund and the prudential insurance companies and the replacement fund could be viewed as firsttier or secondtier affiliates of one another under section a of the act it is conceivable that this aspect of the substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by section a of the act as a result the section  applicants have determined that it is prudent to seek relief from section a in the context of this application for the inkind purchases of replacement fund shares by the prudential insurance companies and the inkind sales of replacement fund shares to the prudential insurance companies  the section  applicants submit that for all the reasons stated in the application the terms of the proposed inkind purchases of shares of the replacement fund by the prudential insurance companies including the consideration to be paid and received as described in this application are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the section  applicants also submit that the proposed inkind purchases by the prudential insurance companies of replacement fund shares are consistent with the policies of ast and the replacement fund as recited in their current registration statements and reports filed under the act finally the section  applicants submit that the proposed substitution is consistent with the general purposes of the act to the extent that the inkind purchases by the prudential insurance companies of the replacement funds shares are deemed to involve principal transactions among firsttier or secondtier affiliates for purposes of section a of the act the procedures described below should be sufficient to assure that the terms of the proposed transactions are reasonable and fair to all participants the section  applicants maintain that the terms of the proposed inkind purchase transactions including the consideration to be paid and received by each fund involved are reasonable fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in rule a the one condition of rule a that the section  applicants will not comply with is the condition requiring that the transaction be a purchase or sale for no consideration other than cash payment against prompt delivery of a security for which market quotations are readily available the proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of section c of the act and rule c thereunder with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in any of the separate accounts contract owners will not suffer any adverse tax consequences as a result of the substitution the fees and charges under the contracts will not increase because of the substitution even though the separate accounts the prudential insurance companies and ast may not rely on rule a the section  applicants believe that the rules conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons the section  applicants assert that where as here they or the relevant investment company would comply with all but one of the conditions of the rule as described above the commission should consider the extent to which they would meet these or other similar conditions and issue an order if the protections of the rule would be provided in substance  the board of ast has adopted procedures as required by paragraph e of rule a under the act pursuant to which the replacement fund may purchase and sell securities to and from its affiliates the board of ast will conduct its review of the transactions in the same manner that it normally would follow in accordance with rule a under the act the section  applicants will carry out the proposed prudential insurance companies inkind purchases in conformity with all of the conditions of rule a and asts procedures thereunder except that the consideration paid for the securities being purchased or sold may not be entirely cash nevertheless the circumstances surrounding the proposed substitution will be such as to offer the same degree of protection to the replacement fund from overreaching that rule a provides to it generally in connection with its purchase and sale of securities under that rule in the ordinary course of its business in particular the prudential insurance companies or any of their affiliates cannot effect the proposed transactions at a price that is disadvantageous to the replacement fund although the transactions may not be entirely for cash each will be effected based upon  the independent market price of the portfolio securities valued as specified in paragraph b of rule a and  the net asset value per share of each fund involved valued in accordance with the procedures disclosed in its respective investment company registration statement and as required by rule c under the act no brokerage commission fee or other remuneration will be paid to any party in connection with the proposed inkind purchase transactions  the sale of shares of the replacement fund for investment securities as contemplated by the proposed prudential insurance companies inkind purchases is consistent with the investment policies and restrictions of the replacement fund because  the shares are sold at their net asset value  each of the ft subadvisers also serves as the investment manager for the relevant underlying ft fund  each of the ft subadvisers will implement the same investment strategy for the replacement fund that it uses to manage the corresponding underlying ft fund and  the assets of the replacement fund will be equally divided among the three relevant investment strategies in exactly the same manner as the existing fund equally divides its assets among the three underlying ft funds the portfolio securities are of the type and quality that the replacement fund would have acquired with the proceeds from the sale of shares of the existing fund had the shares of the existing fund been sold for cash to assure that this condition is met as applicable the investment managers and the subadvisers for the replacement fund will examine the portfolio securities being offered to the replacement fund and accept only those securities as consideration for shares that it would have acquired for each such fund in a cash transaction conclusion for the reasons and upon the facts set forth above and in the application the substitution applicants and the section  applicants believe that the requested orders meet the standards set forth in section c of the act and section b of the act respectively and should therefore be granted for the commission by the division of investment management under delegated authority kevin m oneill deputy secretary footnotes   the replacement fund has no assets and has not yet commenced operations as of the date hereof the estimated fees and expenses of the replacement fund are however based in part on assumed average daily net assets of approximately  billion for the replacement fund ie the approximate amount of net assets that would have been acquired from the existing fund had the substitution been completed as of december   for the fiscal period ending december   back to citation fr doc  filed   am billing code p published document home home sections
