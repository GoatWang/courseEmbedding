site commercial site sewer  drainage structures utility highway custom products credit application who we are our story  to present our company was founded in  by george r roberts george was an excavating contractor who wanted to grow his business by installing septic tanks as his business grew he found that septic tanks were not always available when needed so rather than relying on someone else and working around their schedule he decided to begin making them himself this “side” business of manufacturing and delivering precast concrete septic tanks soon outgrew the excavating business so he began making septic tanks on a fulltime basis the business grew through the ’s ’s and early ’s by specializing in residential and lightcommercial concrete products up to that point in time the shop was located on federal street in alfred maine adjacent to the roberts home in  george and his wife gladys decided that the company had outgrown its original facility and moved the business to its current location on route  in alfred in  the company was purchased by allan martin and william nichols al and bill’s mission was to grow the company into a regional leader in the precast concrete industry under the daily leadership of al martin the company expanded into the commercial market by adding manholes and catch basins commercial septic tanks sewage pumping stations and utility products the company grew at a tremendous rate during this time mirroring the regional construction industries growth in  the company expanded into the precast step business the step guys have become an integral part of the company’s product mix experiencing steady growth year after year after guiding the company’s growth for  years al martin retired from onsite activity in  at that time al promoted longtime employee tim cook to president of the company under tim’s direction the company continued to grow and in  a new  square foot production building was built the new building houses two  ton overhead bridge cranes doubling the previous lifting capacity at the george roberts company in january of  after  years at the helm of george roberts and  years overall tim decided to leave the company for an opportunity much closer to home so al selected steve ray a year employee of the company and a year precast concrete veteran to take over as president of the george roberts after more than  years in business the george r roberts company strives to be a key partner with all of its customers our emphasis on customer support prompt service and quality products has allowed us to
