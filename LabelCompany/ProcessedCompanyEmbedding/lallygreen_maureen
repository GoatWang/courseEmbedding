of article foregoing retirement maureen lallygreen became the first female to serve as dean of duquesne university school of law on july  after a year as interim dean as a judge of the superior court of pennsylvania she chaired the gender fairness and implementation committee as well as the group that developed and proposed to the supreme court a nondiscrimination policy and procedures for the judicial branch of government which was adopted and became effective in  she talked about experiencing duquesne in multiple roles and why she’ll continue to teach what appealed to you about leading duquesne’s school of law enlarge maureen lallygreen is the dean of the duquesne university school of law joe wojcik i went here as an undergraduate and at the law school i was a professor here for many years and always stayed close the appeal to me was the opportunity to not only give back in terms of my personal involvement but also to work with students as they meet the challenges associated with the practice of law in effect you’re reporting to your predecessor since duquesne’s president kenneth gormley is the former dean what’s that like he knows my issues i’m committed to some of the things he began here and he’s committed to listening to my ideas we work together well and we’re at a very different level probably than most people in these positions i just think he gets it what drew you to a career in the law what turned the switch for me was meeting a woman who was a graduate of duquesne law judge carol los mansmann she was working in the district attorney’s office and people at duquesne said i should meet her while i was making my decision about whether to go to law school i’d taken the lsat but wasn’t sure about what i wanted to do when i sat down with her she was so inspirational that i made the decision and went to law school she ended up being a judge on the us district court for the western district of pennsylvania and then became a judge on the us court of appeals for the third circuit did her example stir your interest in serving on the bench i’m sure carol’s experience and others’ experiences added to the attraction but a lot of the work i did was in the appellate round and i loved that arena so when the opportunity came around it was not a hard choice what is the biggest challenge for duquesne university school of law to create an educational opportunity for the students that meets their needs and goals which is part of our mission in a context of ethics and professionalism to prepare them for the jobs that exist now or will exist in the future the practice of law has shifted and it’s no longer the way it was 0 years ago or even 0 years ago from your years on the state superior court bench was there a case that stands out to you maybe a benchmark in your career as a judge it’s not so much a case but the opportunity to work on a problem so it’s no longer a problem or at least minimized such as policies on nondiscrimination on the basis of race or gender it really opened my eyes will you continue to teach yes in the fall i’ll be coteaching appellate practice and procedure a course i’ve taught before and in the spring i’ll coteach governance compliance and risk management why is it important to you to do this when one teaches one is certainly informed by the students from the questions they ask and the goals they set for themselves i think it’s a great way to keep a pulse on who we’re serving so that you can better serve them it does take a lot of time but that’s ok teaching is a privilege in my view it’s a wonderful opportunity to work with those who’ll be the next generation of lawyers if you weren’t in your current position what would you be doing i was trying to be retired i don’t think there’s another path for me would you doover any part of your career i actually don’t look back i’m just grateful you go through things and say “oh lord what is this experience going to evolve to be” in retrospect it usually was something that taught me a lot i certainly wouldn’t change any of the people they all taught me good lessons of life and certainly many many took the time to mentor me and give me opportunities even though it didn’t seem like a straight path it allowed me to grow in ways i never thought i’d grow if you could change jobs for a day with anyone who would it be — and why a member of the us supreme court your husband stephen ross green is also a lawyer now retired so did it help you having shared lives and a shared profession it was terrific he understood my life and i understood his he was more in banking and patents different stuff than i worked with people always ask “did you argue a lot” not really we could discuss topics and he might have a different perspective what haven’t you achieved that you still want to do i want to be a grandma my oldest daughter is pregnant and we’re awaiting a baby in the fall correctionclarification a question in an
