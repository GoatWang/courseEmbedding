nav discount  most recent distribution paid or declared to todays date subject to change in the future there is no guarantee that the fund will declare dividends  distribution rates are calculated by annualizing the most recent distribution paid or declared through todays date and then dividing by the most recent market price the distribution consists of the sum of net investment income net realized shortterm capital gains net realized longterm capital gains and return of capital distribution rates may vary any distribution adjustment will not be reflected until after the declaration
