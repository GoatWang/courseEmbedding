can greatly reduce labor and utility costs slms top service tipsyour tank type water heater  percent of your gas bill loses its original efficiency up to  after the first year’s use and even more as it is used lime deposits begin to settle in the bottom of the tank causing an additional layer of residue buildup this layer will thicken and the burner has to heat the water through the tank and the lime buildup a deliming chemical kit is available for most tanktype water heaters this kit will help eliminate the existing lime in your tank and keep it running more efficiently but this is not the easiest thing to do and special bypass valves are needed to prevent this chemical from going to your washersreduce the temperature of your water heater to  degrees water heaters above  degrees will use  more gas than the degree settingmake sure your water heaters and dryers have enough fresh or makeup air the dexter  lb singlepocket dryer requires a minimum of one square foot of fresh outside air and the stack dryers require a minimum of one and a half square feet of outside air most water heaters are two square feet if youre not sure call us and well take a look for youlower the time per cycle per quarter if youre still on  minutes youre definitely not making any money lower your time to  minutes  minutes lowered to  minutes  or   minutes reduced to  minutes if you own a computer type of dryer you have the luxury of also raising the cool down time thus not allowing the burners to come on during this periodkeep your lint screen area vacuumed or blown out this will improve the airflow and allow your customers clothes to dry fastertake your burners out at least once a year and clean them youll be surprised at the amount of rust that comes out of themlast but surely not least consider raising the vend price of your washers up another quarter most of you have never done this and while you have remained at your original vend prices your utility costs have steadily increased

recent quotes from research analysts about slm corporation stock  according to zacks investment research sallie mae’s shares significantly outperformed the zacks categorized consumer loan industry over the last six months further estimates have remained stable ahead of the company’s q earnings release also the company has positive earnings surprises in recent quartersthe company is focused on strengthening its private education loan assets and revenues maintaining a strong capital position and introducing multiple complementary new products the economic recovery and declining unemployment rate should help sallie mae maintain its leading position in the student lending market further sallie mae’s profitability is likely to be supported by recently approved financial choice act however a competitive business environment and escalating expenses remain nearterm concerns further sallie mae faces concentration risk due to over dependence on brokered deposits   wedbush analysts commented we are initiating coverage on slm corp slm with an outperform rating and a  price target slm is the largest private student loan originator in the country accounting for over  of private originations over the last three years growth in private student loan balances has been significant loan quality stable and adjusted eps increased at an annualized rate of  we think these trends will continue over the next three to five years   jefferies group llc analysts commented slm reported q eps of  beating both our estimate and consensus of  we classify q as another solid quarter with strong fundamentals including continued strong topline growth consistent credit and strong expense controls preliminary  guidance implies  growth at the midpoint which is inline consensus and reflects strong secular growth we consider the growth factors very appealing and continue to favor slm results versus our model net interest income of m beat our forecast of m while noninterest income of m was slightly lower than our m forecast the provision for loan losses of m exceeded our m estimate somewhat offsetting the topline beat although we note that credit remains very stable ie ncos were down meaningfully from year ago results in addition noninterest expense of m was slightly better than our estimate of m and produced an efficiency ratio of  versus our  forecast   barclays plc analysts commented we hosted two days of investor meetings with slm overall we came away with a reinforced view on the longterm growth prospects of the stock if anything we are probably more bullish now prior to the election slm was already a robust growth story but had some warranted legislative risks now those risks at a minimum are off the table in our view and instead we think the legislativeregulatory landscape has become more supportive to private student lending and could actually create catalysts slm could benefit from any one or a combination of potential catalysts that include lower corporate taxes reduction in federal student lending and a much less likely revival of the ffelp program in some form while the stock has rallied  vs  spx since  slm trades at x  eps and still at a discount to the broader smidcap bank group x and also a discount to our dcf driven pt of  up from  reflecting a lower discount rate ultimately we think that none of these catalysts are fully priced in so owning slm here provides a free call option on eps upside from these potential catalysts in our view  who are some of slm corporations key competitors some companies that are related to slm corporation include
