governance education  insight transition navigation we take a disciplined and active approach to building investment strategies that meet the distinct missions of our nonprofit clients now and into the future focused investment policy we are experienced in leading nonprofit organizations through the process of articulating what they want to accomplish with their assets and determining an investment program tailored to meet these objectives most organizations come to us at a transition point often when they find themselves in control of a growing pool of financial assets they can no longer manage on their own we help develop an investment policy statement to clearly lay out the endowments goals and risk tolerance cash flow needs and return targets consistent with their overall objectives individualized asset allocation viewing asset allocation as a critical longterm strategy we work closely with foundations to develop an asset allocation strategy that reflects their particular needs and circumstances we start by gaining an understanding of what clients need to accomplish with their assets including program operation grant making administrative costs inflation protection and real return over time based on these factors we design an asset allocation framework to meet a specific target rate of return at an appropriate level of risk we concentrate on core asset classes we believe will provide the most effective diversification benefits skillfully blending complementary investment managers who focus on bonds stocks and alternative investments that we expect to deliver the nonprofits target return and meet the required payout ratio active manager selection  evaluation our goal is to find the best manager in each asset class for a client’s specific allocation our rigorous manager search and selection process incorporates not only an analysis of a managers past performance but also a determination of whether a manager has the tools to keep performing at that same high level once our investment committee approves a manager for a particular asset class the manager becomes our best advice manager so every client receives that best advice in this way we demonstrate our accountability for the advice ensure no one client is favored over another and focus our resources on the managers we believe are the best not merely satisfactory since we meet with hundreds of prospective managers annually we can effectively analyze existing managers in a new client portfolio as well as work with existing clients who want to consider managers they have identified on their own ongoing performance monitoring approved managers are rigorously monitored on a regular basis we track monthly returns speak with managers by phone frequently and expect to meet with them at their office at least once a year whether in the united states or abroad we measure the ongoing performance of individual managers and of the investment program as a whole and compare it with relevant benchmarks we measure account returns against a blended benchmark and absolute return target on a quarterly basis individual managers are judged against relevant index returns as well as our firm’s established requirements detailed reviewing  reporting we review our clients asset allocation and thirdparty managers on an ongoing basis and make or recommend changes as appropriate we report to clients on a quarterly basis and strive to deliver our investment reviews and accompanying narrative within  days after the end of each calendar quarter our reports contain
