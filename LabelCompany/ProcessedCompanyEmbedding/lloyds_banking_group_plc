banking group upon completion of the takeover on  january  on  february  eric daniels the ceo of the group was questioned about the banking crisis during a session of the treasury select committee of the house of commons one of the key issues concerned lloyds takeover of hbos and the amount of due diligence carried out before the acquisition daniels said that a company would always like to do more due diligence on another company but there are legal limits on how much is possible before an actual acquisition losses were slightly more than the £ billion originally identified by the due diligence owing to writeoffs of property loans because of falling property prices and the lack of demand for it the thenchairman of lloyds sir victor blank said in august  that losses had been at the worst end of expectations and that the lloyds board was surprised by the speed at which the losses—which were caused by the unexpectedly sharp contraction of the world economy in late  and early —happened this position was confirmed by archie kane a senior lloyds executive in scotland in evidence to the scottish parliaments economy committee in december  on  february  lloyds banking group said that the

avert a collapse of the financial sector barclays avoided taking a capital investment from the uk government by raising capital privately and hsbc moved capital to its uk business from its other businesses overseas it was later confirmed that lloyds tsb would have been required by the financial services authority fsa to take additional capital from the government if it had not taken over hbos after the recapitalisations and lloyds acquisition of hbos the uk government held a  stake in lloyds banking group february to june edit in february  after it became apparent that the recession would be deeper than originally anticipated the fsa was instructed to stress test the banks against a severe economic downturn the fsa stated that the assumptions underlying the stress test were not intended to be a forecast of what was likely to happen but to simulate a near catastrophic economic scenario these assumptions included a peaktotrough fall in uk gross domestic product gdp of over  with no growth until  and returning to trendrate growth in  a rise in uk unemployment to just over  a  peaktotrough fall in uk house prices a  peaktotrough fall in uk commercial property prices the conclusion from this exercise was that lloyds would need additional capital if such a scenario ever occurred because the wholesale funding markets were effectively closed at the time in march  lloyds made a deal with the uk government consisting of two elements redemption of preference shares the £ billion of preference nonvoting shares held by ukfi were repaid on  june  following the issue of new

available to existing shareholders through an open offer at  pence that closed on  june — were taken up the remaining  were placed in the market on  june  at  pence this open offer and placing was underwritten by the treasury if none of these new ordinary shares had been bought by existing shareholders or the open market the government—as underwriters of the deal—would have bought them and

governments asset protection scheme to insure it against potential future losses on previous loans—primarily on the old hbos portfolio the fee for this would have been paid for by the issue to the

rights issue to raise capital from existing shareholders as an existing  shareholder the government chose to take part in this and thus maintained its shareholding at  following this the national audit office calculated the governments average buying price for its entire stake in lloyds to be about  pence it was announced in the governments prebudget report on  december  that the forecast for the total loss to taxpayers for all the bank bailouts had been reduced from £ billion to £ billion—in part because of the restructuring of the governments asset protection scheme the final part of the

of the group was questioned about the banking crisis during a session of the treasury select committee of the house of commons one of the key issues concerned lloyds takeover of hbos and the amount of due diligence carried out before the acquisition daniels said that a company would always like to do more due diligence on another company but there are legal limits on how much is possible before an actual acquisition losses were slightly more than the £ billion originally identified by the due diligence owing to writeoffs of property loans because of falling property prices and the lack of demand for it the thenchairman of lloyds sir victor blank said in august  that losses had been at the worst end of expectations and that the lloyds board was surprised by the speed at which the losses—which were caused by the unexpectedly sharp contraction of the world economy in late  and early —happened this position was confirmed by archie kane a senior lloyds executive in scotland in

in lloyds banking group february to june edit in february  after it became apparent that the recession would be deeper than originally anticipated the fsa was instructed to stress test the banks against a severe economic downturn the fsa stated that the assumptions underlying the stress test were not intended to be a forecast of what was likely to happen but to simulate a near catastrophic economic scenario these assumptions included a peaktotrough fall in uk gross domestic product gdp of over  with no growth until  and returning to trendrate growth in  a rise in uk unemployment to just over  a  peaktotrough fall in uk house prices a  peaktotrough fall in uk commercial property prices the conclusion from this exercise was that lloyds would need additional capital if such a scenario ever occurred because the wholesale funding markets were effectively closed at the time in march  lloyds made a deal with the uk government consisting of two elements redemption of preference shares the £ billion of preference nonvoting shares held by ukfi were repaid on  june  following the issue of new ordinary shares—this avoided the payment of £ million annual interest to the treasury and

hbos shareholders overwhelming approved the deal on  december lloyds tsb group changed its name to lloyds banking group upon completion of the takeover on  january  on  february  eric daniels the ceo of the group was questioned about the banking crisis during a session of the treasury select committee of the house of commons one of the key issues concerned lloyds takeover of hbos and the amount of due diligence carried out before the acquisition daniels said that a company would always like to do more due diligence on another company but there are legal limits on how much is possible before an actual acquisition losses were slightly more than the £ billion originally identified by the due diligence owing to writeoffs of property loans because of falling property prices and the lack of demand for it the thenchairman of lloyds sir victor blank said in august  that losses had been at the worst end of expectations and that the lloyds board was surprised by the speed at which the losses—which were caused by the unexpectedly sharp contraction of the world economy in late  and early —happened this position was confirmed by archie kane a senior lloyds executive in scotland in evidence to the scottish parliaments economy committee in december  on  february  lloyds banking group said that the losses at hbos were greater than had been anticipated at around £ billion the share

from the uk government by raising capital privately and hsbc moved capital to its uk business from its other businesses overseas it was later confirmed that lloyds tsb would have been required by the financial services authority fsa to take additional capital from the government if it had not taken over hbos after the recapitalisations and lloyds acquisition of hbos the uk government held a  stake in lloyds banking group february to june edit in february  after it became apparent that the recession would be deeper than originally anticipated the fsa was instructed to stress test the banks against a severe economic downturn the fsa stated that the assumptions underlying the stress test were not intended to be a forecast of what was likely to happen but to simulate a near catastrophic economic scenario these assumptions included a peaktotrough fall in uk gross domestic product gdp of over  with no growth until  and returning to trendrate growth in  a rise in uk unemployment to just over  a  peaktotrough fall in uk house prices a  peaktotrough fall in uk commercial property prices the conclusion from this exercise was that lloyds would need additional capital if such a scenario ever occurred because the wholesale funding markets were effectively closed at the time in march  lloyds made a deal with the uk government consisting of two elements redemption of preference shares the £ billion of preference nonvoting shares held by ukfi were repaid on  june  following the issue of new ordinary shares—this avoided the payment of £ million annual interest to the treasury and

 pence it was announced in the governments prebudget report on  december  that the forecast for the total loss to taxpayers for all the bank bailouts had been reduced from £ billion to £ billion—in

hbos shareholders overwhelming approved the deal on  december lloyds tsb group changed its name to lloyds banking group upon completion of the takeover on  january  on  february  eric daniels the ceo of the group was questioned about the banking crisis during a session of the treasury select committee of the house of commons one of the key issues concerned lloyds takeover of hbos and the amount of due diligence carried out before the acquisition daniels said that a company would always like to do more due diligence on another company but there are legal limits on how much is possible before an actual acquisition losses were slightly more than the £ billion originally identified by the due diligence owing to writeoffs of property loans because of falling property prices and the lack of demand for it the thenchairman of lloyds sir victor blank said in august  that losses had been at the worst end of expectations and that the lloyds board was surprised by the speed at which the losses—which were caused by the unexpectedly sharp contraction of the world economy in late  and early —happened this position was confirmed by archie kane a senior lloyds executive in scotland in evidence to the scottish parliaments economy committee in december  on  february  lloyds banking group said that the losses at hbos were greater than had been anticipated at around £ billion the share

billion € billion of new capital into major uk banks—including royal bank of scotland group lloyds tsb and hbos—to avert a collapse of the financial sector barclays avoided taking a capital investment from the uk government by raising capital privately and hsbc moved capital to its uk business from its other businesses overseas it was later confirmed that lloyds tsb would have been required by the financial services authority fsa to take additional capital from the government if it had not taken over hbos after the recapitalisations and lloyds acquisition of hbos the uk government held a  stake in lloyds banking group february to june edit in february  after it became apparent that the recession would be deeper than originally anticipated the fsa was instructed to stress test the banks against a severe economic downturn the fsa stated that the assumptions underlying the stress test were not intended to be a forecast of what was likely to happen but to simulate a near catastrophic economic scenario these assumptions included a peaktotrough fall in uk gross domestic product gdp of over  with no growth until  and returning to trendrate growth in  a rise in uk unemployment to just over  a  peaktotrough fall in uk house prices a  peaktotrough fall in uk commercial property prices the conclusion from this exercise was that lloyds would need additional capital if such a scenario ever occurred because the wholesale funding markets were effectively closed at the time in march  lloyds made a deal with the uk government consisting of two elements redemption of preference shares the £ billion of preference nonvoting shares held by ukfi were repaid on  june  following the issue of new ordinary shares—this avoided the payment of £ million annual interest to the treasury and

november  that lloyds would not enter the scheme—although rbs still would instead lloyds launched a rights issue to raise capital from existing shareholders as an existing  shareholder the government chose to take part in this and thus maintained its shareholding at  following this the national audit office calculated the governments average buying price for its entire stake in lloyds to be about  pence it was announced in the governments prebudget report on  december  that the forecast for the total loss to taxpayers for all the bank bailouts had been reduced from £ billion to £ billion—in

of the group was questioned about the banking crisis during a session of the treasury select committee of the house of commons one of the key issues concerned lloyds takeover of hbos and the amount of due diligence carried out before the acquisition daniels said that a company would always like to do more due diligence on another company but there are legal limits on how much is possible before an actual acquisition losses were slightly more than the £ billion originally identified by the due diligence owing to writeoffs of property loans because of falling property prices and the lack of demand for it the thenchairman of lloyds sir victor blank said in august  that losses had been at the worst end of expectations and that the lloyds board was surprised by the speed at which the losses—which were caused by the unexpectedly sharp contraction of the world economy in late  and early —happened this position was confirmed by archie kane a senior lloyds executive in scotland in

financial services authority fsa to take additional capital from the government if it had not taken over hbos after the recapitalisations and lloyds acquisition of hbos the uk government held a  stake in lloyds banking group february to june edit in february  after it became apparent that the recession would be deeper than originally anticipated the fsa was instructed to stress test the banks against a severe economic downturn the fsa stated that the assumptions underlying the stress test were not intended to be a forecast of what was likely to happen but to simulate a near catastrophic economic scenario these assumptions included a peaktotrough fall in uk gross domestic product gdp of over  with no growth until  and returning to trendrate growth in  a rise in uk unemployment to just over  a  peaktotrough fall in uk house prices a  peaktotrough fall in uk commercial property prices the conclusion from this exercise was that lloyds would need additional capital if such a scenario ever occurred because the wholesale funding markets were effectively closed at the time in march  lloyds made a deal with the uk government consisting of two elements redemption of preference shares the £ billion of preference nonvoting shares held by ukfi were repaid on  june  following the issue of new ordinary shares—this avoided the payment of £ million annual interest to the treasury and

 pence it was announced in the governments prebudget report on  december  that the forecast for the total loss to taxpayers for all the bank bailouts had been reduced from £ billion to £ billion—in

this month lloyds banking group plc announced it was preparing to compensate customers holding structured products with lloyds itself and its investment arm scottish widows after a case of misselling came to light according to various reports over  consumers were affected with the bank facing a payout of over £m the case highlighted the acorn market linked deposit fund and the protected capital solutions fund which we understand were sold in branch between  and  by staff who were subject to reduced income if they did not sell to meet targets these investments ultimately turned out to be somewhat more convoluted and less attractive than investors were led to believe regulators agreed the bank was in breach of the principle of providing fair clear and not misleading promotions because it provided the consumer with a misleading impression of the likely return over the years we’ve seen some poor value and complicated structured products we’ve publicly warned about some of these and written privately to the regulator about others because we’re passionate about structured products and hate to see cases like this potentially damage the reputation of the sector the regulatory action will serve to improve the situation for those effected as well as reduce the potential for a reoccurrence and these are obviously good outcomes but if the headlines serve to deter investors away from sound wellconstructed fairly charged structured investments then the wider consumer outcomes are not all positive whilst past performance is not a guarantee of the future the average return from all of the structured products in our database that matured last year was  per annum over an average term of approximately four years four months whilst still being respectable the returns were lower than in recent years our ‘preferred’ products fared somewhat better many of us who utilise these investments in our portfolios are at a loss to understand why others don’t far too often it transpires that it is headlines like those that the lloyds story commanded serving as a deterrent because the investor fears they must be missing something an important point to appreciate from this story is that lloyds failed to comply with the requirement that its promotions were “clear fair and notmisleading” from this you can be sure that no provider will risk such a breach and more importantly that you as a consumer have a right to expect any structured or other investment promotion or literature to be clear fair and not misleading they will do exactly what they say on the tin and those outcomes should not be convoluted all in all we consider this disappointing turn of events part of the evolution of the sector but if it reiterates one very crucial thing it is a reminder of the importance of utilising an independent financial adviser ifa who will research the whole of the market to find a product most suitable for you contrary to this a nonindependent like lloyds barclays or st james’ will only promote their own products in which they have a vested interest we at lowes financial management have been successfully advising clients since  as independent financial advisers we look across the whole investment space into alternatives alongside traditional investments with the aim of delivering attractive returns for clients whilst taking an appropriate level of risk whilst we aim to publish details of all of the structured products available through ifas on comparestructuredproductscom and facilitate selfdirected investment for most we would of course welcome the opportunity to discuss your investment needs and objectives and provide appropriate advice covering this and the wider investment universe so please don’t hesitate to call us on   for an initial chat
