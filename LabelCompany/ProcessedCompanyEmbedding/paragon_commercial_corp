currently  and matures in november  and  for general corporate purposes including for possible acquisitions of or investments in bank or permissible nonbank entities though we do not have any agreements or understandings presently with respect to any acquisitions or investments commercial banking in north carolina is extremely competitive due in large part to the early adoption of statewide branching for example as of june   data provided by the fdic deposit market share report indicated that within our market areas there were ­­ different commercial and savings institutions operating a total of  offices  in wake county raleigh and cary and  in mecklenburg county charlotte we compete in our market area with large regional and nationwide banking organizations other federally and state chartered financial institutions such as savings and loan institutions and credit unions mortgage companies and other lenders engaged in the business of extending commercial credit many of our competitors have broader geographic markets and higher lending limits than we do and are also able to provide more services and make greater use of media advertising all of the markets in which we have a banking office are also served by branches of the largest banks in the southeast some of which are among the largest institutions in the united states the enactment of legislation authorizing interstate banking has led to increases in the size and financial resources of some of our competitors in addition as a result of interstate banking outofstate commercial banks have acquired north carolina banks and heightened the competition among banks in north carolina despite the competition in our market area we believe that superior customer service distinguishes us from our competition we offer customers modern banking services in a highly responsive private bank environment we provide personalized services and attract customers by being sensitive to their
