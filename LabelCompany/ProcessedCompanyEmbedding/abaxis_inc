microliters part diff microliters part diff faqs drivers compatible software brochures faqs drivers compatible software brochures what technology does the vetscan hm utilize the vetscan hm uses a combination of chemical differentiation and impedance technology to provide the part wbc differential with impedance technology electrically neutral blood cells generate an electrical pulse as they each pass through an electronically charged aperture cell counts are determined by the number of pulses measured in a given volume of blood over a set period of time the size of the pulse generated is directly proportional to the volume of each cell this size discrimination along with susceptibility to various lysing agents distinguishes the cell types and provides basis for the part differential the size of the vetscan hm aperture was specifically designed to accommodate veterinary blood cells thereby providing optimal differentiation what type of sample is used hematology analyses require edtatreated blood from lavender or purple top tubes containing potassium edta only it is important to ensure that your sample is well mixed and contains optimal proportions of blood and edta the following guidelines should be followed fill each tube at least halffull with blood to eliminate dilution errors thoroughly mix each sample by gently inverting the filled potassium edta sample tube by hand  to  times to avoid clot formation if possible run the sample immediately after mixing if testing is delayed and the sample is placed on a rocker be sure to mix it thoroughly again before analysis by gently inverting the tube  to  times this ensures the homogeneity of the sample do not shake samples doing so can damage the blood cells and can form microbubbles that will cause inaccurate results never use a rocker for samples smaller than  ml rockers do not mix samples feline samples frequently demonstrate platelet aggregations clumps vortex mixing for up to  seconds can disaggregate these clumps with no adverse effect on the sample some practitioners find that collecting blood from the medial saphenous vein using a vacutainer minimizes platelet clumping for further information on sample collection and handling refer to our tech brief sample collection and handling what species are supported fifteen species are supported on the vetscan hm in part differential mode dog cat horse cow alpaca and llama in the part differential mode currently validated species are mouse rabbit rat ferret pig goat monkey sheep and guinea pig what maintenance is recommended for the vetscan hm as with any cell counter the analyzer must be kept clean to avoid build up of debris and particle interference in the system performing the simple and easy preventative maintenance will keep the hm in optimal operating condition thus ensuring peak performance and high quality results what is the shelflife of the vetscan hm hematology reagents shelf life is  months from date of

common occurrence especially in feline samples this clumping may prevent accurate counting by both automated systems and manual slide counting there are however a number of methods you may employ to minimize platelet clumping preventative measures draw sample from medial saphenous vein while the cat is held in a lateral recumbent position stroke gently to reduce stress draw sample directly into edta tube eg monovette system and mix thoroughly immediately or transfer immediately to edta tube from syringe and mix thoroughly even with these preventative measures feline platelet clumping is not always avoidable but can be minimized what are the power requirements needed to operate the system the vetscan hm system requires  volts ac  hz or  volts dc abaxis recommends that the vetscan hm be plugged into a surge protector designed for use with a computer abaxis recommends the use of an uninterruptible power supply ups if the vetscan hm will be used in an area prone to electrical surges or power outages what is a blank and why is it needed a blank measurement checks the cleanliness of the vetscan hm fluidics systems and is used to establish a baseline for sample measurements the results of a blank are used to determine if the background will affect the test results and whether the analyzer needs cleaning or maintenance a blank must be run every  hours each blank measurement remains valid for  hours of continuous operation after which the analyzer displays blank needed and a new blank must be run acceptable blank measurement readings which match the criteria below must be

for entering your own reference ranges and also provides  open labels for adding further species how many result records can the vs hold the vs stores the results of the last  rotors run thereafter the vs replaces the oldest record with the most recent what maintenance does the vs require the only required maintenance is cleaning the air filter on the back of the analyzer does the vs require calibration no unlike any other system the vs reagents are factory calibrated the analyzer reads calibration values from the barcode on the rotor itself the vs then calibrates its optics automatically for each measurement and measures optical absorbance to determine the concentration of each analyte does the vs need surge protection or an uninterruptible power supply abaxis recommends plugging the vs into a surge protector designed for use with a computer abaxis also recommends using an uninterruptible power supply ups in areas prone to electrical surges or power outages can i connect the vs to an external computer yes sample results and status reports can be transmitted to a computer through a usb port whenever calculated or prepared you can use popular terminal emulation software to

capabilities or astm or xml connections contact abaxis technical service  hours a day  days a week at  the vs also interfaces with many commercial veterinary data management software packages for information on compatible packages check with your software vendor or contact abaxis technical service what types of samples can i run on the vs whole blood serum or plasma is precision pipetting required no adding approximately µl of sample is sufficient make sure not to overfill the chamber or internal spills can result the vss onboard microfluidics handle the rest can i use sodium heparin no this anticoagulant can alter results we recommend using lithium heparin with the vs can i use whole blood directly in a rotor no syringes might be heparinized with sodium heparin anticoagulant which is not recommended for use with the vs instead transfer the sample to a green top lithium heparin tube before loading into the rotor if i inadvertently run an outdated rotor do i risk inaccurate results the analyzer checks the rotor and cancels the run if the rotor is outdated this makes it essential to set your vs to the correct date and time what is the shelf life of rotors rotor shelf life depends on the type of rotor but averages approximately  to  months from the date of manufacture see the package label to determine the rotor expiration date to ensure optimal performance through the expiration date the rotors must be refrigerated at ° c ° f and used one at a time directly from the refrigerator note do not store rotors in the freezer or along side of a freezer component within a refrigerator this freezes the diluent pack which prevents it from running properly in the instrument if a rotor was exposed to heat do i risk unreliable results as with other systems or if its run too cold always store rotors in the appropriate conditions to help ensure accurate results rotors may tolerate brief exposure to heat or cold but excessive exposure to extreme temperatures suppresses reporting of some results since the vss extensive builtin iqc mechanisms protect against reporting results for potentially compromised analytes do rotors require warmup before use no in fact you should use rotors directly from the refrigerator does hemolysis lipemia or icterus affect the results on the vetscan vs endogenous substances such as hemolysis lipemia and icterus affect all blood chemistries regardless of the type size or cost of the analysis instrument the vetscan vs is the only pointofcare analyzer that assesses and suppresses hemolysis lipemia and icterus by determining assaybyassay the level at which these substances could affect the reliability of the results and bringing this to the users attention what do the tilde    symbols in the results mean these symbols mean that the vss iqc algorithm is functioning correctly and results for that particular chemistry analysis were suppressed if the vs cannot assure reliable results because of sample quality endogenous substances or immeasurable analysis the analyzer suppresses the results rather than simply report unreliable numbers  what happens if i run a rotor under the wrong species the analyzer is specifically calibrated for different species if a rotor is run under the wrong species bank the results will be unusable and the rotor must be run again under the correct species can the vs results be transmitted to my lab management software most lab management software is compatible with abaxis equipment check with your software company to be certain can i back up the results on my vs no but you can print out reference ranges and results or transfer them for storage in your lab management software can patients other than equine large animal or avian use the equine large animal and avian

accordance with iec  faqs drivers compatible software brochures faqs drivers compatible software brochures is the vs a one test at a time system no the vs offers a variety of assays in a number of preconfigured panels for the utmost flexibility while requiring only seconds of handson time and providing the lowest possible operating costs do i need a separate instrument for electrolytes or blood gases no the vs offers na k tco and cl which can be run on the same unit test procedure and sample can the analyzer detect a flawed or defective rotor yes the vss extensive intelligent quality control iqc detects any flaw or potential anomaly in the rotor abaxis also provides a performance guarantee covering manufacture defective rotors this does not include cancellations or assay suppressions due to improper rotor storage operator error or poor sample integrity how many species can the vs store for reference ranges in addition to cat dog and horse the vs includes predetermined specie labels for entering your own reference ranges and also provides  open labels for adding further species how many result records can the vs hold the vs stores the results of the last  rotors run thereafter the vs replaces the oldest record with the most recent what maintenance does the vs require the only required maintenance is cleaning the air filter on the back of the analyzer does the vs require calibration no unlike any other system the vs reagents are factory calibrated the analyzer reads calibration values from the barcode on the rotor itself the vs then calibrates its optics automatically for each measurement and measures optical absorbance to determine the concentration of each analyte does the vs need surge protection or an uninterruptible power supply abaxis recommends plugging the vs into a surge protector designed for use with a computer abaxis also recommends using an uninterruptible power supply ups in areas prone to electrical surges or power outages can i connect the vs to an external computer yes sample results and status reports can be transmitted to a computer through a usb port whenever calculated or prepared you can use popular terminal emulation software to collect the data from the vs the data is delivered in raw ascii format and can easily be converted to text for use in other applications for information about optional ethernet connectivity capabilities or astm or xml connections contact abaxis technical service  hours a day  days a week at  the vs also interfaces with many commercial veterinary data management software packages for information on compatible packages check with your software vendor or contact abaxis technical service what types of samples can i run on the vs whole blood serum or plasma is precision pipetting required no adding approximately µl of sample is sufficient make sure not to overfill the chamber or internal spills can result the vss onboard microfluidics handle the rest can i use sodium heparin no this anticoagulant can alter results we recommend using lithium heparin with the vs can i use whole blood directly in a rotor no syringes might be heparinized with sodium heparin anticoagulant which is not recommended for use with the vs instead transfer the sample to a green top lithium heparin tube before loading into the rotor if i inadvertently run an outdated rotor do i risk inaccurate results the analyzer checks the rotor and cancels the run if the rotor is outdated this makes it essential to set your vs to the correct date and time what is the shelf life of rotors rotor shelf life depends on the type of rotor but averages approximately  to  months from the date of manufacture see the package label to determine the rotor expiration date to ensure optimal performance through the expiration date the rotors must be refrigerated at ° c ° f and used one at a time directly from the refrigerator note do not store rotors in the freezer or along side of a freezer component within a refrigerator this freezes the diluent pack which prevents it from running properly in the instrument if a rotor was exposed to heat do i risk unreliable results as with other systems or if its run too cold always store rotors in the appropriate conditions to help ensure accurate results rotors may tolerate brief exposure to heat or cold but excessive exposure to extreme temperatures suppresses reporting of some results since the vss extensive builtin iqc mechanisms protect against reporting results for potentially compromised analytes do rotors require warmup before use no in fact you should use rotors directly from the refrigerator does hemolysis lipemia or icterus affect the results on the vetscan vs endogenous substances such as hemolysis lipemia and icterus affect all blood chemistries regardless of the type size or cost of the analysis instrument the vetscan vs is the only pointofcare analyzer that assesses and suppresses hemolysis lipemia and icterus by determining assaybyassay the level at which these substances could affect the reliability of the results and bringing this to the users attention what do the tilde    symbols in the results mean these symbols mean that the vss iqc algorithm is functioning correctly and results for that particular chemistry analysis were suppressed if the vs cannot assure reliable results because of sample quality endogenous substances or immeasurable analysis the analyzer suppresses the results rather than simply report unreliable numbers  what happens if i run a rotor under the wrong species the analyzer is specifically calibrated for different species if a rotor is run under the wrong species bank the results will be unusable and the rotor must be run again under the correct species can the vs results be transmitted to my lab management software most lab management software is compatible with abaxis equipment check with your software company to be certain can i back up the results on my vs no but you can print out reference ranges and results or transfer them for storage in your lab management software can patients other than equine large animal or avian use the equine large animal and avian profiles no profiles and reference ranges are designed for the specific species indicated on the package label running samples of other species can provide inaccurate results because some analytes are

surprises by focusing on the most recent analyst revisions this is done because generally speaking if an analyst reevaluates their earnings estimate right before an earnings release it means that they have fresh information which could potentially be more accurate than what analysts thought about a company two or three months ago the crux of this approach is comparing the most accurate estimate to the zacks consensus estimate although the zacks rank is also an important feature of the esp metric combining these two can help investors find stocks that are ready to beat the consensus at their next report and hopefully surge higher in price too in fact when combining a zacks rank  or better and a positive earnings esp stocks produced a positive surprise  of the time and best of all by using
