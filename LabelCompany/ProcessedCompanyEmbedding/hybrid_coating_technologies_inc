   true green poly’s™ complete lack of isocyanates and vocs make it a great solution for contractors architects and organizations concerned about their employees customers residents and guests’ wellbeing the product’s lack of noticeable odor cannot be overlooked exceptional durability – with proper floor preparation true green poly™ provides a finish that can withstand trafficand heavy equipment repeated cleaning and no diminished gloss  solids – true green poly™ is a “true”  solids product no evaporation no shrinkage for your application this means greater coverage witha smaller amount of material it’s easy to achieve your desired thickness in one coat with true green poly™ saving you time money and hassle anticorrosive – in environments such as kitchens or agricultural operations true green poly™ can withstand exposure to caustic chemicals that often destroy other coatings introducing the world’s first and only zero isocyanate hybrid polyurethane industrial  commercial coatings the firstever modified hybrid polyurethane currently used in coatings and paint manufactured without the use of toxic isocyanates throughout the entire production process the result is true green poly™ a substitute for conventional polyurethane and epoxies that is hundreds of times less toxic has superior properties and may provide up to  in reduced application costs true green poly™ featuring green polyurethane™ is the first commerciallyavailable zero isocyanate hybrid polyurethane coating the product emits such low odor that it can be applied in environments that make conventional toxic isocyanatebased polyurethane coatings difficult to use such as hospitals and schools true green poly™ is perfect for new construction as well as recondition projects with “green” considerations or seeking leed certification true green poly™ provides an appealing choice for a wide range of projects due to its ease of application exceptional durability and competitive costs   recently green polyurethane™ was the recipient of the prestigious  presidential green chemistry challenge award given by the us environmental protection agency epa in cooperation with the american chemical society the award program supported by the white house office of science and technology policy recognizes “landmark green chemistry technologies developed by industrial pioneers and leading scientists in the field of green chemistry” according to industrial finishes  systems chairman and ceo stuart barr “we’re excited to have the opportunity to bring this muchneeded product to market this is truly a gamechanger in today’s world eliminating harmful vocs and isocyanates is an increasingly important focus hct’s chemistry allows us to bring products to market that eliminate isocyanates while providing a superior finish and easy application” “industrial finishes has a strong management team with a vision toward the future of coatings they also have a highly motivated sales team with a record of success we believe this will be an exceptional partnership and are excited about the product launch” said joseph kristul president and ceo of hct for more information regarding true green poly™ contact industrial finishes at or infoindustrialfinishescom                                                          green polyurethane™ applications green polyurethane™ coatings and paint can be applied to almost any surface and is particularly useful on metal and concrete on applications requiring higher safety and sanitation standards and in heavy traffic and corrosive surface areas typical applications include •    food  beverage processing facilities •    medical and pharmaceutical clean rooms •    schools  hospitals •    industrial and commercial buildings •    private and public garages •    chemical plants •    marine  military applications •    equipment for liquid fertilizer delivery •    protective coatings inside pipes   the problem of conventional coatingspaint and toxic isocyanates   the problem with isocyanates conventional polyurethane pu paint and coatings have many disadvantages they are porous permeable and maintain poor hydrolytic stability this makes the material highly vulnerable to environmental degradation and ultimately leads to their chemical decomposition especially when in contact with water conventional pu foams such as spray foam insulation are applied via a spraying mechanism that sends toxic isocyanates in the air — exposing workers to the dangers of toxic isocyanates strict and costly health  safety measures have to be implemented in the manufacture and application of conventional polyurethane due to the toxicity of isocyanates this is why regulatory bodies around the world are now                                                 looking toward phasing out the use of isocyanates the green polyurethane™ solution green polyurethane™ also referred to as “hnipu” – hybrid nonisocyanate polyurethane is a “hybrid” material that combines the high chemical resistance properties of epoxy and advanced durability and wear resistance properties of polyurethane making it the perfect coating application for sanitary high traffic and corrosive surface areas green polyurethane™ provides the foundation of the true green poly™ line of commercial floor coatings and paint as a hybrid material with superior properties green polyurethane™ can be applied in one or two coatings providing a welcome costsaving substitute to currently used multilayered coating applications its safety features allow it to be applied without the interruption of business due to public exposure creating an additional  savings on application costs for customers as a foam green polyurethane™ provides high r values up to  energy savings up to  and improved tensile strength over conventional foam without using dangerous isocyanates recent antiisocyanate regulatory pressure us epa mdi action plan the us epa environmental protection agency is taking progressive action to regulate and potentially ban isocyanates and has mentioned hybrid’s technology as an alternative to toxic polyurethane in its mdi action plan against isocyanates see page  figovsky and shapovalov osha national emphasis program on june   the occupational safety and health administration osha a division of the us department of labor initiated a national emphasis program to protect workers from the serious health effects from occupational exposure to isocyanates isocyanates are found in polyurethane based products according to osha “workers exposed to isocyanates can suffer debilitating health problems for months or even years after exposure which could result in death” california’s department of toxic substances control dtsc on march   selected isocyanates and two others substances from a list of  toxic components that it will focus on with the goal of potentially banning them altogether within the next two years the announcement is part of a bigger effort to educate consumers and manufacturers about product safety under the greenchemistry law which went into effect in california last year under the law the agency has jurisdiction to ban these products altogether after following proper protocol that process includes workshops a public comment period and requiring manufacturers that want to sell these products in california to determine whether it would be feasible to use safer ingredients the us epa on january   announced that it was taking action to protect consumers from new uses and imports of harmful isocyanates in polyurethane the epa’s proposed action a significant new use rule snur under the toxic substances control act tsca would require manufacturers including importers to notify the epa at least  days before starting or resuming new uses of isocyanates in polyurethane based consumer products the epa would then have the opportunity to evaluate the intended use of and if necessary to take action to prohibit or limit all products containing over one tenth of one percent of the chemical including imported products that make their way into the united states industrial finishes  systems is
