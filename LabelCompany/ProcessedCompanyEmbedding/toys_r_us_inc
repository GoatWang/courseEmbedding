they also sell childrens books the sale items are also good great place to buy gifts for kids got tons of gifts like little champssportscenterdino etc as this place has good stuffif you have time go to the one in foster cityone star to this store as they did not give gift wrapping and offered very slow service at the cash counter plus overall their loyalty service is ridiculousu cant figure out your total points collected online or in the store at the cash counter the customer service is really bad here and the returns clerk by the name of diane is very rude a complete waste of time to come here first its not shown in the great malls directory then when we finally found it across the food court we were so shocked at how small it is and the sad selection of toys also i dont see any discount with it being an outlet store i came in with a coupon book with a list of toys i planned to get but they dont have any of it great drove all the way for nothing i came here on a tuesday afternoon to shop for a gift for my nephew and my niece a strong aircon breeze greeted me at the entrance it was awfully cold inside the store i walked in and strolled one aisle at a time looking for new or extraordinary cute figurine toys to my surprise they had limited selections and not as adorable as the ones ive seen at other stores in addition their prices are expensive for an outlet store back to target for an outlet yall got some prices that arent close to being outlet price  its crowded its loud its dark and gloomy in here  im already at the mall paying for overpriced things  i might as well hit up the real toys r us heading back home i had to purchase tons of toys for our kids area we needed big durable toys jenna the manager assisted us with finding what we were looking for being that we were going to carry tons of toys she offered to let us borrow her flat bed cart what a great idea jenna was really helpful made it so much easier for us thank you jenna for the great customer service once these toys get destroyed in a few months we will be back the store  the store manager joshin hayward can kiss my arse ive always hated coming to this store because of their poor customer service  their lack of popular items now i ultimately hate toys r us their stupid order online  pick up at the store sucks big balls im sorry for the vulgarity but seriously toys r us has to rethink their instore pickup policy my father orders my yr old a gift online gives me the order  then i drive  miles to pick up the item then i am refused because it has to be the effen cardholder to pick it up to top it all off the manager is a dick doesnt even try to accomodate or try to speak with my father well maybe he shouldnt have because he wouldve gotten an earful of curse words his young arse never heard of although i cussed him out  threw a middle finger up in the air screw you josh for being rude i called the   cancelled the order never again will i deal with toys r us theyre over priced  rude this honestly does not deserve a star star breakdown service   stars presentation   stars qualityselection   star this toys r us has just moved to a new location the old daiso location right by the food court and it looks a lot better  real shelves no more wire racks but the selection remains the second rate toys that i dont think they typically carry in toys r us stores service was really great my mom bought my son a terrible fighter plane here that falls to pieces when you play with it actually the wings dont even really fit into the slot theyre supposed to go in so i brought it back open boxed and didnt have a receipt the manager was really understanding about it and helped me get store credit without any hassle it helps that theyre still carrying it right on the shelves right now ran across this toys r us inside the great mall a few weeks ago i went inside out of curiosity and was shocked with what i found the store looks horrible to start with lots of hastily put together wire rack shelves full of random toys most of the toys i saw had damaged boxes i did a spot check of the prices for a few items legos video games toy cars against the toys r us website this store has actually increased the prices of these damaged toys but  compared to what they sell for at a normal toys r us unless youre looking for something that you absolutely cant find anywhere else stay away from here youll get ripped off love the store nice employees and good location thats kind of funny what the last reviewer posted as i travel between toys r us to look for exclusive items  tfa arcee old sets of exclusive star wars figures etc  i go as far as redwood city to find my little beauties but who am i for you to listen to did i mention i live in milpitas which is like  minutes away this place has cheaper items if you know what youre looking for  heres an actual comparison of two items that i found star wars transformers at regular tru  at the express  general grevious  at the time i was buying them regular toys r us stores had gotten rid of its old general transformers and i was only able to find it at express oh and by the way sir if you havent noticed lots of websites that sell things online will be cheaper why because you pay shipping and handling holy crap that dude had a vendetta against tru and this just irked me that the only review was from a nimrod absolute jerks are the cashiers here and the selection is crappy dont waste your time here this is not a real tru this is like a tru express or something cant remember what the associates called it inventory here is hit and miss its kinda like shopping for toys at costco you dont know what they will have and you cant depend on them to stock enough of any particular line of toy they have what they have this is primarily why im only giving them  stars however i have found rare figures here that i had trouble finding elsewhere so it is worth a visit every now and then toys r us  reviews
