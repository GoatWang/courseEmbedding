improved handoff communications close related departmentsmoredivision of general pediatrics news and events insights multicenter patientsafety study reduces injuries from hospital medical errors by  with improved handoff communicationsipass bundle improves safety quality of care at nine medical centers boston nov   – improvements in verbal and written communication between health care providers during patient handoffs can reduce injuries due to medical errors by  percent according to a multicenter study led by researchers from boston childrens hospital reported nov  in the new england journal of medicine nejm study results show that ipass—an original system of bundled communication and training tools for handoff of patient care between providers—can greatly increase patient safety without significantly burdening existing clinical workflows medical errors in hospitals such as diagnostic delays preventable surgical complications and medication overdoses are a leading cause of death and injury in the us an estimated  percent of the most serious medical errors can be linked to communication between clinicians particularly during patient handoffs for example a handoffrelated medical error could occur if information about a critical diagnostic test is not communicated correctly between providers at shift change the result could be a potentially harmful delay in patient care miscommunications and handoff errors are two of the most significant causes of medical errors in hospitals in the us said the study’s principal investigator and senior author christopher landrigan md mph of boston childrens division of general pediatrics this is the first multicenter handoff improvement program that has been found to reduce injuries due to medical errors”  a multicenter team led by landrigan and the studys lead author amy starmer md mph designed ipass with the goal of improving patient safety and reducing or eliminating the most common source of medical errors through improved providertoprovider communication ipass consists of standardized communication and handoff training a verbal handoff process organized around the verbal mnemonic ipass illness severity patient summary action list situational awareness and contingency planning and synthesis by receiver computerized handoff tools to share patient information between providers using an ipass structure engagement of supervising attending physicians to observe and oversee handoff communications a campaign promoting the adoption of ipass as part of institutional process and culture we recognized that it would take a great deal of work to make the handoff program a sustainable system and encourage its adoption across hospitals starmer said we partnered with experts in research curriculum development and administration as well as local faculty and executives at the nine centers to develop a comprehensive and multifaceted handoff and communication program now the new ipass program works seamlessly with existing tools and is part of each institutions culture in the nejm paper landrigan starmer and their colleagues report on the results of implementing ipass through the pediatric residency programs of nine hospitals benioff children’s hospital university of california san francisco cincinnati children’s hospital medical center university of cincinnati doernbecher

of the health sciences boston childrens hospital served as the lead site for the study while brigham and womens hospital served as the datacoordinating center at each participating hospital patient handoffs by residents were monitored and assessed for a sixmonth preintervention period during the sixmonth intervention phase residents were trained on ipass handoff processes and required to use the system going forward an additional six months of monitoring and assessment followed the intervention across the participating centers the overall rate of medical errors decreased by  percent—from  to  errors per  admissions—after the introduction of ipass preventable adverse events injuries due to medical errors decreased by  percent—from  to  errors per  admissions the research teams data covered a total of  patient admissions timemotion analyses of providers activities showed that implementing ipass did not add time to patient handoffs or decrease time spent at patient bedsides or on other tasks the researchers noted significant improvements in residents verbal and written communications at every center and a significant increase in residents satisfaction with the quality of their patient handoffs after ipass implementation according to a poststudy survey we took basic principles of patient safety and as a team found ways to integrate them into the normal workflow of hospital residents” landrigan said we hope ipass will remain an embedded system within these institutions going forward “because we know that miscommunications so commonly lead to serious medical errors and because the frequency of handoffs in the hospital is increasing there is no question that highquality handoff improvement programs need to be a top priority for hospitals” says starmer “it’s tremendously exciting to finally have a comprehensive and rigorously tested training program that has been proven to be associated with safer care and that meets this need for our patients landrigan and starmer note that while the ipass bundle has been focused thus far on inpatient pediatric care the principles are applicable to care in any hospital inpatient setting and while not documented in the study they believe that the safety improvements supported by ipass adoption could lead to substantial reductions in medical errorrelated health care costs the ipass curriculum is available to the
