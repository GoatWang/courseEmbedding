to comply with certain agreements among the central bank of chile the depositary and télexchile and applicable chilean exchange regulations which we have been advised by our chilean counsel cariola diez perezcotapos  cia ltda abogados chilean counsel do not allow a chilean entity such as redes ópticas to purchase the adss of télexchile chilean law and the chilean tender offer procedure chile has adopted laws governing tender offers for shares of chilean listed companies and our chilean counsel has advised us that the svs has authority to regulate transactions of the type proposed herein chilean counsel has explained to us that under chilean law tender offers must be open to all shareholders of the target company and they must be based on the same conditions and equal terms thus the chilean offer must be open to us residents holding shares in addition chilean counsel has advised us that when making a tender offer for one series of shares that has a preference chilean law requires the bidder to make a simultaneous offer for any other series of shares of the issuer outstanding in an equal percentage accordingly as described below a separate proration factor must be applied to each series of shares sought in the tender offer chilean counsel has also advised us that under chilean law any person seeking control of a company by means of a tender offer for shares must comply with the procedures for tender offers provided in title xxv of the chilean securities act the procedural requirements of title xxv among others include the filing of a prospectus which describes the terms and conditions of the tender offer the prospectus must be filed with the svs the chilean stock exchanges and the target company and must be available at the offices of the bidder the svs also requires that in the event of a simultaneous offer in a foreign market such as our proposed offers the bidder must file and make available a spanish translation of the foreign prospectus in addition the bidder must publicly announce the starting period of the tender offer in two chilean newspapers with national coverage one day before commencing the tender offer according to chilean counsel applicable chilean law also requires that tendering shareholders have withdrawal rights throughout the term of the tender offer and any extension thereto the initial chilean tender offer must be open for a minimum period of  calendar days and a maximum period of  calendar days unless the issuer has shares held through a depositary in which case the initial offer must remain open for a period of  calendar days the offer may be extended only once for a minimum of  calendar days and a maximum of  calendar days three calendar days after the tender offer expires the bidder must publish the results of the tender offer in the same chilean newspapers used for announcing the offer payment to tendering holders is made based on chilean market practices which provide for payment within three to five business days after publicly announcing the results of the tender offer the proposed dual offer structure the chilean offer and the us offer will have substantially identical terms and will be conducted subject to limited exceptions with substantially identical procedures the offers are proposed as follows  on or about march   redes ópticas will publicly announce the chilean offer in two chilean newspapers with national coverage at or about the same time redes ópticas will file a chilean prospectus and a spanish translation of the us offering document with the svs and will make copies of both such documents available at télexchile and the chilean stock exchanges on or about the same time redes cayman will issue a press release in the united states announcing the us offer in addition as soon as practicable after the announcement of the offers southern cross and redes cayman will file a schedule to with the securities and exchange commission  the us offer will be for shares held by us residents and adss regardless of the residency of the ads holder at a price equal to  chilean pesos per share and  chilean pesos per ads the us offer will be paid in us dollars with the dollar amount thereof being determined by reference to the average exchange rate at which commercial banks conduct authorized transactions in chile as determined by the central bank of chile and published in the official gazette of chile as in effect on the date of payment the conversion the us offering documents will explain the conversion and will provide an estimate of the offer price in us dollars based on an exchange rate in effect on a date near the commencement of the offers to assist holders of adss and shares the chilean offer will be for shares at a price of  chilean pesos per share and the chilean offer will be open to all persons holding shares including us residents but will not be open to adss in the event that the price per share in the chilean offer is increased redes cayman will similarly increase the price offered for shares and adss in the us offer likewise if there is a price increase in the us offer redes ópticas will increase the price per share offered in the chilean offer  the us offer will disclose that us residents holding shares may participate in either the us offer or the chilean offer the us offer will describe the method for tendering in the chilean offer as well as the us offer  redes seeks to acquire a total of  shares which represents  of the series a shares and  of the series b shares of télexchile if more than  of the series a shares andor more than  of the series b shares are tendered in the offers a proration factor will be determined for each series of shares one for the series a shares and one for the series b shares including series b shares underlying the adss the proration factor would be used to determine the number of series a and series b shares accepted in the offers by way of example if the number of shares of one series tendered exceeds the amount sought ie the series is oversubscribed and the other series is undersubscribed then all shares tendered in the undersubscribed series will first be accepted for purchase in the offers without proration and any remaining capacity will be reallocated to the oversubscribed series and then proration will be applied to the extent necessary for purposes of this letter remaining capacity means the total number of shares of a specific series sought in the offers less the number of shares actually tendered for example if only  shares of each series were sought in the offers and  series b shares and  series a shares were tendered  shares the remaining capacity would be reallocated to series a and the proration factor would be calculated as follows      divided by  which equals  the proration factor further if both series of shares tendered are oversubscribed a separate proration factor will be applied to each series based on the number of shares tendered and the number of shares sought for each series if proration is necessary persons tendering in the us offer will be treated identically to persons tending in the chilean offer the us offer documents will explain the possibility of proration the process of proration and its effect on tendering holders proration on a seriesbyseries basis is necessary in order to assure equal treatment of holders of each series of télexchiles shares if both series are undersubscribed there will be no proration  to the extent proration as described above is necessary it will be applied on a seriesbyseries basis and not on a countrybycountry basis  the us offer will remain open for at least  business days after the filing of the schedule to the chilean offer will remain open for at least  calendar days to the extent possible under the applicable laws and regulations the offers will begin and end concurrently the offers are intended to expire on the same day chilean law provides that a chilean tender offer may remain open for a maximum of  calendar days  days plus the maximum  day extension in contrast us law may require under certain circumstances that an offer remain open beyond the th day for example if there was a change in the price offered at a time close to the expiration of the us offer the offering period would be extended to comply with us securities regulations if an extension of the us offer is necessary redes ópticas will elect to make its onetime extension of the chilean offer as permitted under chilean law to ensure to the extent possible that the chilean offer and the us offer expire concurrently if however additional extensions of the us offer become necessary thus requiring additional extensions of the chilean offer so that the offers expire concurrently redes ópticas will request from the svs a corresponding change in the duration of the chilean offer but chilean counsel has advised us that such a request is not likely to be successful in this event redes ópticas might be required to purchase tendered shares in the chilean offer before the us offer expires thus resulting in the need for separate proration pools one for the us offer and one for the chilean offer if it becomes apparent that the offers will not end on the same date due to a conflict in laws southern cross and redes will seek appropriate relief from the svs and the sec if the necessary relief is not available the offers may not be consummated the us offer documents will disclose i the maximum  calendar day offering period provided by chilean law ii the possibility that under certain circumstances us law could require the offer to stay open beyond  calendar days and that in such event redes ópticas might be required to purchase shares tendered in the chilean offer prior to the tendering of shares or adss in the us offer and iii except as required by applicable law and regulations redes cayman intends to consummate the us offer concurrently with the chilean offer  the us offer will be denominated in chilean pesos and paid in us dollars based on the conversion as described above whether a holder tenders shares or adss in the us offer the chilean offer will be denominated in chilean pesos and paid in chilean pesos  during the period from the announcement of the offers until the expiration of the us offer southern cross and redes do not plan to and will not directly or indirectly purchase or enter into any arrangements to purchase shares or adss of télexchile in the us or outside the us other than purchases of shares andor adss pursuant to the offers in compliance with rule d  payment for the shares and the adss tendered in the offers will be made according to chilean market practices which provides for payment within five business days after the public announcement of the results of the chilean offer public announcement of the results of the chilean offer and proration if applicable is required on the third day after the expiration of the chilean offer southern cross and redes intend to make prompt payment within five business days following the announcement of the results from the chilean offer except as required by applicable law payment in the offers is intended to be concurrent  tenders of shares and adss made pursuant to the us offer may be withdrawn at any time prior to the expiration date of the us offer as defined in the us offer documents further the us offer documents explain that tenders may be withdrawn after the expiration of  calendar days from the commencement of the us offer pursuant to section d of the exchange act if a tender has not yet been accepted as explained above chilean law requires that withdrawal rights be provided throughout the term of the chilean offer and any extensions thereto except as otherwise described herein the us offer would comply with all provisions of the exchange act and the rules thereunder the chilean offer would be conducted pursuant to and in compliance with all applicable chilean laws and regulations sec rules involved and discussion rule d proration in the offers as described above will be applied on a seriesbyseries basis and not a countrybycountry basis series a and series b shares will be accepted on a pro rata basis according to the number of shares of each series tendered and the number of shares of each series sought in the offers however to the extent that one series is oversubscribed and one series is undersubscribed the remaining capacity will be reallocated from the undersubscribed series to the oversubscribed series as described above due to the possibility of reallocation between the two series the mechanics of proration in the offers may not literally comply with section d and rule d we therefore request relief from rule d solely to permit the reallocation of any remaining capacity from the undersubscribed series to the oversubscribed series to the extent necessary rule da rule da provides that no person shall make a tender offer unless the offer is open to all security holders of the class of securities subject to the tender offer the us offer will be open solely to us residents holding shares and to all holders of adss regardless of their residency conversely the chilean offer will be open solely to holders of shares but not ads holders as described above under applicable chilean exchange regulations and pursuant to certain agreements among the central bank of chile the depositary and télexchile a chilean person or entity may not acquire adss of télexchile and the chilean offer will be open to all holders of shares read literally rule da could be interpreted to prohibit the dual structure of the offers prompting this request for relief the securities and exchange commission has adopted certain exemptive rules for crossborder tender and exchange offers business combinations and rights offerings relating to the securities of foreign companies the adopting release release nos   international series release no  the cross border release indicates that the purpose of granting exemptions to rule d is to facilitate us investor participation in crossborder transactions as described herein there are certain conflicts between the chilean regulations and the tender offer rules and practice in the united states we believe that the best method for reconciling these conflicts is the dual offer structure described in this letter which is both appropriate and consistent with the intent of the exchange act and the cross border release a similar structure was previously approved by the commission in connection with the tender offer by ivax corp for the shares and adss of laboratorio chile sa june  the ivax letters we respectfully request that the offers be exempted from compliance with rule da of the exchange act given the following i the protections afforded by chilean regulations ii the differing procedural requirements under applicable law between the offers and iii the fact that the offers will have substantially identical terms and will be conducted on the same time frame and with substantially the same procedures in particular we note that the relief provided by tier ii as adopted in the cross border release does not provide for a foreign offer that is open to us persons in this case chilean law requires that the chilean offer be open to all holders of shares including us holders accordingly we believe relief from rule da is necessary and appropriate despite the limitations in the tier ii exemption rule e rule e among other things prohibits subject to certain specified exceptions a person that is making a cash tender offer for an equity security from directly or indirectly purchasing or making any arrangement to purchase such security or any security which is immediately convertible into or exchangeable for such security outside the tender offer the prohibition extends from the time the offer is first publicly announced until its expiration including any extensions thereof literal application of rule e could be read to prohibit purchases of shares pursuant to the chilean offer following announcement of the us offer the securities and exchange commission has eliminated subject to certain specified conditions compliance with rule e formerly rule b for certain crossborder tender offers see the cross border release in our case where the percentage of us ownership of all shares subject to the offers in the aggregate exceeds  but is less than  as described above the securities and exchange commission generally accepts requests for exemptive relief from rule e on a casebycase basis we believe that our request for exemptive relief from rule e with respect to the chilean offer is consistent with the exemptive relief granted by the securities and exchange commission for other similarly structured tender offers see the ivax letters in re endesa sa tender offer for shares and adss of empresa nacional de electricidad sa endesa chile april   and in re endesa sa tender offer for shares and adss of enersis sa february   collectively the endesa letters in both the ivax letters and the endesa letters relief from rule e was granted in the context of dual offers in the united states and chile the structure of the offers described in the endesa letters consisted of a cash offer to purchase shares and adss in the united states and a concurrent offer to purchase shares only in chile via a chilean auction process the auction process was used prior to the enactment of new tender offer laws in chile the offers in the ivax letters consisted of an all cash tender offer for all shares of common stock and adss in which the offer in the united states was for shares and adss open to us residents only and the offer in chile was open to all shareholders including us residents in addition we call your attention to the recent relief granted to aes relating to a partial tender offer for the class d shares of cantv where multiple classes of securities were outstanding see in re tender offers for shares and adss of cantv december   the aes letter in addition to the above referenced letters the sec has granted relief in similar circumstances recognizing that the interests of facilitating crossborder transactions and international comity may require an acquisition of shares to be conducted pursuant to two separate tender offers each subject to the laws and regulations of a different country in the following noaction letters the sec provided relief from rule e so that the nonus offers could be made during the pendency of a us offer see in re exchange offer by banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria sa for ordinary shares and adss of bbva banco frances april   in re cash tender offer by banco bilbao vizcaya argentaria sa for common and preferred shares and adss of banco ganadero sa march    and in re exchange offers by telefonica sa for telecomunicacoes de sao paulo sa tele sudeste celular participacoes sa telefonica del peru saa and telefonica de argentina sa may   because the proposed dual offer structure involves the purchase of securities pursuant to a foreign tender offer it does not present the same risks associated with open market purchases and thus the policies forming the basis for rule e will not be violated by granting the exemption requested southern cross and redes ópticas intention to purchase shares pursuant to the chilean offer and the actual purchases themselves will be fully disclosed to us shareholders who will be assured the benefit of receiving the same price in the us offer as paid in the chilean offer relief requested rules d da and e we hereby request exemptive relief from rule da and rule e under the exchange act to allow southern cross and redes together with their affiliates dealer managers financial advisors and chilean stockbroker for the chilean offer and other nominees or brokers in each case acting as agents for redes ópticas to purchase shares pursuant to the chilean offer after the public announcement but prior to the expiration of the us offer such arrangements to purchase may include the solicitation and facilitation of tenders of shares pursuant to the chilean offer in addition as discussed above rule ddii merely provides that two offers may be made one offer open only to us persons and another offer open only to nonus persons to the extent that the chilean offer is open to us shareholders and conversely to the extent ads holders are not permitted to tender in the chilean offer we request relief from rule da we also request relief from section d and rule d under the exchange act solely to permit the reallocation of any remaining capacity from one series of shares to another series of shares in the event that one series is undersubscribed and the other series is oversubscribed if you wish further information or to discuss these matters further please call me at   very truly yours james j moloney jjmsp
