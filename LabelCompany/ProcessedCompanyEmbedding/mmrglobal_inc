necessary to winning to anyone who has followed mmrglobal they are also words that we have lived by for nearly ten years to get to where we are now ready now is a very challenging time in the world the united states is involved in conflicts around the globe while war rages on throughout the middle east africa and europe we all have our own personal challenges in our daily lives and in the lives of the ones we love  one of my wife kira’s best friends is surviving breast cancer one day at a time while a number of close friends have family members also fighting numerous medical crises in the past week alone mymedicalrecords has shown its readiness and is responsible for helping countless individuals families including our nearest and dearest twolegged and fourlegged friends manage their medical records and other important documents to fight illness reduce medical costs and save lives it’s sometimes hard to get up each day and face the challenges but we do we move forward  we persist meanwhile the more we put out to the universe the more we get back and mymedicalrecords personal health record system does just that mymedicalrecords helps individuals and their families  legged or  legged manage their health reduce costs and save lives the company now finds itself in a market where electronic medical records and personal health records are mandated by global regulatory requirements the financial markets are valuing small health information providers with minimal revenues in the hundreds of millions and in one recent ipo billions of dollars the fact is that after  years and building a great product  service and accumulating three portfolios of  health it and biotech patents our first markman hearing is a week away on tuesday august  mymedicalrecords will be in federal court facing four defendants all major players in healthcare and many times the size of mmr in what is legally termed a markman hearing a markman hearing is a court hearing in which a judge determines the meaning of words from patent claims that are in dispute in a patent infringement lawsuit inventions are defined by the precise wording of the patent claims and the definition of these words play a key role as to whether the jury will ultimately determine that patent infringement has occurred  this is a big deal huge the defendants’ law firms are legendary if you recall the story of david vs goliath i now know how david felt  since  i have believed that the computer age would transform the way doctors and patients communicate after all this time it looks like we’re on the edge of that time i knew that computers would eventually take over and my doctor’s handwriting which neither my pharmacist nor i could read would be replaced by electronics  what i didn’t know was that i would be running a company in the center of that transformation for almost ten years without the persistence endurance tolerance patience determination and commitment of our shareholders employees and friends we may not have made it this far however we have it took nearly  years of research technical refinement and tens of millions of dollars to get to this point and for the many of you who have been part of the journey we are excited that the next destination is just around the corner a big step in our growing success came just last week when we started selling our personal health record kit

i love the fourth of july it’s one of my favorite holidays  kira  i announced our engagement on the fourth of july i hosted many lorschland parties wwwlorschlandcom on the big day and i was planning on throwing one this year however a business trip to australia put my allamerican fourth of july barbecue plans on hold until next year the good news is we are not missing out because even half way around the world they are celebrating america’s independence day every day during the week leading up to hot dogs and fireworks on the big day the us embassy has the chef from commander’s palace in new orleans making fried chicken bites gumbo and peach cobbler along with the standard fare of hot dogs and hamburgers everywhere  the only bad news is that it’s winter here and yesterday in canberra our fourth of july picnic was held in temperatures of almost zero httpwwwbrisbanetimescomauactnewsusandaustraliaworkingtogetherinwaysmanyofusdontevenhearaboutdefenceministerdavidjohnstonzstjzhtml since arriving down under most of my time has been in meetings about healthcare with numerous medical professionals hospitals and government officials on behalf of mmrglobal and the company’s mymedicalrecords personal health record phr and we have been welcomed everywhere and given access to whomever we want to meet and if i ever thought that i worked hard in the us  being in australia forces me to work a hour day of meetings with hospitals physicians providers investors and government officials all day every day  then i get back to the hotel where i work all day again over the night with los angeles however this fourth of july in addition to feeling proud to be an american among friends i am very excited about the business opportunities ahead based on all the relationships we are making and doors we are opening i plan on returning to the states with agreements for as many as  physicians to begin offering the mymedicalrecords phr this week so far i have attended two “july th” celebrations an independence day cocktail party celebration at the national maritime museum and the one in canberra  while in canberra i attended meetings with the minister for health peter dutton the aussies sure know how to make a patriotic american feel right at home most everyone loves freedom and much of the world looks to america’s independence day as a reason to celebrate the right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness there is a definite spirit of partnership and collaboration here between australian and american business healthcare entertainment sustainability…i

filed under posts by robert lorsch last thursday i was admitted to the hospital with pain in my midsection and an elevated white count i had been experiencing mild symptoms of pain in the stomach for more than a week and when the pain started keeping me up three nights in a row i called my internist  he referred me to a gastro specialist whom i saw on monday november th the doctor gave me a complete workup which included taking a rush “stat” blood draw  after the appointment i was sent home with two antibiotics and instructions to wait for his call at  that same evening the doctor called and told me i had a significantly elevated white count and to immediately go for an emergency ct scan i told the specialist that would not be possible as i was traveling to chicago early the next morning for scheduled meetings where attorneys from around the country were gathering and we were not meeting at an imaging center i explained that this was an important and timesensitive meeting and only something like removing my appendix would keep me away  so unless he could tell me i was having an appendicitis attack i was going to chicago as it turned out the only reason i am able to write this blog and appear on fox news all weekend and again in a special segment later today is because my mymedicalrecordscom personal health record account kept me out of an operating room so since my diagnosis was not definitively an appendicitis attack… despite the pain and fever i was at lax at  am and on a  flight to chicago with the company’s patent attorney who did not have a copy of my advanced directives we arrived at the meeting in chicago which by that time was the only thing i could feel good about  then i drove from the suburb of deerfield to the chicago loop for an mmrglobal investor dinner returning to the airport hilton in time for a few hours of sleep and the morning flight that would get me back to the office for more than half a day of work on wednesday however that is not exactly what the universe had in store for me instead the ongoing fever and pain made me realize i needed the ct scan before going to the office  so i scheduled the procedure from the inflight internet after the threehour imaging procedure i went home to wait for the results at about  pm that night i received a call from the specialist telling me to get myself to the hospital emergency room with specific instructions to be admitted adding to both my wife kira and i that it was a life or death situation the specialist also contacted a surgeon to be my admitting physician and i was in a hospital bed the next morning which was now thursday  i had been told that i would be out in  days and i had an infection that that would simply be treated with iv antibiotics i quickly learned that now everything was an emergency my ct scan was done outside the hospital so when i checked into the hospital no one had a copy only a verbal report from the specialist  however when a surgical team came to my room to prep me that night they told me i was not headed to an iv line but to surgery then i started asking more questions based on what i learned i told them that surgery was anything but acceptable i made it very clear that i did not want surgery and requested a hospital radiologist render a second opinion on my ct scan the problem was it was not at the hospital because i know how important it is to ask for a disc of the procedure whenever a patient leaves a radiologist i had one with me but i did not have the report i ’d the specialist who emailed the report to me the hospital had no way to receive email from a patient especially at what was now  at night however every nurse’s station can receive a fax so using my personal mymedicalrecordscom account i uploaded the email to my inbox moved the report to my radiology file and faxed it directly from my personal health record to the nurse’s station records and disc in hand the surgical team went to a radiologist in the hospital and they all read the film together  fortyfive minutes later the team canceled putting me under the knife and started the iv  clearly without a patientcontrolled copy of my phr i would not have able to be on fox  friends saturday morning discussing the latest on dr afridi and back in my office today instead i would have been in recovery having had an unnecessary surgery apparently one set of radiologists from outside the hospital had given one opinion and the radiologist in the hospital another  fortunately the hospital won surgery canceled and  bags of iv antibiotics later it was off to fox  friends the best news is of course that i didn’t need surgery and that the influx of antibiotics seems to have resolved the problem i walked out of the hospital feeling great and as a matter of fact several people have said i’ve never looked better had i not had a personal health record i would not be writing this blog painfree this thanksgiving kira and i have a lot to be thankful for in that mymedicalrecords kept me from having an unnecessary operation if you haven’t already done so i encourage you to use this holiday season to open a personal health record account at

various government officials going back to hhs secretary mike leavitt former national coordinators for health it david brailer and david blumenthal and congressional representatives of the house science committee staff and others and there is no better proof about effectively getting things done than reading about the results of my impromptu meeting last week with prime minister of pakistan nawaz sharif the meeting came as a direct result of my many trips to washington demonstrating the mymedicalrecords personal health record that patients can sign up for in real time httpwwwfoxnewscompoliticsexclusivepakistanipremierpledgestoreconsiderjaileddoctorcase my message has been clear repeatedly demonstrating mmr’s costeffective solution to deployment of an interoperable personal health record at the sba hhs onchit surgeon general of the united states congressional representatives and appropriate committees that deal with health care and budgets for health it i first got involved in health it because i saw an opportunity to provide affordable easy to use patientcontrolled access to protected health information regardless of the system that it originated from which seemed like the right thing to do then in february this year while in washington to present the mymedicalrecords story to the house committee on science space and technology subcommittee on oversight i was invited into a meeting which evolved into a discussion of international politics and pakistan the meeting was about the plight of dr shakil afridi who was imprisoned by pakistani officials for helping the united states pinpoint the location of osama bin laden because it also felt like the right thing to do kira and i started wwwfreeafridicom which led us on a humanitarian mission to free dr afridi from his year prison sentence if you believe that the more you give to the universe the more the universe gives back then look for dr afridi to go free and mmr to fulfill a significant purpose

my blog  however this last weekend was so relevant to science and technology and in particular the future of health care and mmrglobal in japan that i felt remiss not sharing it on this page  the visit was arranged by us congressman dana rohrabacher who after welcoming the honorable ichita yamamoto who is japan’s minister of state for science space  information technology including ocean policy and his delegation at spacex beamed himself back to washington for emergency budget resolution votes late saturday night  as a result i was left hosting the minister around the southern california scientific hot spots the minister also happens to be a former rock singer speaks great english and is an allaround easygoing quite likable guy i first met minister yamamoto and his entourage of ten plus drivers and luggage handlers at lax and joined his state department motorcade caravanning to spacex for a private briefing and tour of the rocket manufacturing facility less than twenty hours prior to the launch of falcon  wwwspacexcom from there i traveled with the japanese contingentto the california science center where president  ceo jeffrey rudolph and trustee kira lorsch greeted us all at the robert h lorsch family pavilion bob lorsch mmrglobal ceo with ichita yamamoto minister of state for government of japan and jeffrey rudolph california science center ceo at the science center’s robert h lorsch family pavilion during our tour of the science center we spent time discussing the effect of natural disasters on the environment in the wake of the recent earthquake and tsunami in japan focusing in particular on the effect of the fukushima nuclear power plant on the pacific oceans we discussed the us government and japan scheduling a conference of nations who share coastlines to help mitigate damage from future disasters we ended the tour under the wing of space shuttle endeavour where we spoke about how our nations have been working together in space as we looked at a plaque from a usjapan mission to the space station  after the tour everyone enjoyed a luncheon hosted by mmrglobal starting with of course a traditional miso soup we left the california science center and moved on to aeroscraft located in a  square foot marine corps enclosed air station where we sat in the control pod of a stateoftheart blimp being designed for surveillance and to carry as much as  tons of cargo as far as  nautical miles httpwwwhuffingtonpostcomaeroscrafttestgroundflightairshipnhtml after a briefing at aeroscraft we moved to the orange county water district ocwd where we were hosted by mr linden blue father of the predator drone amongst other very impressive technology there we saw the future of the nuclear reactor small enough to be located on a flatbed truck  after the general atomics nuclear reactor presentation httpwwwgacomnuclearenergy  we toured  acres of ground water reclamation facilities where we all got to drink sewer water reclaimed to clean drinking water the groundwater replenishment system technology seems to work as i’m not sick  the day was capped off by another fabulous meal hosted by ocwd board president shawn dewane where we toasted our future with the japanese over two excellent california wines without the reclaimed sewer water as mmr expands its global footprint which includes the us canada mexico australia new zealand

robert lorsch he will tell you “it is real it always will be and it exists in and beyond every corner of every alternate universe”…so says richard bach i have spent the last four years blogging about the magic inside that keeps me motivated  many have criticized me for being a frustrated version of richard bach however nothing could be further from the truth i write my blogs the way i do because it works for me  some readers might say that i should focus my writing more about the business of mmr but what fun would that be after all if you can’t make money and have fun is it really worth it the fact is that when i put myself out there personally i still get lots of the comments about mmr but i also get comments about how i make a difference in other people’s lives and that makes me feel good one example is dr shakil afridi wwwfreeafridicom who is sitting in a dungeon in pakistan after sacrificing his family so that he could help america pinpoint the location of osama bin laden kira and i have received a landslide of worldwide press from our efforts creating a campaign to free dr afridi in order to call attention to this important humanitarian crisis as a result of our efforts and the efforts of the employees at mmr we received worldwide coverage last week from london’s “daily mail” and page  of the “new york post” to breitbart being who i am allows me to run mmrglobal a publicly traded company under mmrf while keeping mmr in the spotlight and giving back by calling attention to humanitarian and philanthropic issues in the world like the plight of dr shakil afridi now i am going to talk about mmr and how my bachlike belief system is turning the dream of an emerging growth opportunity into the reality of a business which could hold more than one billion dollars worth of intellectual property rights for its shareholders mmr is a company that was founded to facilitate better care by reducing medical costs and helping save lives  mmr is a journey i embarked on as a result of my own life experiences and my fight to survive a deadly form of cancer  years ago which i did as i sit down to let my fingers do the walking i realized that it was time to let you see how it’s possible that a person can turn a dream into a reality by simply wanting it to be so this is the second time in my life i have entered an industry that was dominated by multibillion dollar companies in communications or healthcare i entered both opportunities as the underdog first competing in telecommunications then health it the first time based on will and determination i knew i won big when i went public standing on the floor of the nasdaq this time i know we are winning based on the fact that we continue to hit consistent singles in the healthcare business and doubles and triples with our health it and biotech patent portfolios so let’s travel to behind the curtain in oz so you can actually see what the future could have in store for all of us i believe that when you resist change you are stuck with what you have  so in my world i never resist change and i am always exploring places to visit on a neverending canvas despite an extraordinary unexplainable trading range in our stock the direction is clearly up  mmr’s world promises to continue coming alive with a high quality group of strategic partners and customers  we no longer have to beat people over the head to get them to use a personal health record  now we can focus on delivering products and services  so as a result of consumer and professional awareness of phrs and requirements to deploy them we should begin to see revenues from operations and licensing far greater that any projected in the past ehealth is finally a reality of our time just like the evolution of other industries like credit monitoring services which took forever to evolve online banking services which took forever to evolve online travel services which took forever to evolve and online retail which took forever to evolve ehealth is now fast becoming a way of life  and after eight long years mmr is well positioned to benefit from that industry growth by exploiting the marketplace much like amazon did in retail paypal in payment processing and ebay in auctions and commerce to name only a few as ceo of the company i could not be more excited about how this year is progressing and all the things that lie ahead  for those who have followed this company since inception when i have said “the best is yet to come” it means just that for example last week we spent a halfday in meetings with sodexo regarding phr offerings and an mmrpro distribution program internationally we also met with representatives of the new employee owners of kodak who paid us a visit to help celebrate their purchase of kodak’s document imaging business and other assets  this means supply lines from kodak in the future for mmrpro has never looked better our relationships with all our strategic vendors and partners are excellent from nihilent to ng connect to unistonghe and interbit data fujitsu kodak and many others we continue to make significant progress in australia and in fact one of our larger australian strategic partners was in los angeles over the weekend helping us prepare for meetings with government officials in australia next month we are also getting close to significant announcements in singapore during the week we continued ongoing dialogue with webmd and we met with quest diagnostics at their offices near san diego while we work through strategic business opportunities with both webmd and quest we are also in meaningful conversations with half of the top  emr vendors including mckesson and cerner with whom the company has already enjoyed a fiveyear licensing relationship we are also getting closer to a major announcement with a wireless carrier where healthcare continues to be a major priority and agenda item in all cases and with all these opportunities the company continues to actively pursue other licensing and strategic business opportunities both here and abroad as evidenced by last week’s announcement about the middle east and to the extent relationships involve more than strategic conversations we are keeping the investment banking team at b riley very busy while all this goes on the company continues filing additional patent infringement and trademark actions speaking of patents the company’s united states health it portfolio has recently been revalued to add japan which increased it to as much as  billion  as yet the company does not have a valuation on australia singapore south korea hong kong new zealand mexico canada israel and european nations which when added could increase the number significantly australia and singapore are currently the subject of active investigation into infringement matters at this time  httpphxcorporateirnetphoenixzhtmlcpirolnewsarticleidhighlight  the mmr patent portfolio was created about the same time that the office of the national coordinator for health information technology was formed the mmr patent portfolio was granted over nearly an eightyear period of time as part of a multimillion dollar effort to create shareholder value through the ownership of patents and other intellectual property in  countries around the globe because there are thousands of patented products in every healthcare professional’s office and hospital from the design of a handle on a scalpel to components of the most sophisticated imaging equipment the healthcare industry has shown it respects the patent system and based on our experience so far we feel good about our ability to license and monetize these patents on behalf of our shareholders  in fact we are not aware of a situation where an industry has paid so much attention to the value of a patent portfolio since samsung and apple went to court which further makes us feel good about the future the fact that the mmr patents are the subject of worldwide media attention and in the united states alone the company believes that more than  hospitals and healthcare providers do or will infringe on the company’s ip by the end of  should make for a very good next few years in closing my favorite bachism is “you are never given a wish without the power to make it true you may have to work for it however”  so kira i am sorry i will be late for dinner tonight   robert h “bob” lorsch ceo mmrglobal  wilshire blvd nd floor los angeles ca  tel  wwwmmrglobalcom wwwmymedicalrecordscom follow us on twitter at mmrglobal tags bob

robert lorsch  filed under posts by robert lorsch my sunday afternoons are usually spent like “three’s company” with kira my wife and michael selsman of investor relations for the company however these days we are so busy making news at mmr that we barely have the time to report it  kira who is also mmr’s spokesperson prepared a welcome dinner for luo jianhui vice president  chairman of unisoft groupunistonghe technology  unistonghe is mmrglobal’s joint venture partner in china mr luo arrived last night for a twoday visit to lorschville and meetings at mmr’s corporate headquarters regarding deployment of the latest versions of our mymedicalrecords personal health record in china we will be discussing the growth of health it in china since their nationwide emr launch was first announced in   since that time unis and mmr have formed unis tonghe mmr international health management service company ltd the venture was formed to enable both our organizations to participate in the growth of health it in china and in particular the expanded delivery of mymedicalrecords phrs in china in  the chinese government announced a usd  billion  billion yuan investment to support the development of medical and healthcare technologies the growth is driven by the upgrades of large hospital information systems and hit infrastructure as to the very good news following are a few of many headlines that you might look forward to in the coming months announcements on expansion of the company’s patent portfolio in the us and internationally updates on opportunities in the middle east in particular qatar  in fact one shareholder recently referred to me as needing to change my name to the emir of phrs continued announcements of licensing and settlement agreements as well as an expanded patent education and notification program to hospitals and healthcare professionals including major hospital systems such as pinnaclehealth and other ambulatory care facilities that i have been meeting with in pennsylvania specific announcements pertaining to licensing and deployment of the company’s products and services in wireless apps updates on milestone payments from biotech patents and the beginning of efforts to pursue infringement claims pertaining to the company’s anticd antibody ip the “my hospital everywhere” phr program in japan and the effect that mmr’s patents could have throughout the asia pacific region anticipated updates and announcements coming out of australia and singapore the culmination of all the above and more which the company will share in connection with its upcoming shareholder meeting in july our management team remains as committed as ever to our customers and shareholders  in the last four hours on a sunday night i have spoken with michael bobbie rich ingrid and eric all about different matters the entire team gives  seven by twentyfour so that mmr can take advantage of being in the fastestgrowing and biggest emerging market opportunity of our time healthcare many of you have followed kira and my efforts to help free dr shakil afridi  dr afridi is the man who helped verify the location of osama bin laden for the united states  without dr afridi’s participation we may not have pinpointed the location of the world’s most dangerous terrorist his reward has been capture torture and a sentence of  years in a remote prison in pakistan to learn more about the free afridi effort visit wwwfreeafridicom i just spent the last hour on the phone with pakistan preparing for interviews tomorrow   as we observe the second anniversary of the end of bin laden’s reign of terror follow the media coverage of kira and i appearing in national print media television and radio in our efforts to help free dr afridi we will do our best to post times for interviews on mmr’s facebook and twitter sites  we also appreciate your registering at wwwafridicom and voting on the “we the people petition” on that home page i will discuss the plight of dr shakil afridi and what concerned americans can do to help get him released while the company continues its efforts to notice and license hospitals and other healthcare providers we have spent the last couple of months focused on selling our products and services or licensing our patents in advance of requirements for patient portals and personal health records driven by stage  meaningful use although it has taken nine years since president george w bush signed a  executive order leading to the beginning of health it and mmr’s business of personal health records i am excited to see physicians hospital administrators and the general public understanding the value and importance of having a personal health record which is why i believe that followers of mmr will keep waking up to big news   robert h “bob” lorsch  ceo  mmrglobal  wilshire blvd nd floor los angeles ca  tel  follow me on twitter at boblorschtweets read more  comments   april th  as reprinted from pakistan and the wall street journal posted by robert lorsch  filed under posts by robert lorsch this is our time – there’s been an unprecedented outburst of activity at mmrglobal and in our personal lives  while the fight against terror is the operative agenda for our nation after the results of this week along those lines kira and i have continued spearheading the launch of the citizen campaign to free dr shakil afridi  dr afridi is currently imprisoned in pakistan after pinpointing the location of osama bin laden for the american government helping end the largest international hunt for the world’s most wanted terrorist it has been a week of heavy media coverage in our lives from the wall street journal fox news cspan and soon breitbart and others on the business front here at home the wall street journal ran an interview with athenahealth’s jonathan bush this week that speaks to the value and opportunities of the health it business particularly as it relates to online medical records  the piece highlighted that even today more than  pages of fax are still received in a doctor’s office per month this clearly underscores the value and significance of the mymedicalrecords patent portfolio in this extraordinary marketplace in fact as part of recent mmr press announcements the company called attention to a january   report published by the michael bass research group valuing mmr’s us patents at between  million to  billion based on what is described as conservative estimates of a market projected to reach a gdp value of  billion we expect those valuations to increase as a result of recent additional patents being granted to mmr in canada and japan as to pakistan please watch the important video of rep dana rohrabacher grilling secretary of state john kerry before the house committee on foreign affairs about dr afridi this week please view it on the front page of wwwfreeafridicom where you can also watch kira and me discussing this important topic all over network television the congressman forcefully called for the us to stop funding aid to pakistan while dr afridi “languishes in a dungeon” stating on a personal note “shame on us if we ignore dr afridi”  so true that this country can leave the man who pinpointed the location of osama bin laden behind at a time when we are reminded in the news this past week what he stood for you have the chance to show your support for congressman rohrabacher’s undiminished efforts to keep up the pressure on freeing dr afridi by signing a petition to free this american hero and support congressional resolution  when you visit freeafridicom you can click on “we the people” which is the link on the upper left corner of the page to sign the petition it’s especially important now because on april th a tribal court in pakistan will convene for the th time in as many months promising to rule on considering his release  if we get  signatures by the th the white house will comment and that could make all the difference so from the pages of the wall street journal a us congressman and the secretary of state on cspan and kira and me on the major networks like fox and cbs the hour days of my life are filled with excitement and opportunity most importantly i continue to focus on business opportunities including the exploitation of our hit and biotech patents by attending marathon meetings on licensing opportunities for the company while i am focused on mmr kira is off shooting a music video for the band ok go i am also planning on bringing the bob lorsch hidden talent revue back to beverly hills and spending at least ten minutes a day stressing over carpet stains from our rescue animals the good news is despite so many important things to do i have a feeling that soon my cell phone can take a break on a sunday or at least be put on vibrate robert h “bob” lorsch  ceo  mmrglobal  wilshire blvd nd floor los angeles ca  tel  wwwmmrglobalcom follow me
