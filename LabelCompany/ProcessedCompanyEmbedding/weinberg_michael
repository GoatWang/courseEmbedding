maritime law and claims including the jones act the death on the high seas act and the longshore harbor workers’ compensation act  as a maritime employee you are probably covered under either the jones act or the longshore harbor workers’ compensation actthe jones act is one of few federal laws that truly protects employees who are involved in workplace accidents  unlike the typical case where workers’ compensation coverage is present in which case suit against the employer is barred the jones act allows an injured employee to file suit directly against his or her employer and collect money damages for any of the employer’s or coemployee’s negligence which may have caused or contributed to the employee’s injury  the jones act also has other procedural and substantive advantages over the typical case maritime related or otherwise  there are special types of rules which define who classifies as a “seaman” and therefore who can sue under the jones act  accordingly it is crucial that you contact a knowledgeable and experienced attorney in order to maximize your recoveryif you do not classify as a seaman and therefore are not eligible to sue under the jones act you may still be eligible for compensation under the longshore harbor workers’ compensation act which is a form of workers’ compensation coverage for maritime employees who do not classify as seamen  even if you are not covered under either the jones act or the longshore harbor workers’ compensation act any employee passenger or other person may be covered under general maritime law  there are specific laws which cover injuries and damages sustained to those involved in any incident or accident in the areas defined by maritime these areas usually include ships vessels harbors piers platforms and others  the firm can help those and their loved ones who have been injured or killed in any type of maritime accidentif you are in need of legal representation for a jones act or maritime case please call the
