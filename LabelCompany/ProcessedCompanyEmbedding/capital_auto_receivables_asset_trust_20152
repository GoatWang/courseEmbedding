outlook stable class a at aaasf outlook stable class b at aasf outlook stable class c at asf outlook stable class d at bbbsf outlook stable class e at bbsf outlook stable key rating drivers the rating actions are based on available credit enhancement ce and loss performance to date the collateral pool continues to perform within fitchs expectations under the current structure and ce the securities are able to withstand stress scenarios consistent with the assigned ratings and make full payments to investors in accordance with the terms of the documents the initial recommended loss proxy of  for  incorporated an additional stress considering the potential postrevolving worstcase collateral pool this approach took into consideration a negative migration of the pool characteristics assuming the collateral migrates to the maximum collateral concentration limits during the revolving period to date the additional collateral added to the pool in the revolving period has been consistent when compared to the initial pool there have been minimal negative migrations with only one month left before the revolving period ends after which the transaction will begin to amortize as a result of the consistent collateral increased seasoning and low loss performance fitch revised its loss proxy down to  the revised proxy excludes the aforementioned additional stress given that there is only one month left during the revolving period and fitch expects the collateral to be very similar to the original pool mix at the end of this period the ratings reflect the quality of ally financial incs afin retail auto loan originations the sound financial and legal structure of the transaction and the strength of the servicing provided by ally rating sensitivities unanticipated increases in the frequency of defaults and loss severity could produce loss levels higher than the current projected base case loss proxies and impact available loss coverage and multiples levels for the transactions lower loss coverage could affect the ratings and rating outlooks depending on the extent of the decline in coverage in fitchs initial review of the transactions the notes were found to have limited sensitivity to a x and x increase of fitchs base case loss expectations to date the transactions have exhibited strong performance with losses well within fitchs initial expectations with rising loss coverage and multiple levels as such a material deterioration in performance would have to occur within the asset pools to have potential negative impact on the outstanding ratings due diligence usage
