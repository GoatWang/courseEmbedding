today kansas city mo  on a shelf near his computer monitors umb financial ceo j mariner kemper keeps a small bottle of amber cologne it smells horrible honestly but that doesnt matter he rarely opens it the cologne was made by a customer in the s who took a substantial loan to start a line of mens scents he quickly failed and the banks collateral included a warehouse full of the worthless bottles the bank then run by kempers grandfather gave them out as christmas presents the bottle is a reminder to act conservatively kemper says my father always said you should row close to shore says kemper  ive taken that to mean in everything we do we need to manage the risks  never do something that could take the whole business down sticking to its conservative approach earned kansas city mobased umb the no  spot behind bank of hawaii on forbes magazines rating at the end of  of the  largest us banks from best to worst crossstate rival commerce bank with headquarters in st louis and kansas city followed a similar strategy landing itself at no  on the forbes list theres something in the water here he says it also could be the genes commerces ceo is kempers cousin david kemper their greatgrandfather wt kemper had stakes in several banks two through various name changes became todays umb and commerce while other banks in the past decade chased profits in subprime mortgages and financial instruments whose risks most people including the bankers did not understand umb a regional bank with operations in seven states and commerce which operates in five states made relatively conservative loans and cautiously managed customers money now as congress deliberates over new regulations for financial companies bankers such as kemper feel theyre being punished for someone elses recklessness mariner kemper and david kemper  dont sit around at sunday dinner sharing strategy the financial ties between the kemper familys two banks were severed in the s the cousins rarely see each other except at an industry event or family weddings or funerals and their companies growth plans are different umb is expanding in financial services commerce is developing its retail business but their approaches are very similar both believe in conservative lending both focus on developing strong managers both are civicminded and support community and arts causes my father always says banking should be a boring business says john kemper david kempers son and commerce banks strategic planning director boring — but sturdy these banks were built to withstand a recession maybe even a depression and still be ahead of their competitors says peyton green an analyst at sterne agee thats very different from most banks nearly  banks have failed since january   this year according to the federal deposit insurance corp that compares with just  in  and three in  banks and financial institutions have  billion of the federal money spent in the recession to shore up the economy according to nonprofit website propublica about  of the total spent on business bailouts many banks got into trouble on mortgages says doug bernstein head of law firm plunkett cooneys banking bankruptcy and creditors rights practice group because they started taking too much risk on the loans if you want to gain market share maybe youre going to loan  of the propertys assessed value he says they were up to  or more in some cases if something goes bad or unemployment rises are your delinquencies going to go up sure bad things did happen and delinquencies still are going up the noncurrent loan rate for all banks was  in the first quarter up from  a year ago for all banks according to the fdic but delinquency rates at umb and commerce remain low just  of umbs loans are more than  days past due for commerce its  also neither umb nor commerce took any federal aid despite pressure from the government to participate they said it was the patriotic thing to do mariner kemper says but it never made sense to us past tough times umb and commerce have survived tough times in the past bank runs were common in the s in the midwest as crop failures hit wide swaths of the population and squeezed entire communities financially commerce opened in wild west kansas city in  by wt kemper made it through those runs on skill and goodwill it backed some smaller banks in trouble and saw the favors returned when it faced hard times during the depression umb ceo r crosby kemper sr reached out to customers after business hours unheard of then to quell their fear in march  commerce bank ceo wt kemper dealt with a run on his bank with apples he bought them at the farmers market and cheerily handed them out to panicked customers in line while the companies became kansas city institutions the family and its money got involved in everything from politics to the seat kemper arena to the kemper museum of contemporary art downtown caution was out of favor while holding fast to loanratio guidelines and creditscore standards now appears to have served them well it earned criticism in the past decade because it made them appear to be underperforming in  umb was trudging along with its conventional strategy of investing most of its deposits in government treasuries historically low interest rates crushed rates of return and the banks earnings fell  from  as a result share prices stayed nearly flat at about  mariner kemper took over the bank that spring from older brother r crosby kemper iii who now heads kansas citys library system one of his first moves however was anything but conservative he asked his father to step down as chairman of the board david kemper of commerce bancshares i didnt want to jobshadow for the rest of my life he says referring to the practice of having a new hire follow a veteran around to learn the ropes he has since moved to create profit centers for the bank so it is less dependent on interest rates and loans for revenue the company expanded into financial services including adding a small insurance company health care card processing and backoffice work for fund managers commerce bank under ceo david kemper has a different strategy it is focused on retail banking lending money in the community and supporting local businesses david kemper says he wants commerce to be a super community bank — large enough to meet the needs of businesses and individuals but retaining the feel ties and service of a smalltown bank we want to do business with people we know in places we know he says weve got the resources but were small enough to really know whats going on in the community commerce bank shifted its headquarters from kansas city where it still has a significant presence to st louis where david kemper decided to raise his family  years ago kemper has pushed his executives to become part of st louis the top  each sit on one or two charity or business boards the bank sponsors arts and education programs we only do as well as the community david kemper says its the right thing to do and its good for business branching out while kemper family members remain in top jobs at both companies the executive ranks are broadening mariner kemper is ceo of umb financial holdings but peter desilva now is the ceo of umb bank the first nonkemper over the wholly owned subsidiary david kemper and his brother jonathan kemper are the only family members on commerce banks member board and the ceos at both companies also say family members arent given priority over qualified outsiders but there is something to be said for lifelong grooming mariner kemper grew up unavoidably steeped in the family business and had his first job at umb as a teenager verifying employment claims on credit applications however he also studied political science as well as ceramics at the university of puget sound in tacoma wash as a child he says he resented the bank i grew up in a family where every conversation was about the bank he says most people dont like having things shoved down their throats but he realized as a young adult he says that it would have been unfortunate for me not to recognize the opportunity in front of me he asked for a job in colorado where his thengirlfriend nowwife megan lived he began building a commercial loans business in colorado and quickly grew that portfolio to  billion mariner kemper took over the bank at age  young for an otherwise conservative company — but about the same age his father was when he began running it he still lives in denver and has an office there while spending a few days each week in his kansas city office he says the job is satisfying but wearing i love what i do but i have been consumed by it he says different paths the four children of mariner kempers older cousin commerce bank ceo david kemper are closer to his age but have taken different paths even if headed into the family business a day at the office is a day at nbcs the office for david kempers two daughters carrie writes for the tv comedy and ellie appears in the show as receptionist erin son billy is studying history at stanford john  the commerce director of strategic planning also went to stanford then worked for management consultants mckinsey  co before taking a job at the bank his father says that outside experience gives his son perspective his insight will be needed as commerce like umb looks to expand while other banks are faltering but the bank plans to expand with you guessed it a conservative approach the cost of such caution is some missed opportunities david kemper says but it pays off in the long term weve definitively missed buying some banks he says but wed rather hit singles and doubles and have a very high batting average than hitting some home runs posted
