reported to often develop into a more chronic stable phase the incidence of pd is estimated between  and  of the population however the disease is believed to be underdiagnosed and undertreated dupuytrens contracture dc— dc is a progressive condition that limits hand function diminishes quality of life and may ultimately disable the hand through the inability to move or straighten one’s

precocious puberty cpp— precocious puberty is defined as the onset of developmental signs of sexual maturation earlier than would be expected based on population norms this is typically delineated as puberty onset before eight years in girls and nine years in boys in the most common form of cpp sexual maturation proceeds from a premature activation of the hypothalamicpituitarygonadal hpg axis the hpg axis is active during infancy dormant during childhood and reactivated at the onset of puberty the epidemiology of cpp is somewhat nebulous with a commonly cited prevalence range of one in  to one in  children cpp is known to occur more frequently in girls than in boys and has different predominant causes for each sex idiopathic cpp without an identifiable predisposing condition accounts for the majority of cases of precocious puberty in girls but is less frequent in boys central nervous system findings such as tumors and congenital malformations are more frequently observed in boys who present with central precocious puberty it is estimated that two thirds of precocious puberty cases in boys are due to neurological abnormalities the likelihood of an organic cause for cpp is greater

equivalent of a branded product for reasons apart from statutory marketing exclusivity such as the generic equivalent of a branded product that is difficult to formulate or manufacture we target these types of market opportunities to mitigate risks from competitive pressure commonly associated with commoditized generic products the timing of final fda approval of anda applications depends on a variety of factors including whether the applicant challenges any listed patents for the drug and whether the manufacturer of the reference listed drug is entitled to one or more regulatory exclusivity periods during which the fda is prohibited from approving generic equivalents in certain circumstances a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent and thus block andas from being approved until after the patent expiration date the time required to obtain fda approval of andas for a new product varies in time generally requiring a minimum of  months following

as government healthcare programs during the fourth quarter of  the company initiated a process to sell its litha and related subsahara african business assets and on february   the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell litha to acino pharma ag select products in development us generic pharmaceuticals our primary approach to generic pharmaceutical product development is to target highbarriertoentry generic products including firsttofile or firsttomarket opportunities our potential firsttofile and firsttomarket opportunities account for approximately onethird of our pipeline of andas we expect that these potential firsttofile and firsttomarket opportunities to result in products that are either exclusive or have two or fewer competitors when launched which we believe tends to lead to more sustainable market share and profitability for our product portfolio as of december   we had over  products in our pipeline which included approximately  andas pending with the fda representing approximately  billion of combined annual sales for the corresponding branded products in  including  potential firsttofile and four firsttomarket opportunities us branded pharmaceuticals xiaflex ® collagenase clostridium histolyticum or cch is currently approved and marketed in the us for the treatment of both dc and pd two separate indications we are progressing the cellulite development program following meetings held with the fda in december  and a subsequent followup meeting in december  in addition our phase b study was initiated and completed and the results were released in november  an end of phase  meeting with the fda occurred in early  and we will continue to work with the fda in advance of initiating our phase  clinical trials we also have the right to further develop xiaflex ® for additional indications including dupuytren’s nodules adhesive capsulitis and lateral hip fat plantar fibromatosis and human and canine lipomas international pharmaceuticals we have submitted applications for regulatory approval of various products in our international markets in addition rlx serelaxin is currently undergoing human clinical trials rlx is a novel treatment for acute heart failure and phase ii and iii studies suggested rlx helped patients with acute heart failure live longer trial results are expected in the second quarter of  competition generic pharmaceuticals in the generic pharmaceutical market we face intense competition from other generic drug manufacturers brand name pharmaceutical companies through authorized generics existing brand equivalents and manufacturers of therapeutically similar drugs our major competitors in the generics market including teva mylan sandoz and impax laboratories inc impax vary by specific product our primary strategy is to compete in the generic product market with a focus on highvalue firsttofile or firsttomarket opportunities regardless of therapeutic category and products that present significant barriers to entry for reasons such as complex formulation or regulatory or legal challenges by specializing in highbarriertoentry products we endeavor to market more profitable and longerlived products relative to commodity generic products we believe that our competitive advantages include our integrated teambased approach to product development that combines our formulation regulatory legal manufacturing and commercial capabilities our ability to introduce new generic equivalents for brandname drugs our quality and costeffective production our ability to meet customer expectations and the breadth of our existing generic product portfolio offering we make a significant portion of our sales to a relatively small number of drug wholesalers and retail drug store chains these customers play a key role in the distribution chain of our pharmaceutical products drug wholesalers and retail drug store chains have undergone and are continuing to undergo significant consolidation which has resulted in these groups gaining additional purchasing leverage that has increased the pricing pressures on our business additionally the emergence of large buying groups representing independent retail pharmacies and other drug distributors and the prevalence and influence of managed care organizations and similar institutions enable those groups to demand larger price discounts on our products for example there has been a recent trend of large retail customers forming partnerships with large wholesalers such as the alliances between walgreens and amerisourcebergen corporation between rite aid and mckesson drug company and between cvs and cardinal health as a result of these alliances as well as the consolidation among wholesale distributors and the growth of large retail drug store chains a small number of purchasers control a significant share of purchases and have gained more purchasing power that has heightened competition among generic drug producers for the business of this consolidated customer base  table of contents newly introduced generic products with limited or no other generic competition typically garner higher prices relative to commoditized generic products at the expiration of any statutory generic exclusivity period other generic distributors may enter the market resulting in significant price declines consequently the maintenance of profitable operations in generic pharmaceuticals depends in part on our continuing ability to select develop procure regulatory approvals of overcome legal challenges to launch and commercialize new generic products in a timely and cost efficient manner and to maintain efficient high quality manufacturing capabilities we also have diverse manufacturing capabilities covering almost all generic presentations such as solid oral dose gels liquids nasal sprays ophthalmics films transdermal patches and injectable products branded pharmaceuticals the branded pharmaceutical industry is highly competitive our products compete with products manufactured by many other companies in highly competitive markets throughout the us and internationally primarily through our paladin somar and litha businesses our competitors vary depending upon therapeutic and product categories competitors include many of the major brand name and generic manufacturers of pharmaceuticals with respect to branded pharmaceuticals our competitors including abbott laboratories abbott allergan plc allergan purdue pharma lp purdue jazz pharmaceuticals plc jazz shire plc shire horizon pharma plc horizon and mallinckrodt plc mallinckrodt among others  vary depending on product category dosage strength and drugdelivery systems we compete principally through targeted product development and our acquisition and inlicensing strategies the competitive landscape in the acquisition and inlicensing of pharmaceutical products has intensified in recent years as there has been a reduction in the number of compounds available and an increase in the number of companies and the collective resources bidding on available assets in addition to product development and acquisitions other competitive factors in the pharmaceutical industry include product efficacy safety ease of use price demonstrated costeffectiveness marketing effectiveness service reputation and access to technical information the competitive environment of the branded product business requires us to continually seek out technological innovations and to market our products effectively however some of our current branded products face competition not only from other brands but also from generic versions generic versions are generally significantly less expensive than branded versions and where available may be required in preference to the branded version under thirdparty reimbursement programs or substituted by pharmacies if competitors introduce new products delivery systems or processes with therapeutic or cost advantages our products can be subject to progressive price reductions or decreased volume of sales or both most new products that we introduce must compete with other products already on the market or products that are later developed by competitors manufacturers of generic pharmaceuticals typically invest far less in research and development than researchbased pharmaceutical companies and therefore can price their products significantly lower than branded products accordingly when a branded product loses its market exclusivity it normally faces intense price competition from generic forms of the product to successfully compete for business with managed care and pharmacy benefits management organizations we must often demonstrate that our products offer not only medical benefits but also cost advantages as compared with other forms of care we are aware of certain competitive activities involving opana ® er and other products for a description

international pharmaceuticals segments as a result of consolidation among wholesale distributors as well as rapid growth of large retail drug store chains a small number of large wholesale distributors control a significant share of the market and the number of independent drug stores and small drug store chains has decreased some wholesale distributors have demanded that pharmaceutical manufacturers including us enter into distribution service agreements dsas pursuant to which the wholesale distributors provide the pharmaceutical manufacturers with specific services including the

our exclusive license agreements extend to or beyond the patent expiration dates  table of contents the effect of these issued patents is that they provide us with patent protection for the claims covered by the patents the coverage claimed in a patent application can be significantly reduced before the patent is issued accordingly we do not know whether any of the applications we acquire or license will result in the issuance of patents or if any patents are issued whether they will provide significant proprietary protection or will be challenged circumvented or invalidated because unissued us patent applications are maintained in secrecy for a period of eighteen months and us patent applications filed prior to november   are not disclosed until such patents are issued and since publication of discoveries in the scientific or patent literature often lags behind actual discoveries we cannot be certain of the priority of inventions covered by pending patent applications moreover we may have to participate in interference and other inter parties proceedings declared by the pto to determine priority of invention or in opposition proceedings in a foreign patent office either of which could result in substantial cost to us even if the eventual outcome is favorable to us there can be no assurance that any patents if issued will be held valid by a court of competent jurisdiction an adverse outcome could subject us to significant liabilities to third parties require disputed rights to be licensed from third parties or require us to cease using such technology we believe that our patents the protection of discoveries in connection with our development activities our proprietary products technologies processes and knowhow and all of our intellectual property are important to our business all of our branded products and certain generic products such as endocet ® and endodan ® are sold under trademarks to achieve a competitive position we rely on trade secrets nonpatented proprietary knowhow and continuing technological innovation where patent protection is not believed to be appropriate or attainable in addition as outlined above we have a number of patent licenses from third parties some of which may be important to our business see note  license and collaboration agreements in the consolidated financial statements  included in part iv item  of this report exhibits financial statement schedules  there can be no assurance that any of our patents licenses or other intellectual property rights will afford us any protection from competition we rely on confidentiality agreements with our employees consultants and other parties to protect among other things trade secrets and other proprietary technology there can be no assurance that these agreements will not be breached that we will have adequate remedies for any breach that others will not independently develop equivalent proprietary information or that other third parties will not otherwise gain access to our trade secrets and other intellectual property we may find it necessary to initiate litigation to enforce our patent rights to protect our intellectual property or to determine the scope and validity of the proprietary rights of others litigation is costly and timeconsuming and there can be no assurance that our litigation expenses will not be significant in the

prosecution fda approval is typically required before any new drug can be marketed an nda or bla is a filing submitted to the fda to obtain approval of new chemical entities and other innovations for which thorough applied research is required to demonstrate safety and effectiveness in use the process generally involves • completion of preclinical laboratory and animal testing and formulation studies in compliance with the fda’s good laboratory practice glp regulations • submission to the fda of an investigational new drug ind application for human clinical testing which must become effective before human clinical trials may begin in the us • approval by an independent institutional review board irb before each trial may be initiated and continuing review during the trial •

applicable and • approval by the fda of the nda or bla clinical trials are typically conducted in three sequential phases although the phases may overlap • phase i generally involves testing the product for safety adverse effects dosage tolerance absorption distribution metabolism excretion and other elements of clinical pharmacology • phase ii trials typically involve a small sample of the intended patient population to assess the efficacy of the compound for a specific indication to determine dose tolerance and the optimal dose range as well as to gather additional information relating to safety and potential adverse effects • phase iii trials are undertaken in an expanded patient population at typically dispersed study sites in order to determine the overall riskbenefit ratio of the compound and to provide an adequate basis for product labeling each trial is conducted in accordance with certain standards under protocols that detail the objectives of the study the parameters to be used to monitor safety and efficacy criteria to be evaluated each protocol must be submitted to the fda as part of the ind data from preclinical testing and clinical trials are submitted to the fda in an nda or bla for marketing approval and to foreign government health authorities in a marketing authorization application consistent with each health authority’s specific regulatory requirements clinical trials are also subject to regulatory inspections by the fda and other regulatory authorities to confirm compliance with applicable regulatory standards the process of completing clinical trials for a new drug may take many years and require the expenditures of substantial resources see item a risk factors  “ the pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated which creates uncertainty about our ability to bring new products to market and imposes substantial compliance costs on our business ” for further discussion on fda approval as a condition of approval the fda or foreign regulatory authorities may require further studies including phase iv postmarketing studies or postmarketing data reporting results of postmarketing programs may limit or expand the further marketing of the products for some drugs the fda may require a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy rems which could include medication guides physician communication plans or other elements to make certain safe use in february  the fda sent letters to manufacturers of certain opioid drug products indicating that these drugs will be required to have a rems designed to reduce risks and improve the safe use of certain opioid drug products three products sold by endo were included in the list of affected opioid drugs opana ® er morphine sulfate er and oxycodone er in  the fda sent another letter requiring that the manufacturers of these drugs develop and submit to the fda a postmarket rems plan the fda approved a classwide extendedreleaselongacting rems in july  the goal of this rems is to reduce serious adverse outcomes resulting from inappropriate prescribing misuse and abuse of extendedrelease or longacting opioid analgesics while maintaining patient access to pain

business ” for further discussion  in recent years the fda has taken steps to reduce the maximum strength of acetaminophen in prescription combination drug products to help reduce or prevent the risk of liver injury from an unintentional overdose of acetaminophen among the company’s products impacted by the fda’s actions were three branded combination drug pain relief products percocet ®  endocet ® and zydone ®  and the generic combination drug pain relief products butalbitalacetaminophencaffeine hydrocodoneacetaminophen and oxycodoneacetaminophen in most instances fda approval of an anda is required before a generic equivalent of an existing or referencelisted drug can be marketed the anda process is abbreviated in that the fda waives the requirement of conducting complete preclinical and clinical studies and generally instead relies principally on bioequivalence studies bioequivalence generally involves a comparison of the rate of absorption and levels of concentration of a generic drug in the body with those of the previously approved drug when the rate and extent of absorption of systemically acting test and reference drugs are considered the same under the bioequivalence requirement the two drugs are considered bioequivalent and are generally regarded as therapeutically equivalent meaning that a pharmacist can substitute the product for the referencelisted drug under certain circumstances an anda may also be submitted for a product authorized by approval of an anda suitability petition such petitions may be submitted to secure authorization to file an anda for a product that differs from a previously approved drug in active ingredient route of administration dosage form or strength in september  and july  congress reauthorized pediatric testing legislation which now requires andas approved via the suitability petition route to conduct pediatric testing the timing of final fda approval of anda applications depends on a variety of factors including whether the applicant challenges any listed patents for the drug and whether the manufacturer of the reference listed drug is entitled to one or more statutory exclusivity periods during which the fda is prohibited from approving generic products in certain circumstances a regulatory exclusivity period can extend beyond the life of a patent and thus block andas from being approved on the patent expiration date  table of contents certain of our products are or in the future could be regulated and marketed as biologic products pursuant to blas our blalicensed products were licensed based on a determination by the fda of safety purity and potency as required under the public health service act phsa although the anda framework referenced above does not apply to generics of blalicensed biologics in  congress enacted the biologics price competition and innovation act of  bpcia as part of the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca which amended the phsa to create an abbreviated licensure pathway for products deemed to be biosimilar to or interchangeable with fdalicensed reference biological products under the bpcia following the expiration of a year reference exclusivity period fda may license under section k of the phsa a biologic that it determines is biosimilar to or interchangeable with a reference product licensed under section a of the phsa biosimilarity is defined to mean that the section k product is highly similar to the reference product notwithstanding minor differences in clinically inactive components and that there are no clinically meaningful differences between the section k product and the reference product in terms of the safety purity and potency of the product to be considered interchangeable a product must be biosimilar to the reference product be expected to produce the same clinical result as the reference product in any given patient and if administered more than once to an individual the risks in terms of safety or diminished efficacy of alternating or switching between use of the product and its reference product is not greater than the risk of using the reference product without such alternation or switch once any reference exclusivity period for our blalicensed biologics expires fda may approve under section k of the phsa another company’s bla for a biosimilar or interchangeable version of our product although licensure of a biosimilar or interchangeable under section k is generally expected to require less than the full complement of productspecific preclinical and clinical data required for innovator products licensed under section a fda has considerable discretion over the kind and amount of scientific evidence required to demonstrate biosimilarity and interchangeability and the agency has yet to issue regulations setting forth specific criteria for licensure of biosimilar or interchangeable products based on scientific developments postmarket experience or other legislative or regulatory changes the current fda standards of review for approving new pharmaceutical products are sometimes more stringent than those that were applied in the past including to certain opioid products as a result the fda does not have as extensive safety databases on these products as on some products developed more recently accordingly we believe the fda has expressed an intention to develop such databases for certain of these products including many opioids the st century cures act cures act was signed into law on december   the cures act includes various provisions to accelerate the development and delivery of new treatments such as those intended to expand the types of evidence manufacturers may submit to support fda drug approval to encourage patientcentered drug development to liberalize the communication of healthcare economic information hcei to payers and to create greater transparency with regard to manufacturer expanded access programs central to the cures act are provisions that enhance and accelerate fda’s processes for reviewing and approving new drugs and supplements to approved new drug applications ndas these include but are not limited to provisions that i require fda to establish a program to evaluate the potential use of real world evidence to help to support the approval of a new indication for an approved drug and to help to support or satisfy postapproval study requirements ii provide that fda may rely upon qualified data summaries to support the approval of a supplemental application with respect to a qualified indication for an already approved drug iii require fda to issue guidance for purposes of assisting sponsors in incorporating complex adaptive and other novel trial designs into proposed clinical protocols and applications for new drugs and iv require fda to establish a process for the qualification of drug development tools for use in supporting or obtaining fda approval for or investigational use of a drug the cures act also includes  billion in new funding to address what the act refers to as the “opioid abuse crisis” specifically the cures act authorizes the awarding of grants to states for the purpose of addressing opioid abuse within each state with preference to be given to states with an incidence or prevalence of opioid use disorders that is substantially higher relative to other states funding would be provided for states to supplement opioid abuse prevention and treatment activities such as improving prescription drug monitoring programs implementing prevention activities training for health care providers and expanding access to opioid treatment programs states receiving such grants would be required to report on activities funded by the grant in the substance abuse block grant report  table of contents we cannot determine what effect changes in the fda’s laws or regulations including legal or regulator interpretations when and if promulgated or upcoming advisory committee meetings may have on our business in the future changes could among other things require expanded or different labeling additional testing the recall or discontinuance of certain products and additional record keeping such changes could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows see item a risk factors  “ the pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated which creates uncertainty about our ability to bring new products to market and imposes substantial compliance costs on our business ” for further discussion in september  the fda announced classwide safety labeling changes and new postmarket study requirements for all extendedrelease and longacting erla opioids among other things the updated indication states that because of the risks of addiction abuse and misuse even at recommended doses and because of the greater risks of overdose and death these drugs should be reserved for use in patients for whom alternative treatment options are ineffective not tolerated or would be otherwise inadequate to provide sufficient management of pain erla opioid analgesics are not indicated for asneeded pain relief the fda is also requiring drug companies that make these products to conduct further studies and clinical trials to further assess the known serious risks of misuse abuse increased sensitivity to pain hyperalgesia addiction overdose and death it is not presently known what impact if any these changes to the indications for use or results from the postmarketing studies may have on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows a sponsor of an nda is required to identify in its application any patent that claims the drug or a use of the drug subject to the application upon nda approval the fda lists these patents in a publication referred to as the orange book any person that files a section b nda must make a certification in respect to listed patents the type of nda that may rely upon the data in the application for which the patents are listed or an anda to secure approval of a generic version of this first or listed drug the fda may not approve such an application for the drug until expiration of the listed patents unless  the generic applicant certifies that the listed patents are invalid unenforceable or not infringed by the proposed generic drug and gives notice to the holder of the nda for the listed drug of the basis upon which the patents are challenged and  the holder of the listed drug does not sue the later applicant for patent infringement within  days of receipt of notice under the current law if an infringement suit is filed the fda may not approve the later application until the earliest of  months after submission entry of an appellate court judgment holding the patent invalid unenforceable or not infringed such time as the court may order or the patent expires one of the key motivators for challenging patents is the day market exclusivity period visávis other generic applicants granted to the developer of a generic version of a product that is the first to have its application accepted for filing by the fda and whose filing includes a certification that the applicable patents are invalid unenforceable andor not infringed a paragraph iv certification and that prevails in litigation with the manufacturer of the branded product over the applicable patents under the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of   medicare act with accompanying amendments to the hatchwaxman act drug price competition and patent term restoration act this marketing exclusivity would begin to run upon the earlier of the commercial launch of the generic product or upon an appellate court decision in the generic company’s favor in addition the holder of the nda for the listed drug may be entitled to certain nonpatent exclusivity during which the fda cannot approve an application for a competing generic product or b nda product the fda enforces regulations to require that the methods used in and the facilities and controls used for the manufacture processing packing and holding of drugs conform to cgmps the cgmp regulations the fda enforces are comprehensive and cover all aspects of manufacturing operations compliance with the regulations requires a continuous commitment of time money and effort in all operational areas the fda conducts preapproval inspections of facilities engaged in the development manufacture processing packing testing and holding of the drugs subject to ndas and andas in addition manufacturers of both pharmaceutical products and active pharmaceutical ingredients apis used to formulate the drug also ordinarily undergo a preapproval inspection failure of any facility to pass a preapproval inspection will result in delayed approval and would have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows the fda also conducts periodic inspections of drug facilities to assess the cgmp status of marketed products following such inspections the fda may issue an untitled letter as an initial correspondence that cites violations that do not meet the threshold of regulatory significance for a warning letter fda guidelines also provide for the issuance of warning letters for violations of “regulatory significance” for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action finally the fda could issue a form  notice of inspectional observations which could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection if the fda were to find serious cgmp noncompliance during such an inspection it could take regulatory actions that could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows imported api and other components needed to manufacture our products could be rejected by us customs in respect to domestic establishments the fda could initiate product seizures or request or in some instances require product recalls and seek to enjoin or otherwise limit a product’s manufacture and distribution in certain circumstances violations could support civil penalties and criminal prosecutions in addition if the fda concludes that a company is not in compliance with cgmp requirements sanctions may be imposed that include preventing that company from receiving the necessary licenses to export its products and classifying that company as an unacceptable supplier thereby disqualifying that company from selling products to federal agencies  table of contents certain of our subsidiaries sell products that are “controlled

programs or subjecting sales of their products to certain price ceilings in addition to the costcontainment measures described in item a risk factors a final rule promulgated and reissued by the us department of defense dod in october  subjects drug sales to retail pharmacies under the tricare retail pharmacy program to certain price ceilings specifically under the final rule manufacturers are required among other things to pay refunds for prescriptions filled beginning on january   and extending to future periods based on the applicable ceiling price limits beginning in the first quarter of  a provision in the bipartisan budget act of  will also require drug manufacturers to pay additional rebates to state medicaid programs if the prices of their noninnovator drugs rise at a rate faster than inflation as continues to be the case for innovator products the federal andor state governments may continue to enact measures in the future aimed at containing or reducing payment levels for prescription pharmaceuticals paid for in whole or in part with government funds we cannot predict the nature of this or other such measures or their impact on our profitability and cash flows these efforts could however have material consequences for the pharmaceutical industry and the company from time to time legislative changes are made to government healthcare programs that impact our business congress continues to examine various medicare and medicaid policy proposals that may result in a downward pressure on the prices of prescription drugs in these programs see item a risk factors  “ the availability of third party reimbursement for our products is uncertain and thus we may find it difficult to maintain current price levels additionally the market may not accept those products for which third party reimbursement is not adequately provided ” for further discussion on medicare and medicaid reimbursements in march  president obama signed into law ppaca that has made major changes to the healthcare system one such change is the requirement that pharmaceutical manufacturers of branded prescription drugs must pay an annual fee to the federal government each individual pharmaceutical manufacturer must pay a prorated share of the total industry fee the fee is  billion for   billion for  and  billion for  decreasing to  billion for years thereafter based on the dollar value of its branded prescription drug sales to specified federal programs ppaca also expanded health insurance coverage to many previously uninsured americans through a combination of federal subsidies for lowerincome individuals who enrolled in health plans through health insurance exchanges and enabling states to expand medicaid eligibility with the federal government paying a high share of the cost  table of contents following the november  us elections uncertainty exists about the future of this insurance coverage expansion the current executive branch administration and congressional leaders have expressed interest in repealing these ppaca provisions and replacing them with alternatives that may be less costly and provide state medicaid programs and private health plans more flexibility if ppaca is repealed andor replaced in whole or in part it is possible that many of the reforms implemented as part of ppaca including those affecting the pharmaceutical industry may be repealed or amended as a result healthcare fraud and abuse laws we are subject to various federal state and local laws targeting fraud and abuse in the healthcare industry violations of which can lead to civil and criminal penalties including fines imprisonment and exclusion from participation in federal healthcare programs these laws are potentially applicable to us as both a manufacturer and a supplier of products reimbursed by federal healthcare programs and they also apply to hospitals physicians and other potential purchasers of our products the federal antikickback

may assert that a claim including items or services resulting from a violation of  usc § ab constitutes a false or fraudulent claim for purposes of the civil false claims act discussed below or the civil monetary penalties statute which imposes fines against any person who is determined to have presented or caused to be presented claims to a federal healthcare program that the person knows or should know is for an item or service that was not provided as claimed or is false or fraudulent the federal antikickback statute and implementing regulations provide for certain exceptions for “safe harbors” for certain discounting rebating or personal services arrangements among other things however the lack of uniform court interpretation of the antikickback statute makes compliance with the

healthcare program the qui tam provisions of the false claims act and similar state laws allow a private individual to bring civil actions on behalf of the federal or state government and to share in any monetary recovery the federal physician payments sunshine act and similar state laws impose reporting requirements for various types of payments to physicians and teaching hospitals failure to comply with required reporting requirements under these laws could subject manufacturers and others to substantial civil money penalties in addition government entities and private litigants have asserted claims under state consumer protection statutes against pharmaceutical and medical device companies for alleged false or misleading statements in connection with the marketing promotion andor sale of pharmaceutical and medical device products including state investigations of the company regarding the company’s vaginal mesh devices and investigations and litigation by certain government entities regarding the company’s marketing of opioid products international regulations our growing international operations have increased our interaction with regulatory authorities in other countries and made the company subject to laws and regulations that differ from those under which the company operates in the united states in most cases these regulatory agencies evaluate and monitor the safety efficacy and quality of pharmaceutical products govern the approval of clinical trials and product registrations and regulate pricing and reimbursement many of these markets have differing product preferences and requirements and operate in an environment of governmentmandated costcontainment programs including price controls several governments have placed restrictions on physician prescription levels and patient reimbursements emphasized greater use of generic drugs and enacted acrosstheboard price cuts as methods of cost control whether or not fda approval has been obtained for a product approval of the product by comparable regulatory authorities of other countries must be obtained prior to marketing the product in those countries the approval process may be more or less rigorous from country to country and the time required for approval may be longer or shorter than that required in the united states  table of contents service agreements we contract with various third parties to provide certain critical services including manufacturing supply warehousing distribution customer service certain financial functions certain research and development activities and medical affairs for a complete description of our significant manufacturing supply and other service agreements see note  commitments and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements  included in part iv item  of this report exhibits financial statement schedules  we primarily purchase our raw materials for the production and development of our products in the open market from third party suppliers however some raw materials are only available from one source we attempt when possible to mitigate our raw material supply risks through inventory management and alternative sourcing strategies we are required to identify the suppliers of all raw materials for our products in the drug applications that we file with the fda if the raw materials from an approved supplier for a particular product become unavailable we would be required to qualify a substitute supplier with the fda which would likely interrupt manufacturing of the affected product see item a risk factors for further discussion on the risks associated with the sourcing of our raw materials license  collaboration agreements and acquisitions we continue to seek to enhance our product line and develop a balanced portfolio of differentiated products through product acquisitions and inlicensing or acquiring licenses to products compounds and technologies from third parties the company enters into strategic alliances and collaborative arrangements with third parties which give the company rights to develop manufacture market andor sell pharmaceutical products the rights to which are primarily owned by these third parties these alliances and arrangements can take many forms including licensing arrangements codevelopment and comarketing agreements copromotion arrangements research collaborations and joint ventures such alliances and arrangements enable us to share the risk of incurring all research and development expenses that do not lead to revenuegenerating products however because profits from alliance products are shared with the counterparties to the collaborative arrangement the gross margins on alliance products are generally lower sometimes substantially so than the gross margins that could be achieved had the company not opted for a development partner for a full discussion including agreement terms and status see our disclosures in note  acquisitions and

pharmaceutical industry is intensely competitive and we face competition in our branded and generic pharmaceutical business in addition to product development safety efficacy commercialization marketing and promotion other competitive factors include product quality and price reputation service and access to scientific and technical information many of our competitors including abbott allergan purdue jazz shire horizon mallinckrodt teva mylan sandoz and impax among others may have greater resources than we do and we cannot predict with certainty the timing or impact of competitors’ products furthermore recent trends in this industry are toward further market consolidation of large drug companies into a smaller number of very large entities further concentrating financial technical and market strength and increasing competitive pressure in the industry it is possible that our competitors may make greater research and development investments and have more efficient or superior processes and systems and that their new products may make our products or technologies uncompetitive or obsolete furthermore academic institutions government agencies and other public and private organizations conducting research may seek patent protection and may establish collaborative arrangements for competitive products or programs if we fail to compete successfully our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows could be materially adversely affected our branded products face competition from generic versions generic versions are generally significantly cheaper than branded versions and where available may be required or encouraged in place of the branded version under thirdparty reimbursement programs or substituted by pharmacies for branded versions by law the entrance of generic competition to our branded products generally reduces our market share and adversely affects our profitability and cash flows further certain asian and other overseas generic competitors may be able to produce products at costs lower than the costs of domestic manufacturers if we experience substantial competition from asian or other overseas generic competitors with lower production costs our profit margins will suffer in addition certain of our branded products are not protected by patent rights or have limited patent life and will soon lose patent protection loss of patent protection for a branded product typically is followed promptly by generic substitutes as a result sales of many of these branded products may decline or stop growing over time generic competition with our branded products has had and will continue to have a material adverse effect on the net sales and profitability of our branded products in addition our generics business faces competition from brandname pharmaceutical companies which have taken aggressive steps to thwart or delay competition from generic equivalents of their brandname products the actions taken by competing brand name pharmaceutical companies may increase the costs and risks associated with our efforts to introduce generic products and may delay or prevent such introduction altogether our sales may also suffer as a result of changes in consumer demand for our products including those related to fluctuations in consumer buying patterns tied to seasonality or the introduction of new products by competitors which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial conditions and cash flows if generic manufacturers use litigation and regulatory means to obtain approval for generic versions of our branded drugs our sales may suffer under the hatchwaxman act the us food and drug administration fda can approve an abbreviated new drug application anda for a generic bioequivalent version of a previously approved drug without requiring the anda applicant to undertake the full clinical testing necessary to obtain approval to market a new drug in place of such clinical studies an anda applicant usually needs only to submit data demonstrating that its generic product is bioequivalent to the branded product  table of contents various generic manufacturers have filed andas seeking fda approval for generic versions of certain of our key pharmaceutical products including but not limited to lidoderm ®  both formulations of opana ® er aveed ® and megace es ®  in connection with such filings these manufacturers have challenged the validity andor enforceability of one or more of the underlying patents protecting our products in the case of lidoderm ® and megace es ®  we no longer have patent protection in the markets where we sell these products our revenues from lidoderm ® have been negatively affected by actavis’s september  launch and mylan’s august  launch of their lidocaine patch  generic versions of lidoderm ®  and we anticipate that these revenues could decrease further should one or more additional generic versions launch with respect to opana ® er aveed ® and other branded pharmaceutical products it has been and continues to be our practice to vigorously defend and pursue all available legal and regulatory avenues in defense of the intellectual property rights protecting our products despite our efforts to defend our products litigation is inherently uncertain and we cannot predict the timing or outcome of our efforts if we are not successful in defending our intellectual property rights or opt to settle or if a product’s marketing exclusivity rights expire or become otherwise unenforceable our competitors could ultimately launch generic versions of our products which could significantly decrease our revenues and could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows as well as our share price for a complete description of the related legal proceedings see note  commitments and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements  included in part iv item  of this report exhibits financial statement schedules  as a result there are currently ongoing legal proceedings brought by us andor our subsidiaries and in certain cases our third party partners against manufacturers seeking fda approval for generic versions of our products if we fail to obtain exclusive marketing rights for our generic pharmaceutical products or fail to introduce these generic products on a timely basis our revenues gross margin and operating results may decline the hatchwaxman amendments to the federal food drug and cosmetic act provide for a period of  days of marketing exclusivity for a generic version of a previously approved drug for any applicant that is firsttofile an anda containing a certification of invalidity noninfringement or unenforceability related to a patent listed with respect to the corresponding brandname drug commonly referred to as a “paragraph iv certification” a large portion of our revenues for our us generic pharmaceuticals segment have been derived from the sales of generic drugs during such day marketing exclusivity period permitted under the hatchwaxman act and from the sale of other generic products for which there otherwise is limited competition andas that contain paragraph iv certifications challenging patents however generally become the subject of patent litigation that can be both lengthy and costly there is no certainty that we will prevail in any such litigation that we will be the firsttofile and be granted the day marketing exclusivity period or if we are granted the day marketing exclusivity period that we will not forfeit such period even where we are awarded marketing exclusivity we may be required to share our exclusivity period with other anda applicants who submit paragraph iv certifications in addition brandname pharmaceutical companies often authorize a generic version of the corresponding brandname drug to be sold during any period of marketing exclusivity that is awarded described further below furthermore timely commencement of the litigation by the patent owner imposes an automatic stay of anda approval by the fda for  months unless the case is decided in the anda applicant’s favor during that period finally if the court decision is adverse to the anda applicant the anda approval will be delayed until the challenged patent expires and the applicant will not be granted the day marketing exclusivity the future profitability of our us generic pharmaceutical segment depends to a significant extent upon our ability to introduce on a timely basis new generic products that are either the firsttomarket or among the firsttomarket or that otherwise can gain significant market share during the day marketing period as permitted by the hatchwaxman act our ability to timely bring our products to market is dependent upon among other things the timing of regulatory approval of our products which to a large extent is outside of our control as well as the timing of competing products our revenues and future profitability are dependent in large part upon our ability or the ability of our development partners to file timely and effectively andas with the fda or to enter into contractual relationships with other parties that have obtained marketing exclusivity no assurances can be given that we will be able to develop and introduce commercially successful products in the future within the time constraints necessary to be successful if we or our development partners are unable to continue to timely and effectively file andas with the fda or to partner with other parties that have obtained marketing exclusivity our revenues and operating results may decline significantly and our prospects and business may be materially adversely affected  table of contents we may be the subject of product liability claims or product recalls and we may be unable to obtain or maintain insurance adequate to cover potential liabilities our business exposes us to significant potential risk from product liability claims other significant litigation matters government investigations or product recalls including but not limited to such matters associated with the testing manufacturing marketing and sale of our products we have been in the past and continue to be subject to various product liability cases other litigations and government investigations in addition to direct expenditures for damages settlement and defense costs there is a possibility of adverse publicity loss of revenues and disruption of business as a result of product liability claims or other litigation matters some plaintiffs have received substantial damage awards in some jurisdictions against pharmaceutical andor medical device companies based upon claims for injuries allegedly caused by the use of their products in addition in the age of social media plaintiffs’ attorneys have a wide variety of tools to advertise their services and solicit new clients for litigation thus we could expect that any significant product liability litigation or mass tort in which we are a defendant will have a larger number of plaintiffs than such actions have seen historically because of the increasing use of widespread and mediavaried advertising in addition it may be necessary for us to voluntarily or mandatorily recall or withdraw products that do not meet approved specifications or which subsequent data demonstrate may be unsafe or ineffective or misused any such recall or withdraw could result in adverse publicity costs connected to the recall and loss of revenue if we are found liable on a product liability claim or series of claims defaults could be declared under our debt agreements we could suffer reputational damage and we could incur losses any of which could materially and adversely impact our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows our pharmaceutical and medical device products may cause or may appear to cause serious adverse side effects or potentially dangerous drug interactions if misused improperly prescribed or subject to faulty surgical technique for example we andor certain of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in multiple lawsuits in various federal and state courts alleging personal injury resulting from use of transvaginal surgical mesh products designed to treat pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence through our astora women’s health business astora we and certain plaintiffs’ attorneys representing meshrelated product liability claimants have entered into various master settlement agreements msas regarding settling up to approximately    filed and unfiled mesh claims handled or controlled by the participating attorneys these msas which were executed at various times since june  were entered into solely by way of compromise and settlement and are not in any way an admission of liability or fault by us andor any of our subsidiaries as of december   our product liability accrual for vaginal mesh cases totaled   million  for all known claims for which a liability is probable we may be subject to additional liabilities arising out of these claims and are responsible for the cost of managing these claims in addition to claims covered by msas we are currently aware of approximately  claims that have been filed asserted or that we believe are likely to be asserted that have not been accrued for because we lack sufficient information to determine whether any potential loss is probable in addition there may be other claims asserted in the future it is currently not possible to estimate the number or validity of any such future claims although we believe there is a reasonable possibility that a loss in excess of the amount recognized exists we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount accrued at this time we cannot confirm to you that we will be able to obtain or maintain product liability insurance in the future on acceptable terms or with adequate coverage against potential liabilities or other losses such as the cost of a recall if any claim is brought against us regardless of the success or failure of the claim for example we no longer have product liability insurance to cover the claims in connection with the meshrelated litigation described above additionally we may be limited by the surviving insurance policies of our acquired subsidiaries which may not be adequate to cover against potential liabilities or other losses the failure to generate sufficient cash flow or to obtain other financing could affect our ability to pay the amounts due under those liabilities not covered by insurance see note  commitments and contingencies in the consolidated financial statements  included in part iv item  of this report exhibits financial statement schedules for further discussion of our product liability claims our ability to protect and maintain our proprietary and licensed third party technology which is vital to our business is uncertain our success competitive position and future income will depend in part on our ability to obtain and protect patent rights relating to the technologies processes and products we have developed and are currently developing and may develop in the future our policy is to seek patent protection for technologies processes and products we own and to enforce the intellectual property rights we own and license we cannot confirm to you that patent applications we submit and have submitted will result in patents being issued if an invention qualifies as a joint invention the joint inventor may have rights in the invention and we cannot confirm to you that the joint inventor will protect the intellectual property rights to the joint invention we cannot confirm to you that a third party will not infringe upon design around or develop uses not covered by any patent issued or licensed to us or that these patents will otherwise be commercially viable in this regard the patent position of pharmaceutical compounds and compositions is particularly uncertain even issued patents may later be modified or revoked by the pto by analogous foreign offices or in legal proceedings upon the expiration or loss of necessary intellectual property protection for a product others may manufacture and distribute our patented products which will result in a loss of a significant portion of our sales of that product  table of contents in addition our success particularly in our branded businesses depends in part on the ability of our partners and suppliers to obtain maintain and enforce patents and protect trademarks trade secrets knowhow and other intellectual property and proprietary information our ability to commercialize any branded product successfully will largely depend upon our or any partner’s or supplier’s ability to obtain and maintain patents and trademarks of sufficient scope to lawfully prevent thirdparties from developing andor marketing infringing products we cannot confirm to you as to the degree of protection any patents will afford including whether the protection obtained will be of sufficient breadth and degree to protect our commercial interests in all the countries where we conduct business furthermore we cannot confirm to you that our products will not infringe the patents or other intellectual property rights held by third parties if we infringe the intellectual property rights of others we could lose our right to develop manufacture or sell products or we could be required to pay monetary damages or royalties to license proprietary rights from third parties an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or a failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing or selling our products the company also relies on trade secrets and other unpatented proprietary information which it generally seeks to protect by confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with its employees consultants advisors and partners these agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of confidential information and may not provide the company with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized disclosure in addition if the company’s employees scientific consultants or partners develop inventions or processes that may be applicable to the company’s products under development such inventions and processes will not necessarily become the company’s property but may remain the property of those persons or their employers our competitors or other third parties may allege that we are infringing their intellectual property forcing us to expend substantial resources in litigation the outcome of which is uncertain any unfavorable outcome of such litigation including losses related to “atrisk” product launches could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position and results of operations companies that produce branded pharmaceutical products routinely bring litigation against anda or similar applicants that seek regulatory approval to manufacture and market generic forms of their branded products alleging patent infringement or other violations of intellectual property rights patent holders may also bring patent infringement suits against companies that are currently marketing and selling approved generic products litigation often involves significant expense and can delay or prevent introduction or sale of our generic products if patents are held valid enforceable and infringed by our products we would unless we could obtain a license from the patent holder need to delay selling our corresponding generic product and if we are already selling our product cease selling and potentially destroy existing product stock there may be situations in which we may make business and legal judgments to market and sell products that are subject to claims of alleged patent infringement prior to final resolution of those claims by the courts based upon our belief that such patents are invalid unenforceable or are not infringed by our marketing and sale of such products this is referred to in the pharmaceutical industry as an “atrisk” launch the risk involved in an atrisk launch can be substantial because if a patent holder ultimately prevails against us the remedies available to such holder may include among other things damages measured by the profits lost by the patent holder which can be significantly higher than the profits we make from selling the generic version of the product moreover if a court determines that such infringement is willful the damages could be subject to trebling we could face substantial damages from adverse court decisions in such matters we could also be at risk for the value of such inventory that we are unable to market or sell agreements between branded pharmaceutical companies and generic pharmaceutical companies are facing increased government scrutiny in the us and abroad we are involved in numerous patent litigations in which generic companies challenge the validity or enforceability of our products’ listed patents andor the applicability of these patents to the generic applicant’s products likewise our us generic pharmaceuticals segment is also involved in patent litigations in which we challenge the validity or enforceability of innovator companies’ listed patents andor their applicability to our generic products therefore settling patent litigations has been and is likely to continue to be part of our business parties to such settlement agreements in the us including us are required by law to file them with the us federal trade commission the ftc and the antitrust division of the department of justice doj for review the ftc has publicly stated that in its view such settlement agreements may violate the antitrust laws in some instances the ftc has brought actions against brand and generic companies that have entered into such agreements accordingly we may receive formal or informal requests from the ftc for information about a particular settlement agreement and there is a risk that the ftc may commence an action against us alleging violation of the antitrust laws  table of contents in addition some members of congress have proposed legislation that would limit the types of settlement agreements generic manufacturers can enter into with brand companies in  the supreme court in ftc v actavis  determined that reverse payment patent settlements between generic and brand companies should be evaluated under the rule of reason but provided limited guidance beyond the selection of this standard because the supreme court did not articulate the full range of criteria upon which a determination of legality of such settlements would be based or provide guidance on the precise circumstances under which such settlements would always qualify as legal there may be extensive litigation over what constitutes a reasonable and lawful patent settlement between a brand and generic company we are subject to multiple lawsuits purporting to be class actions brought by direct and indirect payers alleging that our settlement agreements respectively with watson regarding the lidoderm ® patent litigation and with impax regarding the opana ® er patent litigation were unlawful in violation of federal antitrust laws as well as various state laws we have significant goodwill and other intangible assets consequently potential impairment of goodwill and other intangibles may significantly impact our profitability goodwill and other intangibles represent a significant portion of our assets as of december   and   goodwill and other intangibles comprised approximately  and   respectively of our total assets goodwill and other intangible assets are subject to an impairment analysis whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable additionally goodwill and indefinitelived assets are subject to an impairment test at least annually for the years ended december    and  we recorded asset impairment charges of  million   million and  million  respectively which related primarily to goodwill and other intangible assets the procedures and assumptions used in our goodwill and intangible assets impairment testing and the results of our testing are discussed in item  of this report management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the captions “ critical accounting estimates ” and “ results of operations ” events giving rise to impairment of goodwill or intangible assets are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and often cannot be predicted as a result of the significance of goodwill and other intangible assets our results of operations and financial position in a future period could be negatively impacted should additional impairments of our goodwill or other intangible assets occur we are subject to various regulations pertaining to the marketing of our products and services  we are subject to various federal and state laws pertaining to healthcare fraud and abuse involving the marketing and pricing of our products and services including prohibitions on the offer of payment or acceptance of kickbacks or other remuneration for the purchase of our products and services including inducements to potential patients to request our products and services and inducements to healthcare professionals to prescribe and use our products additionally product promotion educational activities support of continuing medical education programs and other interactions with healthcare professionals must be conducted in a manner consistent with the fda regulations and the antikickback statute the antikickback statute with certain exceptions or exemptions published by the office of the inspector general of the department of health and human services hhsoig prohibits persons or entities from knowingly and willfully soliciting receiving offering or providing remuneration directly or indirectly to induce either the referral of an individual or the furnishing recommending or arranging for a good or service for which payment may be made under federal healthcare programs such as the medicare and medicaid programs violations of the antikickback statute also carry potential federal false claims act liability additionally many states have adopted laws similar to the antikickback statute without identical exceptions or exemptions some of these state prohibitions apply to referral of patients for healthcare items or services reimbursed by any thirdparty payer not only the medicare and medicaid programs any such new regulations or requirements may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with may delay our introduction of new products may adversely affect our total revenues and may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows sanctions for violating these laws include criminal penalties and civil sanctions and possible exclusion from federal funded healthcare programs such as medicare and medicaid as well as potential liability under the false claims act and applicable state false claims acts there can be no assurance that our practices will not be challenged under these laws in the future that changes in these laws or interpretation of these laws would not give rise to new challenges of our practices or that any such challenge would not have a material adverse effect on our business or results of operations law enforcement agencies sometimes initiate investigations into sales marketing andor pricing practices based on preliminary information or evidence and such investigations can be and often are closed without any enforcement action nevertheless these types of investigations and any related litigation can result in i large expenditures of cash for legal fees payment of penalties and compliance activities ii limitations on operations iii diversion of management resources iv injury to our reputation and v decreased demand for our products  table of contents in addition our company is subject to statutory and regulatory restrictions on the promotion of uses of prescription drugs or devices that are not cleared or approved by the fda although the fda does not regulate a physician’s choice of medications treatments or product uses the fdca and fda regulations and guidance significantly restrict the ability of pharmaceutical and medical device companies to communicate with patients physicians and other thirdparties about unapproved or uncleared product uses fda ftc the hhsoig the doj and various state attorneys general actively enforce state and federal prohibitions on the promotion of unapproved uses as well as prohibitions against promotional practices deemed false or misleading a company that is found to have improperly promoted its products under these laws may be subject to significant liability including significant administrative civil and criminal sanctions including but not limited to significant civil damages criminal fines and exclusion from participation in medicare medicaid and other federal healthcare programs applicable laws governing product promotion also provide for administrative civil and criminal liability for individuals including in some circumstances potential strict vicarious liability conduct giving rise to such liability could also form the basis for private civil litigation by thirdparty payers or other persons allegedly harmed by such conduct we have established and implemented a corporate compliance program designed to prevent detect and correct violations of state and federal healthcare laws including laws related to advertising and promotion of our drugs and devices nonetheless the fda ftc hhsoig the doj andor the state attorneys general and  qui tam  relators may take the position that we are not in compliance with such requirements and if such noncompliance is proven the company and in some cases individual employees may be subject to significant liability including the aforementioned administrative civil and criminal sanctions furthermore in february  we entered into a deferred prosecution agreement dpa with the us department of justice and a corporate integrity agreement cia with the us department of health and human services to resolve allegations regarding the promotion of lidoderm ®  in march  our subsidiary par entered into a cia and a plea agreement with the us department of justice to resolve allegations regarding the promotion of megace es ®  those agreements place certain obligations on us related to the marketing of our branded pharmaceutical products and our healthcare regulatory compliance program including reporting requirements to the us government detailed requirements for our compliance program code of conduct and policies and procedures and the requirement to engage an independent review organization we have implemented procedures and practices to comply with the cia including the engagement of an independent review organization in the event we breach the dpa the plea agreement andor the cia there is a risk the government would seek remedies provided for in those agreements including instituting criminal prosecution against us seeking to impose stipulated penalties or seeking to exclude us from participation in federal health care programs the pharmaceutical industry is heavily regulated which creates uncertainty about our ability to bring new products to market and imposes substantial compliance costs on our business  governmental authorities such as the fda impose substantial requirements on the development manufacture holding labeling marketing advertising promotion distribution and sale of therapeutic pharmaceutical products through lengthy and detailed laboratory and clinical testing and other costly and timeconsuming procedures in addition before obtaining regulatory approvals for certain generic products we must conduct limited bioequivalence studies and other research to show comparability to the branded products a failure to obtain satisfactory results in required premarketing trials may prevent us from obtaining required regulatory approvals the fda may also require companies to conduct postapproval studies and postapproval surveillance regarding their drug products and to report adverse events before obtaining regulatory approvals for the sale of any of our new product candidates we must demonstrate through preclinical studies and clinical trials that the product is safe and effective for each intended use preclinical and clinical studies may fail to demonstrate the safety and effectiveness of a product likewise we may not be able to demonstrate through clinical trials that a product candidate’s therapeutic benefits outweigh its risks even promising results from preclinical and early clinical studies do not always accurately predict results in later large scale trials a failure to demonstrate safety and efficacy could or would result in our failure to obtain regulatory approvals clinical trials can be delayed for reasons outside of our control which can lead to increased development costs and delays in regulatory approval for example there is substantial competition to enroll patients in clinical trials and such competition has delayed clinical development of our products in the past for example patients may not enroll in clinical trials at the rate expected or patients may drop out after enrolling in the trials or during the trials in addition we rely on collaboration partners that may control or make changes in trial protocol and design enhancements or encounter clinical trial compliancerelated issues which may also delay clinical trials product supplies may be delayed or be insufficient to treat the patients participating in the clinical trials or manufacturers or suppliers may not meet the requirements of the fda or foreign regulatory authorities such as those relating to current good manufacturing practices we also may experience delays in obtaining or we may not obtain required initial and continuing approval of our clinical trials from institutional review boards we cannot confirm to you that we will not experience delays or undesired results in these or any other of our clinical trials  table of contents we cannot confirm to you that the fda or foreign regulatory agencies will approve clear for marketing or certify any products developed by us or that such approval will not subject the marketing of our products to certain limits on indicated use the fda or foreign regulatory authorities may not agree with our assessment of the clinical data or they may interpret it differently such regulatory authorities may require additional or expanded clinical trials any limitation on use imposed by the fda or delay in or failure to obtain fda approvals or clearances of products developed by us would adversely affect the marketing of these products and our ability to generate product revenue which would adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations in addition with respect specifically to pharmaceutical products the submission of a new drug application nda or anda to the fda with supporting clinical safety and efficacy data for example does not guarantee that the fda will grant approval to market the product meeting the fda’s regulatory requirements to obtain approval to market a drug product which varies substantially based on the type complexity and novelty of the pharmaceutical product typically takes years and is subject to uncertainty additional delays may result if an fda advisory committee or other regulatory authority recommends nonapproval or restrictions on approval although the fda is not required to follow the recommendations of its advisory committees it usually does a negative advisory committee meeting could signal a lower likelihood of approval although the fda may still end up approving our application regardless of an advisory committee meeting outcome or the fda’s final approval decision public presentation of our data may shed positive or negative light on our application with respect to our supplemental new drug application for opana ® er the fda has scheduled a joint meeting of the drug safety and risk management advisory committee and the anesthetic and analgesic drug products advisory committee in march  to discuss pre and postmarketing data about the abuse of opana ® er and the overall riskbenefit of this product the advisory committees also will discuss abuse of generic oxymorphone er and oxymorphone immediaterelease ir products the advisory committees will likely make recommendations to the fda as to whether additional measures should be taken to control the abuse potential of these products including a possible recommendation to remove these products from us markets some drugs are available in the united states that are not the subject of an fdaapproved nda in  the fda’s center for drug evaluation and research “cder” office of compliance modified its enforcement policy with regard to the marketing of such “unapproved” marketed drugs under cder’s revised guidance the fda encourages manufacturers to obtain nda approvals for such drugs by requiring unapproved versions to be removed from the market after an approved version has been introduced subject to a grace period at the fda’s discretion this grace period is intended to allow an orderly transition of supply to the market and to mitigate any potential related drug shortage depending on the length of the grace period and the time it takes for subsequent applications to be approved this may result in a period of de facto market exclusivity to the first manufacturer that has obtained an approved nda for the previously unapproved marketed drug we may seek fda approval for certain unapproved marketed drug products through the b regulatory pathway even if we receive approval for an nda under section b the fda may not take timely enforcement action against companies marketing unapproved versions of the drug therefore we cannot be sure that that we will receive the benefit of any de facto exclusive marketing period or that we will fully recoup the expenses incurred to obtain an approval in addition certain competitors and others have objected to the fda’s interpretation of section b if the fda’s interpretation of section b is successfully challenged this could delay or even prevent the fda from approving any nda that we submit under section b moreover even if our product candidates are approved under section b the approval may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which the products may be marketed or to other conditions of approval or may contain requirements for costly postmarketing testing and surveillance to monitor the safety or efficacy of the products the anda approval process for a new product varies in time generally requiring a minimum of  months following submission of the anda to fda but could also take several years from the date of application the timing for the anda approval process for generic products is difficult to estimate and can vary significantly anda approvals if granted may not include all uses known as indications for which a company may seek to market a product further once a product is approved or cleared for marketing failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements can result in among other things suspensions or withdrawals of approvals or clearances seizures or recalls of products injunctions against the manufacture holding distribution marketing and sale of a product and civil and criminal sanctions furthermore changes in existing regulations or the adoption of new regulations could prevent us from obtaining or affect the timing of future regulatory approvals or clearances meeting regulatory requirements and evolving government standards may delay marketing of our new products for a considerable period of time impose costly procedures upon our activities and result in a competitive advantage to larger companies that compete against us based on scientific developments postmarket experience or other legislative or regulatory changes the current fda standards of review for approving new pharmaceutical products or new indications or uses for approved or cleared products are sometimes more stringent than those that were applied in the past  table of contents some new or evolving fda review standards or conditions for approval or clearance were not applied to many established products currently on the market including certain opioid products as a result the fda does not have as extensive safety databases on these products as on some products developed more recently accordingly we believe the fda has expressed an intention to develop such databases for certain of these products including many opioids in particular the fda has expressed interest in specific chemical structures that may be present as impurities in a number of opioid narcotic active pharmaceutical ingredients such as oxycodone which based on certain structural characteristics and laboratory tests may indicate the potential for having mutagenic effects fda has required and may continue to require more stringent controls of the levels of these impurities in drug products for approval also the fda may require labeling revisions formulation or manufacturing changes andor product modifications for new or existing products containing such impurities the fda’s more stringent requirements together with any additional testing or remedial measures that may be necessary could result in increased costs for or delays in obtaining approval for certain of our products in development although we do not believe that the fda would seek to remove a currently marketed product from the market unless such mutagenic effects are believed to indicate a significant risk to patient health we cannot make any such assurance in may of  an fda advisory panel recommended mandatory training of all physicians who prescribe opioids on the risks of prescription opioids in  the cdc also issued a guideline for prescribing opioids for chronic pain that provides recommendations for primary care clinicians who are prescribing opioids for chronic pain outside of active cancer treatment palliative care and endoflife care in addition state health departments and boards of pharmacy have authority to regulate distribution and may modify their regulations with respect to prescription narcotics in an attempt to curb abuse in either case any such new regulations or requirements may be difficult and expensive for us to comply with may delay our introduction of new products may adversely affect our total revenues and may have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows the fda has the authority to require companies to undertake additional postapproval studies to assess known or signaled safety risks and to make any labeling changes to address those risks the fda also can require companies to formulate approved risk evaluation and mitigation strategies rems to confirm a drug’s benefits outweigh its risks for example in  we along with other manufacturers of longacting and extendedrelease opioid drug products received a letter from the fda requiring that we develop and submit to the fda a postmarket rems plan for our opana ® er morphine sulfate er and oxycodone er drug products to require that training is provided to prescribers of these products and that information is provided to prescribers that they can use in counseling patients about the risks and benefits of opioid drug use in december  the fda approved our interim rems for opana ® er which was subsequently superseded by the classwide extendedreleaselongacting rems approved in july  the goal of this rems is to reduce serious adverse outcomes resulting from inappropriate prescribing misuse and abuse of extendedrelease or longacting opioid analgesics while maintaining patient access to pain medications the rems includes a medication guide elements to assure safe use and annual rems assessment reports the fda’s exercise of its authority under the ffdca could result in delays or increased costs during product development clinical trials and regulatory review increased costs to comply with additional postapproval regulatory requirements and potential restrictions on sales of approved products foreign regulatory agencies often have similar authority and may impose comparable requirements and costs postmarketing studies and other emerging data about marketed products such as adverse event reports may also adversely affect sales of our products furthermore the discovery of significant safety or efficacy concerns or problems with a product in the same therapeutic class as one of our products that implicate or appear to implicate the entire class of products could have an adverse effect on sales of our product or in some cases result in product withdrawals the fda has continuing authority over the approval of an nda or anda and may withdraw approval if among other reasons postmarketing clinical or other experience tests or data show that a drug is unsafe for use under the conditions upon which it was approved or if fda determines that there is a lack of substantial evidence of the drug’s efficacy under the conditions described in its labeling furthermore new data and information including information about product misuse or abuse at the user level may lead government agencies professional societies practice management groups or patient or trade organizations to recommend or publish guidance or guidelines related to the use of our products which may lead to reduced sales of our products the fda and the dea have important and complementary responsibilities with respect to our business the fda administers an application and postapproval monitoring process to confirm that products that are available in the market are safe effective and consistently of uniform high quality the dea administers registration drug allotment and accountability systems to satisfy against loss and diversion of controlled substances both agencies have trained investigators that routinely or for cause conduct inspections and both have authority to seek to enforce their statutory authority and regulations through administrative remedies as well as civil and criminal enforcement actions  table of contents the fda regulates and monitors the quality of drug clinical trials to provide human subject protection and to support marketing applications the fda may place a hold on a clinical trial and may cause a suspension or withdrawal of product approvals if regulatory standards are not maintained the fda also regulates the facilities processes and procedures used to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products in the us manufacturing facilities must be registered with the fda and all products made in such facilities must be manufactured in accordance with the latest cgmp regulations which are enforced by the fda compliance with clinical trial requirements and cgmp regulations requires the dedication of substantial resources and requires significant expenditures in the event an approved manufacturing facility for a particular drug is required by the fda to curtail or cease operations or otherwise becomes inoperable or a third party contract manufacturing facility faces manufacturing problems obtaining the required fda authorization to manufacture at the same or a different manufacturing site could result in production delays which could adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flow the fda is authorized to perform inspections of us and foreign facilities under the ffdca at the end of such an inspection fda could issue a form  notice of inspectional observations which could cause us to modify certain activities identified during the inspection following such inspections the fda may issue an untitled letter as an initial correspondence that cites violations that do not meet the threshold of regulatory significance of a warning letter fda guidelines also provide for the issuance of warning letters for violations of “regulatory significance” for which the failure to adequately and promptly achieve correction may be expected to result in an enforcement action fda also may issue warning letters and untitled letters in connection with events or circumstances unrelated to an fda inspection similar to other healthcare companies during  our facilities in multiple countries across the full range of our business units were subject to routine and newproduct related inspections by the fda mhra hpra and health canada some of these inspections resulted in noncritical inspection observations including fda form  observations we have responded to all inspection observations within the required time frame and have implemented or are continuing to implement the corrective action plans as agreed with the relevant regulatory agencies many of our core products contain controlled substances the stringent dea regulations on our use of controlled substances include restrictions on their use in research manufacture distribution and storage a breach of these regulations could result in imposition of civil penalties refusal to renew or action to revoke necessary registrations or other restrictions on operations involving controlled substances in addition failure to comply with applicable legal requirements subjects the manufacturing facilities of our subsidiaries and manufacturing partners to possible legal or regulatory action including shutdown any such shutdown may adversely affect their ability to supply us with product and thus our ability to market affected products this could have a negative impact on our business results of operations financial condition cash flows and competitive position see also the risk described under the caption “the dea limits the availability of the active ingredients used in many of our current products and products in development as well as the production of these products and as a result our procurement and production quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials” in addition we are subject to the federal drug supply chain security act dscsa the us government has enacted dscsa which requires development of an electronic pedigree to track and trace each prescription drug at the salable unit level through the distribution system which will be effective incrementally over a year period compliance with dscsa and future us federal or state electronic pedigree requirements may increase our operational expenses and impose significant administrative burdens we cannot determine what effect changes in regulations or legal interpretations or requirements by the fda or the courts when and if promulgated or issued may have on our business in the future changes could among other things require different labeling monitoring of patients interaction with physicians education programs for patients or physicians curtailment of necessary supplies or limitations on product distribution these changes or others required by the fda or dea could have an adverse effect on the sales of these products the evolving and complex nature of regulatory science and regulatory requirements the broad authority and discretion of the fda and the generally high level of regulatory oversight results in a continuing possibility that from time to time we will be adversely affected by regulatory actions despite our ongoing efforts and commitment to achieve and maintain full compliance with all regulatory requirements the success of our acquisition and licensing strategy is subject to uncertainty and any completed acquisitions or licenses may reduce our earnings be difficult to integrate not perform as expected or require us to obtain additional financing we regularly evaluate selective acquisitions and look to continue to enhance our product line by acquiring rights to additional products and compounds such acquisitions may be carried out through corporate acquisitions asset acquisitions licensing and joint venture arrangements or by acquiring other companies however we cannot confirm to you that we will be able to complete acquisitions that meet our target criteria on satisfactory terms if at all in particular we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates in addition any acquisition of assets and rights to products and compounds may fail to accomplish our strategic objective and may not perform as expected further if we are unable to maintain on commercially reasonable terms product compound or other licenses that we have acquired our ability to develop or commercially exploit our products may be inhibited in order to continue to develop and broaden our product range we must compete to acquire these assets our competitors may have greater resources than us and therefore be better able to complete acquisitions or may cause the ultimate price we pay for acquisitions to increase if we fail to achieve our acquisition goals our growth may be limited  table of contents in addition to the risks related to acquisition of assets and products acquisitions of companies may expose us to additional risks which are beyond our control and may have a material adverse effect on our profitability and cash flows the combination of two independent businesses is a complex costly and timeconsuming process as a result we may be required to devote significant management attention and resources to the integration of an acquired business into our practices and operations any integration process may be disruptive and if implemented ineffectively may restrict the realization of the full expected benefits in addition any acquisitions we make may result in material unanticipated problems expenses liabilities competitive responses and loss of customer relationships the difficulties of combining operations of companies include among others • diversion of management’s attention to integration matters • difficulties in achieving anticipated cost savings synergies business opportunities and growth prospects from the combination of the businesses • difficulties in the integration of operations and systems • difficulties in conforming standards controls procedures and accounting and other policies business cultures and compensation structures between the companies • difficulties in the assimilation of employees • difficulties in managing the expanded operations of a significantly larger and more complex company • challenges in retaining existing customers and obtaining new customers • potential unknown liabilities or larger liabilities than projected adverse consequences and unforeseen increased expenses associated with the merger and • difficulties in coordinating a geographically dispersed organization the benefits of a merger are also subject to a variety of other factors many of which are beyond our ability to control such as changes in the rate of economic growth in jurisdictions in which the combined company will do business the financial performance of the combined business in various jurisdictions currency exchange rate fluctuations and significant changes in trade monetary or fiscal policies including changes in interest rates and tax law of the jurisdictions in which the combined company will do business the impact of these factors individually and in the aggregate is difficult to predict in part because the occurrence of the events or circumstances described in such factors may be interrelated and the impact to the combined company of the occurrence of any one of these events or circumstances could be compounded or alternatively reduced offset or more than offset by the occurrence of one or more of the other events or circumstances described in such factors in addition based on current acquisition prices in the pharmaceutical industry acquisitions could decrease our net income per share and add significant intangible assets and related amortization or impairment charges our acquisition strategy may require us to obtain additional debt or equity financing resulting in leverage increased debt obligations as compared to equity or dilution of ownership we may not be able to finance acquisitions on terms satisfactory to us we may decide to sell assets which could adversely affect our prospects and opportunities for growth we may from time to time consider selling certain assets if i we determine that such assets are not critical to our strategy or ii we believe the opportunity to monetize the asset is attractive or for various other reasons including for the reduction of indebtedness we have explored and will continue to explore the sale of certain noncore assets although our expectation is to engage in asset sales only if they advance or otherwise support our overall strategy any such sale could reduce the size or scope of our business our market share in particular markets or our opportunities with respect to certain markets products or therapeutic categories as a result any such sale could have an adverse effect on our business prospects and opportunities for growth results of operations financial condition and cash flows our growth and development will depend on developing commercializing and marketing new products including both our own products and those developed with our collaboration partners if we do not do so successfully our growth and development will be impaired our future revenues and profitability will depend to a significant extent upon our ability to successfully commercialize new branded and generic pharmaceutical products protected by patent or statutory authority in a timely manner as a result we must continually develop test and manufacture new products which must meet regulatory standards to receive requisite marketing authorizations products we are currently developing may or may not receive the regulatory approvals or clearances necessary for us to market them furthermore the development and commercialization process is timeconsuming and costly and we cannot confirm to you that any of our products if and when developed and approved can be successfully commercialized in addition risks associated with developing commercializing and marketing new products are beyond our control for example some of our collaboration partners may decide to make substantial changes to a product’s formulation or design may experience financial difficulties or may have limited financial resources any of the foregoing may delay the development commercialization andor marketing of new products in addition if a codeveloper on a new product terminates our collaboration agreement or does not perform under the agreement we may experience delays and additional costs in developing and marketing that product  table of contents we conduct research and development of medical and technological products to enable us to manufacture and market pharmaceutical products in accordance with specific government regulations much of our drug development effort is focused on technically difficulttoformulate products andor products that require advanced manufacturing technology typically expenses related to research development and regulatory approval of compounds for our branded pharmaceutical products are significantly greater than those expenses associated with generic products as we continue to develop new products our research expenses will likely increase because of the inherent risk associated with research and development efforts in the healthcare industry particularly with respect to new drugs our research and development expenditures may not result in the successful regulatory approval and introduction of new pharmaceutical products also after we submit a regulatory application the relevant governmental health authority may require that we conduct additional studies including studies to assess the product’s interaction with alcohol as a result we may be unable to reasonably predict the total research and development costs to develop a particular product the availability of third party reimbursement for our products is uncertain and thus we may find it difficult to maintain current price levels additionally the market may not accept those products for which third party reimbursement is not adequately provided  our ability to commercialize our products depends in part on the extent to which reimbursement for the costs of these products is available from government healthcare programs such as medicaid and medicare private health insurers and others we cannot be certain that over time third party reimbursements for our products will be adequate for us to maintain price levels sufficient for realization of an appropriate return on our investment government payers private insurers and other third party payers are increasingly attempting to contain healthcare costs by  limiting both coverage and the level of reimbursement including adjusting copays for products approved for marketing by the fda  refusing in some cases to provide any coverage for uses of approved products for indications for which the fda has not granted marketing approval and  requiring or encouraging through more favorable reimbursement levels or otherwise the substitution of generic alternatives to branded products we may experience pricing pressure on the price of our products due to social or political pressure to lower the cost of drugs which would reduce our revenue and future profitability we may experience downward pricing pressure on the price of our products due to social or political pressure to lower the cost of drugs which would reduce our revenue and future profitability recent events have resulted in increased public and governmental scrutiny of the cost of drugs especially in connection with price increases following companies’ acquisition of the rights to certain drug products in particular us federal prosecutors have issued subpoenas to pharmaceutical companies seeking information about drug pricing practices in addition the us senate is publicly investigating a number of pharmaceutical companies relating to drugprice increases and pricing practices our revenue and future profitability could be negatively affected if these inquiries were to result in legislative or regulatory proposals that limit our ability to increase the prices of our products in addition in september  a group of us senators introduced legislation that would require pharmaceutical manufacturers to justify price increases of more than  in a month period and a large number of individual states have introduced legislation aimed at drug pricing regulation transparency or both our revenue and future profitability could be negatively affected by the passage of these laws or similar federal or state legislation pressure from social activist groups and future government regulations may also put downward pressure on the price of drugs which could result in downward pressure on the prices of our products in the future our business is highly dependent upon market perceptions of us our brands and the safety and quality of our products and may be adversely impacted by negative publicity or findings market perceptions of us are very important to our business especially market perceptions of our company and brands and the safety and quality of our products if we our partners and suppliers or our brands suffer from negative publicity or if any of our products or similar products which other companies distribute are subject to market withdrawal or recall or are proven to be or are claimed to be ineffective or harmful to consumers then this could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows for example the pharmaceutical drug supply has been increasingly challenged by the vulnerability of distribution channels to illegal counterfeiting and the presence of counterfeit products in a growing number of markets and over the internet third parties may illegally distribute and sell counterfeit versions of our products that do not meet the rigorous manufacturing and testing standards that our products undergo counterfeit products are frequently unsafe or ineffective and can be potentially lifethreatening counterfeit medicines may contain harmful substances the wrong dose of api or no api at all however to distributors and users counterfeit products may be visually indistinguishable from the authentic version  table of contents in addition negative posts or comments about us on any social networking web site could seriously damage our reputation the inappropriate use of certain social media vehicles could cause brand damage or information leakage or could lead to legal implications from the improper collection andor dissemination of personally identifiable information or the improper dissemination of material nonpublic information we are dependent on market perceptions and negative publicity associated with product quality patient illness or other adverse effects resulting from or perceived to be resulting from our products or our partners’ and suppliers’ manufacturing facilities could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows our reporting and payment obligations under the medicaid drug rebate program and other governmental drug pricing programs are complex and may involve subjective decisions any failure to comply with those obligations could subject us to penalties and sanctions we are subject to federal and state laws prohibiting the presentation or the causing to be presented of claims for payment by medicare medicaid or other thirdparty payers that are determined to be false or fraudulent including presenting a claim for an item or service that was not provided these false claims statutes include the federal civil false claims act which permits private persons to bring suit in the name of the government alleging false or fraudulent claims presented to or paid by the government or other violations of the statutes and to share in any amounts paid by the entity to the government in fines or settlement such suits known as qui tam actions have increased significantly in the healthcare industry in recent years these actions against pharmaceutical companies which do not require proof of a specific intent to defraud the government may result in payment of fines to andor administrative exclusion from the medicare medicaid andor other government healthcare programs we are subject to laws that require us to enter into a medicaid drug rebate agreement and a b pharmaceutical pricing agreement as a condition for having our products eligible for payment under medicare part b and medicaid we have entered into such agreements in addition we are required to report certain pricing information to the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms on a periodic basis to allow for accurate determination of rebates owed under the medicaid drug rebate agreement of ceiling prices under the b program and certain other government pricing arrangements and of reimbursement rates for certain drugs paid under medicare part b on february   cms issued a final rule implementing the medicaid drug rebate provisions incorporated into the ppaca effective april   in most instances implementation of the final rule required operational adjustments by us in order to maintain compliance with applicable law changes included in the final rule revised how manufacturers calculate average manufacturer price amp and best price and also affect the quarterly amounts that we owe to state medicaid programs through the medicaid drug rebate program also cms made changes with respect to how certain products are categorized for purposes of the medicaid drug rebate program ie single source innovator multiple source or noninnovator multiple source which could affect the rebate calculation methodology and thus the level of rebates incurred for affected products in addition cms finalized its proposal to change the reimbursement metrics upon which medicaid agencies are required to reimburse for covered outpatient drugs the new reimbursement structure could adversely affect providers’ reimbursement for our products and thus could adversely affect sales of our products the final rule also expanded the scope of the medicaid drug rebate program to apply to us territories effective april   which will require operational adjustments and may result in additional rebate liability finally cms withdrew its proposed definition of “line extension” set forth in the  proposed rule regarding the medicaid drug rebate program and opened a new day comment period soliciting views on how to interpret the relevant ppaca provisions additional operational adjustments and financial implications may result upon cms’ finalization of “line extension” provisions we and other pharmaceutical companies have been defendants in a number of lawsuits filed by various government entities alleging generally that we and numerous other pharmaceutical companies reported false pricing information in connection with certain drugs that are reimbursable by state medicaid programs which are partially funded by the federal government there is a risk the company will be subject to similar investigations or litigations in the future and that the company will suffer adverse decisions or verdicts of substantial amounts or that the company will enter into monetary settlements any unfavorable outcomes as a result of such future litigation could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows there is additional uncertainty surrounding the healthcare insurance coverage mandate that went into effect in the us in  and continued into  employers may seek to reduce costs by reducing or eliminating employer group healthcare plans or transferring a greater portion of healthcare costs to their employees job losses or other economic hardships may also result in reduced levels of coverage for some individuals potentially resulting in lower levels of healthcare coverage for themselves or their families these economic conditions may affect patients’ ability to afford healthcare as a result of increased copay or deductible obligations greater cost sensitivity to existing copay or deductible obligations lost healthcare insurance coverage or for other reasons we believe such conditions could lead to changes in patient behavior and spending patterns that negatively affect usage of certain of our products including some patients delaying treatment rationing prescription medications leaving prescriptions unfilled reducing the frequency of visits to healthcare facilities utilizing alternative therapies or foregoing healthcare insurance coverage such changes may result in reduced demand for our products which could materially and adversely affect the sales of our products our business and results of operations  table of contents our customer concentration may adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations we primarily sell our products to a limited number of wholesale drug distributors and large pharmacy chains in turn these wholesale drug distributors and large pharmacy chains supply products to pharmacies hospitals governmental agencies and physicians in addition this distribution network is continuing to undergo significant consolidation marked by mergers and acquisitions among wholesale drug distributors and large pharmacy chains we expect that consolidation of wholesale drug distributors and large pharmacy chains will increase pricing and other competitive pressures on pharmaceutical companies including us total revenues from customers who accounted for  or more of our total revenues during the three years ended december  are as follows          cardinal health inc           mckesson corporation           amerisourcebergen corporation           revenues from these customers are included within our us branded pharmaceuticals us generic pharmaceuticals and international pharmaceuticals segments if we were to lose the business of any of these customers or if any were to experience difficulty in paying us on a timely basis our total revenues profitability and cash flows could be materially and adversely affected we are currently dependent on outside manufacturers for the manufacture of a significant amount of our products therefore we have and will continue to have limited control of the manufacturing process and related costs certain of our manufacturers currently constitute the sole source of one or more of our products third party manufacturers currently manufacture a significant amount of our products pursuant to contractual arrangements certain of our manufacturers currently constitute the sole source of our products for example teikoku is our sole source of lidoderm ® and grünenthal gmbh grünenthal is our sole source for one of our formulations of opana ® er because of contractual restraints and the leadtime necessary to obtain fda approval and possibly dea registration of a new manufacturer replacement of any of these manufacturers may be expensive and time consuming and may cause interruptions in our supply of products to customers as a result any such delay could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows because many of our products are manufactured by third parties we have a limited ability to control the manufacturing process or costs related to the process increases in the prices we pay our manufacturers interruptions in our supply of products or lapses in quality could adversely impact our margins profitability and cash flows we are reliant on our third party manufacturers to maintain the facilities at which they manufacture our products in compliance with fda dea state and local regulations if they fail to maintain compliance with fda dea or other critical regulations they could be ordered to cease manufacturing or product may be recalled which would have a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows additionally if any facility that manufactures our products experiences a natural disaster we could experience a material adverse impact on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows in addition to fda and dea regulation violation of standards enforced by the environmental protection agency epa and the occupational safety and health administration osha and their counterpart agencies at the state level could slow down or curtail operations of third party manufacturers in addition we may consider entering into additional manufacturing arrangements with third party manufacturers in each case we will incur significant costs in obtaining the regulatory approvals and taking other necessary steps to begin commercial production by these manufacturers if the market for the products manufactured by these third parties substantially contracts or disappears we will continue to be financially obligated under these contracts such an obligation could have a material adverse effect on our business  table of contents we are dependent on third parties to supply all raw materials used in our products and to provide services for certain core aspects of our business any interruption or failure by these suppliers distributors and collaboration partners to meet their obligations pursuant to various agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows we rely on third parties to supply all raw materials used in our products in addition we rely on third party suppliers distributors and collaboration partners to provide services for certain core aspects of our business including manufacturing warehousing distribution customer service support medical affairs services clinical studies sales and other technical and financial services all third party suppliers and contractors are subject to fda and very often dea requirements our business and financial viability are dependent on the continued supply of goods and services by these third party suppliers the regulatory compliance of these third parties and on the strength validity and terms of our various contracts with these third party manufacturers distributors and collaboration partners any interruption or failure by our suppliers distributors and collaboration partners to meet their obligations pursuant to various agreements with us could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows in addition we have entered into minimum purchase requirement contracts with some of our third party raw material suppliers if the market for the products that utilize these raw materials substantially contracts or disappears we will continue to be financially obligated under these contracts and meeting such obligations could have a material adverse effect on our business we are dependent upon third parties to provide us with various estimates as a basis for our financial reporting while we undertake certain procedures to review the reasonableness of this information we cannot obtain absolute assurance over the accounting methods and controls over the information provided to us by third parties as a result we are at risk of them providing us with erroneous data which could have a material adverse impact on our business and or reporting if our manufacturing facilities are unable to manufacture our products or the manufacturing process is interrupted due to failure to comply with regulations or for other reasons it could have a material adverse impact on our business if any of our manufacturing facilities fail to comply with regulatory requirements or encounter other manufacturing difficulties it could adversely affect our ability to supply products all facilities and manufacturing processes used for the manufacture of pharmaceutical products are subject to inspection by regulatory agencies at any time and must be operated in conformity with cgmp and in the case of controlled substances dea regulations compliance with the fda’s cgmp and dea requirements applies to both drug products seeking regulatory approval and to approved drug products in complying with cgmp requirements pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities must continually expend significant time money and effort in production recordkeeping and quality assurance and control so that their products meet applicable specifications and other requirements for product safety efficacy and quality failure to comply with applicable legal requirements subjects our manufacturing facilities to possible legal or regulatory action including shutdown which may adversely affect our ability to supply the product were we not able to manufacture products at our manufacturing facilities because of regulatory business or any other reasons the manufacture and marketing of these products would be interrupted this could have a material adverse impact on our business results of operation financial condition cash flows and competitive position for example our horsham facility and the facilities of the manufacturer that we are in the process of qualifying as an alternate manufacturer for xiaflex ® such manufacturer the “proposed alternate manufacturer” and such facility the “proposed alternate facility” are subject to such regulatory requirements and oversight if we or the proposed alternate manufacturer fail to comply with cgmp requirements we may not be permitted to sell our products or may be limited in the jurisdictions in which we are permitted to sell them further if an inspection by regulatory authorities indicates that there are deficiencies including noncompliance with regulatory requirements we could be required to take remedial actions stop production or close our horsham facility or the proposed alternate facility which would disrupt the manufacturing processes limit the supplies of xiaflex ® and delay clinical trials and subsequent licensure andor limit the sale of commercial supplies in addition future noncompliance with any applicable regulatory requirements may result in refusal by regulatory authorities to allow use of xiaflex ® in clinical trials refusal of the government to allow distribution of xiaflex ® within the us or other jurisdictions criminal prosecution and fines recall or seizure of products total or partial suspension of production prohibitions or limitations on the commercial sale of products refusal to allow the entering into of federal and state supply contracts and followon civil litigation  table of contents the dea limits the availability of the active ingredients used in many of our current products and products in development as well as the production of these products and as a result our procurement and production quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or complete clinical trials  the dea regulates chemical compounds as schedule i ii iii iv or v substances with schedule i substances considered to present the highest risk of substance abuse and schedule v substances the lowest risk the active ingredients in some of our current products and products in development including oxycodone oxymorphone buprenorphine morphine fentanyl and hydrocodone are listed by the dea as schedule ii or iii substances under the controlled substances act of  consequently their manufacture shipment storage sale and use are subject to a high degree of regulation for example generally all schedule ii drug prescriptions must be signed by a physician physically presented to a pharmacist and may not be refilled without a new prescription furthermore the dea limits the availability of the active ingredients used in many of our current products and products in development and sets a quota on the production of these products we or our contract manufacturing organizations must annually apply to the dea for procurement and production quotas in order to obtain these substances and produce our products as a result our procurement and production quotas may not be sufficient to meet commercial demand or to complete clinical trials moreover the dea may adjust these quotas from time to time during the year any delay or refusal by the dea in establishing our quotas or modification of our quotas for controlled substances could delay or result in the stoppage of our clinical trials or product launches or could cause trade inventory disruptions for those products that have already been launched which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial position results of operations and cash flows if we are unable to retain our key personnel and continue to attract additional professional staff we may be unable to maintain or expand our business because of the specialized scientific nature of our business our ability to develop products and to compete with our current and future competitors will remain highly dependent in large part upon our ability to attract and retain qualified scientific technical and commercial personnel the loss of key scientific technical and commercial personnel or the failure to recruit additional key scientific technical and commercial personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business while we have consulting agreements with certain key individuals and institutions and have employment agreements with our key executives we cannot confirm to you that we will succeed in retaining personnel or their services under existing agreements there is intense competition for qualified personnel in the areas of our activities and we cannot confirm to you that we will be able to continue to attract and retain the qualified personnel necessary for the development of our business the trading prices of our securities may be volatile and your investment in our securities could decline in value the market prices for securities of pharmaceutical companies in general have been highly volatile and may continue to be highly volatile in the future for example in  our ordinary shares traded between  and  per share on the nasdaq the following factors in addition to other risk factors described in this section may cause the market value of our securities to fluctuate • fda approval or disapproval of any of the drug applications we have submitted • the success or failure of our clinical trials • new data or new analyses of older data that raises potential safety or effectiveness issues concerning our approved products • product recalls • competitors announcing technological innovations or new commercial products • introduction of generic substitutes for our products including the filing of andas with respect to generic versions of our branded products • developments concerning our or others’ proprietary rights including patents • competitors’ publicity regarding actual or potential products under development or other activities affecting our competitors or the industry in general • regulatory developments in the us and foreign countries or announcements relating to these matters • periodtoperiod fluctuations in our financial results • new legislation in the us relating to the development sale or pricing of pharmaceutical products or changes in interpretation of existing legislation relating thereto • a determination by a regulatory agency that we are engaging or have engaged in inappropriate sales or marketing activities including promoting the “offlabel” use of our products • social and political pressure to lower the cost of drugs • social and political scrutiny over increases in prices of shares of pharmaceutical companies that are perceived to be caused by a strategy of growth through acquisitions  table of contents • litigation and • changes in the political and regulatory environment and international relations as a result of events such as the exit of the united kingdom from the european union brexit and the new us administration and other external factors including market speculation or disasters and other crises our operations could be disrupted if our information systems fail if we are unsuccessful in implementing necessary upgrades or if we are subject to cyberattacks our business depends on the efficient and uninterrupted operation of our computer and communications systems and networks hardware and software systems and our other information technology we collect and maintain information which includes confidential and proprietary information as well as personal information regarding our customers and employees in digital form data maintained in digital form is subject to risk of cyberattacks which are increasing in frequency and sophistication cyberattacks could include the deployment of harmful malware viruses worms and other means to affect service reliability and threaten data confidentiality integrity and availability despite our efforts to monitor and safeguard our systems to prevent data compromise the possibility of a future data compromise cannot be eliminated entirely and risks associated with intrusion tampering and theft remain in addition we do not have insurance coverage with respect to system failures or cyberattacks if our systems were to fail or we are unable to successfully expand the capacity of these systems or we are unable to integrate new technologies into our existing systems our operations and financial results could suffer we also have outsourced significant elements of our operations to third parties some of which are outside the us including significant elements of our information technology infrastructure and as a result we are managing many independent vendor relationships with third parties who may or could have access to our confidential information the size and complexity of our information technology systems and those of our third party vendors with whom we contract make such systems potentially vulnerable to service interruptions the size and complexity of our and our vendors’ systems and the large amounts of confidential information that is present on them also makes them potentially vulnerable to security breaches from inadvertent or intentional actions by our employees partners or vendors or from attacks by malicious third parties the company and its vendors’ sophisticated information technology operations are spread across multiple sometimes inconsistent platforms which pose difficulties in maintaining data integrity across systems the everincreasing use and evolution of technology including cloudbased computing creates opportunities for the unintentional or improper dissemination or destruction of confidential information stored in the company’s systems foreign regulatory requirements vary including with respect to the regulatory approval process and failure to obtain regulatory approval or maintain compliance with requirements in foreign jurisdictions would prevent or impact the marketing of our products in those jurisdictions we have worldwide intellectual property rights to market many of our products and product candidates and intend to seek approval to market certain of our products outside of the us approval of a product by the regulatory authorities of foreign countries must be obtained prior to manufacturing or marketing that product in those countries the approval procedure varies among countries and can involve additional testing and the time required to obtain such approval may differ from that required to obtain fda approval the nonus regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with obtaining fda approval set forth herein approval by the fda does not secure approval by the regulatory authorities of any other country nor does the approval by foreign regulatory authorities in one country secure approval by regulatory authorities in other foreign countries or the fda outside of the us regulatory agencies generally evaluate and monitor the safety efficacy and quality of pharmaceutical products and devices and impose regulatory requirements applicable to manufacturing processes stability testing record keeping and quality standards among others these requirements vary across jurisdiction in certain countries including emerging and developing markets the applicable health care and drug regulatory regimes are continuing to evolve and new requirements may be implemented ensuring and maintaining compliance with these evolving requirements is and will continue to be difficult timeconsuming and costly if we fail to comply with these regulatory requirements or fail to obtain and maintain required approvals our target market will be reduced and our ability to generate revenue from abroad will be adversely affected our astora subsidiary could be adversely affected by special risks and requirements related to its previous business of manufacturing medical products our astora subsidiary is subject to various risks and requirements associated with it previously being a medical equipment manufacturer which could have adverse effects these include the following • potential and actual product liability claims for any defective or allegedly defective goods that are distributed and • increased government scrutiny andor potential claims regarding the marketing of medical devices  table of contents we are subject to health information privacy and data protection laws that include penalties for noncompliance we are subject to a number of privacy and data protection laws and regulations globally the legislative and regulatory landscape for privacy and data security continues to evolve there has been increased attention to privacy and data security issues in both developed and emerging markets with the potential to affect directly our business  this includes federal and state laws and regulations in the united states as well as in europe and other markets  there has also been increased enforcement activity in the united states particularly related to data security breaches a violation of these laws or regulations could subject us to penalties fines andor possible exclusion from medicare or medicaid such sanctions could materially and adversely affect our business results of operations financial condition and cash flows the expanding nature of our business in global markets exposes us to risks associated with adapting to emerging markets and taking advantage of growth opportunities the globalization of our business including in latin america south africa and canada may expose us to increased risks associated with conducting business in emerging markets any difficulties in adapting to emerging markets could impair our ability to take advantage of growth opportunities in these regions and a decline in the growth of emerging markets could negatively affect our business results of operations or financial condition the expansion of our activities in emerging markets may further expose us to more volatile economic conditions and political instability we also face competition from companies that are already well established in these markets our inability to adequately respond to the unique characteristics of these markets particularly with respect to their regulatory frameworks the difficulties in recruiting qualified personnel potential exchange controls weaker intellectual property protection higher crime levels and corruption and fraud could have a material adverse effect on our business our policies and procedures which are designed to help us our employees and agents comply with various laws and regulations regarding corrupt practices and antibribery cannot guarantee protection against liability for actions taken by businesses in which we invest failure to comply with domestic or international laws could result in various adverse consequences including possible delay in the approval or refusal to approve a product recalls seizures withdrawal of an approved product from the market or the imposition of criminal or civil sanctions including substantial monetary penalties in addition differences in banking systems and business cultures could have an adverse effect on the efficiency of internal controls over financial reporting matters given the significant learning curve to fully understand the emerging markets’ business operating environment and the quality of controls in place we may not be able to adequately assess the efficiency of internal controls over financial reporting or the effects of the laws and requirements of the local business jurisdictions many jurisdictions require specific permits or business licenses particularly if the business is considered foreign these requirements may affect our ability to carry out our business operations in emerging markets our international operations could expose us to various risks including risks related to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates in    of our total revenues were from sources outside the us some of these sales were to governmental entities and other organizations with extended payment terms a number of factors including differing economic conditions changes in political climate differing tax regimes changes in diplomatic and trade relationships and political or economic instability in the countries where we do business could affect payment terms and our ability to collect foreign receivables we have little influence over these factors and changes could have a material adverse impact on our business in particular the risk of a debt default by one or more european countries and related european or national financial restructuring efforts may cause volatility in the value of the euro in addition foreign sales are influenced by fluctuations in currency exchange rates primarily the canadian dollar euro south african rand mexican peso british pound and australian dollar we face risks relating to the expected exit of the united kingdom from the european union on june   the united kingdom held a remainorleave referendum on the united kingdom’s membership within the european union the result of which favored the brexit a process of negotiation will likely determine the future terms of the united kingdom’s relationship with the european union as well as whether the united kingdom will be able to continue to benefit from the european union’s free trade and similar agreements the timing of the brexit and potential impact of brexit on our market share sales profitability and results of operations is unclear depending on the terms of brexit economic conditions in the united kingdom the european union and global markets may be adversely affected by reduced growth and volatility the uncertainty before during and after the period of negotiation is also expected to have a negative economic impact and increase volatility in the markets particularly in the eurozone such volatility and negative economic impact could in turn adversely affect the company’s business results of operations financial condition and cash flows  table of contents the risks of selling and shipping products and of purchasing products across international borders may adversely impact our revenues results of operations and financial condition the sale and shipping of our products and services across international borders is subject to extensive us and foreign governmental trade regulations such as various antibribery laws including the us foreign corrupt practices act export control laws customs and import laws and antiboycott laws our failure to comply with applicable laws and regulations could result in significant criminal civil and administrative penalties including but not limited to imprisonment of individuals fines denial of export privileges seizure of shipments restrictions on certain business activities and exclusion or debarment from government contracting also the failure to comply with applicable legal and regulatory obligations could result in the disruption of our shipping and sales activities in addition some countries in which our subsidiaries sell products are to some degree subject to political economic andor social instability our nonus sales operations expose us and our representatives agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in nonus jurisdictions these risks include • the imposition of additional us and nonus governmental controls or regulations • the imposition of costly and lengthy new export licensing requirements • the imposition of us andor international sanctions against a country company person or entity with whom the company does business that would restrict or prohibit continued business with the sanctioned country company person or entity • economic and political instability or disruptions including local and regional instability or disruptions due to natural disasters such as severe weather and geological events disruptions due to civil unrest and hostilities rioting military activity terror attacks or armed hostilities • changes in duties and tariffs license obligations and other nontariff barriers to trade • the imposition of new trade restrictions • imposition of restrictions on the activities of foreign agents representatives and distributors • foreign tax authorities imposing significant fines penalties and additional taxes • pricing pressure that we may experience internationally • laws and business practices favoring local companies • difficulties in enforcing or defending intellectual property rights and • exposure to different legal and political standards due to our conducting business in several foreign countries we cannot provide assurance that one or more of these factors will not harm our business additionally we are experiencing fluidity in regulatory and pricing trends as a result of the ppaca and the health care and education reconciliation act of  any material decrease in our nonus sales would adversely impact our results of operations and financial condition we have substantial amount of indebtedness which could adversely affect our financial position and prevent us from fulfilling our obligations under such indebtedness which may require us to refinance all or part of our then outstanding indebtedness any refinancing of this substantial indebtedness could be at significantly higher interest rates despite our current level of indebtedness we may still be able to incur substantially more indebtedness this could increase the risks associated with our substantial indebtedness we currently have a substantial amount of indebtedness as of december    we have total debt of approximately  billion in aggregate principal amount our substantial indebtedness may • make it difficult for us to satisfy our financial obligations including making scheduled principal and interest payments on our indebtedness • limit our ability to borrow additional funds for working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general business purposes • limit our ability to use our cash flow or obtain additional financing for future working capital capital expenditures acquisitions or other general business purposes • expose us to the risk of rising interest rates with respect to the borrowings under our credit facility which are at variable rates of interest • require us to use a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations to make debt service payments • limit our flexibility to plan for or react to changes in our business and industry • place us at a competitive disadvantage compared to our less leveraged competitors and • increase our vulnerability to the impact of adverse economic and industry conditions  table of contents if we are unable to pay amounts due under our outstanding indebtedness or to fund other liquidity needs such as future capital expenditures we may be required to refinance all or part of our then existing indebtedness sell assets reduce or delay capital expenditures or seek to raise additional capital any of which could have a material adverse effect on our operations there can be no assurance that we will be able to accomplish any of these alternatives on terms acceptable to us or at all any refinancing of this substantial indebtedness could be at significantly higher interest rates which will depend on the conditions of the markets and our financial condition at such time in addition we and our subsidiaries may be able to incur substantial additional indebtedness in the future if new indebtedness is added to our current debt levels the related risks that we and our subsidiaries now face could intensify covenants in our debt agreements restrict our business in many ways a default of which may result in acceleration of certain of our indebtedness we are subject to various covenants in the instruments governing our debt that limit our ability andor our restricted subsidiaries’ ability to among other things • incur or assume liens or additional debt or provide guarantees in respect of obligations of other persons • issue redeemable stock and preferred stock • pay dividends or distributions or redeem or repurchase capital stock • prepay redeem or repurchase debt • make loans investments and capital expenditures • enter into agreements that restrict distributions from our subsidiaries • sell assets and capital stock of our subsidiaries • enter into certain transactions with affiliates and • consolidate or merge with or into or sell substantially all of our assets to another person a breach of any of these covenants could result in a default under our indebtedness if there were an event of default under any of the agreements relating to our outstanding indebtedness the holders of the defaulted debt could cause all amounts outstanding with respect to that debt to be due and payable immediately terminate all commitments to extend further credit enforce liens against the assets securing or otherwise supporting the debt and pursue other legal remedies the instruments governing our debt contain crossdefault or crossacceleration provisions that may cause all of the debt issued under such instruments to become immediately due and payable as a result of a default under an unrelated debt instrument an event of default or an acceleration under one debt agreement could cause a crossdefault or crossacceleration of other debt agreements we cannot confirm to you that our assets or cash flow would be sufficient to fully repay borrowings under our outstanding debt instruments if the obligations thereunder were accelerated upon an event of default we may need to conduct asset sales or elect to pursue other alternatives including proceedings under applicable insolvency laws relating to some or all of our business any or all of the above could have a material adverse effect on our business financing activities financial conditions and operations for a description of our indebtedness see note  debt in the consolidated financial statements  included in part iv item  of this report exhibits financial statement schedules  the irs may not agree with the conclusion that we should be treated as a nonus corporation for us federal income tax purposes following the paladin transaction although we are incorporated in ireland the us internal revenue service irs may assert that we should be treated as a us corporation and therefore a us tax resident for us federal income tax purposes pursuant to section  of the internal revenue code the code a corporation is generally considered a tax resident in the jurisdiction of its organization or incorporation for us federal income tax purposes because we are an irish incorporated entity we would generally be classified as a nonus corporation and therefore a nonus tax resident under these rules section  provides an exception pursuant to which a nonus incorporated entity may in certain circumstances be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes under section  we would be treated as a nonus corporation for us federal income tax purposes if the former shareholders of ehsi owned immediately after the paladin transaction within the meaning of section  less than  by both vote and value of endo shares by reason of holding shares in ehsi the ownership test the former ehsi shareholders owned less than  by both vote and value of the shares in endo after the paladin merger by reason of their ownership of shares in ehsi as a result under current law we are expected to be treated as a nonus corporation for us federal income tax purposes there is limited guidance regarding the application of section  of the code including with respect to the provisions regarding the application of the ownership test our obligation to complete the paladin transactions was conditional upon its receipt of a section  opinion from our counsel skadden arps slate meagher  flom llp skadden dated as of the closing date of the paladin transaction and subject to certain qualifications and limitations set forth therein to the effect that section  of the code and the regulations promulgated thereunder should not apply in such a manner so as to cause endo to be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes from and after the closing date however an opinion of tax counsel is not binding on the irs or a court therefore there can be no assurance that the irs will not take a position contrary to skadden’s section  opinion or that a court will not agree with the irs in the event of litigation  table of contents the effective rate of taxation upon our results of operations is dependent on multinational tax considerations we earn a portion of our income outside the united states that portion of our earnings is taxed at the more favorable rates applicable to the activities undertaken by our subsidiaries outside of the united states our effective income tax rate in the future could be adversely affected by a number of factors including changes in the mix of earnings in countries with differing statutory tax rates changes in the valuation of deferred tax assets and liabilities changes in tax laws the outcome of income tax audits and repatriation of earnings from our subsidiaries for which we have not provided for taxes cash repatriations are subject to restrictions in certain jurisdictions and may be subject to withholding and other taxes we are subject to the examination of our tax returns and tax arrangements by the irs and other tax and governmental authorities for example our transfer pricing has been the subject of irs audits and may be the subject of future audits by the irs or other tax authorities and we may be subject to tax assessments or the reallocation of income among our subsidiaries we regularly assess all of these matters to determine the adequacy of our tax provisions which are subject to significant discretion although we believe our tax provisions are adequate the final determination of tax audits and any related disputes could be materially different from our historical income tax provisions and accruals the results of audits and disputes could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements for the period or periods for which the applicable final determinations are made future changes to us and nonus tax laws could materially adversely affect us under current law we are expected to be treated as a nonus corporation for us federal income tax purposes however changes to the rules in section  of the code or regulations promulgated thereunder or other guidance issued by the treasury or the irs could adversely affect our status as a nonus corporation for us federal income tax purposes and any such changes could have prospective or retroactive application to us ehsi andor their respective shareholders and affiliates consequently there can be no assurance that there will not exist in the future a change in law that might cause us to be treated as a us corporation for us federal income tax purposes including with retroactive effect in addition recent us legislative proposals would expand the scope of us corporate tax residence and limit deductibility of interest andor other payments made by our us subsidiaries to nonus persons from which we currently benefit if such a change in law were enacted it could have a material adverse effect on our financial statements further the us congress the organization for economic cooperation and development the european commission and other government agencies in jurisdictions where we and our affiliates do business have had an extended focus on issues related to the taxation of multinational corporations and there are several current legislative proposals that if enacted would substantially change the taxation of multinational corporations one example is in the area of “base erosion and profit shifting” where payments are made between affiliates from a jurisdiction with high tax rates to a jurisdiction with lower tax rates as a result the tax laws in the jurisdictions in which we operate could change on a prospective or retroactive basis and any such changes could increase our effective tax rate materially adversely impacting our financial statements and cash flows from operations we may not be able to successfully maintain our low tax rates which could adversely affect our businesses and financial condition results of operations and growth prospects we are incorporated in ireland and also maintain subsidiaries in amongst other jurisdictions the united states canada mexico india bermuda the united kingdom luxembourg and south africa the irs and other taxing authorities may challenge intercompany arrangements responding to or defending such a challenge could be expensive consume time and other resources and divert management’s attention we cannot predict whether taxing authorities will conduct an audit challenging our tax positions the cost involved in responding to and defending any such audit and resulting litigation or the outcome if we are unsuccessful we may be required to pay taxes for prior periods interest fines or penalties and may be obligated to pay increased taxes in the future any of which could require us to reduce our operating expenses decrease efforts in support of our products or seek to raise additional funds all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial statements results of operations and growth prospects our ability to use us tax attributes to offset us taxable income may be limited existing and future tax laws and regulations may limit our ability to use us tax attributes including net operating losses to offset us taxable income for a period of time following the  paladin transaction section  precludes our us affiliates from utilizing us tax attributes to offset taxable income if we complete certain transactions with related nonus subsidiaries in addition the us treasury department recently issued new temporary and proposed regulations related to corporate inversions and earnings stripping the limitations on the use of certain tax attributes and deductions in these regulations are in addition to existing rules that could impose more restrictive limitations in the event that cumulative changes in our stock ownership within a threeyear period exceed certain thresholds such changes or the adoption of additional limitations could impact our overall utilization of deferred tax assets potentially resulting in a material adverse impact to our financial statements and cash flows from operations  table of contents any attempts to take us over will be subject to irish takeover rules and subject to review by the irish takeover panel we are subject to irish takeover rules under which our board of directors board of directors will not be permitted to take any action which might frustrate an offer for our ordinary shares once it has received an approach which may lead to an offer or has reason to believe an offer is imminent if pharmaceutical companies are successful in limiting the use of generics through their legislative regulatory and other efforts our sales of generic products may suffer many pharmaceutical companies increasingly have used state and federal legislative and regulatory means to delay generic competition these efforts have included • pursuing new patents for existing products which may be granted just before the expiration of earlier patents which could extend patent protection for additional years • using the citizen petition process eg under  cfr s  to request amendments to fda standards • attempting to use the legislative and regulatory process to have drugs reclassified or rescheduled or to set definitions of abuse deterrent formulations to protect brand company patents and profits and • engaging in statebystate initiatives to enact legislation that restricts the substitution of some generic drugs if pharmaceutical companies or other third parties are successful in limiting the use of generic products through these or other means our sales of generic products may decline if we experience a material decline in generic product sales our results of operations financial condition and cash flows will suffer we have limited experience in manufacturing biologic products and may encounter difficulties in our manufacturing processes which could materially adversely affect our results of operations or delay or disrupt manufacture of those of our products that are reliant upon our manufacturing operations the manufacture of biologic products requires significant expertise and capital investment although our subsidiary auxilium leased its facilities in horsham pennsylvania in order to have direct control over the manufacturing of the active ingredient of xiaflex ®  we have limited experience in manufacturing xiaflex ®  or any other biologic product biologics such as xiaflex ®  require processing steps that are highly complex and generally more difficult than those required for most chemical pharmaceuticals in addition testopel ®  is manufactured using a unique proprietary process if our manufacturing processes at the rye new york facility or horsham facility are disrupted it may be difficult to find alternate manufacturing sites we may encounter difficulties with the manufacture of the active ingredient of xiaflex ®  or testopel ®  which could delay disrupt or halt our manufacture of xiaflex ®  and testopel ®  respectively require writeoffs which may affect our financial results result in product recalls or product liability

financial statements  included in part iv item  of this report exhibits financial statement schedules  executive summary endo international plc is an irelanddomiciled global specialty pharmaceutical company focused on generic and branded pharmaceuticals we aim to be the premier partner to healthcare professionals and payment providers delivering an innovative suite of generic and branded drugs to meet patients’ needs this executive summary provides highlights from the results of operations that follow • total revenues in  increase d  to  million from   this revenue increase was primarily attributable to revenues related to our september  acquisition of par pharmaceutical holdings inc par the increase was partially offset by decreased revenues for certain products in our us branded pharmaceuticals segment driven mainly by decrease d voltaren ®  gel lidoderm ®  opana ® er and frova ® revenues related to generic competition and decreased revenues from our legacy us generic pharmaceuticals segment as a result of competitive pressure on commoditized generic products • gross margin for  decrease d to  from  in   this decrease was primarily attributable to the mix of revenue being more heavily weighted toward lower margin generic pharmaceutical product sales as compared to the higher margin branded products increased intangible asset amortization of  million for  and charges to increase excess inventory reserves • asset impairment charges in  increased to  million compared to  million in  driven primarily by goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges in our generics paladin litha and somar reporting units • during the year ended december    the company recognized an income tax benefit of  million on  million of loss from continuing operations before income tax  compared to  million of tax benefit on  million of loss from continuing operations before income tax during the comparable  period during the year ended december    the company completed a legal entity restructuring as part of its continuing integration of its business this resulted in the realization of a  million tax benefit arising from an outside basis difference that was reduced by a  million charge for the establishment of a valuation allowance on a portion of the company’s us deferred tax assets the tax benefit for the comparable  period was primarily related to losses from continued operations combined with benefits resulting from the expected realization of deferred tax assets for certain components of the company’s ams business arising from tax refunds relating to the carryback of net operating losses • loss from continuing operations for  increased to  million from  million for the year ended december    primarily attributable to the goodwill and intangible asset impairments noted above  table of contents critical accounting estimates to understand our financial statements it is important to understand our critical accounting estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us us gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of revenue recognition and sales deductions for estimated chargebacks rebates sales incentives and allowances certain royalties distribution service fees returns and allowances significant estimates and assumptions are also required when determining the fair value of financial instruments the valuation of longlived assets income taxes contingencies and stockbased compensation some of these judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results may differ from these estimates for any given individual estimate or assumption made by us there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable although we believe that our estimates and assumptions are reasonable they are based upon information available at the time the estimates and assumptions were made actual results may differ significantly from our estimates we consider an accounting estimate to be critical if  the accounting estimate requires us to make assumptions about matters that were highly uncertain at the time the accounting estimate was made and  changes in the estimate that are reasonably likely to occur from period to period or use of different estimates that we reasonably could have used in the current period would have a material impact on our financial condition results of operations or cash flows our most critical accounting estimates are described below revenue recognition pharmaceutical products our net pharmaceutical product sales consist of revenues from sales of our pharmaceutical products less estimates for chargebacks rebates sales incentives and allowances certain royalties distribution service fees returns and allowances as well as fees for services we recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss has passed to the customer which is typically upon delivery to the customer when estimated provisions for revenue reserves are reasonably determinable and when collectability is reasonably confirmed revenue from the launch of a new or significantly unique product may be deferred until such time that the product has achieved market acceptance for these products revenue is typically recognized based on dispensed prescription data and other information obtained prior to and during the period following launch decisions made by wholesaler customers and large retail chain customers regarding the levels of inventory they hold and thus the amount of product they purchase from us can materially affect the level of our sales in any particular period and thus may not correlate to the number of prescriptions written for our products based on external thirdparty data we believe that speculative buying of product particularly in anticipation of possible price increases has been the historical practice of many pharmaceutical wholesalers our wholesaler customers as well as others in the industry structure their arrangements where they charge a fee for their services accordingly we have entered into distribution service agreements dsas with certain of our significant wholesaler customers these agreements obligate the wholesalers to provide us with specific services including the provision of periodic retail demand information and current inventory levels for our branded products held at their warehouse locations additionally under these dsas the wholesalers have agreed to manage the variability of their purchases and inventory levels within specified limits based on product demand we received information from certain of our wholesaler customers about the quantities of inventory they held for our generic and branded products based on this information which we have not independently verified we believe that inventory related to our generic and branded products held at these wholesalers is within a reasonable range as compared to historical wholesaler held inventory amounts and to expected demand for each respective product market at december    we also estimated inventory quantities held at other wholesalers based on buying patterns and believe these levels are within reasonable ranges at december    in addition we evaluated market conditions for products primarily through the analysis of wholesaler and other third party sellthrough as well as internallygenerated information to assess factors that could impact expected product demand as of december    table of contents sales deductions when we recognize revenue from the sale of our products we simultaneously record an adjustment to revenue for estimated chargebacks rebates sales incentives and allowances certain royalties dsa fees returns and allowances these provisions as described in greater detail below are estimated based on historical experience estimated future trends estimated customer inventory levels current contract sales terms with our direct and indirect customers and other competitive factors if the assumptions we used to calculate these adjustments do not appropriately reflect future activity our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted the following table presents the activity and

balance december                     returns and allowances our provision for returns and allowances consists of our estimates of future product returns pricing adjustments and delivery errors consistent with industry practice we maintain a return policy that allows our customers to return product within a specified period of time both prior and subsequent to the product’s expiration date our return policy generally allows customers to receive credit for expired products within six months prior to expiration and within one year after expiration the primary factors we consider in estimating our potential product returns include • the shelf life or expiration date of each product • historical levels of expired product returns • external data with respect to inventory levels in the wholesale distribution channel • external data with respect to prescription demand for our products and • estimated returns liability to be processed by year of sale based on analysis of lot information related to actual historical returns in determining our estimates for returns and allowances we are required to make certain assumptions regarding the timing of the introduction of new products and the potential of these products to capture market share in addition we make certain assumptions with respect to the extent and pattern of decline associated with generic competition to make these assessments we utilize market data for similar products as analogs for our estimations we use our best judgment to formulate these assumptions based on past experience and information available to us at the time we continually reassess and make the appropriate changes to our estimates and assumptions as new information becomes available to us  table of contents our estimate for returns and allowances may be impacted by a number of factors but the principal factor relates to the level of inventory in the distribution channel when we are aware of an increase in the level of inventory of our products in the distribution channel we consider the reasons for the increase to determine if the increase may be temporary or otherthantemporary increases in inventory levels assessed as temporary will not result in an adjustment to our provision for returns and allowances otherthantemporary increases in inventory levels however may be an indication that future product returns could be higher than originally anticipated and accordingly we may need to adjust our estimate for returns and allowances some of the factors that may be an indication that an increase in inventory levels will be temporary include • recently implemented or announced price increases for our products and • new product launches or expanded indications for our existing products conversely factors that may be an indication that an increase in inventory levels will be otherthantemporary include • declining sales trends based on prescription demand • recent regulatory approvals to shorten the shelf life of our products which could result in a period of higher returns related to older product with the shorter shelf life • introduction of new product or generic competition • increasing price competition from generic competitors and • recent changes to the national drug codes ndcs of our products which could result in a period of higher returns related to product with the old ndc as our customers generally permit only one ndc per product for identification and tracking within their inventory systems rebates we establish contracts with wholesalers chain stores and indirect customers that provide for rebates sales incentives dsa fees and other allowances some customers receive rebates upon attaining established sales volumes we estimate rebates sales incentives and other allowances based upon the terms of the contracts with our customers historical experience estimated inventory levels of our customers and estimated future trends our rebate programs can generally be categorized into the following four types • direct rebates • indirect rebates • managed care rebates and • medicaid and medicare part d rebates direct rebates are generally rebates paid to direct purchasing customers based on a percentage applied to a direct customer’s purchases from us including dsa fees paid to wholesalers under our dsa’s as described above indirect rebates are rebates paid to indirect customers which have purchased our products from a wholesaler under a contract with us we are subject to rebates on sales made under governmental and managedcare pricing programs in estimating our provisions for these types of rebates we consider relevant statutes with respect to governmental pricing programs and contractual sales terms with managedcare providers and group purchasing organizations starting in  as a result of the implementation of certain provisions of the patient protection and affordable care act ppaca we are required to provide a  discount on our brandname drugs to patients who fall within the medicare part d coverage gap also referred to as the donut hole we estimate an accrual for managed care medicaid medicare part d and coverage gap rebates as a reduction of revenue at the time product sales are recorded these rebate reserves are estimated based upon the historical utilization levels historical payment experience historical relationship to revenues estimated future trends and include an estimate of outstanding claims for endcustomer sales that occurred but for which the related claim has not been billed and an estimate for future claims that will be made when inventory in the distribution channel is sold through to plan participants changes in the level of utilization of our products through private or public benefit plans and group purchasing organizations will affect the amount of rebates that we owe we participate in state governmentmanaged medicaid programs as well as certain other qualifying federal and state government programs whereby discounts and rebates are provided to participating government entities medicaid rebates are amounts owed based upon contractual agreements or legal requirements with public sector medicaid benefit providers after the final dispensing of the product by a pharmacy to a benefit plan participant medicaid reserves are based on expected payments which are driven by patient usage contract performance as well as field inventory that will be subject to a medicaid rebate medicaid rebates are typically billed up to  days after the product is shipped but can be as much as  days after the quarter in which the product is dispensed to the medicaid participant in addition to the estimates mentioned above our calculation also requires other estimates such as estimates of sales mix to determine which sales are subject to rebates and the amount of such rebates periodically we adjust the medicaid rebate provision based on actual claims paid due to the delay in billing adjustments to actual claims paid may incorporate revisions of this provision for several periods medicaid pricing programs involve particularly difficult interpretations of statutes and regulatory guidance which are complex and thus our estimates could differ from actual experience  table of contents we continually update these factors based on new contractual or statutory requirements and significant changes in sales trends that may impact the percentage of our products subject to rebates chargebacks the provision for chargebacks is one of the most significant estimates used in the recognition of our revenue we market and sell products directly to wholesalers distributors warehousing pharmacy chains and other direct purchasing groups we also market products indirectly to independent pharmacies nonwarehousing chains managed care organizations and group purchasing organizations collectively referred to as indirect customers we enter into agreements with some indirect customers to establish contract pricing for certain products these indirect customers then independently select a wholesaler from which to purchase the products at these contracted prices alternatively we may preauthorize wholesalers to offer specified contract pricing to other indirect customers including government entities under either arrangement we provide credit to the wholesaler for any difference between the contracted price with the indirect customer and the wholesaler’s invoice price such credit is called a chargeback the primary factors we consider in developing and evaluating our provision for chargebacks include • the average historical chargeback credits • estimated future sales trends and • an estimate of the inventory held by our wholesalers based on internal analysis of a wholesaler’s historical purchases and contract sales other sales deductions we offer certain of our customers prompt pay cash discounts provisions for prompt pay discounts are estimated and recorded at the time of sale we estimate provisions for cash discounts based on contractual sales terms with customers an analysis of unpaid invoices and historical payment experience estimated cash discounts have historically been predictable and less subjective due to the limited number of assumptions involved the consistency of historical experience and the fact that we generally settle these amounts within  to  days shelfstock adjustments are credits issued to our customers to reflect decreases in the selling prices of our products these credits are customary in the industry and are intended to reduce a customer’s inventory cost to better reflect current market prices the determination to grant a shelfstock credit to a customer following a price decrease is at our discretion rather than contractually required the primary factors we consider when deciding whether to record a reserve for a shelfstock adjustment include • the estimated number of competing products being launched as well as the expected launch date which we determine based on market intelligence • the estimated decline in the market price of our product which we determine based on historical experience and customer input and • the estimated levels of inventory held by our customers at the time of the anticipated decrease in market price which we determine based upon historical experience and customer input valuation of longlived assets longlived assets including property plant and equipment licenses developed technology trade names and patents are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable recoverability of assets that will continue to be used in our operations is measured by comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset in the event the carrying value of the asset exceeds its undiscounted future cash flows and the carrying value is not considered recoverable impairment may exist an impairment loss if any is measured as the excess of the asset’s carrying value over its fair value generally based on a discounted future cash flow method independent appraisals or preliminary offers from prospective buyers an impairment loss would be recognized in the consolidated statements of operations in the period that the impairment occurs as a result of the significance of our amortizable intangibles any recognized impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial position and results of operations during  we recorded intangible asset impairments of  million  these impairment charges were based on fair value estimates determined using discounted cash flow models the discounted cash flow models include assumptions related to product revenue growth rates and operating margin and are based on management’s annual and ongoing forecasting budgeting and planning processes and represent our best estimate of future product cash flows these estimates are subject to the economic environment in which our segments operate demand for our products and competitor actions the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease our estimated discounted future cash flows and the resulting estimated fair value of these intangible assets causing an increase or decrease in the respective intangible asset impairment charge the discount rates applied to these estimated cash flows ranged from  to    table of contents events giving rise to impairment are an inherent risk in the pharmaceutical industry and cannot be predicted factors that we consider in deciding when to perform an impairment review include significant underperformance of a product line in relation to expectations significant negative industry or economic trends and significant changes or planned changes in our use of the assets our reviews of longlived assets during the three years ended december   resulted in certain asset impairment charges which are described in note  goodwill and other intangibles in the consolidated financial statements  included in part iv item  of this report exhibits financial statement schedules  license rights  the cost of licenses are either expensed immediately or if capitalized are recorded at fair value and amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives ranging from  to  years with a weighted average useful life of approximately  years  we determine amortization periods for licenses based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired rights such factors include the expected launch date of the product the strength of the intellectual property protection of the product and various other competitive developmental and regulatory issues and contractual terms significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the useful life of the asset and an acceleration of related amortization expense which could cause our operating income net income and net income per share to decrease the value of these licenses is subject to continuing scientific medical and marketplace uncertainty trade names  acquired trade names are recorded at fair value upon acquisition and if deemed to have definite lives are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives of approximately  years  we determine amortization periods for trade names based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows from the acquired assets such factors include the strength of the trade name and our plans regarding the future use of the trade name significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the useful life of the asset and an acceleration of related amortization expense which could cause our operating income net income and net income per share to decrease developed technology  acquired developed technology is recorded at fair value upon acquisition and is amortized using the economic benefit model or the straightline method over the estimated useful life ranging from  to  years for our intangibles with a weighted average useful life of approximately  years  we determine amortization periods and method of amortization for developed technology based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and timing and extent of estimated cash flows of the acquired assets such factors include the strength of the intellectual property protection of the product and various other competitive and regulatory issues and contractual terms significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the useful life of the

sale the value of these assets is subject to continuing scientific medical and marketplace uncertainty goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets as of  december    and    goodwill and other intangibles comprised approximately   and   respectively of our total assets endo tests goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets for impairment annually or more frequently whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired our annual assessment is performed as of october  st  the goodwill test consists of a step i analysis that requires a comparison between the respective reporting unit’s fair value and carrying amount a step ii analysis would be required if the fair value of the reporting unit is lower than its carrying amount if the fair value of the reporting unit exceeds its carrying amount an impairment does not exist and no further analysis is required the indefinitelived intangible asset impairment test consists of a onestep analysis that compares the fair value of the intangible asset with its carrying amount if the carrying amount of an indefinitelived intangible asset exceeds its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess for the purpose of the october   annual goodwill impairment test the company had five operating segments and reporting units  branded  generics  paladin  litha and  somar the fair values of our reporting units are determined using an income approach that utilizes a discounted cash flow model or where appropriate a market approach or a combination thereof the discounted cash flow models are dependent upon our estimates of future cash flows and other factors our estimates of future cash flows involve assumptions concerning i future operating performance including future sales longterm growth rates operating margins variations in the amount and timing of cash flows and the probability of achieving the estimated cash flows and ii future economic conditions all which may differ from actual future cash flows these assumptions are based on significant inputs not observable in the market and thus represent level  measurements within the fair value hierarchy estimated future cash flows are discounted to present value using a market participant weighted average cost of capital the financial and credit market volatility directly impacts certain inputs and assumptions used to develop the weighted average cost of capital such as the riskfree interest rate industry beta debt interest rate and our market capital structure therefore changes in these assumptions may affect our fair value estimate and the result of the impairment test the discount rates applied to the estimated cash flows for our october   annual goodwill and indefinitelived intangible assets impairment test ranged from  to   depending on the overall risk associated with the particular assets and other market factors we believe the discount rates and other inputs and assumptions are consistent with those that a market participant would use  table of contents assumptions related to revenue growth rates and operating margin are based on management’s annual and ongoing forecasting budgeting and planning processes and represent our best estimate of the future results of operations across the company as of that point in time these estimates are subject to many assumptions such as the economic environment in which our segments operate demand for our products and competitor actions the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease our estimated discounted future cash flows and the resulting estimated fair value of our reporting units and could result in the fair value of a reporting unit being less than its carrying value in the first step of the impairment test in order to assess the reasonableness of the calculated fair values of our reporting units we also compare the sum of the reporting units’ fair values to endo’s market capitalization and calculate an implied control premium the excess sum of the reporting unit’s fair values over the market capitalization or an implied control discount the excess sum of total invested capital over the sum of the reporting unit’s fair values the company evaluates the implied control premium or discount by comparing it to control premiums or discounts of recent comparable market transactions as applicable if the control premium or discount is not reasonable in light of comparable recent transactions or recent movements in the company’s share price we reevaluate the fair value estimates of the reporting units by adjusting discount rates andor other assumptions this reevaluation could correlate to different implied fair values for certain or all of the company’s reporting units as a result of our annual goodwill test performed as of october  st   the company recorded pretax noncash impairment charges relating to our generics paladin litha and somar reporting units for an aggregate total of  million  for a complete description of goodwill impairment charges recorded for the years ended december   and  refer to note  goodwill and other intangibles in the consolidated financial statements  included in part iv item  of this report exhibits financial statement schedules  the generics reporting unit represented  million of the total goodwill charge a  basis point increase in the assumed discount rate utilized or a  decrease in the annual growth rate would have increased our generics reporting unit goodwill impairment charge by approximately  million and  million  respectively our annual goodwill test for the us branded reporting unit indicated the fair value exceeded its carrying value therefore an impairment charge was not required as of october  st   an increase of  basis points to our assumed discount rate used in testing this reporting unit would not have changed the results of our analysis in addition a  reduction of annual cash flows used in testing the us branded reporting unit would not have changed the results of our analysis changes to assumptions used to determine fair value including but not limited to projections of future cash flows and our weighted average cost of capital or significant declines in our stock price could result in additional noncash impairment charges to goodwill or other longlived assets which could be material as of december    our combined goodwill and intangible assets balance is approximately  billion  acquisitionrelated inprocess research and development acquired businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting which requires that the purchase price be allocated to the net assets acquired at their respective fair values any excess of the purchase price over the estimated fair values of the net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill amounts allocated to acquired inprocess research and development iprd are recorded to the balance sheet at the date of acquisition based on their relative fair values the judgments made in determining the estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities assumed as well as asset lives can materially impact our results of operations there are several methods that can be used to determine the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed for intangible assets including iprd we typically use the income method this method starts with our forecast of all of the expected future net cash flows these cash flows are then adjusted to present value by applying an appropriate discount rate that reflects the risk factors associated with the cash flow streams some of the more significant estimates and assumptions inherent in the income method or other methods include the amount and timing of projected future cash flows the amount and timing of projected costs to develop the iprd into commercially viable products the discount rate selected to measure the risks inherent in the future cash flows and the assessment of the asset’s life cycle and the competitive trends impacting the asset including consideration of any technical legal regulatory or economic barriers to entry as well as expected changes in standards of practice for indications addressed by the asset determining the useful life of an intangible asset also requires judgment as different types of intangible assets will have different useful lives acquired iprd is designated as an indefinitelived intangible asset until the associated research and development activities are completed or abandoned  table of contents income taxes our income tax expense deferred tax assets and liabilities and reserves for unrecognized tax benefits reflect our best assessment of estimated current and future taxes to be paid we are subject to income taxes in the united states and numerous other foreign jurisdictions significant judgments and estimates are required in determining the consolidated income tax expense for financial statement purposes deferred income taxes arise from temporary differences between the tax basis of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts in the financial statements that result in future taxable or deductible amounts in assessing the ability to realize deferred tax assets we consider future taxable income by tax jurisdiction and tax planning strategies we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to equal an amount that is more likely than not to be realized in projecting future taxable income we begin with historical results adjusted for the results of discontinued operations and incorporate assumptions about the amount of future earnings within a specific jurisdiction’s pretax operating income adjusted for material changes in business operations the assumptions about future taxable income require significant judgment and are consistent with the plans and estimates we are using to manage the underlying businesses future changes in tax laws and rates could also affect recorded deferred tax assets and liabilities the calculation of our tax liabilities often involves dealing with uncertainties in the application of complex tax laws and regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions across our global operations a benefit from an uncertain tax position may be recognized when it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained on the basis of the technical merits upon examination including resolutions of any related appeals or litigation processes we first record unrecognized tax benefits as liabilities and then adjust these liabilities when our judgment changes as a result of the evaluation of new information not previously available at the time of establishing the liability because of the complexity of some of these uncertainties the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from our current estimate of the unrecognized tax benefit liabilities these differences will be reflected as increases or decreases to income tax expense in the period in which new information is available we consider the earnings of the majority of our subsidiaries to be indefinitely invested within their country of incorporation on the basis of estimates that future cash generation will be sufficient to meet future cash needs and our specific plans for reinvestment of those subsidiary earnings should we decide to repatriate earnings we would need to adjust our income tax provision in the period we determined that the earnings will no longer be indefinitely invested outside the relevant tax jurisdiction contingencies the company is subject to various patent product liability government investigations and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business the factors we consider in developing our contingent accruals for product liability litigation and other contingent liability items include the merits and jurisdiction of the litigation the nature and the number of other similar current and past litigation cases the nature of the product and the current assessment of the science subject to the litigation and the likelihood of the conditions of settlement being met as of december    the company has accrued  million  of which  million relates to vaginal mesh cases for all known claims for which a liability is probable in addition to claims covered by msas we are currently aware of approximately  claims that have been filed asserted or that we believe are likely to be asserted that have not been accrued for because we lack sufficient information to determine whether any potential loss is probable in addition there may be other claims asserted in the future it is currently not possible to estimate the number or validity of any such claims although we believe there is a reasonable possibility that a loss in excess of the amount recognized exists we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount recognized at this time our vaginal mesh accrual is primarily based on master settlement agreements msas between ams and certain plaintiffs’ counsel representing meshrelated product liability claimants ams has agreed to settle up to approximately  filed and unfiled mesh claims handled or controlled by the participating counsel all msas are subject to a process that includes guidelines and procedures for administering the settlements and the release of funds in certain cases the msas provide for the creation of qualified settlement funds into which funds may be deposited pursuant to certain schedules set forth in those agreements all msas have participation thresholds regarding the claims represented by each law firm party to the msa if certain participation thresholds are not met then we will have the right to terminate the settlement with that law firm we expect that valid claims under the msas will continue to be settled however we intend to vigorously contest pending and future claims that are invalid for which settlement is unable to be reached or that are in excess of the maximum claim amounts under the applicable msas  table of contents in order to evaluate whether a claim is probable of a loss we must obtain and evaluate certain information pertaining to each individual claim including but not limited to the following items the name and social security number of the plaintiff evidence of an ams implant the date of implant the date the claim was first asserted to ams and medical records establishing the injury alleged without access to and review of at least this information we are not in a position to determine a claim’s validity or whether a loss is probable further the timing and extent to which we obtain this information and our evaluation thereof is often impacted by items outside of our control including without limitation the normal cadence of the litigation process and the provision of claim information to us by plaintiff’s counsel we will continue to monitor the situation and if appropriate we will make further adjustments to our product liability accrual based on new information we intend to continue exploring all options as appropriate in our best interests and depending on developments there is a possibility that we will suffer adverse decisions or verdicts of substantial amounts or that we will enter into additional monetary settlements any unfavorable outcomes as a result of such litigation or settlements with respect to any asserted or unasserted claims could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows during  the company sold the men’s health and prostate health business to boston scientific corporation and subsequently wound

accruals are recorded with a corresponding charge to litigationrelated and other contingencies net in the consolidated statements of operations when the company determines that a loss related to a

from continuing operations before income tax is equal to the combined results of each of its segments less these unallocated corporate costs we refer to adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax in making operating decisions because we believe it provides meaningful supplemental information regarding our operational performance for instance we believe that this measure facilitates its internal comparisons to our historical operating results and comparisons to competitors’ results we believe this measure is useful to investors in allowing for greater transparency related to supplemental information used in our financial and operational decisionmaking in addition we have historically reported similar financial measures to our investors and believe that the inclusion of comparative numbers provides consistency in our current financial reporting further we believe that adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax may be useful to investors as we are aware that certain of our significant shareholders utilize adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax to evaluate our financial performance finally adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax is utilized in the calculation of adjusted diluted income per share which is used by the compensation committee of endo’s board of directors in assessing the performance and compensation of substantially all of our employees including our executive officers there are limitations to using financial measures such as adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax  other companies in our industry may define adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax differently than we do as a result it may be difficult to use adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax or similarly named adjusted financial measures that other companies may use to compare the performance of those companies to our performance because of these limitations adjusted income from continuing operations before income tax is not intended to represent cash flow from operations as defined by us gaap and should not be used as alternatives to net income as indicators of operating performance or to cash flows as measures of liquidity we compensate for these limitations by providing reconciliations of our total segment adjusted income from

agreed to certain contingent payments in certain license collaboration and other agreements payments under these agreements generally become due and payable only upon the achievement of certain developmental regulatory commercial andor other milestones due to the fact that it is uncertain if and when these milestones will be achieved such contingencies have not been recorded in our consolidated balance sheets  in addition under certain arrangements we or our subsidiaries may have to make royalty payments based on a percentage of future sales of the products in the event regulatory approval for marketing is obtained from a business perspective we view these payments favorably as they signify that the products are moving successfully through the development phase toward commercialization acquisitions going forward our primary focus will be on organic growth however we may consider and as appropriate make acquisitions of other businesses products product rights or technologies our cash reserves and other liquid assets may be inadequate to consummate such acquisitions and it may be necessary for us to issue ordinary shares or raise substantial additional funds in the future to complete future transactions in addition as a result of any acquisition efforts we are likely to experience significant charges to earnings for merger and related expenses whether or not our efforts are successful that may include transaction costs closure costs or costs of restructuring activities legal proceedings we are subject to various patent product liability government investigations and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business accruals are recorded when we determine that a loss related to a litigation matter is both probable and

endo international plc notes to consolidated financial statements for the years ended december     and  note  description of business endo international plc is an irelanddomiciled global specialty pharmaceutical company focused on generic and branded pharmaceuticals we aim to be the premier partner to healthcare professionals and payment providers delivering an innovative suite of generic and branded drugs to meet patients’ needs unless otherwise indicated or required by the context references throughout to “endo” the “company” “we” “our” or “us” refer to financial information and transactions of endo international plc and its consolidated subsidiaries thereafter the accompanying consolidated financial statements of endo international plc and its subsidiaries have been prepared in accordance with united states us generally accepted accounting principles gaap note  summary of significant accounting policies consolidation and basis of presentation— the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of wholly owned subsidiaries after the elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions reclassifications— certain prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current period presentation the company has modified its presentation of accounts payable and accrued expenses that had been in effect prior to december   the company has combined amounts related to accounts payable and accrued expenses in its consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows  the company has applied this change retrospectively to all periods presented use of estimates— the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period significant estimates and assumptions are required in the determination of revenue recognition and sales deductions for estimated chargebacks rebates sales incentives and allowances certain royalties distribution service fees returns and allowances significant estimates and assumptions are also required when determining the fair value of certain financial instruments the valuation of longlived and indefinitelived intangible assets goodwill income taxes contingencies and sharebased compensation some of these judgments can be subjective and complex and consequently actual results may differ from these estimates our estimates often are based on complex judgments probabilities and assumptions that we believe to be reasonable but that are inherently uncertain and unpredictable for any given individual estimate or assumption made by us there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions using historical experience and other factors including the economic environment as future events and their effects cannot be determined with precision our estimates and assumptions may prove to be incomplete or inaccurate or unanticipated events and circumstances may occur that might cause us to change those estimates and assumptions market conditions such as illiquid credit markets volatile equity markets dramatic fluctuations in foreign currency rates and economic downturn can increase the uncertainty already inherent in our estimates and assumptions we adjust our estimates and assumptions when facts and circumstances indicate the need for change those changes generally will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements on a prospective basis it is possible that other professionals applying reasonable judgment to the same facts and circumstances could develop and support a range of alternative estimated amounts we also are subject to other risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ from estimated amounts such as changes in the healthcare environment competition litigation legislation and regulations customer product and supplier concentration— we primarily sell our generic and branded pharmaceuticals to wholesalers drug store chains supermarket chains mass merchandisers distributors mail order accounts hospitals and government agencies our wholesalers and distributors purchase products from us and in turn supply products to retail drug store chains independent pharmacies and managed health care organizations customers in the managed health care market include health maintenance organizations nursing homes hospitals clinics pharmacy benefit management companies and mail order customers total revenues from direct customers that accounted for  or more of our total consolidated revenues during the years ended december  are as follows          cardinal health inc           mckesson corporation           amerisourcebergen corporation           revenues from these customers are included within our us generic pharmaceuticals  us branded pharmaceuticals and international pharmaceuticals segments f table of contents no products accounted for  or more of our total revenues during the years ended december     or   we have agreements with novartis consumer health inc novartis ag sandoz inc collectively novartis teikoku seiyaku co ltd teikoku noramco inc noramco grünenthal gmbh grünenthal and jubilant hollisterstier laboratories llc jhs among others for the manufacture and supply of several of our existing pharmaceutical products see note  commitments and contingencies for further information revenue recognition— pharmaceutical products our net pharmaceutical product sales consist of revenues from sales of our pharmaceutical products less estimates for chargebacks rebates sales incentives and allowances certain royalties distribution service fees returns and allowances as well as fees for services we recognize revenue for product sales when title and risk of loss has passed to the customer which is typically upon delivery to the customer when estimated provisions for revenue reserves are reasonably determinable and when collectability is reasonably confirmed revenue from the launch of a new or significantly unique product may be deferred until such time that the product has achieved market acceptance for these products revenue is typically recognized based on dispensed prescription data and other information obtained prior to and during the period following launch sales deductions— when we recognize net sales from the sale of our pharmaceutical products we record an adjustment to revenue for estimated revenue reserves these provisions are estimated based on historical experience estimated future trends estimated customer inventory levels current contract sales terms with our direct and indirect customers and other competitive factors if the assumptions we used to calculate these adjustments do not appropriately reflect future activity our financial position results of operations and cash flows could be materially impacted research and development rd— expenditures for research and development are expensed as incurred in addition to upfront and milestone payments total rd expenses include the costs of discovery research preclinical development early and lateclinical development and drug formulation as well as clinical trials medical support of marketed products other payments under thirdparty collaborations and contracts and other costs rd spending also includes enterprisewide costs which support our overall rd infrastructure property plant and equipment that are acquired or constructed for research and development activities and that have alternate future uses are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives on a straightline basis upfront and milestone payments made to third parties in connection with agreements with third parties are generally expensed as incurred up to the point of regulatory approval payments made to third parties subsequent to regulatory approval are generally capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the related product amounts capitalized for such payments are included in other intangibles net in the consolidated balance sheets  cash and cash equivalents— the company considers all highly liquid money market instruments with an original maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents at december    cash equivalents were deposited in financial institutions and consisted of immediately available fund balances and time deposits the company maintains its cash deposits and cash equivalents with wellknown and stable financial institutions restricted cash and cash equivalents— cash and cash equivalents that are restricted as to withdrawal or use under the terms of certain contractual agreements are recorded in restricted cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets  at december    restricted cash and cash equivalents totaled  million  of which  million is held in qualified settlement funds qsfs for mesh product liability settlement agreements the restricted cash related to qsfs are for payments related to the company’s vaginal mesh liability see note  commitments and contingencies for further information relating to the vaginal mesh liability at december    restricted cash and cash equivalents totaled  million  of which  million was held in qsfs for mesh product liability settlement agreements marketable securities— the company has equity securities which consist of investments in the stock of publicly traded companies for additional information see note  fair value measurements  accounts receivable— accounts receivable are stated at their net realizable value the allowance for doubtful accounts against gross accounts receivable reflects the best estimate of probable losses inherent in the receivables portfolio determined on the basis of historical experience specific allowances for known troubled accounts and other currently available information in addition accounts receivable is reduced by certain sales deduction reserves where we have the right of offset with the customer concentrations of credit risk —financial instruments that potentially subject the company to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents marketable debt securities and accounts receivable we invest our excess cash in highquality liquid money market instruments and time deposits maintained by major us banks and financial institutions we have not experienced any losses on our cash equivalents we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and generally do not require collateral we have no history of significant losses from uncollectible accounts approximately  and  of our gross trade accounts receivable balance represent amounts due from three customers at december   and   respectively f table of contents we do not expect our current or future credit risk exposures to have a significant impact on our operations however there can be no assurance that our business will not experience any adverse impact from credit risk in the future inventories— inventories consist of finished goods held for distribution raw materials and workinprocess our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market cost is determined by the firstin firstout method we writedown inventories to net realizable value based on forecasted demand and market conditions which may differ from actual results inventory that is in excess of the amount expected to be sold within one year is classified as longterm inventory and is recorded in other assets in the  consolidated balance sheets  property plant and equipment— property plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation major improvements are capitalized while routine maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred costs incurred on assets under construction are capitalized as construction is in progress depreciation is computed over the estimated useful life of the related assets on a straightline basis leasehold improvements and capital lease assets are depreciated on a straightline basis over the shorter of their estimated useful lives or the terms of their respective leases depreciation is not recorded on assets held for sale gains and losses on disposals are included in other income expense net in the consolidated statements of operations  depreciation is based on the following estimated useful lives as of december      range of useful lives from buildings  years to  years machinery and equipment  years to  years leasehold improvements  years to  years computer equipment and software  years to  years assets under capital lease shorter of useful life or lease term furniture and fixtures  years to  years computer software— the company capitalizes certain costs incurred in connection with obtaining or developing internaluse software including external direct costs of material and services and payroll costs for employees directly involved with the software development capitalized software costs are included in property plant and equipment net in the consolidated balance sheets and amortized beginning when the software project is substantially complete and the asset is ready for its intended use costs incurred during the preliminary project stage and postimplementation stage as well as maintenance and training costs are expensed as incurred lease accounting— the company accounts for operating lease transactions by recording rent expense on a straightline basis over the expected life of the lease commencing on the date it gains possession of leased property the company includes tenant improvement allowances and rent holidays received from landlords and the effect of any rent escalation clauses as adjustments to straightline rent expense over the expected life of the lease capital lease transactions are reflected as a liability at the inception of the lease based on the present value of the minimum lease payments or if lower the fair value of the property assets under capital leases are recorded in property plant and equipment net in the consolidated balance sheets and depreciated in a manner similar to other property plant and equipment certain construction projects may be accounted for as direct financing arrangements whereby the company records over the construction period the full cost of the asset in property plant and equipment net in the consolidated balance sheets  a corresponding liability is also recorded net of leasehold improvements paid for by the company and is amortized over the expected lease term through monthly rental payments using an effective interest method assets recorded under direct financing arrangements are depreciated over the lease term license rights— the cost of licenses are either expensed immediately or if capitalized are recorded at cost less accumulated amortization and are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives ranging from  years to  years  with a weighted average useful life of approximately  years  we determine amortization periods for licenses based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows of the acquired rights such factors include the expected launch date of the product the strength of the intellectual property protection of the product and various other competitive developmental and regulatory issues and contractual terms significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the useful life of the asset and an acceleration of related amortization expense which could cause our operating income net income and net income per share to decrease f table of contents trade names— acquired trade names are recorded at fair value upon acquisition and if deemed to have definite lives are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives of approximately  years  we determine amortization periods for trade names based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and cash flows from the acquired assets such factors include the strength of the trade name and our plans regarding the future use of the trade name significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the useful life of the asset and an acceleration of related amortization expense which could cause our operating income net income and net income per share to decrease developed technology— acquired developed technology is recorded at fair value upon acquisition and is amortized using the economic benefit model or the straightline method over the estimated useful life ranging from  year to  years for our intangibles relating to continuing operations with a weighted average useful life of approximately  years  we determine amortization periods and method of amortization for developed technology based on our assessment of various factors impacting estimated useful lives and timing and extent of estimated cash flows of the acquired assets such factors include the strength of the intellectual property protection of the product and various other competitive and regulatory issues and contractual terms significant changes to any of these factors may result in a reduction in the useful life of the asset and an acceleration of related amortization expense which could cause our operating income net income and net income per share to decrease amortization expense is not recorded on assets held for sale the value of these assets is subject to continuing scientific medical and marketplace uncertainty longlived asset impairment testing —longlived assets which include property plant and equipment and definitelived intangible assets are assessed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable the impairment testing involves comparing the carrying amount of the asset to the forecasted undiscounted future cash flows generated by that asset in the event the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the undiscounted future cash flows generated by that asset and the carrying amount is not considered recoverable an impairment exists an impairment loss is measured as the excess of the asset’s carrying amount over its fair value an impairment loss is recognized in net income in the period that the impairment occurs inprocess research and development assets iprd— the fair value of iprd acquired in a business combination is determined based on the present value of each research project’s projected cash flows using an income approach future cash flows are predominately based on the net income forecast of each project consistent with historical pricing margins and expense levels of similar products revenues are estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors expected industry trends individual project life cycles and the life of each research project’s underlying patent in determining the fair value of each research project expected cash flows are adjusted for the technical and regulatory risk of completion iprd is initially capitalized and considered indefinitelived intangible assets subject to annual impairment reviews the reviews which occur annually or more frequently upon the occurrence of certain events requires the determination of the fair value of the respective intangible assets if the fair value of the intangible assets is less than its carrying amount an impairment loss is recognized for the difference for those assets that reach commercialization the assets are amortized over the expected useful lives goodwill— goodwill which represents the excess of purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is carried at cost goodwill is not amortized rather it is subject to a periodic assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test goodwill is assessed for impairment on an annual basis as of october st of each year or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired the impairment model requires a twostep method for determining goodwill impairment in the first step we determine the fair value of our reporting units using an appropriate valuation methodology if the net book value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value we would then perform the second step of the impairment test which requires allocation of the reporting unit’s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities using the acquisition method prescribed under authoritative guidance for business combinations any residual fair value is allocated to goodwill an impairment charge is recognized only when the implied fair value of our reporting unit’s goodwill is less than its carrying amount contingencies— the company is subject to various patent challenges product liability claims government investigations and other legal proceedings in the ordinary course of business legal fees and other expenses related to litigation are expensed as incurred and included in selling general and administrative expenses or discontinued operations net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations  contingent accruals and legal settlements are recorded with a corresponding charge to litigationrelated and other contingencies net or discontinued operations net of tax in the consolidated statements of operations when the company determines that a loss is both probable and reasonably estimable due to the fact that legal proceedings and other contingencies are inherently unpredictable our assessments involve significant judgment regarding future events the company records a receivable from its product liability insurance carriers only when the resolution of any dispute has been reached and realization of the potential claim for recovery is considered probable f table of contents contingent consideration —certain of the company’s business acquisitions involve the potential for future payment of consideration that is contingent upon the achievement of operational and commercial milestones and royalty payments on future product sales the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined at the acquisition date using unobservable inputs these inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows the probability of success achievement of the contingent event and the riskadjusted discount rate used to present value the probabilityweighted cash flows subsequent to the acquisition date at each reporting period the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes recorded in earnings changes in any of the inputs may result in a significantly different fair value adjustment share repurchases— the company accounts for the repurchase of ordinary shares at par value under applicable irish law ordinary shares repurchased are retired and not displayed separately as treasury stock upon retirement of the ordinary shares the company records the difference between the weighted average cost of such ordinary shares and the par value of the ordinary shares as an adjustment to accumulated deficit in the consolidated balance sheets  advertising costs— advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and amounted to  million   million and  million for the years ended december     and   respectively cost of revenues —cost of revenues includes all costs directly related to bringing both purchased and manufactured products to their final selling destination it includes purchasing and receiving costs direct and indirect costs to manufacture products including direct materials direct labor and direct overhead expenses necessary to acquire and convert purchased materials and supplies into finished goods cost of revenues also includes royalties paid or owed by endo on certain inlicensed products inspection costs depreciation amortization of intangible assets warehousing costs freight charges costs to operate our equipment and other shipping and handling activity sharebased compensation— sharebased compensation for employees and nonemployee directors is measured at the grant date based on the estimated fair value of the award and is recognized as an expense over the requisite service period sharebased compensation expense is reduced for estimated future forfeitures these estimates are revised in future periods if actual forfeitures differ from the estimates changes in forfeiture estimates impact compensation expense in the period in which the change in estimate occurs foreign currency translation— the companys operations utilize the us dollar usd or local currency as the functional currency where applicable the company identifies its separate and distinct foreign entities and groups the foreign entities into two categories  extension of the parent usd functional currency and  selfcontained local functional currency if a foreign entity does not align with either category factors are evaluated and a judgment is made to determine the functional currency for foreign entities where the usd is the functional currency all foreign currencydenominated asset and liability amounts are remeasured into usd at endofperiod exchange rates except for inventories prepaid expenses property plant and equipment goodwill and other intangible assets which are remeasured at historical rates foreign currency income and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during the year except for expenses related to balance sheet amounts remeasured at historical exchange rates exchange gains and losses arising from remeasurement of foreign currencydenominated monetary assets and liabilities are included in income in the period in which they occur for foreign entities where the local currency is the functional currency assets and liabilities denominated in local currencies are translated into usd at endofperiod exchange rates and the resultant translation adjustments are reported net of their related tax effects as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss in equity assets and liabilities denominated in other than the local currency are remeasured into the local currency prior to translation into usd and the resultant exchange gains or losses are included in income in the period in which they occur income and expenses are translated into usd at average exchange rates in effect during the period income taxes— the company accounts for income taxes under the asset and liability method which requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the financial statements under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the differences between the financial statements and tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date the company records net deferred tax assets to the extent it believes these assets will more likely than not be realized in making such a determination the company considers all available positive and negative evidence including projected future taxable income taxplanning strategies and results of recent operations in the event that the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of their net recorded amount the company would make an adjustment to the deferred tax asset valuation allowance which would reduce the provision for income tax f table of contents the company records uncertain tax positions in accordance with accounting standards codification asc topic  income taxes on the basis of a twostep process whereby the company first determines whether it is more likely than not that the tax positions will be sustained based on the technical merits of the position and then measures those tax positions that meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold the company recognizes the largest amount of tax benefit that is greater than  likely to be realized upon ultimate settlement with the tax authority the company recognizes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits within the income tax expense line in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  accrued interest and penalties are included within the related tax liability line in the consolidated balance sheets  comprehensive income— comprehensive income includes all changes in equity during a period except those that resulted from investments by or distributions to a company’s shareholders other comprehensive income or loss refers to revenues expenses gains and losses that are included in comprehensive income but excluded from net income as these amounts are recorded directly as an adjustment to shareholders’ equity recent accounting pronouncements in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu no   “revenue from contracts with customers” asu  asu  represents a comprehensive new revenue recognition model that requires a company to recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which a company expects to be entitled to receive in exchange for those goods or services this asu sets forth a new fivestep revenue recognition model which replaces the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety and is intended to eliminate numerous industryspecific pieces of revenue recognition guidance that have historically existed in august  the fasb issued asu no  “ revenue from contracts with customers topic  deferral of the effective date” which defers the effective date of asu  by one year but permits companies to adopt one year earlier if they choose ie the original effective date as such asu  will be effective for annual and interim reporting periods beginning after december   in march and april  the fasb issued asu no  “revenue from contracts with customers topic  principal versus agent consideration reporting revenue gross versus net” and asu no  “revenue from contracts with customers topic  identifying performance obligations and licensing” respectively  which clarifies the guidance on reporting revenue as a principal versus agent identifying performance obligations and accounting for intellectual property licenses in addition in may  the fasb issued asu no  “revenue from contracts with customers topic  narrowscope improvements and practical expedients” which amends certain narrow aspects of topic  and in december  the fasb issued asu no  “technical corrections and improvements to topic  revenue from contracts with customers” which amends certain narrow aspects of topic  the company will adopt the new revenue recognition standards on january   the company has established a crossfunctional implementation team consisting of representatives from across its business segments the company is currently in the process of performing a diagnostic assessment of the impact of the standard on its contract portfolio by reviewing the company’s current accounting policies and practices to identify potential differences that would result from applying the requirements of the new standard to its revenue contracts in addition during  the company plans to identify and implement if necessary appropriate changes to its business processes systems and controls to support recognition and disclosure under the new standard the implementation team intends to report the findings and progress of the project to the company’s management and the audit committee throughout the remainder of  the company is currently evaluating the impact of asu  on the company’s consolidated results of operations and financial position in addition the two permitted transition methods under the new standard are the full retrospective method in which case the standard would be applied to each prior reporting period presented and the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be recognized at the earliest period shown or the modified retrospective method in which case the cumulative effect of applying the standard would be

to perform procedures to determine the fair value at the impairment testing date of its assets and liabilities including unrecognized assets and liabilities following the procedure that would be required in determining the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination instead under asu  an entity should perform its annual or interim goodwill impairment test by comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount an entity should recognize an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount exceeds the reporting unit’s fair value however the loss recognized should not exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to that reporting unit additionally an entity should consider income tax effects from any tax deductible goodwill on the carrying amount of the reporting unit when measuring the goodwill impairment loss if applicable asu  is effective for annual or any interim goodwill impairment tests in fiscal years beginning after december   and an entity should apply the amendments of asu  on a prospective basis early adoption is permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment tests performed on testing

information is not reviewed or included within our internal management reporting therefore the company has not disclosed asset information for each reportable segment note  fair value measurements financial instruments the financial instruments recorded in our consolidated balance sheets include cash and cash equivalents including money market funds and time deposits restricted cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable marketable securities equity and cost method investments accounts payable and accrued expenses acquisitionrelated contingent consideration and debt obligations included in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash and cash equivalents are money market funds representing a type of mutual fund required by law to invest in lowrisk securities for example us government bonds us treasury bills and commercial paper money market funds pay dividends that generally reflect shortterm interest rates due to their shortterm maturity the carrying amounts of nonrestricted and restricted cash and cash equivalents including money market funds and time deposits accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate their fair values fair value guidance establishes a threetier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value these tiers include • level —quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities • level —inputs other than level  that are observable either directly or indirectly such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities quoted prices in markets that are not active or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities • level —unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity and that are significant to the fair value of the assets or liabilities marketable securities equity securities consist of investments in the stock of publicly traded companies the values of which are based on quoted market prices and thus represent level  measurements within the abovedefined fair value hierarchy these securities are not held to support current operations and are therefore classified as noncurrent assets equity securities are included in marketable securities in our consolidated balance sheets at december   and   at the time of purchase we classify our marketable securities as either availableforsale securities or trading securities depending on our intent at that time availableforsale and trading securities are carried at fair value with unrealized holding gains and losses recorded within other comprehensive income or net income respectively the company reviews unrealized losses associated with availableforsale securities to determine the classification as a “temporary” or “otherthantemporary” impairment a temporary impairment results in an unrealized loss being recorded in other comprehensive income an impairment that is viewed as otherthantemporary is recognized in net income the company considers various factors in determining the classification including the length of time and extent to which the fair value has been less than the company’s cost basis the financial condition and nearterm prospects of the issuer or investee and the company’s ability to hold the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in market value f table of contents loans receivable we did not have any loans receivable as of december   our loans receivable at december   related primarily to loans totaling  million to our joint venture investment owned through our litha subsidiary the joint venture investment is further described below the majority of this amount was secured by certain of the assets of our joint venture the fair values of these loans were based on anticipated cash flows which approximated the carrying amount and were classified in level  measurements in the fair value hierarchy the company classified these loans receivable as assets held for sale as of december   in its consolidated balance sheets  equity and cost method investments as of december    the company has investments that it accounts for using the equity or cost method of accounting totaling  million  the company divested a joint venture investment owned through its litha subsidiary during the three months ended march   the company classified this joint venture investment as assets held for sale as of december   in its consolidated balance sheets  during the three months ended june   the company recognized an otherthantemporary impairment of its litha joint venture investment totaling  million  reflecting the excess carrying value of this investment over its estimated fair value to estimate the fair value of this joint venture investment the company relied primarily on a market approach based on the terms of the announced divestiture of that investment with respect to its other equity or cost method investments which are included in other assets in the company’s consolidated balance sheets at december   and   the company did no t recognize any otherthantemporary impairments the company considered various factors including the operating results of its equity method investments and the lack of an unrealized loss position on its cost method investments acquisitionrelated contingent consideration the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities is determined using unobservable inputs hence these instruments represent level  measurements within the abovedefined fair value hierarchy these inputs include the estimated amount and timing of projected cash flows the probability of success achievement of the contingent event and the riskadjusted discount rate used to present value the probabilityweighted cash flows subsequent to the acquisition date at each reporting period the contingent consideration liability is remeasured at current fair value with changes recorded in earnings

collectively proceedings that arise from time to time in the ordinary course of our business including among others those relating to product liability intellectual property regulatory compliance and commercial matters while we cannot predict the outcome of these proceedings and we intend to defend vigorously our position an adverse outcome in any of these proceedings could have a material adverse effect on our current and future financial position results of operations and cash flows matters that are not being disclosed herein are in the opinion of our management immaterial both individually and in the aggregate with respect to our financial position results of operations and cash flows if and when such matters in the opinion of our management become material either individually or in the aggregate we will disclose such matters as of december    our reserve for loss contingencies totaled  million  of which  million relates to our product liability accrual for vaginal mesh cases although we believe there is a reasonable possibility that a loss in excess of the amount recognized exists we are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss in excess of the amount recognized at this time product liability we and certain of our subsidiaries have been named as defendants in numerous lawsuits in various us federal and state courts as well as in canada and other countries alleging personal injury resulting from the use of certain products of our subsidiaries these matters are described below in more detail we believe that certain settlements and judgments as well as legal defense costs relating to certain product liability matters are or may be covered in whole or in part under our product liability insurance policies with a number of insurance carriers in certain circumstances insurance carriers reserve their rights to contest or deny coverage we intend to contest vigorously any and all such disputes with our insurance carriers and to enforce our rights under the terms of our insurance policies accordingly we will record receivables with respect to amounts due under these policies only when the resolution of any dispute has been reached and realization of the potential claim for recovery is considered probable amounts recovered under our product liability insurance policies will likely be less than the stated coverage limits and may not be adequate to cover damages andor costs relating to claims in addition there is no guarantee that insurers will pay claims or that coverage will otherwise be available vaginal mesh cases in october  the fda issued a public health notification october  public health notification regarding potential complications associated with transvaginal placement of surgical mesh to treat pelvic organ prolapse pop and stress urinary incontinence sui the notification provided recommendations and encouraged physicians to seek specialized training in mesh procedures to advise their patients about the risks associated with these procedures and to be diligent in diagnosing and reporting complications in july  the fda issued an update to the october  public health notification regarding mesh to further advise the public and the medical community of the potential complications associated with transvaginal placement of surgical mesh to treat pop and sui in the july  update the fda stated that adverse events are not rare furthermore the fda questioned the relative effectiveness of transvaginal mesh as a treatment for pop as compared to nonmesh surgical repair the july  notification continued to encourage physicians to seek specialized training in mesh procedures to consider and to advise their patients about the risks associated with these procedures and to be diligent in diagnosing and reporting complications in january  the fda issued a statement reclassifying surgical mesh for transvaginal pop repair from class ii to class iii surgical mesh for sui repair remains a class ii device in january  the fda ordered manufacturers of transvaginal surgical mesh used for pop and of single incision minislings for urinary incontinence such as our ams subsidiary to conduct postmarket safety studies and to monitor adverse event rates relating to the use of these products the fda agreed to place  ams study orders on hold for a variety of reasons ams commenced three of these postmarket study orders however due to the winddown of the astora business in  ams notified the fda of its termination of these studies and the fda has confirmed closure of those studies since  we and certain of our subsidiaries including ams andor astora have been named as defendants in multiple lawsuits in the us in various state and federal courts including a multidistrict litigation mdl in the us district court for the southern district of west virginia mdl no  in canada where various class action and individual complaints are pending and in other countries alleging personal injury resulting from the use of transvaginal surgical mesh products designed to treat pop and sui plaintiffs in these suits allege various personal injuries including chronic pain incontinence and inability to control bowel function and permanent deformities and seek compensatory and punitive damages where available f table of contents we and certain plaintiffs’ counsel representing meshrelated product liability claimants have entered into various master settlement agreements msas and other settlement agreements regarding settling up to approximately  filed and unfiled mesh claims handled or controlled by the participating counsel for an aggregate total of approximately  billion  these msas which were executed at various times since june  were entered into solely by way of compromise and settlement and are not in any way an admission of liability or fault by us or any of our subsidiaries all msas are subject to a process that includes guidelines and procedures for administering the settlements and the release of funds in certain cases the msas provide for the creation of qsfs into which funds may be deposited pursuant to certain schedules set forth in those agreements all msas have participation thresholds regarding the claims represented by each law firm party to the msa if certain participation thresholds are not met then we will have the right to terminate the settlement with that law firm in addition one agreement gives us a unilateral right of approval regarding which claims may be eligible to participate under that settlement to the extent fewer claims than are authorized under an agreement participate the total settlement payment under that agreement will be reduced by an agreedupon amount for each such nonparticipating claim funds deposited in qsfs are included in restricted cash and cash equivalents in the consolidated balance sheets  distribution of funds to any individual claimant is conditioned upon the receipt of documentation substantiating the validity of the claim a full release and a dismissal of the entire action or claim as to all ams parties and affiliates prior to receiving funds an individual claimant is required to represent and warrant that liens assignment rights or other claims identified in the claims administration process have been or will be satisfied by the individual claimant confidentiality provisions apply to the amount of settlement awards to participating claimants the claims evaluation process and procedures used in conjunction with award distributions and the negotiations leading to the settlements we expect that valid claims under the msas will continue to be settled however we intend to vigorously contest pending and future claims that are invalid for which settlement is unable to be reached or that are in excess of the maximum claim amounts under the applicable msas in addition to claims covered by msas we are currently aware of approximately  claims that have been filed asserted or that we believe are likely to be asserted that have not been accrued for because we lack sufficient information to determine whether any potential loss is probable in addition there may be other claims asserted in the future it is currently not possible to estimate the number or validity of any such future claims in order to evaluate whether a claim is probable of a loss we must obtain and evaluate certain information pertaining to each individual claim including but not limited to the following items the name and social security number of the plaintiff evidence of an ams implant the date of implant the date the claim was first asserted to ams and medical records establishing the injury alleged without access to and review of at least this information and the opportunity to evaluate it we are not in a position to determine a claim’s validity or whether a loss is probable further the timing and extent to which we obtain this information and our evaluation thereof is often impacted by items outside of our control including without limitation the normal cadence of the litigation process and the provision of claim information to us by plaintiff’s counsel we will continue to monitor the situation and if appropriate we will make further adjustments to our product liability accrual based on new information we intend to continue exploring all options as appropriate in our best interests and depending on developments there is a possibility that we will suffer adverse decisions or verdicts of substantial amounts or that we will enter into additional monetary settlements any unfavorable outcomes as a result of such litigation or settlements with respect to any asserted or unasserted claims could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows as of the date of this report we believe that the current product liability accrual includes all known claims for which liability is probable the following table presents the changes in the vaginal mesh qsfs and product liability accrual balance during the year ended december   in thousands   qualified settlement funds   product liability accrual balance as of december         additional charges —    cash contributions to qualified settlement funds    — cash distributions to settle disputes from qualified settlement funds       cash distributions to settle disputes —     other    — balance as of december         the entire portion of the  million product liability accrual amount shown above is classified in the current portion of the legal settlement accrual in the december   consolidated balance sheets  charges related to vaginal mesh product liability for all periods presented are reported in discontinued operations net of tax in our consolidated statements of operations  f table of contents we expect to fund the payments under all current settlement agreements over the course of  as the funds are disbursed out of the qsfs from time to time the product liability accrual will be reduced accordingly with a corresponding reduction to restricted cash and cash equivalents in addition we may pay cash distributions to settle disputes separate from the qsfs which will also decrease the product liability accrual and decrease cash and cash equivalents we were contacted in october  regarding a civil investigation initiated by a number of state attorneys

options and stock awards of  million were excluded from the diluted share calculation because their effect would have been antidilutive the  convertible senior subordinated notes due april   were only included in the dilutive net loss per share calculations using the treasury stock method during periods in which the average market price of our ordinary shares was above the applicable conversion price of the convertible notes or  per share and the impact would not have been antidilutive in these periods under the treasury stock method we calculated the number of shares issuable under the terms of these notes based on the average market price of the shares during the period and included that number in the total diluted shares outstanding for the period we entered into convertible note hedge and warrant agreements which have subsequently been settled that in combination had the economic effect of reducing the dilutive impact of the convertible notes however we separately analyzed the impact of the convertible note hedge and the warrant agreements on diluted weighted average shares outstanding as a result the purchases of the convertible note hedges were excluded because their impact would have been antidilutive the treasury stock method was applied when the warrants were inthemoney with the proceeds from the exercise of the warrant used to repurchase shares based on the average share price in the calculation of diluted weighted average shares until the warrants were inthemoney they had no impact to the diluted weighted average share calculation f table of contents

management are covered under the private securities litigation reform act of  and canadian securities litigation act and are subject to the changes risks and uncertainties described in todays press

principles generally accepted in the united states and that may be different from nongaap financial measures used by other companies investors are encouraged to review endos current report on form k furnished with the sec for endos reasons for including those nongaap financial measures in todays earnings announcement the reconciliation of nongaap financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is contained in our earnings press release issued prior to todays call i would now like to turn the call over to paul paul v campanelli  endo international plc thank you steve good morning and thank you for joining us for todays call i presume that most of you have had an opportunity to review the companys earnings press release that we issued earlier this morning let me now turn to our fourth quarter  earnings presentation on slide two we begin with a brief agenda for todays call now before we commence with the review of endos fourth quarter performance i will first address the activity we have been engaged in since i assumed the role of ceo in late september as many of you know over the past few months endo has undertaken an overall assessment of our companys strategy in its asset and product portfolios through this assessment our management team developed a multiyear plan for our company this necessitated a realistic examination of endo our current industry environment and where we are headed over the next several years in conjunction with our annual goodwill and inprocess rd impairment testing we developed a revised companywide longterm forecast taking into consideration the realities of our current external environment the revised plan reflects a lower estimated fair value for certain reporting units and intangible assets this change in estimated fair value ultimately led to significant impairment charges being recorded during the fourth quarter blaise will address these charges in greater detail later on this mornings call while the impairment charges reflect an accounting valuation of assets acquired in the past our multiyear plan represents our forward looking strategy importantly weve already begun to execute on a number of our plans underlying initiatives and priorities in this regard moving to slide three we have defined three key priorities the first is to reshape our organization for success weve put in place a new executive leadership team that possesses a demonstrated track record of success we have centralized and streamlined endos global supply chain quality and compliance organization in order to create a more cohesive and efficient structure to support both our generics and branded businesses additionally we announced the restructuring of our corporate and branded pharmaceutical rd function importantly we named terry coughlin to be endos chief operating officer as a result we now have an operating leader with visibility into all of our business units which we believe will allow us to achieve greater efficiencies and to capitalize on synergistic opportunities between the businesses we also believe our new operating model will help enable a new endo culture focused on execution and accountability our second priority is to build our portfolio of capabilities for the future in doing so we identified assets in businesses that were no longer core to us and divested them or plan to in the near future as they no longer align with our goforward strategy weve divested noncore assets such as belbuca and restructured endos pain franchise to become a highly focused specialty branded business and today we announced the divestiture of the south african litha healthcare group we are investing where we can win and divesting noncore assets in this context we have also identified somar as noncore and well be conducting due diligence on divesting somar in order to focus on regulated markets in developed countries both litha and somar are good businesses with talented teams and we appreciate all the contributions they have made to our company however they are no longer a good strategic fit for endo and they are better placed with companies that can provide the attention and resources they deserve lastly our third priority is to drive margin expansion and delever we will look to drive margin improvements through a culture focused on smart product selection operational execution and continuous improvements in addition to driving margin improvement delevering is a priority and we do aspire to delever back into the three to four times range over time we are not going to put a specific timeframe on we expect to achieve this goal due to the number of uncertainties in the near term that could impact the timing of achieving it we are committed to taking a highly disciplined approach to capital allocation with the repayment of debt as a top priority after investing in our key growth driver through the actions we have already taken to date we are achieving cost savings that will ultimately result in lower operating expenses solid ebitda generation and a significantly improved ebitda margin percentage starting in  moving to slide  today it is endos intent to be a highly focused generics and specialty branded pharmaceutical company delivering high quality medicines to patients through excellence in development manufacturing and commercialization endo will focus on its core assets a generics business which is the fourth largest in the us based on sales with a growing sterile injectables unit and a promising pipeline of almost  andas and a revamped specialty branded business focused on our flagship product xiaflex as well as products like supprelin la testopel and aveed now moving to slide  well begin the review of our financial results driven by a strong fourth quarter performance endo placed at the high end of our guidance range for both revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share for the quarter and the year this performance was driven by our generics business which benefited from important product launches as well as the continued growth of our xiaflex franchise on slide  you will see a snapshot of our segment revenues for the fourth quarter owing to two significant product launches our us generic pharmaceutical unit represented about  of our companys revenue in the fourth quarter turning to slide  our generics business delivered a very strong performance in the quarter driven by the first to file launches of quetiapine er the generic version of seroquel xr in november and ezetimibe the generic equivalent of zetia in december the successful launches of ezetimibe and quetiapine achieved combined sales approaching  million for the quarter ezetimibe represented the largest product launch in pars history our sterile injectables business continues to grow led again by vasostrict in  vasostrict achieved sales just over  million and is endos largest selling product going forward sterile injectables will continue as one of pars areas of strategic focus we are developing an impressive roster of andas for sterile injection and infusion having filed five andas for sterile products just in the fourth quarter we also received approval for our mycophenolate injection anda and launched the product in november in new launches and alternative dosages the strong performance was driven by the two product launches we just reviewed alternative dosages specifically benefited from the increased sales of potassium chloride liquid and powder our base generics business declined approximately  compared to fourth quarter  and approximately  for the full year  compared to proforma  which is in line with the guidance we provided last november as weve discussed before the base business has been impacted by consortium pricing pressures an evolving consortium structure and additional competitive generic entrants in certain product categories the fourth quarter base business revenue increased sequentially from the third quarter of  the increase was due to the expected restocking in the quarter slide  finally as we said last month at the jpmorgan healthcare conference we expect our  base business revenue decline to be similar to what we experienced in  or in the low  range in  the underlying rate of base business price erosion is likely to be high singledigit when we exclude the impact of product discontinuances the fullyear impact of prior year competitive events and the impact of expected new competitive events in  with that said we expect our total generics segment to decline in the high single to low doubledigit percentage range in  due to what i just described partially offset by growth in our sterile injectables and new launch revenues respectively it is important to note that we expect modest growth in gross margin improvement versus prior year with margins in the high  range now moving to slide  you will see that in  par launched approximately  new products representing approximately  billion in market value according to ims health in addition we made  regulatory submissions including  andas we also successfully rationalized our generics product portfolio with approximately  products that provided no profit identified for discontinuance in addition we restructured our manufacturing network including the divestiture of our charlotte manufacturing facility as a result we are on track to realize approximately  million in annual net savings in  these savings are higher than previously communicated as weve been able to accelerate and increase the net savings expected to be realized through our restructuring effort these savings are contributing towards the expected yearoveryear improvement in our  adjusted gross margin on slide  we highlight our fullyear  product launch expectation we expect to file a similar number of andas as we did in  we also expect to launch at least  new products in  although none will be of the same magnitude of quetiapine and ezetimibe yeartodate we have already launched three products the  milligram and  milligram strains of dexmethylphenidate er capsules for which par was first to file itraconazole capsules and most recently are b nda ephedrine sulfate injection we also received news from the fda that we can now expect unapproved sources of adrenalin to vacate the market by the second half of the year in addition we continue to have  share of the potassium chloride liquid market and have been growing our potassium powder market share nicely including vasostrict our b strategy has yielded five products for par that are all significant contributors to our businesses on slide  well discuss our branded business revenues in our us branded pharmaceutical business declined  compared to fourth quarter  the decrease in sales was due primarily to the impact of generic erosion on endos pain and establish products portfolios as well as the divestiture of stendra brands impacted by continued generic erosion included voltaren gel lidoderm and frova specialty pharmaceuticals increase  in the fourth quarter versus prior year powered by strong performances from xiaflex and supprelin la sales of xiaflex our flagship branded product increased  compared to fourth quarter  driven primarily by doubledigit demand growth for the product particularly in peyronies disease meanwhile sales of another core specialty product supprelin la grew  driven in part by continued demand growth in  we expect our branded revenue to decline in the low to midteen percentage range yearoveryear based on the annualized erosion for the products previously discussed as well as the continued decline of the legacy pain portfolio partially offset by the growth of xiaflex and our other specialty brands we expect gross margins for the segment to remain in the high  range turning to slide  for the year xiaflex achieved us sales of  million a  increase from  on a pro forma basis we expect our  specialty business to grow in the high single digits driven primarily by expected high single to low doubledigit growth for xiaflex only a small portion of the diagnosed patient population for each of the xiaflex indications have actually been treated this represents a very promising opportunity to endo to increase awareness among patients and extend the products growth in each of its onmarket indications our q  branded specialty business performance demonstrates an initial proof point that endo can win in those strategic core areas that we focus upon and invest in appropriately as i briefly mentioned earlier belbuca has been returned to bdsi the pain opioid market has changed significantly and belbuca no longer aligns with endos us branded strategy and portfolio prioritization a portion of the cost savings from the restructuring of our pain business will be redeployed in  to support our core franchises including xiaflex supprelin la and other core branded franchises on slide  lets now discuss xiaflex further we are very excited about the prospects for xiaflex and recognize it to be a very valuable asset well focus our efforts and resources behind xiaflex and its approved indications and in pursuing an indication for cellulite following the announcement of positive phase b data last november endo is fully committed to obtaining the necessary aesthetics capabilities to be prepared to successfully launch and commercialize xiaflex for cellulite we are in fact preparing for success as part of the preparation we intend to maintain what i refer to as our optionality with regard to the cellulite opportunity and its potential commercialization we will examine and consider all options in our efforts to maximize the value of this opportunity and increase longterm shareholder value moving to slide  lets address international pharmaceuticals as part of our productbyproduct and businessbybusiness assessment we made the determination that litha healthcare group and somar are no longer aligned with the company strategy and do not represent a core areas of focus for endo accordingly we have entered into an agreement with the acino to divest litha and have started due diligent efforts for the potential sale of somar fourth quarter international revenues of  million declined  compared to prior year paladins fourth quarter performance actually exceeded our expectations due to delayed competition on certain products in the fourth quarter paladin began to promote xiaflex and nucynta in canada paladin also retains canadian market rights to serelaxin and looks forward to the results of phase  clinical trial later this year the decline in emerging market revenues from litha and somar were attributable in part to a decrease in litha revenue as a result of the divestiture of noncore asset in the first quarter of  somar revenues were impacted by lower demand for certain products in mexico and the unfavorable impact of foreign exchange in  we expect international revenues to decline in the mid to high  range reflecting the divestiture of litha as well as the competitive pressure discussed earlier for paladin and the impact of foreign exchange on somar with that let me turn the call over to blaise coleman to further discuss the financial performance of the company in the quarter and our  financial guidance blaise blaise coleman  endo international plc thank you paul and good morning everyone first on slide  youll see a snapshot of the fourth quarter gaap financial results paul covered company and segment revenues earlier so i will not review that here on a gaap basis we had a loss per share of  in the quarter versus diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of  in the fourth quarter of  gaap net loss from continuing operations in the fourth quarter of  was  billion compared to gaap net income from continuing operations of  million during the same period in  the  billion net loss resulted from  billion goodwill and intangible asset impairment charges recorded during fourth quarter  moving to slide  as paul mentioned during the fourth quarter the company conducted its annual goodwill and inprocess rd impairment tests and tested several other finite lived intangible assets that had triggering events during the quarter to test these assets for impairment the company utilized estimated future cash flows developed as part of our fourth quarter companywide forecasting process the companys revised forecast reflects a change in outlook primarily for its generics reporting unit reflecting the quickly evolving new realities of the us generics external environment as characterized by increased buying power from the continued consolidation of its customer base increased levels of competition due to the new lowcost competitors and accelerated fda anda approvals and a change in the value derived from estimated future pricing levels all these factors coupled with increases in the risk factor included in the discount rate used to calculate the discounted cash flows have driven a material decrease in the estimated fair value of our generics reporting unit and certain intangible assets this change in the estimated implied fair value led to the majority of the impairment charges recorded in fourth quarter in addition to the impairment charges related to our generics reporting unit we also had impairment charges related to our international pharmaceutical segment driven by a change in the expected future cash flows from those respective reporting units turning to slide  as paul mentioned on an adjusted basis both revenue and adjusted diluted earnings per share are at the high end of our guidance range for the quarter and the year to summarize the points paul made earlier revenue was strong due to the launches of ezetimibe and quetiapine extended release the continued growth of our sterile injectables business and doubledigit growth for xiaflex adjusted net income of  million and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations of  increased versus fourth quarter  due to higher revenues and lower operating expenses especially when viewed as a percent of sales moving to cash and liquidity on slide  in fourth quarter  cash flow from operations totaled approximately  million weve also highlighted some of the material items that impacted our cash flow from operations on a quarterly and annual basis on slide  you will see highlights of our full year  guidance we expect revenues to be approximately  billion to  billion a low doubledigit decline versus  reflective of the pressures in our generics branded and international businesses paul described earlier excluding the impact of divestitures and product discontinuations our forecasted total enterprise revenue decline would be high singledigit reported diluted gaap earnings per share from continuing operations are projected to be between  and  and we expect adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations to be between  and  more importantly we expect adjusted ebitda from continuing operations to be between  billion to  billion representing a significant increase in adjusted ebitda margin yearoveryear reflective of the impact from our ongoing margin enhancement initiatives the companys financial guidance is based on the following assumptions adjusted gross margins of approximately  to  adjusted operating expenses as a percentage of revenues to be approximately  to  adjusted interest expense of approximately  million to  million adjusted effective tax rate of approximately  to  and adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations assumes fullyear adjusted diluted shares outstanding of approximately  million shares additionally it is important to note that we expect our  cash tax rate to be in the low single digits as a percentage of adjusted pretax income our guidance assumes that the litha divestiture announced today closes in the second quarter of  from a pl phasing perspective we also expect approximately  of our total enterprise fullyear revenue to be realized in the first half of the year mainly due to the exclusivity period of quetiapine and ezetimibe we also expect our gross margin percentage in first quarter  to be broadly in line to slightly below fourth quarter  with meaningful improvement during the course of the year based on the favorable shifts in product mix and increased realization of net savings from our recently completed generics manufacturing and restructuring initiatives lastly we anticipate our first quarter  operating expenses to be largely in line with fourth quarter  due to the timing of certain expenses and as our recently announced corporate and rd restructuring initiatives begin to yield meaningful savings in the second quarter of this year finally on slide  we provide our  actual and  estimated cash flow prior to debt payment we generated approximately  million in cash flow prior to debt payment and repaid approximately  million in principal in  fourth quarter  cash flow prior to debt payment was higher than expected primarily due to a lower use of cash from changes in working capital and a favorable shift in timing of payments into the mesh qualified settlement funds as noted in our press release we ended the fourth quarter with approximately  million in unrestricted cash approximately  million in restricted cash and a net debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio of approximately  times as we look towards  we expect cash flow prior to debt payment in the range of approximately  million to  million and estimate ending net debt to adjusted ebitda leverage ratio to be in the high four times range with regards to funding endos existing mesh obligations as of september   approximately  million of the mesh liability accrual remained to be paid into qualified settlement funds in the fourth quarter endo paid approximately  million into the qualified settlement funds we expect to pay the remaining balance of approximately  million in  with the vast majority being paid in the first half of the year we did not increase our mesh product liability accrual during the fourth quarter and we believe that the current accrual includes all known claims for which liability is probable and estimatable more broadly we continue to execute our legal strategy of litigating claims that are invalid for which settlement is not able to be reached or that are in excess of the maximum claim amounts under our master settlement agreements i note that we recently received varying levels of information supporting an increase in our estimate from approximately  to  filed or asserted claims or claims that we believe are likely to be asserted we have not accrued for these claims because we lack sufficient information to determine if any potential loss is probable i point out that the possibility of additional claims has been disclosed by endo in multiple public filings and i reiterate today the potential of other claims to be filed or asserted in the future it is currently not possible however to estimate the number or validity of such claims and endo will not speculate in that regard or with respect to the overall outcome of the mesh litigation and its impact on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows this update will be included in our  form k and we will continue to update our disclosures as additional information becomes available now let me turn it back over to paul paul paul v campanelli  endo international plc thank you blaise moving to slide  i want to reiterate and close with our three key priorities our  financial guidance clearly reflects that endo is entering a period of transition from a company that grew through debtfueled ma to one that will primarily focus on organic growth in driving margin improvement through a new endo culture focused on operational execution it will take some time to successfully address the challenges that our company faces today and it will take time to reposition endo for longterm success we are ready and we have already begun to meet these challenges and are very excited about our future we have a management team with a track record of success we have the people products and pipeline in place that we believe will enable us in time to achieve success and create value for our shareholders there are several reasons why i believe endo represents an attractive opportunity for longterm investors first we reshaped the organization and have a new executionfocused culture built for sustainability in the future and finally we have and will maintain a highly disciplined approach to capital allocation with a commitment to delever over time that has the potential to create value for equity holders i remain excited and enthusiastic about the opportunity to be leading the new endo i want to thank all of our employees for their hard work dedication and commitment to the company this has not been an easy period for them and i am proud of how theyve fully embraced the new endo culture and priorities we continue to believe that this is a time of significant opportunity for endo our employees the patients we serve and our shareholders that concludes our prepared remarks let me now turn the call back over the steve to manage our questionandanswer period steve stephen j mock  endo international plc thank you paul wed like now to open the lines to your questions in the interest of time if you could limit your initial questions to allow us to get in as many as possible within the hour we would appreciate it christy may we have the first question questionandanswer session operator thank you our first question is from the line of louise chen of guggenheim your line is open louise chen  guggenheim securities llc hi thanks for taking my questions here so first question i had here was how we think about sales growth longer term just curious given the fact that youve got some exclusive launches in  and then also vasostrict is a very big product for you how do we think about growth in  and beyond and any risk to those sales going forward and then the second question i had was on litha and somar can you confirm whether or not those have been removed from the  guidance thanks paul v campanelli  endo international plc okay so blaise will start with those blaise coleman  endo international plc yeah so louise on your second question somar is included in the guidance litha is included for essentially the first quarter and then weve removed it paul v campanelli  endo international plc and louise in terms of how we look at the business on a goforward basis unfortunately at this time were not going to be able to guide beyond where we are in  we have a series of uncertainties that we in essence weve got to get through and when you look at  with the launches of ezetimibe and quetiapine those are going to be tough comparators as we kind of look out into  so with that were just going to have to ask for some patience here and were just focused on  at this point in time louise chen  guggenheim securities llc okay thank you operator thank you our next question is from david amsellem of piper jaffray your line is open david a amsellem  piper jaffray  co thanks wanted to get your thoughts paul on the upcoming panel on opana er what you make of it what ultimately do you think is the end game for the fda and really your level of concern or how should we be concerned about a potential that the product is removed from the market thanks paul v campanelli  endo international plc yeah so david i think right now as you know theres an adcom on march  and  it is in fact a joint meeting to discuss the risk and benefit of all oxymorphone products so its not just opana er it includes any generic forms of oxymorphone as well as you can imagine endos always going to be focused on patient safety thats a top priority and were committed really to provide patients – to have a commitment to provide patients with safe and efficacious products for their intended use so right now the adcom is focused on riskbenefit from abuse so its a little bit difficult for us to opine in terms of what the end game is with the fda i think at this point in time what we can say is that our studies to date support the safety and efficacy for the intended use of opana well know on march  and  what the potential outcome is so really at this point in time were prepared to discuss all aspects of our trials but were in a waitandsee game until march  and  david a amsellem  piper jaffray  co okay thanks operator thank you our next question is from elliot wilbur of raymond james your line is open elliot wilbur  raymond james  associates inc thanks good morning just two questions on the generic business overall first paul in your deck i think its slide eight the waterfall chart you talk about  price erosion sort of a high singledigit impact and basically what im looking for is commentary on the actual rate of price erosion exiting  and then what you have embedded in  in terms of just the pure price erosion metric obviously we talked before base business down  yearoveryear and then just sort of your earlier commentary that it will be down  obviously theres a fairly big volume impact included in that as well just trying to get a sense of what the actual price erosion on the portfolio may be and then secondly with respect to new product launch expectations i think you talked about approximately  launches how many of those do you actually have a relatively high degree of visibility on in terms of either specific datecertain patent expiration or a settlement obviously the fda hasnt been doing paul v campanelli  endo international plc okay elliot wilbur  raymond james  associates inc favors for any companies in terms of specialties generics just want to get a sense of the degree of confidence we can have around that level of launches thanks paul v campanelli  endo international plc so elliot what ill do is ill give you some visibility really on the new product launches and blaise will give you a little bit more color on the base erosion which has about four components of the composition here so moving back to like new product launches as we say – im going to go through this pretty slowly so theres no confusion when we look at new product launches for  we say we have about  products i would tell that we have a fairly high degree of confidence that those are all products that we will be able to deliver on now theres always some degrees of uncertainty but in this case when we talk about the  products i have pretty good certitude that were going to execute and weve already launched a series of products up to this point when we look at – maybe ill put a little color on the value i think thats probably important when we look at these  new products the value that we should be looking at is about  million dollars of true pure new product launches from a revenue standpoint so we want to get that out there but i think its also important to talk maybe just a little bit of the carryover for our zetia and quetiapine because theyre so big contributors to what were doing so when you look at those two products theres going to be a carryover value of about  million of those two products so youve got  million of new product launches true pure new product launches about  million of carryover products that are zetia and quetiapine and then you should look at about another  million dollars of carryover  products into  that are excluding zetia and quetiapine so that should give you full color on how were looking at  now ill turn it over to blaise to give you some color on base erosion blaise coleman  endo international plc yeah elliot so just to pick up on your questions when we think about  in terms of from a price volume standpoint overall we had about  price erosion in that  theres two components of that theres a normal course sort of price erosion and theres price erosion due to new competitor events and so for a normal course it was sort of in the midsingle digits and then the delta was due to competitor events when we show it now for  on the slide there you see that  price erosion thats very much our normal course price erosion and included in that is obviously our expectations around some additional pressure from the consortiums through the course of the year theres another element thats embedded in the other blocks in terms of the competitor events that also has a price element to it and again that – so from a total price erosion standpoint yearoveryear when you take the normal course and then the impact from competitor events we would also have that in sort of that low doubledigit midteen range elliot wilbur  raymond james  associates inc okay operator thank you our next question is from marc goodman of ubs your line  marc goodman  ubs securities llc so paul once we get rid of the international business okay we understand thats happening and then should we assume that youre done taking a look at the branded products and that what we see today is what were going to keep thats really the first question second is can you just give us a flavor for generic gross margins in the quarter and then third that was a great explanation for the previous answer is there any way you could tease out just how much the consortiums is adding to the pricing pressure is it an extra  in the year  is there any way you could do that paul just for us to understand thanks blaise coleman  endo international plc high level marc wed say the consortium pricing pressures probably adding about  to  about about yeah thatd be generally and then marc maybe ill just handle your gross margin question so our generics gross margin for the segment in fourth quarter  was around  marc goodman  ubs securities llc yeah paul v campanelli  endo international plc and then marc in terms of the big question really in terms of how were looking at our businesses i think weve proven and weve shown that weve taken a lot of action here over the last four or five months here with decisions that weve made on the portfolio on facilities and belbuca amongst many other things and really doing this with a new leadership team thats been in place for really probably three or four months as we take a step back and look at our total businesses your question was specifically on the branded side i think how were looking at it is we are considering optionality across really the entire business ultimately well need to do whats right for endo we are prepared for success both on the generic side and the branded side so we are putting resources into rd both from pure generic play and obviously were preparing for success in xiaflex but we also have to keep our optionality open if we can place endo in a better position down the line we would just have to always consider that and i think you would expect that from us as normal course so thats pretty much where we are we want to keep our options open marc goodman  ubs securities llc thanks paul v campanelli  endo international plc okay thank you operator thank you our next question is from randall stanicky of rbc capital markets your line is open randall s stanicky  rbc capital markets llc great thanks paul i just have a couple of quick followups if the q generic gross margin was  i think youd pointed to high  for  whats driving that and how does some of this base business erosion factor into that i guess that increase in margin outlook if that is correct and then secondly do we have timing around mckesson walmart the bid cycle there can you just provide some comments on expectations and then i have one really quick followup after that paul v campanelli  endo international plc okay so i would say the gross margins thats driving up into the mids now blaise i would point to the bs i think part of that as you look at the sterile injectables unit the margins there are very healthy weve had success with the potassium liquids and powder product adrenaline is another product that weve had great success with so those are for the most part the drivers of positive gross margin blaise coleman  endo international plc the other thing i would add paul is randall as we mentioned in the slides well see about  million of savings related to the generic restructuring thats an incremental  million of savings from what we had in  so thats also contributing heavily to the gross margin favorability so both the product mix that paul talked about as well as the cost savings initiatives that we have been driving paul v campanelli  endo international plc yeah and then in terms of the claris one impact right now i would tell you its a little hard to totally pinpoint the implementation of claris one but i would probably – my instinct is telling me somewhere around q maybe q randall s stanicky  rbc capital markets llc and thats built into the  to  impact that you talked about from consortium pressure paul v campanelli  endo international plc yes when we talk about base erosion similar in  as  we are including the impact of claris one randall s stanicky  rbc capital markets llc okay great and then just one clarification so we talked about on the mesh side  cases last year earlier in year can you just update us what is that outstanding number now in terms of total outstanding mesh cases and whats the trend been in terms of settlement just so that we can try to get some better visibility or a handle around where and what really when thats going to resolve paul v campanelli  endo international plc okay so so im going to pass it over to blaise but youre referring to the  claims that weve increased to  randall s stanicky  rbc capital markets llc yeah maybe blaise we can talk a little bit about it blaise coleman  endo international plc yeah so randall the  of the nonnsa claims that weve been filed asserted or that we believe are likely to be asserted that we havent accrued for because we cant assess probability of loss at this time and theres a number of reasons why that can increase some of those and many of those are outside of our control it has to do with a number of factors including the receipt of new information and some of that comes in as the end of the tolling agreements are lifted which really causes the statute of limitations to begin running and requires claimants to file in order to avoid dismissal theres also the additional advertising by plaintiff attorneys as well as other factors so all of those things are contributing to us receiving new information thats really leading to the increase to the  randall s stanicky  rbc capital markets llc okay i mean you dont expect that to – is that  kind of where you expect that to max out at or are we still seeing claims coming in blaise coleman  endo international plc yeah i mean randall at this time we dont have any way to predict that randall s stanicky  rbc capital markets llc okay okay thanks a lot guys its helpful paul v campanelli  endo international plc thank you randall okay operator thank you our next question is from greg fraser of deutsche bank your line is open gregory d fraser  deutsche bank securities inc morning guys its greg fraser on for gregg gilbert thanks for the additional color on how to think about the generics business in  that was helpful i was wondering if you could comment on how much growth you would expect for the injectables business this year or is that sort of embedded in the other comments that you made paul v campanelli  endo international plc its embedded lets see if we can – just bear with us for a second here we can give you just a little color on growth blaise coleman  endo international plc yeah in terms of growth we would expect that to be sort of in the high singledigits to low doubledigits growth in  for the overall sterile injectables gregory d fraser  deutsche bank securities inc got it and then a question on cash flow and the  million of cash distributions expected to settle mesh claims in  will there be a tax refund related to those payments it wasnt clear blaise coleman  endo international plc yeah so greg the way you should think about modeling cash taxes is not to do it at any specific line item but do it at an enterprise level so the guidance we gave is that we anticipate that our cash tax rate will be in the low singledigits as a percentage of pretax adjusted net income and thats how we would recommend that you model cash taxes gregory d fraser  deutsche bank securities inc will there be a specific refund related to the blaise coleman  endo international plc not specific to that no gregory d fraser  deutsche bank securities inc okay and then just last quick one how do we think about rd spend for the cellulite study that youre going to be starting in the second half thank you paul v campanelli  endo international plc well we are preparing for success the actual number is about ish about  million for the clinical trial portion blaise coleman  endo international plc in  paul v campanelli  endo international plc in  for the clinical trial portion of cellulite okay thank you operator thank you our next question is from chris schott of jpmorgan your line is open dana c flanders  jpmorgan securities llc hi thanks this is dana flanders on for chris just my first question can you just talk a little bit more about your outlook for your potassium chloride products and i know you mentioned the incremental opportunity to gain share on the powder maybe you can help frame that and then what are your assumptions around competition in guidance for  on both the liquid and powder and then i have a quick followup paul v campanelli  endo international plc well regarding both those products theres no intellectual property holding anybody back from filing it or launching into those products so i think you just have to assume that generic competition is able to come back into both the liquid and the powder that said anyone filing an anda would have to go through the standard regulatory process and youd have to assume probably about a month review knowing that these ndas have been approved for more than a year so i just caution you on the longevity so these products have been approved i believe since  maybe even  anybody that would file an anda i would not have visibility to that because they would be filing paragraph probably two theres no patents associated with these bs but at this point in time we have  of the liquid market and we have much greater than  share in the powder market dana c flanders  jpmorgan securities llc oh great okay great and my quick followup just can you talk about the interest expense for  i know that came in i think a little bit higher that what we were expecting and so just whats the average blended interest rate for the company and just i guess help frame your exposure to rising interest rates thank you blaise coleman  endo international plc yeah so thats right we do – just to remind you about  of our debt is variable base debt and we have factored into our guidance increased in a rate increased environment have factored that into our thinking and thats whats really driving the impact youre seeing yearoveryear from a interest expense standpoint paul v campanelli  endo international plc okay thank you next question operator thank you our next question is from david risinger of morgan stanley your line is open thomas chiu  morgan stanley  co llc hi thanks this is thomas chiu on behalf of dave we just had one question regarding xiaflex for cellulite could you please disclose how you plan to address the pricing given the high price for medical conditions and  pricing restrictions thank you very much paul v campanelli  endo international plc yeah so thomas thank you at this point in time we do have a strategy but were not going to – at this point in time it just were not going to elaborate we acknowledge the challenge and we do have a plan to address it when its finalized well be pleased to communicate it so were just going to ask for some patience in this regard thank you next question operator thank you our next question is from gary nachman of bmo your line is open unknown speaker good morning this is nicole  on the line for gary just going back to xiaflex could you describe the phase  program and are you looking to partner that out or could you ultimately just mark it out yourself paul v campanelli  endo international plc sure so in terms of the phase  program the trial had about  patients enrolled in it and just from a very – to try to address the question from a very high level it utilized a primary endpoint that had what was called a twopoint improvement in severity from baseline so it was a internally developed metric with external consultants that if you as a patient or clinician had seen more than a twopoint improvement from baseline that that would ultimately provide clarity in terms of the direction of the results this study is really kind of referred to as a photonumeric cellulite severity scale and the results were discussed with the fda probably about two three weeks ago in our end of phase b discussions with the fda that meeting went reasonably well were pretty excited and we are preparing for success as we move into phase  we try not to get too deep into the results because ultimately we want to publish the results of the trial so stay tuned but we again were planning for success were very excited about the outcome of phase b and we should be preparing for phase  in the q timeframe unknown speaker great thank you paul v campanelli  endo international plc thank you operator thank you our next question is from andrew finkelstein of susquehanna your line is open paul v campanelli  endo international plc andrew operator please check your mute button stephen j mock  endo international plc christy maybe we want to go on to the next question operator our next question is from liav abraham of citi your line is open andrew finkelstein  susquehanna financial group lllp hi hello operator oh liav abraham  citigroup global markets inc hi paul v campanelli  endo international plc hi liav liav abraham  citigroup global markets inc hi thanks good morning firstly could you please just outline the exact contribution from generic seroquel and zetia in  in the fourth quarter and then secondly just a question on your path to delevering which is i understand to be a stated goal i understand that you dont want to provide specific commentary or timelines on how you get there but perhaps you can help us think about the pushes and pulls as it relates to cash flows in at least post  as you aim to get to that three to four times range paul v campanelli  endo international plc so the exact was what  – yeah so the exact combined for ezetimibe and quetiapine for q was  million liav liav abraham  citigroup global markets inc thanks paul v campanelli  endo international plc okay and in terms of the push and pulls i think at this point in time were not – were just not in the position to give specifics as i mentioned earlier weve made tremendous progress in a short period of time but there still is a degree of uncertainties that we need to get our hands wrapped around so were just going to ask from some patience clearly its a primary focus and you can see the moves that were making to put ourselves in a better position for efficiencies and growing really at the end of the day growing ebitda margins just give us little bit more time and when were ready well come back and communicate where we stand on our strategy for delivering in  liav abraham  citigroup global markets inc thank you paul v campanelli  endo international plc thank you operator thank you and now well take andrew finkelsteins question of susquehanna your line is open andrew finkelstein  susquehanna financial group lllp thanks very much for taking the question apologies for the delay i was just hoping you could talk a little bit more – the slides mention a stocking impact in generics in q i noticed the generics base was up quarteronquarter so if you could talk a little bit about those dynamics second on potassium you note the lack of exclusivity but do you have any views on the citizen petition that one of your competitors submitted recently regarding elemental impurities and then just for the generics business more broadly are there any pipeline products in particular that should be a focus for people as opportunities either in the second half of this year or as we go into next year thanks paul v campanelli  endo international plc sure so theres three questions there im going to let blaise answer your first one blaise coleman  endo international plc andrew just in terms of stocking in q in generic so if we look at total generics and were going to exclude quetiapine and ezetimibe because theyre just – we had the major launches excluding those two products the overall stocking in our generics business was around  million and then particularly in the base business in fourth quarter we saw about  million of stocking paul v campanelli  endo international plc okay and then andrew your question regarding the citizens petition we believe that ultimately that citizens petitions not going to have any impact on our ability to sell in terms of opening up competition and as i mentioned earlier there isnt anything stopping anyone from filing an anda so when that occurs and the fda approves somebody well defend our share as you would expect as parbased product regarding the pipeline focus i think really if you go back in some of the questions that we – sorry some of the commentary around ephedrine and adrenaline the fact that the fdas taken action to take the unapproved sources off the market in several months thats probably where i would focus my attention to in terms of drivers for  ephedrine and adrenaline andrew finkelstein  susquehanna financial group lllp thanks very much paul v campanelli  endo international plc okay stephen j mock  endo international plc okay operator thank you stephen j mock  endo international plc go ahead next question please operator our next question is from annabel samimy of stifel your line is open esther hong  stifel nicolaus  co inc hi this is esther hong on for annabel samimy just a quick question on vasostrict can you provide any updates on any potential competition for that product thank you paul v campanelli  endo international plc sure thank you at this point in time as you know we have intellectual property we have an orange book patent and to the best of our knowledge we believe at this point in time that we have not been noticed from any paragraph iv filers so i think its probably maybe the best way to communicate that at this point in time we have not been noticed of any paragraph iv applicants stephen j mock  endo international plc okay christy well take one more question please operator our last question is from the line of ken cacciatore of cowen  company your line is open ken cacciatore  cowen  co llc hey thanks guys just real quick question just looking forward to the cellulite phase  just kind of counting out how long would it take sounds like it could be on the market around  so just wondering can you review for us the xiaflex intellectual property when we should expect you have durability for this product too thank you paul v campanelli  endo international plc so ken your assumptions are in the ballpark in terms of timing assuming success so i probably wouldnt go any deeper than that in terms of the intellectual property surrounding xiaflex there are a number of – theres a number of patents that have been granted i would say most notably theres a  patent that expires in  but on top of that as you would expect our team is working towards additional patents for end market as well as potential future indication so work in progress and then just keep in mind that it is a bla and with that comes a series of de facto challenges this is not something that is easily developed so were pretty excited about potential indications and – okay okay all right stephen j mock  endo international plc all right that concludes the qa session paul v campanelli  endo international plc okay so with that thank you steve as i said this is a important time for endo we appreciate your continued interest and support of the company and we look forward to providing you with updates as we move
