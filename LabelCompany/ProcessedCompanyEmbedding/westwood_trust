for advisors  the wealthadvisor skip to main content search westwood trust’s “common trust funds” emerge as bellwether business model for advisors westwood trust’s “common trust funds” emerge as bellwether business model for advisors jerry cooper contributor january   exclusive ceo says new funds can be started in minutes not months at a fraction of the cost of a mutual fund earlier this month the trust advisor reported westwood holdings group inc nyse  whg through its trust company unit westwood trust helped forge gains by landing large new accounts while other firms sat on the sidelines westwood managed to bring in  billion in new assets during the toughest year in recent financial memory as part two of our report on westwood trust i had an opportunity to chat once again with brian casey president and ceo of westwood to drill down into the topic of interest to most wealth advisors – common trust funds new money from an old idea simply stated common trust funds or “ctfs” permit the commingling or pooling of investors’ money into one account known as a common fund for the purpose of creating a single investment in other words they are much like a mutual fund they actually predate mutual funds so they are an old concept since they are a bank product ctfs are not required to be registered with the securities and exchange commission and they are not considered to be a security under state and federal securities laws they are regulated under occ regulation   cfr  and are supervised by state or federal bank regulators casey says there are two types of ctfs the first are common trust funds or ctfs a product of a bank or trust company established as a convenience to the trust client the second are collective investment funds or cifs these are utilized primarily by large qualified plan sponsors who are seeking institutional pricing for a large pool of retirement assets such as ks  they strike an nav daily and trade on fundserve   casey adds “we actually have one of these that we developed for a fortune  company k plan and the data is available in morningstar” but westwood’s power products are the ctfs common trust funds they are private and only available to clients of westwood trust casey says that “they are only available to our clients who have a bona fide personal trust relationship with the trust company” their minimum account size is  million which can be either a taxable or retirement account but in other words to benefit “you have to be a trust client and have seven figures with us to be part of the club” according to the westwood’s k quarterly report for the year ending september    billion of its  billion or  of its assets under management are held in common trust fund relationships the strategies westwood runs  separate common trust funds which are based on  asset classes casey adds “with institutional quality and thoughtful asset allocation the client is given a better shot of achieving what it is that they’re trying to do than picking a mutual fund off a list” to the client “expenses matter” with a ctf the only charge is a management fee  there is no legal accounting  transfer agent or fund supermarket fees that are normally part of a mutual fund fee structure westwood offers five different “flavors” of value this includes smallcap allcap largecap  mid‑cap and smidcap value as for income they offer five types of income products including investment grade bonds reits high yield and two unique income funds they have an esoteric type of fund called the income opportunity fund this allows them to participate in a company through different parts of its capital structure this might include for example a high dividend paying common stock a preferred stock or part of a company’s debt in the form of a bond or they might own royalty trusts or mlps they just started a popular global diversification fund ctf the strategy on this vehicle is to focus on investor purchasing power protection casey remarks “as us citizens we have a lot of obstacles that could diminish the purchasing power of our savings like inflation or the potential decline of the us dollar” this fund might hold global tips or treasury inflation protected securities global bonds gold and other types of commodities while westwood manages all of the domestic value and income funds westwood employs outside subadvisors chosen by westwood’s investment committee with assistance from an outside consulting firm to manage the domestic growth funds westwood uses william blair in chicago as their subadvisor for international value westwood uses lazard based in london and for international growth westwood employs martin currie based in scotland the fees paid to subadvisors come out of westwood’s pocket as opposed to any additional fee to the client  casey says “asset allocation is critical to longterm investment success westwood is a worldclass investor in the value and income space but we recognize that investors need access to both domestic and international strategies to complete their asset allocation plan  we have a talented consultant on retainer and an experienced investment committee to help us identify best in class subadvisors” technical items a major part of hosting a selection of common trust funds servicing close to  billion is the technology platform the two major factors that must be considered for any common trust fund trust accounting systems are  to keep track of each investors holding and  to be able to strike a daily nav calculation for each fund westwood uses a trust accounting system called infovisa casey said they have been working with infovisa for over  years and they deliver a “great system” he remarked that the folks that started infovisa came out of sungard sungard offers two trust accounting systems to support ctf processing the two systems are charlotte which is utilized primarily by firms with zero to us billion in trust assets customers include smaller community banks and private trust companies as well as startup firms the other is addvantage which is typically used by large regional and national banks with no theoretical size maximum in terms of assets transactions or users each of the systems has been designed to work in conjunction with sungard’s wealth management platform solution wealth station the trust platforms are also able to utilize the trade execution and compliance tools of the sungard transaction network stn advent also offers a common trust fund system it is actually a mutual fund system but may be used to keep track of ctfs taking  action common trust fund arrangements offer clients lower fees than mutual funds that together with the enormous flexibility to create a pooled investment vehicle in minutes means that ctfs are likely to become an important part of the investment landscape the ease with which a trust company can be established in south dakota nevada or delaware by investment managers has made inroads to this field establishing a kind of “turnkey” service which allows investment managers and plan administrators to easily establish new common trust funds arrangements jerry cooper senior
