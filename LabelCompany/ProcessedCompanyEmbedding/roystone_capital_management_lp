positions sector weights sentiment turnover top  holdings and more what is a hedge fund a closer look at hedge funds there are plenty of investment vehicles that financially savvy individuals can think about investing in or tracking the hedge fund is just one of those but it is also the one that is worth looking at there’s an air of mystery about this type of investment vehicle but it is not always a tough nut to crack what investors need to do is to educate themselves on what hedge funds are and to understand what risks they should expect to expose their investments to how do hedge funds work hedge funds are considered as viable alternatives to the existing forms of investment on the financial markets however it is not open to every individual investor rather the funds are more ideal for people and institutions that have significant amount of assets that they want to be managed and grown managers typically pool together the assets of their clients to create a unified fund and then they make their trades and investments using that single fund it is theoretically similar to mutual funds but they differ in the techniques that’s the reason why it’s not open to individual investors there are significant risks involved – aside from traditional investment vehicles like the popular mutual funds and stock market options as well as bonds hedge fund managers lean more towards high risk but sophisticated trading techniques to realize significant profits for their clients’ portfolio adding to the risk exposure is the fact that hedge funds are not as closely regulated as the other financial instruments hedge fund managers are not always required to make filings and reports to the securities and exchange commission but that’s on a case to case basis if the assets are large enough the sec will require reports hedge fund managers however are bound by law to protect their clients’ investments or face antifraud measures a brief history of hedge funds hedge funds have a very long history people and institutions began investing in this vehicle at the early st century the funds never lost popularity over time before the recession hit there was a total value of us trillion being managed by hedge fund managers worldwide the industry had a brief hiccup afterwards because of the subprime mortgage crisis but it eventually recovered this is a testimony to how popular hedge funds really are and how much investors are willing to trust their assets to managers hedge fund assets totaled  trillion worldwide by april  just three years after the crisis burst by the third quarter of  the worldwide value of assets under management or aum is at  trillion and may continue to grow in the next years hedge fund strategies hedge fund managers do not subscribe to a single strategy but rather they employ a combination of various strategies it is not uncommon to find hedge fund managers putting some of the money in their management to purchase securities derivatives there are however some popular strategies that hedge fund managers acknowledge and use hedge fund managers will exercise any strategy and option within their discretion in response to several factors in the market here are some of the strategies that hedge fund managers could use either by itself or in tandem with other techniques in managing assets global macro this type of strategy relies on identifying macroeconomic events that take place around the world to make investment decisions managers generally look at the big picture globally to identify potential entry points for profitable investments the global macro approach leverages multiple markets and managers will employ long and short investment strategies to maximize profits from volatile market movements this approach is very flexible and very diversified as well because there are many variations of substrategy under this umbrella directional the directional strategy does not pay too much attention to what is happening to markets on a global basis instead directional strategy dictates that fund managers look at each individual market movement when picking ideal investments a typical action under this strategy is to invest in equities with an eye for the long term and to couple that position with shortterm buying and selling to hedge against risk eventdriven hedge fund managers following this philosophy are focused in following corporate events and leveraging their assets to earn from the market movement influenced by these occurrences for instance company consolidations and mergers can make possible upward movements in price eventdriven hedge fund management will typically take positions before or after such events take place in order to leverage and earn profits from the price movements that occur even bankruptcy declarations can also spur action from eventdriven hedge fund managers relative value relative event hedge fund management focuses on finding price discrepancies and investing on those this is the most technical of all the four management strategies discussed so far analysis is very comprehensive and somewhat holistic as there are many types of analysis carried out under this strategy to identify the profitable price discrepancies how do hedge fund managers approach risk as mentioned above hedge funds are not advisable for all types of investors because of the amount of risk involved in their operation that is where risk mitigation comes in in fact managers operating in the hedge fund industry are described as being the most meticulous – they use the most stringent and the most precise means of protecting investments against the risks that the volatility of the market brings the most common method of reducing the risk exposure of managed assets is to diversify the entirety of the funds used to set up the hedge funds are split between various investments and varying investment positions for instance some of the funds may be put into longterm positions in lowrisk lowreturn funds that can steadily gain in the passage of time a portion of the funds may be invested in highrisk highreturn investment positions that the hedge fund manager may monitor in the short term taking into consideration the risk factor and market environment in addition hedge fund companies may employ risk officers these are not people who are directly involved in trading but have knowledge in how markets work these risk officers will focus on identifying long and shortterm risks to the assets under management and will then work on creating a comprehensive risk management strategy that will be applied by the hedge fund managers for their managed assets other techniques for managing risk in hedge funds include using risk management methodologies as well as operational due diligence offshore and onshore hedge funds because of their popularity and the global nature of their investment hedge fund managers can be found all over the world there are two types of hedge fund management companies and they are the onshore and offshore hedge fund managers their differences lie mainly in the levying of tax on the investors’ earnings offshore hedge fund managers give their investors the advantage of minimal tax consequences for example usbased investors who enjoy tax exemptions on their investments particularly in retirement funds will turn to offshore hedge funds this helps them avoid being taxed for their income from the hedge funds on the other hand if offshore hedge funds invest in instruments and securities in the united states they can expect the us government to slap withholding taxes on their investments however there are no capital gains tax involved here – this is to make sure that offshore investors are not doubletaxed for any increase on the value of their assets only their local jurisdiction has the legal right to levy any taxes on the investors for gains they see from their investments the presence of both onshore and offshore hedge management funds make the taxation more flexible and more personalized according to each investor’s personal expectations in taxation in addition it encourages global investment because of the measures imposed specifically to avoid the horrors of doubletaxation – a common fear among investors who have eyes on diversifying globally prominent centers of investment the united states remains the center of global hedge fund management  of the hedge fund managers that oversee the progress of global funds are based in the united states the securities and exchange commission has in its registry nearly  financial experts as of april  who handled management of hedge funds these are found across the us but most of them are based in new york city and connecticut’s gold coast as for european hedge funds london is the home of the managers with over  of them found in the city in  these firms were responsible for managing  of the hedge fund assets from continental europe there is a growing market in asia particularly in japan growing economic centers hong kong and singapore are also experiencing a growth in hedge fund assets under management but it will be some time before they achieve the demand in hedge fund managers enjoyed by the us and london in europe in fact most of the hedge funds from asia are managed by offshore companies based in these two centers hedge fund

commodity trading advisors are these that provide managed futures accounts or funds and they have very different return profile and correlations than hedge funds managed futures offer a good way to diversify hedge fund or other traditional investments and in some cases could also offer lower minimum investment requirements because hedge funds are usually stock picking and don’t provide crisis

altshuller five european companies funds are shorting october   by matthew mcalister share tweet share  share hedge funds manager analysis manager monday roystone capital management karan katyal senior analytics associate todays manager monday takes a look at a roystone capital management which has had a hard time generating alpha in the current environment thus far our manager mondays have tended to focus on popular funds that have no trouble generating alpha today we’ll examine a manager that public data indicates has had a slightly more difficult go of it albeit over a much shorter time period in a low dispersion environment roystone capital management is a valueoriented hedge fund founded in  by rich barrera formerly of redwood and glenview the fund invests both long and short in equities and credit all the below analysis is purely on their long equity book they’re required to publicly file so does not encapsulate their entire book given the asset class profile of roystone’s investments and the fact they did not reach sufficient size to file till q  this is an important disclaimer this analysis does not include their first year and the multiasset class longshort nature of their portfolio means actual performance and portfolio composition may differ greatly asset growth  transmission roystone has grown explosively aum as measured by market value has roughly doubled from where it was in the first filing in q  as we’ve pointed out a few times in the past an increase in assets is typically reflected in an equity fund’s portfolio through three metrics an increase in the number of securities as the manager tries to find new names to deploy the capital a rise up the market cap spectrum as the manager searches for names big enough to be able to accept the additional money andor a decrease in liquidity as the manager decides to double down on the same names when we inspect roystone’s portfolio we first see that the number of securities they’ve publicly filed on has stayed roughly stable with some ups and downs meanwhile d liquidity has actually increased given this one would posit that roystone has likely pushed the third lever to accommodate asset growth – and sure enough examination of their portfolio shows that on a weighted average basis the fund has crept up the market cap spectrum later we will explore whether this shift has been a good thing absolute and relative analysis on an absolute basis roystone seems to have done a decent job generating nearly bps of contribution of the  names they’ve filed on since q  they’ve made money on  of their names what we here at novus refer to as a batting average and have deployed  of capital into these winnings these impressive metrics have been hamstrung slightly by the fact their average winner makes bps whereas their average loser detracts  bps this unimpressive winloss ratio of x suggests that roystone may have some issues around sizing up their winners and cutting their losers see this novus paper that goes into some more depth about the importance of the winloss ratio more worries come up when we look at roystone’s performance on a relative basis comparing each security to the market and to its relevant sector benchmark we can dissect how much of the fund’s contribution from that security has come from exposure to the marketsector “beta” and how much has come from security selectiontrading “alpha” the results of this analysis across the portfolio can be seen below the data suggests that the entirety of the bps that roystone has generated on its long equity book has come from beta security selectiontrading detracted bps while this obviously isn’t great there is an interesting observation one can make upon examining the biggest alpha generatorsdetractors with the exception of valeant on the long side and media general on the short side none of these names are particularly popular amongst hedge funds indeed when we examine the novus top  the  most popular names among hedge funds our research has found we find just  overlap with roystone’s book what this means is for better or for worse roystone unlike numerous other funds is not collecting  and  to go to “idea lunches” and schmooze stock picks off the competition sector analysis since their first filing the fund has been focused on three main sectors consumer discretionary healthcare and tech more recently they have increased exposure slightly to industrials and utilities and have exited the financials space entirely as we dig in further we see that the book has generated alpha primarily in healthcare positive performance in other segments has largely been driven by marketsector exposure worryingly significant alpha has been detracted in the core consumer discretionary and tech sectors in the chart below the lighter bars are beta and the darker bars are alpha additionally despite relatively small allocations utilities and materials have been the heaviest detractors with the lack of success in their core sectors the manager can’t be blamed for exploring other options but these do not seem to be working out market cap analysis as we previously noted the avenue that roystone has appeared to have gone down to incorporate asset growth is a move into larger market capitalization names often this can be a sign that a manager’s style is drifting into an area in which they don’t have expertise let’s see if that’s the case here as expected mega and large cap exposure have risen since late  at the expense of mid and small cap exposure fortunately it appears that this move up the market cap spectrum has been additive to the portfolio substantively all alpha has been generated by large and mega cap names position sizing position sizing is another way for a manager to generate alpha getting one name in ten right is fine if  of your money is in that winning name splitting roystone’s book into various position sizing buckets we can examine the returns they generated across the buckets what the chart above is showing is had they deployed  of their capital into names in the bps bucket roystone would have annualized

rock stars while the data does not show roystone in equally favorable light all this analysis needs to be taken with a grain of salt – their shorts along with their credit positions may have performed very differently to the names we examined additionally the time period in question is probably not statistically significant especially given the low dispersion environment that has made it difficult for most managers to generate alpha finally there are a few positives to be taken their relatively unique portfolio along with a move up the market capitalization spectrum into names where they’ve been able to generate more alpha activist vs activist vs activist one of the most polarizing strategies a hedge fund manager can employ is to be an activist investor carl icahn the largest and most renowned of activists recently weighed in on the issue stating “there are bad activists and we agree that it’s bad all they want to do is get in and rock the boat and make a quick trade” but we have found that data speaks favorably of activist managers or at the very least the returns they are able to generate for their investors without opining on the “good” or “bad” it’s clear that activists can be very different in the strategies they use to create value for the companies they target and their investors this article performs a deepdive holdings analysis on three prominent activist hedge
