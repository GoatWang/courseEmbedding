general counsel advanced micro devices inc harry wolin knows technology or at least the technology market while you might not see him giving expert advice on how to use the latest gadgets or coding complex algorithms into cuttingedge software he has seen the technology sector of the austin economy like few others have as it has developed and changed it’s a field he has been involved in for the good part of three decades even if he is just getting used to his new iphone “i just made the transition from a blackberry and frankly i’m struggling with that one” he said with a grin “even though i’ve been in the tech industry my entire career i’m still somewhat of a dinosaur” iphone issues aside wolin’s experience with technology giants like advanced micro devices inc and motorola inc grants him a rare panorama of what the trends have been and what they will be he explained that the austin picture has changed from one of independent entrepreneurs and small startups trying to get their piece of the pie to an era where those same smallbusiness employees are migrating to bigger corporations “when i first got here we were leading up to the internet bubble everybody was doing all sorts of things dell was really booming—just over the top—and everybody was making money hand over fist” he recounted “now a lot of the tech workers are going from the small organizations into the big ones—you know the dells the ibms the motorolas the amds” amd is currently the world’s second largest central processing unit cpu manufacturer behind intel corporation and a leader in graphics processing units wolin joined the company in  and headed the technology law department where he dealt with intellectual property affairs as vice president prior to that he worked at motorola as vice president and director of legal affairs for the semiconductor products sector which later became freescale semiconductor inc in his time with amd wolin has helped see through the ibmamd process technology alliance the acquiring of graphics card manufacturer ati and the settlement of antitrust lawsuits with intel that made the microprocessor market more equitable in  he received the magna stella award from the texas general counsel forum for his innovative management and is also a member of the state bars of arizona and texas wolin who has a bachelor’s degree in chemistry from the university of arizona got started in the business after his first year of law school when he took a job with motorola and entered into a program that trained law students with a technical background to be patent attorneys he said that he never expected to be involved with a technology company—he never really had a passion for it as a child—but said he is continually captivated by the advances at amd “it’s complicated it’s intense stuff i look at what the people do here every day and it’s truly amazing” he said “they are working on the neatest stuff out there that anyone is working on” wolin explained that a growing austin is the perfect place for fostering new innovations in the technology market he spoke about the university of texas as part of the reason for the growth and the continuing health of the area’s technology market as well as the state’s protech mentality “it’s the combination of the startup culture as well as the big company presence” he said “there’s jobs for those people from ut we also have the state of texas that does a lot things to keep tech companies in place” “they make it a good place to do business some of the tax laws are favorable and when you couple favorable government and favorable industry with a big university you’ve got all the building blocks for a nice effort” he continued austin might be a good fit for amd but amd is also a good fit for austin it attracts small upandcoming businesses and creates almost  jobs locally the microchip manufacturer sponsors events such as austin city limits and south by southwest and dedicated roughly  volunteer hours to the community in  wolin serves on the board of governors for lifeworks which provides assistance to struggling families and youth with housing finances and education after some stagnation in the job market over the past few years wolin forecasted that the current economy will he hopes allow amd to again move forward with incubating more startups investing venture capital and ultimately funding new technologies “the tech business in austin is very different than it was when i first got here” he said “and i think it’s going to continue to change” amd accomplishments acquired ati a graphics card manufacturer that is now leading the graphics processing unit market in performance leader in hypertransport technology which has been used in apple and ibm computers developed accelerated processing units that provide enhanced processing power and power efficiency for graphics cards advances in disruptive server space developed athlon  processors which was a significant leap in bit computing developed first dual core opteron processor an xbased server cpu on april   set world record for fastest overclocked cpu at  ghz ibmamd process technology
