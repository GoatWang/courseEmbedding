business world the ability to oversee plans processes and personnel requires skills that are honed over time and with great patience sometimes there is an “aha moment” an epiphany of sorts at which point a person realizes ‘i can lead’ in other cases a series of general events or a string of specific incidences yields a confidence and focus within a person allowing leadership qualities to come forthin nashville the majority of leaders remain men but woman are closing that gap making significant impact on the area’s business community it is a trend that is encouraging and surely will benefit the city and the region the nashville post editorial team selected the  most powerful women — check out our  choices here — based on their leadership skills broad influence and ability to facilitate positive change the group represents a crosssection of area industries health care government nonprofits and public relationsmarketingwe interviewed the four to learn about their leadership styles philosophies and challenges they came across as humble intelligent and seasoned we liked what we heard nashville indeed should take note of these leaders the girl scouts transformed agenia clark’s life at an early ageclark is now returning the favor by leading the girl scouts of middle tennessee the iconic local nonprofit that serves  girls and  adult volunteers in  counties in middle tennesseeclark who was named president and ceo of the girls scouts of middle tennessee in  gives the girl scouts much of the credit for providing her the confidence to grow into — and succeed at — many roles in lifeher accomplishments began early clark excelled in elementary school in mobile ala and won a scholarship to a college preparatory academy for high school for her academic efforts she also soared as an undergraduate and mba student at the university of tennesseeafter graduation she landed leadership positions quickly clark held executive positions at northern telecom vanderbilt university and the tennessee lottery before landing the girls scouts of middle tennessee job“agenia has every trait necessary to lead a multimillion dollar corporation — intelligence passion vision patience communications integrity dedication assertiveness sincerity and humor” said deborah varallo president of varallo public relations and a girls scouts of middle tennessee board member “she is capable of leading a fortune  company she just happens to be leading the girl scouts of middle tennessee”  clark first sensed that she had the potential to be a good leader when she was a young girl scout she remembers a pivotal moment when she was asked to be the “flag caller” at a girl scout flag ceremony“it was the first time i recall hearing my voice announced and it was for the honorable cause of the flag ceremony” clark said “i remember being nervous but i also remember the preparation i had for taking that leadership role i remember the numerous times i had to listen and follow the instructions of the caller myself”varallo first met clark before she was ceo when they were both volunteers at girls scouts of middle tennessee she was impressed by clark’s rollupyour sleeves attitude — not just as a corporate leader but as a nononsense wife mother and concerned community member“agenia can lead the girl scouts because she’s done it all she’s planned troop meetings been camping organized cookie booths and sewed on the badges her daughter earned” varallo saidclark currently serves on the advisory council to the college of business at the university of tennessee and on the steering committee for nashville’s agenda she is a member of several boards the nashville area chamber of commerce the women’s fund board for the community foundation and avenue bank she is a committed volunteer for leadership nashville the region’s premiere executive leadership organizationclark has also has been honored by the tennessee economic council on women for her leadership and inducted into the ywca’s academy for women of achievementalthough her influence as a leader in middle tennessee is undeniable she is modest about it and gives much of the credit for her success to others“i stand on some very broad shoulders of a great staff an amazing board dedicated volunteers and wonderful wonderful mentors” clark said “being influential simply means that you take the time to share your knowledge experiences and desire to effect change sharing is what makes an individual influential”clark also has high praise for nashville’s community of women business and community leaders“we have an amazing community of women in middle tennessee” she said “given a cause they are there given a mission they show up when you just have a question you will get an answer”she also has a strong belief that the region’s girl scout leaders are among the most effective women leaders in the area“recently vanderbilt university’s peabody school conducted research that confirmed that girl scouting makes a big difference in a girl’s life” clark said “i’m reassured that nashville’s future female leaders are coming from the thousands of girls we serve every day”clark believes that good leaders possess a combination of traits all of which are emphasized taught practiced and validated in the girl scouting experience“a leader needs to be visionary” she said “a leader also has to have entrepreneurial qualities in order to generate new energy and enthusiasm from a team one doesn’t exist without the other because at different times during the lifespan of a business or project the impact of one or the other fluctuates” management  most powerful women executive leadership girl scouts of middle tennessee nashville post magazine related insider trades pinnacle ceo sells m worth of
