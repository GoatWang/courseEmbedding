restaurant locations across the us june  coravin inc wins silver stevie in american business awards’ “startup of the year” category product detailsedit the coravin system uses a medical grade needle and a capsule of argon gas to pour a bottle of wine through the cork the cork is never removed this helps prevent oxidation increasing the longevity of the wine it accomplishes this by first inserting a hollow needle through the cork the user then presses a trigger to pressurize the bottle with argon gas when the user releases the trigger the wine pours into the glass the needle is removed from the cork a naturally elastic and porous material which then reseals protecting the wine from oxidation and leaving the remaining wine unaffected receptionedit when it launched in july  the coravin system
