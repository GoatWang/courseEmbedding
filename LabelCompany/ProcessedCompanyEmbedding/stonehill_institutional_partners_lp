and the crossmotion denied background in february  botw the lender of certain non performing loans including a loan in the principal amount of the loan to borrowers gary goett and others determined to sell the loans pursuant to a written engagement agreement dated march   botw retained defendant mission capital advisors llc mission to market a collection of loans and to conduct an auction sale of the botw assets including the loan stem affex a the sale process was a structured time line sealedbid auction designed to result in the submission of noncontingent final bids along with prenegotiated purchase and sale agreements stem aff ex c on march   mission distributed an offering memorandum which included the loan in a single asset pool the offering memorandum set a timeline for indicative bids march   final bids april   winning bidder selection april   deposit april   and closing april   on the final bid date prospective buyers were to submit noncontingent offers the acceptance of which by seller will require immediate execution of pre   negotiated asset sale agreements by prospective bidder accompanied by a i  nonrefundable wire funds deposit stem aff ex s the offering memorandum also stated that the seller is selling its assets subject only to those representations and warranties explicitly stated in the asset sale agreement the offering memorandum included a disclaimer that the seller reserves the right at their sole and absolute discretion to withdraw any or all of the assets from the loan sale at any time id although the parties dispute who initiated the call on april   steven emery of mission spoke with michael stem of stonehill regarding the auction stem expressed an interest in participating in the auction mission forwarded a copy of the proposed loan sale agreement lsa that botw intended to utilize in connection with the winning bid stem affex d the lsa was the prenegotiated asset sale agreement referenced in the offering memorandum on april   stonehill advised mission that the proposed lsa did not contain the technical provisions necessary to effectuate sale and assignment of a loan under a syndicated credit facility and offered to modify the proposed lsa or use the loan syndications and trading association syndicated loan documents lst a documentation stern aff ex e a lsta documentation is a form purchase and sale agreement incorporating standardized terms and conditions for trading distressed syndicated loans stonehill rule a statement  botw rule a response   on april   emery called stem to inform him that stonehills bid price  of the loan amount was accepted as the winning bid at the auction on april   stonehill sent mission a modified version of the lsa to address the requirements for a syndicated credit facility stem aff ex f on april   jason kuwayama counsel for botw sent emery an email stating that if the loan was a syndicated credit then the lst a form agreement is actually pretty good stem affex g emery replied that he was  certain that stonehill is right about this being a syndicated credit id on april   mission sent an email to stonehill stating subject to the mutual execution of an acceptable loan sale agreement bank of the west seller has agreed to the stonehill capital management llc buyer  bid of mixed portfolio    upb purchase price       as discussed counsel representing bank of the west will be jason kuwayama  jason will be sending you an executable loan sale agreement in clean and redline form by tuesday may st an executed signature page and  nonrefundable deposit is expected no later than  pm edt on wednesday may nd  stem affex h later that day kuwayama emailed stonehill stating that he was previously unaware that the loan was syndicated and that he preferreded to use the lst a documentation for syndicated credits stem affex i kuwayama further stated that because most trade agents would not approve trades at the end of the month the parties should aim for an early may closing date id on may   kuwayama again emailed stonehill stating that he was working on getting you the documents by monday he also requested a copy of previous documents regarding the loan stem aff ex j on may   stonehill responded with draft documents and expressed a desire to move forward with execution so that stonehill could pay the required deposit stem affex k on may   botw learned that stonehill had provided financing to goett in an internal memorandum dated may   stem aff ex  botw employee mark mccue summarized the auction by stating that on or shortly after april   botw determined that it would be in its best interest to place the goett note with mission to be sold mission capital negotiated the sale of the goett note to stonehill capital at the sales price of  the memorandum states further that no formal written commitments are executued between botwmission capital and stonehill that would obligate botw to sale sic the goett note fact remains that botw acted in good faith and has verbally committed to the goett note sale to stonehill the memorandum makes no mention of the april   email from mission to stonehill which states that bank of the west  has agreed to the stonehill  bid  stem aff ex h on may   stonehill emailed kuwayama following up on the status ofthe transaction kuwayama forwarded the email to mission stating huh did you talk to them stem aff ex p on may   stonehill emailed mission following up as well stem aff ex q on may   kuwayama advised mission that botw will not proceed with the sale because it has no obligation to do so there are no agreements  between botw and stonehill capital the    offering memorandum    permits the botw to withdraw any loan from the auction at any time mission forwarded the email containing the attorneys advice to stonehill on may   stern aff ex r on june   as a result of the financing goettreceived botw received  on the loan which exceeded stonehills bid by  see stonehill rule a statement  botw rule a response  seven days later stonehill commenced this action the complaint alleged three causes of action  breach of contract  breach oflmplied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and  indemnification plaintiff sought damages in a sum exceeding  plus the costs disbursements and attorneys fees following dismissal of the second cause of action with leave to replead in the alternative motion sequence no   stonehill filed an amended complaint rep leading breach of implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing second cause of action in the alternative adding an unjust enrichment cause of action in the alternative third cause of action and renumbering the indemnification cause of action as the fourth cause of action in the amended complaint plaintiff seeks damages in the sum of at least  million on june   the court denied botws motion to dismiss the second and third causes of action on august   stonehill moved for summary judgement against botw as to the first cause of action or alternatively on the second and third causes of action discussion the standards for summary judgment are well settled summary judgment is a drastic remedy which will be granted only when the party seeking summary judgment has established that there are no triable issues of fact see cplr  b alvarez v prospect hosp  nyd    sillman v twentieth centuryfox film corporation  nyd    to prevail the party seeking summary judgment must make a prima facie showing of entitlement to judgment as a matter of law tendering evidentiary proof in admissible form which may include deposition transcripts and other proofannexed to an attorneys affirmation see alvarez supra olan v farrell lines  nyd   zuckerman v city of new york  nyd   absent a sufficient showing the court should deny the motion without regard to the strength of the opposing papers see winegradv new york univ med ctr  nyd      once the initial showing has been made the burden shifts to the party opposing the motion to rebut the prima facie showing by producing evidentiary proof in admissible form sufficient to require a trial of material issues of fact see kaufman v silver  nyd    although the court must carefully scrutinize the motion papers in a light most favorable to the party opposing the motion and must give that party the benefit of every favorable inference see negri v stop  shop inc  nyd    and summary judgment should be denied where there is any doubt as to the existence of a triable issue of fact see rotuba extruders inc v ceppos  nyd     bald conclusory assertions or speculation and a shadowy semblance of an issue are insufficient to defeat a summary judgment motion sj capalin assoc v globe vfg corp  nyd   see zuckerman supra ehrlich v american moninga greenhouse manufacturing corp  nyd    a whether a contract was formed to sustain a breach of contract action plaintiffs must demonstrate i an agreement ii plaintiffs performance iii defendants breach of the agreement and iv damages as a result of the breach see krauss v visa international service assoc  add  st dept  the loan was put up for auction by botw and were offered for sale subject only to those representations and warranties explicitly stated in the asset sale agreement stem aff ex s stonehill submitted the highest bid at the auction which bid was accepted by mission on behalf of botw subject to execution by the parties ofan acceptable loan sale agreement stem aff ex h botw argues that because the acceptance was made expressly subject to mutual execution of an acceptable loan sale agreementand there is no dispute that the lsa or lsta was never executed there was no binding agreement inamcan holdings inc v canadian imperial bankocommerce  add   st dept  o the court stated that in determining whether a contract exists the inquiry centers upon the parties intent to be bound ie whether there was a meeting of the minds regarding the material terms of the transaction a loan subject to a mutually acceptable agreement does not necessarily condition assent on the execution of a definitive agreement as long as the agreement is reasonably certain as to material terms emigrant bank v ubs real estate securities inc  add   st dept  see also bed bath  beyond inc v ibex construction llc  add     st dept  however if an agreement is not reasonably certain in its material terms there can be no enforceable contract cobble hill nursing home inc v henry  warren corp  nyd    here the auction was structured such that the material terms were prenegotiated because it misapprehended the nature of the loan botw erroneously included a lsa that was inappropriate for a syndicated credit facility when stonehill pointed out that an lsta documentation should be used instead botws counsel agreed immediately but for botws misunderstanding of the nature of the loan the material terms of the sale were established at the time of missions acceptance ofstonehills bid the parties postacceptance discussions regarding the agreement were focused on correcting the error by substitution of another well understood standard form of agreement stonehill never expressed any intention to modify the material terms of the agreement on the contrary the undisputed evidence shows that stonehill was ready willing and able to sign a compliant form and that delays in concluding the transaction were initiated by botw botws recent assertion that the lst a documentation contains myriad provisions to which botw would not agree failed to contain various provisions upon which botw would insist kuwayama aff ij  is not supported by any contemporaneous communication evidencing any of either the myriad provisions it found to be objectionable or the various provisions upon which it would insist these protestations advanced in litigation are also inconsistent with the sale terms botw set as subject only to those representation and warranties explicitly stated in the asset sale agreement regarding themyriad and various provisions which botw states have not been met botw argues that it was under no obligation to disclose to stonehill the changes it purportedly wanted to make to the lst a documentation it adds that until those secret changes were made it was under no binding obligation to proceed with the sale these arguments are utterly meritless the material terms on which to loan sold at auction are readily ascertainable by reference the offering memorandum the original lsa stonehill s bid and missions email accepting the bid botw requested the lst a documentation from stonehill and stated that it would send a form to stonehill to execute stonehill sent a proposed version of the lst a documentation to botw at botws request botw neither objected to any of the terms in the lsta    documentation nor provided any counterproposal there is no evidence of that botw manifested an intent not to be bound by the results of the auction until after it learned that stonehill had provided refinancing to goett thereby increasing the value of the loan by  million the subject to language in missions email accepting stonehills bid did not render it an unenforceable agreement to agree see bed bath and beyond inc supra use of the language subject to in the letter oflntent and references to the execution of a construction agreement as a qualification do not amount to an express reservation of the right not to be bound the cases cited by botw are not to the contrary clifford r gray inc v lechase construction services llc  add  d dept  involved the promised award of a subcontract without material terms such as the precise nature of the work the price and manner of payment the subject of the sale price and manner of payment in this case are definite although the time of closing was delayed from the initial terms this was required because of botws failure to produce a suitable agreement for execution and the preference of botws counsel for a closing after monthend stonehill states that it was prepared to wire a deposit and close in accordance with botws proposed timeframe an assertion that is not disputed idt corp v tyco group sarl   nyd   involved a enforceable settlement agreement that required negotiation oflater agreements before a party was obligated to perform the parties negotiated in good faith as the agreement required but failed to reach an agreement here botw failed to negotiate in good faith despite acknowledging its commitment to stonehill it reneged on the sale without providing a single proposed change to the lsnlsta amcan supra involved an agreement with a conditions precedent subheading the agreement was subject to completion of definitive loan documentation which contained the agreed upon terms and conditions and such other terms and conditions as defendant may reasonably require unlike amcan the agreement here did not contemplate additional terms and conditions in this case all the terms and conditions were prenegotiated and the technical execution of an acceptable form containing those prenegotiated terms was all that was required scneider v jarmain  add  st dept  ajfg  ny slip op u involved a letter of intent lacking material terms that ma de clear that there was no agreement between the parties    b mission as botws agent botw also argues that mission did not have authority to enter into a binding contract on its behalf an agent has actual authority if the principal has granted the agent the power to enter contracts on the principals behalf see ford v unity hospital  nyd    mission was hired by botw to conclude the auction and mission did so there is no evidence that mission had less than full authority to conduct an auction that would be binding on the winning bidder and botw if mission lacked such authority neither botw nor mission disclosed that fact to potential bidders in fact botw relied on mission to communicate both its acceptance of the bid and its decision not to proceed with the trade stem aff ex h and r moveover at oralargument on motion sequence number  held on june   counsel for botw readily conceded that mission was hired by botw to conduct the auction and to declare the winning bid with the understanding that the sale was subject to completion of the lsa the argument advanced by botws lawyer after botw learn there was more money to be made by not selling the loan to stonehill that mission was not its agent for the purpose of sale stem aff ex r is belied by documentary evidence demonstrating that mission had actual authority the engagement letter stem aff ex a states that mission shall  conduct a final sealed bid round the offering memorandum stem aff ex s describes the process wherein bidders would submit noncontingent final bids even if mission did not have actual authority there is no evidence that either botw or mission took any steps that would alert a reasonable bidder that botws auctioneer lacked authority c whether stonehill was ready willing and able to conclude the sale stonehill asserts without contradiction that it was ready to execute the lst a documentation and to wire a deposit as soon as botw forwarded it for execution the i  deposit was linked to execution of the agreement missions emailed acceptance of the bid stated that kuwayama would send an executable agreement by may i  and that stonehill was to execute it the next day and wire the  deposit kuwayama failed to send the draft agreement thereby precluding stonehill from performing its obligations on may   kuwayama requested a version of the lst a documention for use in the sale and indicated that he would send the documents by may   he failed to do so consequently stonehills obligation to execute an agreement and wire the deposit was never triggered    conclusion stonehill has shown that it was the highest bidder at auction that it was ready willing and able to perform its obligations that botw has failed to rebut stonehills prima facie case with evidence in admissible form that raises a genuine material issue of fact the motion will be granted accordingly it is hereby ordered that stonehills motion for summary judgment as to the first cause of action is granted and botws crossmotion for summary judgement dismissing the complaint is denied and it is further ordered that the judgement shall be entered in favor of stonehill and against botw settle judgement on ten  days notice this constitutes the decision and order of the court dated march   enter tvtd  peter sherwood jsc search this case google
