mar   am interesting it is something i will probably never run across most companies i have worked for are nowhere near that volume of datait would be many years before they came close to  petabyte my current company has an iseries with or historical data going back to  and we are only at  capacity of our tb of disk add my comment cancel    garry kranz   mar   am hi toddn the use of scaleout storage is on the rise i think qumulos builtin data analytics is a key differentiator esp in the era of big data add my comment cancel    toddn   mar   am id be curious as to what percent of todays businesses would be considered big data sounds like it may be the right direction if the trend continues that way this might just be a small portion of the market so they can adjust things as they grow as it does not effect the mainstream its kind of scary that i have twice the storage capacity for my pc as my company add my comment cancel    garry kranz   mar   am i think big data is still thought of mainly as complex data sets that require fast a high degree of analytics if you arent running hadoop clusters a large sql farm or oltp systems you may not have encountered big data and scaleout storage yet interesting what kind of storage area you running add my comment cancel    toddn   mar   am nothing like you mentioned just the standard default configuration for a ibm iseries
