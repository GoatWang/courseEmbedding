elementary school for boys in kindergarten through ninth grade located on the upper east side of manhattan the school draws just under  students from many new york city neighborhoods allenstevenson is large enough to offer a multifaceted educational experience and it is small enough to provide a personal atmosphere where each boy is known at allenstevenson there are many ways to be a boy and many ways to learn and grow our boys distinguish us allenstevenson specializes in building selfconfidence academic skills and character in a friendly and intellectually challenging environment we believe that it is an extraordinary school fulfilling a contemporary mission with a purposeful balance of academics athletics and the arts few schools for boys match the broad range of our educational program our very special emphasis on music and the other arts and our supportive development of the whole boy in addition to its rigorous academic standards the school recognizes the basic importance of ethical standards of conduct citizenship community service and mutual trust and respect all of which are conducive to effective teaching and successful learning an allenstevenson education fosters a boys natural intellectual curiosity about himself about his community and about the world as the schools video says at allenstevenson we believe that life is inherently interesting and that a good education unlocks its mysteries therefore we value openness to new ideas and selfconfidence without arrogance in the belief that such attitudes enable people to accept the world and explore new solutions to problems that face them we profess that everyone benefits from being part of a learning community with a diversity of backgrounds strengths experiences and viewpoints in a time when social roles may be changing allenstevenson attempts to foster in young men those skills and qualities that will help them deal creatively with change for example we prize collaboration as much as competition in all areas and value interpersonal skills teamwork sportsmanship and friendship along with the development of each individual the setting we cherish builds on failure as well as success striving always to create an atmosphere emotionally safe enough to allow boys to try new things to make mistakes and to learn from them we believe that education works best when teachers and parents work together for the good of each boy allenstevenson enables families not only to meet the early developmental and educational needs of their sons but also in close consultation with parents to have the choice of excellent and appropriate high school placements after th or th grades just as this strategic plan establishes goals and priorities for the schools future we intend to kindle in every boy a passion for excellence the proven foundation on which to build a productive adult life in the new century at heart allenstevenson aspires to establish a lifelong attitude of respect for learners
