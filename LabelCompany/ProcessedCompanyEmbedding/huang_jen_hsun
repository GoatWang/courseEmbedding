nvidia ceo sees future in cars and gaming qa  cnet mobile nvidia ceo sees future in cars and gaming qa ceo jenhsun huang explains to cnet why nvidia is no longer focusing on smartphones and why someone would pay  for a gpu by shara tibken may    pm pdt nvidia ceo jenhsun huang shows off the companys shield gaming device at nvidias headquarters in santa clara calif shara tibkencnet santa clara calif  nvidia is shifting gears again the company which has risen to prominence by creating graphic processing units or gpus for computers has long been looking for other avenues of growth it had sought to break into the smartphone and tablet business but has largely been shut out and is now looking at gaming devices and cars as its next big opportunity whatever the area nvidia needs to capitalize on it fast last year pc shipments posted their worstever drop of  percent according to gartner and the tech research firm expects shipments to drop more than  percent this year and fall again next year even as most smartphones passed on nvidias tegra chip it found its way into notable products like the xiaomi mi pad tablet and the first two versions of microsofts windows rtpowered surface tablet  but the latest reports suggest qualcomm will supply the chip for microsofts new smallerscreen surface instead of nvidia nvidia ceo jenhsun huang didnt want to talk about surface with cnet as much as the companys new strategy which he believes will pay off for the chipmaker the following is an edited transcript of our conversation which took place wednesday here at the companys headquartersq some reports say nvidia isnt targeting smartphones and tablets with tegra anymore has your strategy shifted see also cnets take on nvidia shield pcs sales may suck but people still are buying nvidia gpus nvidias ceo talks shield with cnet yes there will be future models microsoft surface event join us tuesday may  at  am pt live blog jenhsun huang the strategy has shifted but thats not quite right the reason for that is this first of all we see that mobile is not about phones only one of the most important mobile devices is a phone but mobile technology is revolutionizing products all over the placeits going to revolutionize tvs its going to revolutionize obviously computers but its also going to revolutionize games and cars and all kinds of stuff our strategy is to go and focus our energy on segments of mobile where we can add the most value the area where we can add the most value is visual computing graphics gpus etcin some phones visual computing is important but in a lot of phones visual computing is just not that important so what we wanted to do was focus on no  gaming where we can add a lot of value and we think gaming on android is going to be important were going to focus on car computers where visual computing and supercomputing technology is really important to the future of cars and then were going to focus our energy on segments of mobile computing segments of phones and tablets where computer graphics are really important are those gamingspecific devices or what do you meanhuang a gamingspecific device certainly is one example also settop boxes that are designed for gaming tablets where they would like to highlight gaming tablets where instead of just highlighting the design theyd also like to highlight the performance that goes hand in hand with gaming processors as performance if you want to build the porsche of tablets or phones were a fabulous partner for that thats why companies like xiaomi like working with us theyre reaching out to a technologyforward fan base does that mean were not going to see nvidia in smartphones you earlier said gaining share in smartphones was a matter of releasing a processor called tegra i that integrated g with your apps processor has that not workedhuang tegra i wasnt that successful for us i would say that when we first started this we thought that bringing g to entrylevel phones mainstream phones integrated with our apps processor would be a real opportunity i think that the phone marketplace has commoditized really really fast it is not our strategy to go after commodity phones it is not our strategy to go after mainstream devices but our strategy is to focus on performanceoriented visual computingoriented gamingoriented devices where we can add a lot of valuenvidias tegra processor powers cars such as the tesla audi and lamborghini pictured at nvidias santa clara calif headquarters shara tibkencnet of course if i said these things three years ago it would have sounded really strange and the reason for that is because cars werent really prevalent with computers inside and it wasnt a very large part of our strategy or a large part of our business now its growing significantly its a large part of our business now and youre seeing more and more android compute devices whether its game consoles or gaming devices in china from huawei or zte youre seeing devices that are highlighting their gaming and performance capabilities much morepeople are recognizing that in the google play store the no  download is games now all of a sudden theres a lot more discussion about android as a platform for gamingjust three years ago if i said these things all people wanted to focus on was phones now we have a lot more pillars of growth in mobile and were just not going to go focus on mainstream phoneswhy did tegra struggle in smartphoneshuang our focus as a company is still performanceoriented the mainstream phone market commoditized so fast that really thedifferentiators were price and you can see the pressure that mediatek is putting on qualcomm and you can see the pressure that mediatek is putting on marvell and broadcom and all of these companies because guess what theyre the lowestcost provider i think that for mainstream phones theres one strategy that really works right now which is price thats not our differentiator thats not what we do for a living will there be a tegra i or whatever you would call a chip that integrates g with an apps processorhuang we dont talk about future products but i also havent talked about ti you delayed tegra  for tegra i did that turn out to be a mistake did you miss this whole design cyclehuang i would say that tegra i didnt pan out we learned a lot in the process but there are many things in our company that didnt pan out thats ok if you want to be an innovative company you have to fail look we built a great chip lgs shipping it in the rest of the world outside the united states its a fantastic processor but from a business strategy it wasnt a success so i learned a lot from it its ok im glad i did it and now were moving on  nvidia shield so what did you learnhuang i think that i learned we are not a commodity player going after something that starts with mainstream should have discouraged us at the time it looked like our g solution was quite far ahead of the marketbut that windows closing very quickly were just not a cost playerwhats going on with microsofts surface are you still supplying chips for the tablethuang no commentbut im guessingsurface does mean more than one thing for example we werent in surface pro that was intel we werent in small phones that was qualcomm we were in a particular device theres going to be a whole lot of surface devices is my guess well try to win what we canin terms of gaming nvidia launched its shield device last year when you announced it you told cnet that you were already working on future versions of shield are you still working on new models when will we see them related links cnets take on the surface  pc shipments to sink  percent this year as tablets surge  gartner ds vita shield phone tablet which game handheld should you buy huang yeah there are plans for more shield devices the way to say it is obviously we have all kinds of exciting things we like to show but at the coreof this strategy shield is the platform that we will use to transform android into a great gaming platform we believe that android is an operating system that epitomizes the future of computingit is arguably the worlds best mobile operating system thats connected to the cloudcloud computing and mobile computing are intertwined in a way that cant be separated i also think that cloud connected to mobile and mobile connected to cloud is essential to the future of gaming as welland so if the computer platform is evolving into mobile and cloud theres no reason why we cant imagine that happening to gaming shield is our platform for making that possible to take video games and make them available in this new computing era shield in this first iteration is just a device but to me shield is a platform what are all the manifestations of this platform well just have to wait and see but the shield platform strategy is really about gaming and the cloud in other gaming topics there are reports you killed or delayed titan z your new highend gpuhuang no no thats sillinessso its still on timehuang yeah is a lot of money for a gpu what do you do to make sure that for someone who buys it its not irrelevant two or three years down the roadhuang in fact most of the customers that buy titan zs buy it every year do you anticipate that happening even with the  pricinghuang yeah and the reason for that is the people who buy titans and titan zs have an insatiable need for computing capability graphics computing capability so either they got tired of using just a p monitor and they just bought a k my titan all of a suddens not enough for a k monitor a  to  monitor i need something bigger to drive it so thats titan z  microsoft surface  windows rt close discuss nvidia ceo sees future in cars

 continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story this interview with jenhsun huang the president and chief executive of nvidia a maker of graphics chips was conducted and condensed by adam bryant q what’s it like to work at nvidia a let me tell you about the two elements that are our core values and that i most treasure and that i spent a lot of time nurturing one is the tolerance to take risks and the ability to learn from failure this ability to celebrate failure if you will needs to be an important part of any company that’s in a rapidly changing world and the second core value is intellectual honesty — the ability to call a spade a spade to as quickly as possible recognize that we’ve made a mistake that we’ve gone the wrong way and that we learn from it and quickly adjustthese came about because when nvidia was founded we were the first company of our kind but we rapidly almost went out of business it turned out the technology didn’t work at all we raised all this money we hired  people we built the technology and it just didn’t work i learned a lot about leadership during that timeq what did you learna i learned that it was ok for ceo’s to say that the strategy didn’t work that the technology didn’t work that the product didn’t work but we’re still going to be great and let me tell you why i think that’s what’s thrilling about leadership — when you’re holding onto literally the worst possible hand on the planet and you know you’re still going to win how are you still going to win because that’s when the character of the company really comes out advertisement continue reading the main story it was during the time that we really cultivated and developed what i consider to be our core values today i don’t think you can create culture and develop core values during great times i think it’s when the company faces adversity of extraordinary proportions when there’s no reason for the company to survive when you’re looking at incredible odds — that’s when culture is developed character is developed continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story i think culture is a big word for corporate character it’s the personality of the company and now the personality of our company simply says this if we think something is really worthwhile and we have a great idea and it’s never been done before but we believe in it it’s ok to take a chance it’s ok to try and if it doesn’t work learn from it adjust and keep failing forward and if you just fail forward all the time — learn fail learn fail learn fail — but every single time you’re making it better and better before you know it you’re a great companymistakes and failures are kind of the negative space around success right and if we could take enough shots at it we’re going to figure out what success is going to look likeq talk more about the intellectual honesty part of it a without intellectual honesty you can’t have a culture that’s willing to tolerate failure because people cling too much to an idea that likely will be bad or isn’t working and they feel like their reputation is tied up in it they can’t admit failure you end up putting too much into a bad idea and then you risk the entire enterpriseq what were the most important leadership lessons over the course of your life a let me start with what i believe to be good leadership traits that resonate for me i appreciate people who are authentic they are just who they are they don’t dress like a ceo because they think that’s what ceo’s dress like they don’t talk like ceo’s because that’s the way they think ceo’s talk they don’t conduct their meetings and expect people to treat them like ceo’s because that’s the way they think ceo’s are supposed to be treated they are just who they areand i like people who are able to call a spade a spade if something is right something’s right if something’s wrong something’s wrong and if something could be better it could be better i don’t want to be sold to all the time and i also believe that you manage with your skills but you have to lead with your heartyou can’t cause other people to fall in love with the work that you’re doing if you don’t love it yourself and so i think you can manage for better performance but you can’t manage for greatness you can’t manage your way into greatness you’ve got to lead your way into greatness and so you have to lead with your heartq what about when you were growing up a when i was in high school nothing gave me greater joy than computer games it was part of how i grew up maybe it’s because i grew up in the video game era but i’ve never beaten myself up about mistakes when i try something and it doesn’t turn out i go back and try it again advertisement continue reading the main story most of the time when you’re playing a game you’re losing you lose and lose and lose until you beat it that’s kind of how the game works right it’s feedback and then eventually you beat it photo jenhsun huang is president and ceo of nvidia a maker of graphics chips in santa clara calif he says restaurant work taught him how to deal with chaos credit dan nevillethe new york times as it turns out the most fun parts of a game are when you’re losing when you finally beat it there’s a moment of euphoria but then it’s over maybe it’s because i grew up in that generation i have the ability to take chances which leads to the ability to innovate and try new things those are important life lessons that came alongq any experiences in your teens or early s that prepared you for leadershipa i was a very good student and i was always focused and driven but i was very introverted i was incredibly shy the one experience that pulled me out of my shell was waiting tables at denny’s i was horrified by the prospect of having to talk to people you want customers to always be right but customers can’t always be right you have to find compromises for circumstances that are happening all the time and you have difficult situations you have mistakes that you make you have the mistakes that the kitchen makes newsletter sign up continue reading the

newsletters see sample manage email preferences not you privacy policy opt out or contact us anytime you can’t control the environment most of the time and so you’re making the best of a state of chaos which was a wonderful learning experience for meq talk about how your leadership style has evolveda i probably give fewer answers and i ask a lot more questions it’s not possible for the ceo to know everything but it is possible for us to add value to just about everything and the reason for that is if you’re the ceo you’re probably better at looking around corners than most you probably have better intuition than most you’re probably able to see the forest better than most you’re probably able to deal with complexity better than most and so you bring a perspective that is uniqueby asking the right questions you can get to the heart of the issue right away it’s almost possible now for me to go through a day and do nothing but ask questions and have my sensibility my perspective and what’s important to me be perfectly clear to everybody without making a statement at allq the perception that many people have of ceo’s is that they have all the answersa there’s no way that i can be as deep in all of the areas as the people on my management team nor is it important it’s more important that through probing i help them realize that they could achieve even more than they thought they could achieve it is probably more important that through questions you cause them to explore ideas that they didn’t realize needed to be explored as the ceo you’re trying to make a great idea betterq what about hiringa there are three characteristics that i think are directly related to success the first is to be able to fall in love with something maybe it’s related to what you’re passionate about the capacity to fall in love is so important to successful people the second one is the capacity to take chances and make mistakes and the third is just to see the world through a child’s eye you know to ask “what if what if we could do this” all of the great ideas are kind of “hey what if we could do this”q let’s say you’re interviewing me for a job how are you going to find out if i have those three qualities advertisement continue reading the main story a well first of all if you use words like love — “i love doing this” — you can just tell when somebody’s passionate about something the second thing is i’ll ask you about one of your greatest failures tell me about something where you just shanked into the woods what happened how’d you deal with it how’d you get back into the gameand the third one is i’ll ask somebody to just teach me something they’ll get on the whiteboard i’ll start saying things like “what if you did that” people who are really receptive to brainstorming and creativity will say “huh that’s interesting well what if we did that”somebody who doesn’t like criticism will say “that’s been tried it doesn’t work” so those people just tend not to be good collaboratorsq and so with those three screens what’s your batting average in hiringa i think hiring great people remains extremely extremely hard the reason for that is this you can never really tell how somebody deals with adversity — whether it’s adversity that’s created by the environment or adversity that you’re creating for them when you have a difficult situation and you need somebody to take it and run with it some people just take it and make it work they feed on adversity some people see adversity and they just cower as talented as they areq when you’re interviewing somebody is there any way you get at thata it’s really tough you could ask them about the adversity they had in the past but you never really know the intensity of that adversity there are some people who in the face of adversity become more calm when the world is just falling apart i actually think my heart rate goes down i find that i think best when i’m under adversitymaybe it’s denny’s as a

pascalbased gpus one of our most successful launches ever we also benefited from both the winding adoption of deep learning and our expanding engagement with hyperscale datacenters around the world as they apply deep learning to all the services they provide revenue continued to accelerate rising  to a record  billion we saw strong sequential and yearonyear growth across our four platforms gaming professional visualization datacenter and automotive our business model based on driving gpu compute platforms into highly targeted markets is clearly succeeding the gpu business was up  to  billion from a year ago the tegra processor business increased  to  million in q our four platforms contributed nearly  of revenue up from  a year earlier and  in the preceding quarter they collectively increased  yearoveryear lets begin with our gaming platform gaming revenue increased  yearonyear to  million reflecting the success of our latest integration of pascalbased gpus demand was strong in every geographic region the pascal architecture offers a number of amazing technological advances and enables unprecedented performance and efficiencies for playing sophisticated aaa gaming titles and driving rich immersive vr experiences in our most successful launch ever we introduced four major products they are geforce gtx   and  for the enthusiast market and the titan x the worlds fastest consumer gpu for deep learning development digital content creation and extreme gaming wired magazine called the gtx  an unprecedented piece of electronic precision one that performs herculean feats of computational strength forbes called gtx  which brings a premium vr experience within reach of many a fantastic product and hardware canucks described titan x as a technological tour de force with frame rates that are simply mindboggling the gtx    and titan x are now in full production and available to consumers worldwide vrs potential is on vivid display in a new open source game that we released during the quarter available on steam nvidia vr funhouse is an open source title created with our gamesworks sdk it integrates physical simulation into vr along with amazing graphics and precise haptics that you feel like youre actually out at carnival moving to professional visualization quadro revenue grew to a record  million up  yearonyear and up  sequentially growth came from the highend of the market for realtime rendering tools and mobile workstations the m gpu  gig launched earlier this year is drawing strong interest from a broad range of customers digital domain a leading specialeffects studio is using quadro to accelerate productivity for its work on films and commercials which requires especially tight turnaround times engineering giant aecom and the yale school of architecture are using quadro to accelerate their design and engineering workflows last month at siggraph conference we introduced a series of new products that embed photorealistic and immersive experience into workflows incorporating iray and vr we launched the pascalbased quadro p the most advanced workstation gpu enabling designers to manipulate complex designs up to twice as fast as before we demonstrated how deep learning is being brought to the realm of the industrial design to create better products faster and we launched eight new and updated software libraries such as vrworks  video sdk which brings panoramic video to vr moving to datacenter revenue reached a record  million more than doubling yearonyear and up  sequentially this impressive performance reflects strong growth in supercomputing hyperscale datacenters and grid virtualization interest in deep learning is surging as industries increasingly seek to harness this revolutionary technology hyperscale companies remain fast adopters of deep learning both for training and realtime inference particularly for natural lingual processing video and image analysis among them are facebook microsoft amazon alibaba and baidu major cloud providers are also offering gpu computing for their customers microsoft azure is now using nvidias gpus to provide computing and graphics virtualization during the quarter we began shipping tesla p the worlds most advanced gpu accelerator based on the pascal architecture designed to accelerate deep learning training it allows application performance to scale up to eight gpus using our nvlink interconnect we also announced a variant of p based on pci express that makes it suitable for a wide range of accelerated servers at our gpu technology conference in april we introduced dgx the worlds first deep learning supercomputer equipped with eight ps in a single box it provides deep learning performance that is equivalent to  traditional servers it comes loaded with nvidia software and ai application developers we are seeing strong interest in dgx from ar researchers and developers across academia government labs and large enterprises two days ago jenhsun handdelivered the very first dgx production model to the open ai institute they plan to use this system in part to build autonomous agents like chatbots cars and robots broader deliveries will commence later this quarter we will be talking more about deep learning later this year at regional versions of our gpu technology conference set for eight cities around the world among them beijing amsterdam tokyo and seoul as well as washington dc our grid graphics virtualization business more than doubled in the quarter adoption is accelerating across a variety of industries particularly automotive and aec among customers out of this quarter was statoil a norwegian oil and gas company finally in automotive revenue increased to a record  million up  yearoveryear and up  sequentially driven by premium infotainment and digital cockpit features in mainstream cars our effort to help partners develop selfdriving cars continues to accelerate we have started to ship our drive px  automotive supercomputer to the plus companies using both our hardware and driveworks software to develop autonomous driving technologies we remain on track to ship our autopilot solution based on the drive platform beyond our four platforms our oem and ip business was  million down  yearonyear in line with mainstream pc demand now turning to the rest of the income statement we had record gaap gross margin of  while nongaap gross margin was  these reflect the strength of our geforce gaming gpus the success of our platform approach and strong demand for deep learning gaap operating expenses were  million down  from a year earlier nongaap operating expenses were  million up  from a year earlier this reflects increased hiring in rd and marketing expenses partially offset by lower legal fees gaap operating income for the second quarter was  million compared to  million a year earlier nongaap operating income was  million up  nongaap operating margins improved  basis points from a year ago to  now turning to the outlook for the third quarter of fiscal  we expect revenue to be  billion plus or minus  our gaap and nongaap gross margins are expected to be  and  respectively plus or minus  basis points gaap operating expenses are expected to be approximately  million nongaap operating expenses are expected to be approximately  million and gaap and nongaap tax rates for the third quarter of fiscal  are both expected to be  plus or minus  further financial details are included in the cfo commentary and other information available on our ir website we will now open the call for questions operator could you please poll for questions thank you operator questionandanswer session operator and your first question comes from the line of mark lipacis mark lipacis  jefferies llc hi thanks for taking my questions first question on the datacenter business can you help us understand to what extent is the demand being driven by the deep learning applications versus the classic computationally intense design applications jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director sure mark our datacenter business is comprised of three basic markets as youre alluding to one is highperformance computing and one could say that or characterize it as a traditional supercomputing market and very computationally intensive our second market is grid which is our datacenter virtualization basically graphics application virtualization you could stream and serve any pc or any pc application from datacenter to any client device and the third application is deep learning and this is largely our hyperscale datacenters applying deep learning to enhance their applications to make them much smarter much more delightful the vast majority of the growth comes from deep learning by far and the reason for that is because highperformance computing is a relatively stable business its still growing business and i expect the highperformance computing to do quite well over the coming years grid is a fastgrowing business i think colette said that it was growing  year overyear but its from a much smaller base and deep learning is not only significant in size its also growing quite substantially mark lipacis  jefferies llc thats very helpful thank you and then last question on the new – so youre just starting to ship pascal now and i guess my understanding is that historically as youre shipping the new product the yields have opportunity for improvement and the more volume is shipped the more you climb down the yield curve what classically happens here on the yield and does that positively impact gross margins over the next three or four quarters thank you jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director yeah so weve talked extensively about the way we prepare for new process nodes over the last several years for longterm nvidia followers you might have recalled that nanometer was a very challenging node for us and then with all of these challenges its an opportunity for us to improve our company and weve implemented a very rigorous process node preparation methodology and it starts of course with some of the worlds best process design engineers circuit design engineers and process readiness teams and we have a fantastic group dedicated to just getting process ready for us and the second part of it is just how that process readiness is integrated throughout the entire company and so im really proud of the way that the company executed on pascal nanometer finfet is no trivial task not to mention the speed of the memories that we used its the worlds first gx we also ramped the worlds first hbm memory and d memory stacking so the number of technological challenges that we overcame in the ramp of pascal is quite extraordinary im super proud of the team now going forward were going to continue to refine yields and that is absolutely the case however we came into nanometer with a great deal of preparedness and so its too early to guess whats going to happen to yields and margins long term but well guide one quarter at a time operator and your next question comes from the line of toshiya hari toshiya hari  goldman sachs  co hi thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a very strong quarter your q revenue guide implies further acceleration on a yearoveryear basis are there one or two end markets where you expect outsized growth or should we expect growth in the quarter to be broadbased jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director yeah toshiya i appreciate it were experiencing growth in all of our businesses our strategy of focusing on deep learning selfdriving cars gaming and virtual reality these are markets where gpu makes a very significant difference is really paying off and i think this quarter is really the first quarter where we saw growth across every single one of our businesses and my expectation is that were going to see growth across all of our businesses next quarter as well but its driven by the focus on these key markets and away from traditional commodity components businesses i think the one particular dynamic sticks out and its a very significant growth driver of where we have an extraordinary position in and its deep learning deep learning you may have heard is a new computing approach its a new computing model and requires a new computing architecture and this is where the parallel approach of gpus is perfectly suited and five years ago we started to invest in deep learning quite substantially and we made fundamental changes and enhancements for deep learning across our entire stack of technology from the gpu architecture to the gpu design to the systems that gpus connect into for example nvlink to other system software that has been designed for it like cudnn and digits to all of the deep learning experts that we have now in our company the last five years weve quietly invested in deep learning because we believe that the future of deep learning is so impactful to the entire software industry the entire computer industry that we if you will pushed it all in and now we find ourselves at the epicenter of this very important dynamic and it is probably – if there is one particular growth factor that is of great significance it would be deep learning operator and your next question comes from the line of vivek arya vivek arya  bank of america merrill lynch thank you for taking my question and congratulations on good growth and the execution jenhsun the first question is tied to pc gaming very strong trends i was curious if you could quantify how much of your base has upgraded to pascal and have you noticed any change in the behavior of gamers in this upgrade cycle whether its the price or what part of the stack they are buying now and how quickly theyre refreshing versus what you might have seen in the kepler and the maxwell cycles jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director sure thanks a lot vivek lets say on pc gaming theres a few dynamics our installed base represents somewhere around  million active geforce users around the world and in fact only about a third has even upgraded to maxwell and we only started shipping pascal half of this last quarter and so that gives you a sense of how much – and pascal is unquestionably the biggest leap weve ever made generationally in gpus ever it is not only highperformance its also energyefficient and it includes some really exciting new graphics technologies for vr and others and so i think pascal is going to be enormously successful for us and it comes at a time when the pc gaming marketplace is also quite different than the pc gaming market five years ago one dynamic thats really quite powerful is that the production quality the production content is much much higher in video games today than ever and the reason for that id mentioned several times in previous calls is that the installed base of capable game platforms that are architecturally compatible meaning that playstation  and xbox one and pcs are essentially architecturally compatible and so the footprint for developers has grown tremendously over previous generations i mean this is a dynamic thats relatively new and so as a result the quality of games go up which means that the consumption of gpu capability goes up with it and i think were absolutely seeing that dynamic im super excited about the fact that the nextgeneration game console the big boost the x boost is coming just around the corner thats going to allow game content providers game developers to aim even higher and i think that thats going to support longterm expansion of our gross margins and asps of pc gaming i would say that theres some other dynamics that are quite powerful as well as you know very well which is esports is no longer just an interest esports is a fullforce global phenomenon and very very powerful in asia in just about every developing country and of course the western world as well and i think that on top of that not only is vr off to a great start were seeing some right content now but some of the things that we introduced recently with pascal tapping into this grassroots but rather global interest in using videogame as an art medium we introduced project nvidia ansel which is the worlds first ingame photography system it allows you to create virtual reality photographs and its just really really amazing and so you could use your videogame capture your amazing moments share it in vr or in highres with all your friends so theres a lot of different ways to enjoy games now and the production value just continues to go up which is great for our platforms and so i think just to summarize your initial question how much of the installed base has upgraded to pascal very very small of course because we just started production ramp but even then only a third has upgraded to maxwell and so theres its a pretty large pretty significant upgrade opportunity ahead of us operator and your next question comes from the line of stephen chin stephen chin  ubs securities llc hi thanks for taking my questions jenhsun the first one if i could on the datacenter competitive landscape early this week we saw one of your datacenter competitors make an acquisition of a smaller private company and i was wondering if you could talk a bit more about how you view your position in the datacenter market as with respect to machine learning ai and also kind of how your products are positioned from a highend or lowend type of machine learning application performance jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director sure thanks well as you can imagine we have a good pulse on the state of the industry weve been in this industry since the very beginning and deep learning was really ignited when pioneering researchers around the world discovered the use of gpus to accelerate deep learning and made it practical made it even practical to use deep learning as an approach for developing software the gpu was a perfect match because the nature of the gpu is a sea of small processors not one big processor but a whole bunch of small processors and vitally theyre connected by this connecting tissue this connecting tissue inside our processor connecting memory connecting fabric that makes it possible for the processors to communicate with each other all simultaneously that architectural innovation has been the source of our gpu computing initiative some  years ago that invention has really been groundbreaking and so the gpu was really quite a perfect match for deep learning where neural nets are communicating neurons essentially inspired by neurons communicating with each other all simultaneously and so the gpu was really quite a perfect match if you look at deep learning today five years later i think its a foregone conclusion that deep learning has been infused into just about every single internet service to make them smarter more intelligent more delightful to consumers and so you could see that the hyperscale adoption of deep learning is not only broad its largescale and its completely global and this new computing approach we realized was going to be quite significant longterm and so five years ago we started making quite significant investments across the entire stack of our company gpu computing is not just the gpu chip its gpu architecture its the gpus design its the gpu system all of the algorithms that run on top of it all of the tools that run on top of it the frameworks our collaborations with researchers all over the world and so that collaboration and our investment has improved deep learning on gpus dramatically in the last two generations when we started this we were in kepler maxwell was some  times better than kepler and pascal is some  times better than maxwell and so in just two generations just five years time weve improved deep learning by an enormous amount and a gpu today is very unlike a gpu back in the good old days because of all the work that weve done to it now our strategy and this is where were different not only to focus on the gpu and the expertise in parallel computing but where were really different i would say is our singular architecture approach to deep learning weve essentially put all of our investment behind one architecture weve made this architecture available from hyperscale to datacenters to workstations to notebooks to pcs to cars to embedded computers to even a brandnew fully integrated highperformance computer in a box we called dgx the nvidia dgx and so theres so many different ways to gain access to the nvidia architecture the nvidia platform for deep learning theyre just literally all over the place all around you its available to you in retail stores in etail stores from oems in the cloud or even in universities all over the world just in embedded computer kits and so our approach is quite singular and quite focused my sense is that our lead is quite substantial and our position is very good but were not sitting on our laurels as you can tell and for the last five years weve been investing quite significantly and so over the next several years i think youre going to continue to see quite significant jumps from us as we continue to advance in this area operator and your next question comes from the line of romit shah romit j shah  nomura securities international inc yes thank you i had a question on automotive you mentioned that drive px is now shipping to  car companies jenhsun im kind of curious are the wins here sort of similar in size and focused more on prototyping or are there opportunities here that could ultimately translate into full production wins and drive the automotive business disproportionately jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director well i appreciate the question yeah weve just started this quarter shipping drive px  and just before i answer your question let me tell you what drive px  is drive px  of course is a processor its the drive px  version with just one single processor with just parker and our tegra processor and optionally with discrete gpus you could literally build – you can build a car with autopilot capability or an ai copilot capability all the way to selfdriving car capability and it is able to do sensor fusion its able to do slam which is localization and mapping detection using deep neural nets of the environment in a surround matter all of the cameras around the car all feeding into the processor and the drive px processor doing realtime inferencing of surround cameras all the way to the actual planning and driving of the car all done in this one car computer this one car ai supercomputer and so this quarter we started shipping them to all of our partners and developers so that they can start developing their software and their systems around our computer and on top of our software stack we have the intentions of shipping in volume production many of these and its hard to know exactly what everybodys schedule is but it ranges everything from very soon to the next couple of years developing a selfdriving car is no – its a fairly significant undertaking and so nobody does it for fun surely and the question is maybe if i could frame the question just slightly differently do i expect people to be building oem cars or do we expect them to be building shuttles that are maybe geofenced do we expect them to be building trucks and you know how many trucks are on the road and how much of the worlds economy is built around trucking products all over the world to services of basically taxi as a service the answer is that were working with customers and partners across that entire range from cars that are sold to trucks to vans to shuttles to services operator and your next question comes from the line of craig ellis craig a ellis  b riley  co llc yeah thanks for taking the question the first is just a follow up on some of the gaming strength in the quarter with the company launching the founders edition availability of gaming products in the quarter can you talk about how that went and for those products how gross margins compare to just chip bait chip bait sales that would go into a gaming card oem jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director well first of all founders edition i appreciate you asking that founders edition is engineered by nvidia completely built by nvidia and sold directly by nvidia and supported by nvidia now there are some people that – some gamers and customers who would prefer to have a direct relationship with our company its availability is limited and its engineered just at the highest possible level of quality and we limit the production of it and the reason for that is because we have a network of partners who are much much more able to take the nvidia architecture to every corner of the world literally overnight we have a fair number of partners who blanket every single country on the planet as we know and they can provide them in different sizes and shapes and styles and different thermal solutions and different configurations and different price points and so i think we believe that that diversity is one of the reasons why the nvidia geforce platform is so popular and it creates a lot of excitement in the marketplace and a lot of interesting different diversified designs and so i think those two strategies are harmonious with each other but the key point is we built the founders edition really as a way for some customers to be able to purchase directly and have a relationship directly with us but largely our strategy is to go to the market with a network of partners as for gross margins they are marginally the same operator and your next question comes from the line of matt ramsay matthew d ramsay  canaccord genuity inc yes good afternoon thank you jenhsun i wanted to ask a couple of questions again on the datacenter business the first being weve done a little bit of work trying to estimate in our team what the longterm server attach rate for accelerators in general could be and for gpus within that so itd be really interesting to hear your perspectives on that and then secondly is there a market there for an aputype product in the datacenter i know you guys have project denver and some other things going on from the cpu perspective but is there a deep learning integrated cpugpu play that might open up more tam long term for your company that you guys are considering pursuing thank you jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director sure yeah first of all the type of workloads in the datacenter is really changed back in the good old days it largely ran database searches but that has changed so much its no longer just about text its no longer just about data the vast majority of whats going through the internet and whats going through datacenters today as you guys know very well are images there are voice there an increasingly and probably one of the most important new data formats is live video live video if you think about it for just a moment its live video so it doesnt stay in the server and it doesnt get recorded which means that if you want to enjoy that live video there needs to be a fair amount of artificial intelligence capability in the datacenter thats running real time on their live video so that the person that might be interested in the video stream that youre streaming knows who to alert and who to invite to come and watch the live video and so if you think about datacenter traffic going forward my sense is that the workload is going to continue to be increasingly high throughput increasingly high multimedia content and increasingly of course powered by ai and powered by deep learning and so i think thats number one the second is that the architecture of the datacenter is recognizably understandably changing because the workload is changing deep learning is a very different workload than the workload of the past and so the architecture its a new computing model it recognized it needs a new computing architecture and accelerators like gpus are really well a good fit and so now the question is how much its hard to say its hard to say how much but my sense is that its going to be a lot and without any predictions its going to be a lot more than we currently ship and so i think the growth opportunity for deep learning is quite significant i think every hyperscale datacenter will be gpu accelerated they will be gpu accelerated for training they will be gpu accelerated for inferencing there may be other approaches but i think using gpus is going to be a very large part of that and then lastly apus i guess for datacenters i guess my sense is for datacenters energy efficiency is such a vital part and although the workload is increasingly ai and increasingly live video and multimedia where gpus can add a lot of value theres still a lot of workload that is gpucentric and you still want to have an extraordinary cpu and i dont think anybody would argue that intel makes the worlds best cpus its not even close theres not even a close second and so i think the artfulness of and the craftsmanship of intel cpus is pretty hard to deny and for most datacenters i think if you have cpu workloads anyways i think intel xeons are hard to beat and so thats my opinion anyways operator and your next question comes from the line of ian ing ian l ing  mkm partners llc yes thank you so earlier you talked about taping out all the pascal products at this point i mean are you – with three products on the market are you ceding the sub price point for cards to competition or is this something you can serve with older maxwell product or some upcoming product thanks jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director yeah thanks a lot ian we have taped out we have verified we have ramped every pascal gpu thats right however we have not introduced everyone operator and your next question comes from the line of steve smigie j steven smigie  raymond james  associates inc great thanks a lot for the question i just wanted to follow up a little bit on virtual reality you guys have talked a little bit about investments there and i was just curious what sort of reception youre getting at this point and whats going to be in your mind the biggest driver getting that going is it more headsets or more developers working on that thank you jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director yeah steve i think its all of that we have to continue to keep pushing vr and get the head mounts out to the world i think htc vive theyre doing a great job oculus of course are doing a great job and so i think we track very carefully all of the head mounts that are going out there and its growing all the time second the content is really cool and people are really enjoying it and so we just got to get more content and developers all over the world are jumping on to vr it really is a great new experience but its not just games as you know one of the areas where we have a lot of success and we see a lot of excitement is in enterprise and in industrial design in medicines medical imaging in architectural engineering we use it ourselves were doing a fair amount of design of our workspace and we render everything using our photorealistic renderer called iray fully accelerated by our gpus and then we render it into vr and we enjoy it completely in vr and its something else to be inside an environment thats photorealistically rendered and completely enjoying in vr so architectural engineering and construction is going to benefit from that so we see a lot of broadbased adoption of vr now one of the things that we did which was really spectacular is the multiresolution multiprojection rendering of pascal its the worlds first gpu architecture that has the ability to render into multiple projections simultaneously instead of just one and the reason for that is because the gpu back in the good old days was designed for displaying into one display you have one keyboard you have one display but that mode of computer graphics has really changed as we moved into the world of virtual reality and all kinds of interesting different display configurations and display types and so multiprojection was a revolutionary approach to graphics and pascal introduced it and you really benefit it in vr the second thing that we did was we integrated real world physics simulation into vr the benefit is that without the laws of physics as you know you cant feel anything things dont collide things dont bounce when you pick up something you dont feel the haptics of it we have made the entire environment physically simulated and so as a result you feel the entire environment when you tip a bottle of water over it behaves like a bottle of water tipped over and balls behave the way balls behave and things dont merge into each other so that integration with haptics is going to completely revolutionize vr we believe and that physics simulation is another thing and so i think our position in vr is really quite great and im certainly enthusiastic about the development of vr operator and your next question comes from the line of vijay rakesh vijay r rakesh  mizuho securities usa inc hi guys thanks just on the datacenter side jenhsun you mentioned three key segments hpc grid and deep learning what percent of mix are those for the datacenter jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director i would say its about half deep learning at the moment and probably call it  a third is highperformance computing maybe more than that and the rest of it is virtualization and going forward which is part of your question my sense is that deep learning would become a very significant part of that the other thing to realize is that deep learning is not just for internet service providers for voice recognition and image recognition and face recognition and such deep learning is a way of using mathematics using software to discover insight in a huge amount of data and the one place where we regenerate a huge amount of data is highperformance computing every single supercomputing center in the world is going to move towards deep learning and the reason for that is because they generate a huge amount of data that they really have very little ability to comb through to sort through and now with deep learning they can discover really really subtle insights in data thats hyperdimensional and so the way to think about deep learning is really mathematics its a new form of mathematics that is very very powerful its a new approach to software but dont think of it as a market i think every market is going to be a deep learning market i think every application is going to be deep learning application and i think software every piece of software will be infused by ai for longterm operator and your next question comes from the line of harlan sur harlan sur  jpmorgan securities llc good afternoon and solid job on the quarterly execution you guys had really good growth in professional visualization and record revenues i wouldve thought that most of the growth was being driven by the upcoming release of the pascalbased p and p family so i was sort of pleasantly surprised that most of the demand was driven by your current generation m family which means obviously that the pascal demand cycle is kind of still ahead of you number one is that a fair view and then whats driving the strong adoption of m and if you havent already released it when do you expect to launch the pascalbased p and p family thank you jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director yeah thanks harlan i appreciate the question the team has been working really hard over the years to really change the way that computeraided design is done your observation is absolutely right and its coming from several different places first of all more and more design is really about product design industrial design where the feeling of the product the aesthetics of the product is just as important as the mechanical design of the product and whether youre talking about a building or just a consumer product or a car we need to be able to simulate the aesthetics of it in a photorealistic way using real material simulations the computational load necessary to do that is just really quite extraordinary and were now seeing one design package after another whether its dassaults leading packages solidworks leading packages autodesk adobe the amount of gpu use has really really increased and its increasing quite dramatically i think partly because finally for all of the isvs for all the developers not only is the market demand for earlier views of photorealistic designs an important decision criteria they can also rely on the fact that great gpus are available in just about every computer and so the pervasiveness of gpus allows them to take advantage of the gpus and to really trust that the software capabilities that theyve put into their packages if they rely on gpus will have the benefits of gpus there and so i think that that virtuous cycle youre starting to see in design and so the investment that we made in the photorealistic rendering several years ago the gpu acceleration of optics this layer for pathtracing that is used by just about every software package in the world our continued evangelism of gpus and its general purpose use from computer graphics all the way to imaging is something that i think is starting to see benefits thats number one number two maxwell was the most energyefficient gpu ever made until pascal maxwell was twice the energy efficiency of kepler and the amazing thing is that pascal is twice the energy efficiency of maxwell but maxwell made it possible for thin and light designs and laptops and more elegant workstations and the ability to put more horsepower more capability into any workstation because of power concerns maxwell made it possible for the entire industry to uplift the level of gpu that it uses and i think that going forward your last question is going forward how do we see pascal pascal is in the process of ramping into workstations all over the world and so i think in the coming quarters were going to expect to see pascal out there and my expectation is that the dynamics i just described which is software developers using more photorealistic capabilities our invention of gpuaccelerated photorendering iray and optix and mdl material description language and then lastly the energy efficiency of gpus those three factors combined is going to be really healthy for workstations and then last vr vr is coming and in order to really enjoy the type of applications for design youre going to need a pretty powerful gpu to support it operator and your next question comes from the line of ross seymore ross c seymore  deutsche bank securities inc hi guys thanks for letting me ask a question couple for you jenhsun on the automotive side i guess the first part would be weve seen in the recent months some partnerships being formed with some of your competitors and some of your customers and weve seen some of those partnerships actually dissolve so i wondered how does nvidia play in this general ecosystem in forming partnerships or not and then the second part if we put even just a rough year on it when would you think the autonomous driving part of your automotive business would actually exceed the infotainment size of your automotive business thank you jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director yeah thanks a lot ross well we play in a graceful friendly and open way and i mean that i guess rather seriously we believe this we believe that building a autonomous driving car a self driving car is a pile of software and its really complicated software its really really complicated software and its not like one company is going to do it and its also not logical that large great companies who are refining their algorithms and the capabilities of their selfdriving cars over the course of the next two decades can outsource to someone the selfdriving car stack weve always felt that selfdriving cars is a software problem and that large companies need to be able to own their own destiny and thats the reason why drive px  is an openstack and its an open platform so that every car company can build their selfdriving car on top of it number one number two the drive px  architecture is scalable and the reason for that is because automatic braking and autopilot on an highway and a virtual copilot and a completely autonomous selfdriving car a selfdriving truck a geofenced autonomous shuttle a completely autonomous taxi all of these platforms cannot be solved by one chip its just not even logical the computation necessary to do it is so diverse and the more digits of accuracy or the more digits of precision towards safety that you would like to have in dealing with all of the unexpected circumstances the more nines you would like to have if you will the more computation you have to do just as voice recognition the amount of computation necessary for voice recognition over the last just four years or five years has increased by a  times but notice how precise and how accurate voice recognition has become and image recognition circumstance recognition context recognition all of that is going to require just an enormous amount of computation and so we believe that scalable platforms is necessary number two and then number three detection computer vision and detection object detection is just one tiny sliver of the entire autonomous driving problem its just one tiny sliver and weve always said that autonomous vehicles selfdriving cars is really an ai computing problem its a computing problem because the processors needs not just detection but also computation the cpu matters the gpu matters the entire system architecture matters and so the entire computation engine matters number two computing is not just a chip problem its largely a software problem and the body of software necessary for the entire system software stack if you would the operating system of a selfdriving realtime supercomputer doesnt exist most supercomputers are besteffort supercomputers they run a job as fast as they can until theyre done but thats not good enough for a selfdriving car this supercomputer has to run in real time and it has to react the moment it sees that there is danger in the way and best effort doesnt cut it you need it to be a realtime supercomputer and the worlds never built a realtime supercomputer before and thats what drive px  is all about a realtime supercomputer for surround autonomous ai and so thats the focus that we have thats the direction that weve taken and i think what youre seeing is that the market is trying to react to that but maybe as they go further and further into autonomous driving that theyre discovering that the problems are related to the type of problems that were seeing and thats the reason why drive px is a computer not a smart camera operator and your next question comes from the line of joseph moore joseph moore  morgan stanley  co llc great thank you so much you talked about deep learning in the hyperscale environment but it seems like youre getting some traction as well in the enterprise environment i know at least one it department weve talked to has been doing some implementation can you talk a little bit about your progress there and what does it take for you to sort of build that presence within more traditional enterprises jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director well as you know deep learning is not just an internet service approach deep learning is really machine learning supercharged and deep learning is really about discovering insight in big data in big unstructured data in multidimensional data and thats what deep learning – thats the – ive called it its thors hammer that fell from the sky and its amazing technology that these researchers discovered and we were incredibly incredibly well prepared because gpus is naturally parallel and we put us in a position to really be able to contribute to this new computing revolution but when you think about it in the context that its just – its software development its a new method of doing software and its a new way of discovering insight from data what company wouldnt need it so every life sciences company needs it every healthcare company needs it every energy discovery company needs it every etail retail company needs it everybody has lots of data everybody has lots and lots of data that they own themselves every manufacturing company needs it every company that cares about security every company that deals with the massive amount of customer data has the benefit of – can benefit from deep learning so when you frame it in that context i think i would say that deep learnings market opportunity is even greater in enterprises than it is in consumer internet services and thats exactly the reason why we built the nvidia dgx because most of these enterprises dont have the expertise or simply dont have the willpower to want to build a supercomputing datacenter or highperformance computer they would just rather buy an appliance if you will with all of the software integrated and the performance incredibly well tuned and it comes out of a box and thats essentially what nvidia dgx is its a supercomputer in a box and its designed and tuned for high performance computing for deep learning operator and your next question comes from the line of ambrish srivastava ambrish srivastava  bmo capital markets united states hi thank you very much for squeezing me in i had a question just one question on gross margin jenhsun very big top line guidance but yet gross margin is guided to flat what is the reason and i understand its not always perfectly correlated margin should be going up that much but is it pricing is it yield because the mix also seems to be moving in the right direction more provis more hpc and less of the oem business jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director well our guidance is our best estimate and well know how everything turns out next quarter when we talk again but at some high level i would agree with you that as we move further and further and more and more into our platform approach of business where our platform is specialized and rich with software that increasingly the value of the product that we bring has extraordinary enterprise value that the benefits of using it is not just measured in frames per second but real tco for companies and real cost savings as they reduce the number of server clusters and real increases and real boosts in their productivity and so i think theres every reason to believe that longterm this platform approach can derive a greater value but as for the next quarter i think lets just wait and see how it goes operator and your next question comes from the line of rajvindra gill rajvindra s gill  needham  co llc thank you jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director rajvindra how are you rajvindra s gill  needham  co llc sir exactly good a question jenhsun on the drive px  so my understanding as you described it its one scalable architecture from the cockpit to adas to mapping to autonomous driving but im curious to see how that kind of compares to the approach that some of your competitors are taking with respect to providing i guess different solutions for different levels of the adas systems whether its level  level  level  specifically with the vx communication where for level  autonomous driving youre going to need six to  different radar units three to six different cameras lidar im just trying to square how your approach is different from some of your competitors in the semiconductor space jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director yeah good question theres no way to square and theres no reason to square and youre not going to find one answer and the reason why youre not going to find one answer is because nobody knows exactly how to get it done we all have intuitions and we all have beliefs about how were going to be able to ultimately solve the longterm fully autonomous vehicle that wherever i am the car i step into the automobile we step into is completely autonomous and it has ai inside and out and its just an incredible experience but were not there yet and all of these companies have slightly – not all but many companies have slightly different visions of the future some people believe that the path to the future is fully autonomous right away in a geofenced area that has been fully mapped in advance some people believe that you can use it just for highway autopilot as a first starting point and work quickly towards fully autonomy some people believe that the best way to do that is through shuttles and trucks so you see a lot of different visions out there and i think all of those visions are coming from smart people doing smart things and theyre targeting different aspects of transportation i think theres a fallacy that transportation in every single country in every single form is exactly the same it just doesnt work that way and so theres technology insight and then theres market insight and theres a technology vision versus your entry point and i think thats where all of the squaring doesnt happen and so youre solving for problems that – youre solving for a simple equation that wont happen however theres one thing that we believe absolutely will happen we are absolutely certain that ai is going to be involved in this endeavor that finally with deep learning and finally with ai that we believe we have the secret sauce necessary to break these puzzles and to solve these puzzles over the period of time number one number two we believe unquestionably that depending on the problem you want to solve you need a different amount of computational capability we believe unambiguously this is a software problem and that for the largest of transportation companies they need to own their own – theyre going to need – own their own software in collaboration with you but theyre not going to let you do it and keep it as a black box we believe unambiguously that this is a computing problem that this is a realtime supercomputing problem that its not just about a special widget but computation is necessary processors a computer system system software enormous amount of operating system capability is necessary to build something like this it is a massive software problem otherwise we would have done it already and so i think that youre going to see this year the beginnings of a lot of those of some very visionary and really quite exciting introductions but in the next year and the year after that i think youre going to see more and more and more i think this is the beginning and were working with some really really amazing people to get this done operator and your next question comes from the line of mitch steves mitch steves  rbc capital markets llc hey thanks for taking my question guys so just kind of circling back to the datacenter piece and the deep learning aspect is there a change in asps you guys are seeing when you enter that market jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director no mitch steves  rbc capital markets llc so essentially theres going to be no margin change from the datacenter sales and i guess the same question in automotive as well jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director automotive asps for selfdriving cars will be much higher than infotainment its a much tougher problem every car in the world has infotainment with the exception of some pioneering work or early – the best the most leadingedge cars today almost no cars are selfdriving and so i think that the technology necessary for selfdriving cars is much much more complicated than lane keeping or adaptive cruise control or firstgeneration and secondgeneration adas the problem is much much more complicated operator your next question comes from the line of brian alger brian alger  roth capital partners llc hi guys thanks for squeezing me in i think this will be the first congrats actually on a pretty darn good quarter and amazing guidance i want to come back to the difference of pascal versus what would be otherwise competition from either intel or amd theres been a fair amount of documentation talking about the power requirements or the power draw differences between pascal versus polaris and one would think that while thats important in gaming and its gotten a lot of notice it would actually be more important for these deep learning applications that weve been talking so much about over the past half hour or  minutes can you maybe talk to that side of the design not so much the horsepower but maybe the power efficiency of it and what that means for when you scale it up into really big problems jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director yeah brian thank you very much first of all i appreciate the comment the team worked really really hard and over the last several years – the last five years all of the employees of nvidia have been pursuing a strategy that took until today really to show people that it really pays off and its a very unique business model its a very unique approach but i just want to congratulate all the employees that have worked so hard to get us here i appreciate the comment also about energy efficiency in fact energy efficiency is the single most important feature of processors today and going forward and the reason for that is because every single environment that were in is powerconstrained every single environment even your pc with  watts or  watts is powerconstrained because we can surely put more gpus in there than  watts and so thats powerconstrained were in environments where we only have one or two watts it might be a drone and we need to be – were completely powerconstrained so energy efficiency is really important we might be in a datacenter where were doing deep learning and were training neural nets or were inferencing neural nets and in this particular case although the datacenter has a lot of power to provision the number of gpus that they want to use in it is measured in tens tens and tens of thousands and so energy efficiency becomes the predominant issue energy efficiency literally is the most important feature of the processor now from there their functionality and architectural features the architectural changes that weve made in pascal so that we could stay ahead of the deep learning research work and the deep learning progress was groundbreaking and people were starting to discover the architectural changes that we put into pascal and its going to make a huge difference in the next several years of deep learning and so thats a feature in architectural innovation and then lastly of course theres all of the software that goes on top of processor  we call it gpu computing instead of just gpus because gpu computing is about computing its about software its about systems its about the interrelationship of our gpu with the memories and all the memories around the system and the networking and the interconnect and storage and its a largescale computing problem it is also the highest throughput computing problem on the planet which is the reason why weve been called upon by our nation to build the worlds next two fastest supercomputers highthroughput computing is our companys expertise highthroughput computing from fundamental architecture to chip design to system design to system software to algorithms to computational mathematics and all the experts in all the various fields of science that is the great investment that we made in the last five years and i think the results are really starting to show operator and your next question comes from the line of blayne curtis blayne curtis  barclays capital inc hey guys thanks for squeezing me in here and great execution on the quarter two related questions one i just – colette i was just curious your view on the return – use of capital and buybacks obviously an accelerated one only  million in the last quarter whats your view going forward and then jenhsun maybe a bigger question in terms of use of capital whether you could talk about – you said cpu is not an area that you would want to go into but obviously gpus have legs i was just curious if you have to look around at other areas maybe in the datacenter where you could also add value colette m kress  chief financial officer  executive vice president yeah thanks thanks blayne the return of capital continues to be an important part of our shareholder value message but remember it is still two parts of it part of it is still dividends and part of it has been our purchasing of stock so as we continue to go forward the dividend is definitely a longterm perspective and well make sure that we can watch the dividend yield there to stay competitive and also looking at our profitability our share repurchase well look at the opportunistic time for those repurchases and making sure that were also doing that carefully as well jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director and longterm use of capital i would say this that you know what nvidia is really rich with is were rich with vision and creativity and the courage to innovate and thats one of the reasons why we start almost every conversation with anything by gathering our great people around the company and seeing what kind of future we can invent for ourselves and for the world and so i think our use of capital is nurturing the employees that we have and providing them a platform to innovate and create new conditions by which they can be successful and do their lifes work and so thats philosophically where we start were not allergic to acquisitions and purchases and we look all the time and we have the benefit of working with and partnering with companies large and small all over the world as we move the industry forward and so were surely open to that but our natural posture is always to invest in our people and invest in our own companys ability to invent the future operator and your next question comes from the line of cj muse cj muse  evercore isi yeah good afternoon thank you for squeezing me in i guess two quick questions the first one thank you for breaking out deep learning as a percentage of the datacenter can you provide what that percentage was for the april quarter and then the followup question is i look back over the last four quarters and i look at your implied guide youre looking at roughly  incremental operating margin im curious if thats the right kind of number you would underwrite here or should we be thinking about improving mix as well as maturing process and manufacturing at your foundry partners such that that could actually be higher as we look ahead thank you jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director deep learning is a software approach a new computing architecture a new computing approach that the industry that researchers have been developing for  years and it was only until five years ago when pioneering work was on deep learning on gpus that really turbocharged it and gave the industry if you will a time machine that brought the future to the present and the power of deep learning is so great that this capability is expanding and people are discovering more ways to use it and more applications and new deep learning architectures and the networks are getting bigger and deeper and more complicated and so i think that this area is going to grow quite significantly it represents a vast majority of our datacenter revenues recently and my sense is that its going to continue to be a significant part of it and so – what was the second question did i miss it i think that his question was really about datacenters and deep learning right colette m kress  chief financial officer  executive vice president i think your question was regarding deep learning and the percentage of datacenter and how that has moved jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director yeah and its vast majority roughly its vast majority operator and your next question comes from the line of kevin cassidy kevin e cassidy  stifel nicolaus  co inc thanks for taking my question maybe i go to the other end of the spectrum and speaking of energy efficiency are you finding new opportunities for tegra aside from the infotainment in automotive jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director kevin i appreciate the question tegra is at the core of all of our selfdriving car initiatives and so without tegra there would be no selfdriving cars and so tegra is the core of our selfdriving car initiative it is the computing platform for selfdriving cars and drive px  includes tegra as well as discrete gpus of pascal but the core of it the vast majority of the heavy lifting is done by tegra and we expect that going forward and so tegra is incredibly important to us tegra is also the core of the processor of jetson jetson is a platform that is designed for other embedded autonomous and intelligent machines and so you can imagine what kind of intelligent machines in the future would benefit from deep learning and ai but robots and drones and embedded applications and embedded applications inside buildings and cities therere all kinds of applications im very very optimistic about the future of jetson but at the core of that is also tegra and so think of tegra as our computer on a chip and its our ai computer on a chip jenhsun huang  cofounder president ceo  director okay may i i appreciate all the questions thank you all for joining us today our growth is really driven by several factors our focus on deep learning selfdriving cars gaming and vr markets where gpu has been vital is really starting to pay off the second factor is that pascal is the most advanced gpu ever created and were incredibly excited about it and this last quarter we ramped it with enormous success and im so proud of the team for all of the preparation and the executions last quarter and the third is hyperscale adoption of deep learning is now widespread is largescale and were seeing it globally those are several growth drivers ahead of us as we go forward were also looking to sharing our many developments in deep learning ai with you were really just in the beginning of seeing the actual growth of deep learning as we scale out into the market deep learning adoption is now widespread and is ramping at every hyperscale datacenter its a new computing model it requires a new computing architecture one that gpu is perfectly suited for and the thing that weve done that im really delighted with is the strategy that started five years ago to optimize our gpu computing platform from endtoend and optimize it for deep learning at the processor level at the architecture level at the chip design level systems and software and algorithms and a richness of deep learning experts at the company and the collaboration that we have all over the world with researchers and developers has made it possible for us to continue to advance this field in this platform and as a result of that our deep learning platform has improved far more than anybody wouldve expected if you just projected it based on semiconductor physics it would be nowhere near the level of speed up and step up that we got from generation to generation from kepler to maxwell we got x from maxwell to pascal we got another x and you can surely expect pretty substantial improvements and increases from us over the next several years where we really shine is not only as a fantastic platform for deep learning and the training of the networks but its also a fantastic platform to scale out you can enjoy our platform whether its in cloud or in datacenter or in supercomputers and workstations and desk site pcs and notebook computers to cars to embedded computers as i mentioned just now with jetson this is a one singular architecture approach so the thoughtfulness and the care of the investment of the developers and the software programmers and researchers is really our preeminent concern and as we know computing is about architecture and computing is about platform and mostly computing is about developers and weve been quite thoughtful about the importance it is to developers and as a result developers all over the world all over the industry can use the singular architecture and get the benefits of their science and their applications as they scale and deploy their work so thats it we had a great quarter and i look forward to

deep into gaming vr autonomous cars and shield tv dean takahashideantak january    pm above jenhsun huang ceo of nvidia delivers the opening keynote address at ces image credit nvidia you could say that nvidia is at its highwater mark the company’s stock price has tripled in the past year it has transformed itself from a maker of graphics chips to an artificial intelligence company and ceo jenhsun huang gave the opening keynote speech at ces  the big tech trade show in las vegas this week after that keynote huang sat down with a small group of press and answered questions for an hour huang talked about how the serendipitous and destined combination of programmable graphics processing units gpus and deep learning neural networks enabled breakthroughs in ai that are leading to further breakthroughs in autonomous cars and voice controls he also dove deep into pc gaming virtual reality nvidia’s partnership with nintendo on the switch console selfdriving car partnerships with mercedesbenz and audi and shield tv i participated in the group qa with huang here’s an edited transcript of the press event above gary shapiro of cta on stage with jenhsun huang of nvidia at ces image credit dean takahashi jenhsun huang we had a keynote yesterday and i talked about three things the first thing i talked about is that pc gaming and geforce are thriving it’s thriving for a lot of reasons pc gaming is the only gaming platform that’s global it’s global by design it’s global by economics it’s global because it’s based on the pc it’s based on an essential tool for humanity people want to buy a lot of things but people need to buy a pc i also made the point that almost every human is a gamer i believe that my parents’ generation none of them were gamers but my children’s children’s generation everyone will be a gamer and yet there are only several hundred million gamers in the world today which suggests that gaming still has the opportunity to grow by a factor of  gaming is thriving it’s a global business everyone is going to be a gamer production value of games is increasing so fast in the last  years in order to play a call of duty game at a reasonable level—today compared to five years ago you need  times the computational horsepower all of a sudden k is here hdr is here vr is here the technology that drives the industry the production value is increasing incredibly fast gaming is driven no longer just by the fact that it’s fun to play gaming is now a sport you guys have known this for a while you also know that the league of legends finals was viewed by more people than the nba finals i made the claim that long term—who knows how long the long term is but esports could be the world’s largest gaming genre it could be bigger than soccer bigger than football bigger than…swimming i don’t know laughter it could be quite large it’s already incredibly large  million mobile gamers  million people watching other people play gaming is also social it’s a way of hanging out don’t forget that when three of your friends are gamers when they’re playing overwatch and you’re not it’s hard to hang out with them it’s no different from a game of pickup basketball or anything else that we do it’s a social network the more of your friends are gamers the more gamers you get to know it’s a positive feedback system we also have seen in just the last few years—it’s twitch that started it but it’s not only twitch one of the fastestgrowing segments of youtube is video game programming you want to learn how to get to the next level you want to see somebody’s spectacular feat you maybe have used video games as a platform for art you do something really incredible like capture a short story video games as a way to share your victories share your moments share your art—it’s become a really fastgrowing product all of these factors these dynamics are best on pc that’s the reason why the pc industry has grown why the pc gaming market has grown so fast and it’s now the largest gaming platform we see this dynamic continuing we’re quite excited about it i talked about ai in the home ultimately the home needs a home computer your home computer is no longer your pc your personal computer belongs to you everybody has their own personal computer there’s no concept of a “home computer” anymore but i believe there needs to be a home computer it’s likely that your home computer is your entertainment computer we’ve always felt that shield is an entertainment computer it brings a modern way of enjoying content to the home but over time it becomes more and more powerful eventually it controls and connects to the whole house i talked about autonomous driving we gave an update on our autopilot platform – our processor our operating system all the necessary ais there’s a misconception that maybe there’s one ai causing the car to drive but it’s not like that ai in the future is going to be a whole lot of ais it’s a new way of developing software deep learning is a new way of developing software a whole lot of software modules and capabilities are inside the car and they’re all going to be infused with ai you still have to break down the functionality of the car you still have to break down the computing platform into its modular parts and develop it in pieces but we expect there will be a lot of different ais i talked about perception ais i talked about driving ais i talked about reasoning ais – where am i where is everyone else – and i made a prediction about all that i also said that the ai is no longer going to be just about driving you on autopilot even when it’s not driving you it’ll be looking out for you you’ll have a copilot at all times you’ll have a copilot fully engaged fully alert looking at your surroundings it has surround perception at all times not only that it’s also connected to its perception of what you’re doing if there are things happening outside the car that are inconsistent with your attention level it’ll remind you of that even when it’s not confident to drive it should be fully confident to look out for you there’s always going to be a copilot ai running i talked about these three basic ideas gaming geforce is thriving in fact—is it okay if i took one of our lines from the blog and shared it that’s okay right i just don’t know what press etiquette is laughter above jenhsun huang ceo of nvidia at ces image credit dean takahashi question is there such a thing huang i can say whatever i want right there’s a piece of news—geforce is really thriving in fact at ces there are going to be  new gaming laptops launching this year that’s a lot  new geforce gaming laptops every single oem in the world powered by our brand new gpu geforce ti these laptops are thin they’re fast you get essentially something that’s better than a playstation  in a tiny laptop computer your little thin beautiful laptop gives you the ability to play psquality games everything just works we’re also announcing too amazing new gaming monitors the world’s first k gsync hdr models if you haven’t had a chance to see it you must see it no lag no tear full hdr vibrancy k monitors one is from asus and one is from acer those two monitors are going to be fantastic gaming monitors geforce is vibrant we’ll bring ai to the house and we’ll turn your car into an ai it’s either going to be driving you or looking out for you all right that’s it     view all vb recommendations a  million autonomous ship will launch in  grab to raise  billion war chest to cement its lead over uber in southeast asia ai is impacting you more than you realize upcoming venturebeat events blueprint sept    gamesbeat  oct    vb summit oct  –  jensen huang  wikipedia jensen huang from

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
