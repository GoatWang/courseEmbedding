first quarter  conference call at this time all participants are in a listenonly mode a brief question and answer session will follow the formal presentation as a reminder this conference is being recorded and the slides for todays presentation are available on union pacifics website it is now my pleasure to introduce your host mr lance fritz chairman president and ceo for union pacific you may begin lance m fritz  union pacific corp good morning everybody and welcome to union pacifics first quarter earnings conference call with me here today in omaha are beth whited our chief marketing officer cameron scott chief operating officer and rob knight our chief financial officer this morning union pacific is reporting net income of nearly  billion for the first quarter of  this equates to a first quarter record  per share which is up  over last year total volume increased  in the quarter compared to  carload volume increased in three of our six commodity groups led by a  increase in coal the quarterly operating ratio came in at  which is flat with the first quarter of  this is a very solid start to the year especially given the weather challenges we encountered on the western part of our network earlier in the quarter in keeping with our strategic value tracks our engaged employees worked safely and productively under very difficult circumstances during the quarter as a result operations were restored quickly as we continued to focus on providing an excellent customer experience our team will give you more of the details on the quarter starting with beth elizabeth f whited  union pacific corp thank you lance and good morning in the first quarter our volume was up  driven primarily by coal agricultural products and industrial products offset by declines in automotive and chemicals we generated positive net core pricing of  in the quarter with continued energy related and intermodal pricing pressure the increase in volume and a  improvement in average revenue per car drove a  increase in freight revenue lets take a closer look at the performance of each our six business groups ag products revenue increased  on  volume growth and a  improvement in average revenue per car grain carloads increased  yearoveryear driven by ample us grain supply and global market competitiveness increasing demand for grain exports primarily wheat and corn grain product carloads were flat with strengths from ddg exports to mexico and soybean meal shipments in the us offset by a drop in canola meal and oils volume food and refrigerated carloads were down  driven by declines in canned goods refrigerated markets were also down due to western region weather challenges and ample truck availability looking at the remainder of the year the strong south american crop and continued abundance of grain stocks will create uncertainty in the grain markets weather and crop health will also continue to be factors we expect food and refrigerated shipments will see strength as the year progresses automotive revenue was down  in the quarter on a  decrease in volume and a  increase in average revenue per car finished vehicle shipments decreased  as a result of previously referenced contract changes which we have now largely lapped and lower production levels these changes were partially offset by increased west coast imports and new production in mexico the seasonally adjusted average rate of sales was  million vehicles in the first quarter down  from first quarter  on the parts side over the road conversions and growth in light truck demand drove a  increase in volume the us light vehicle forecast for full year  is  million units down  from the  record rate of  million we remain cautious with respect to auto sales due to high inventory dealer incentives and rising interest rates on the parts side however over the road conversions will continue to present opportunities for growth chemicals revenue was up  for the quarter on a  decrease in volume and  increase in average revenue per car petroleum and lpg shipments declined  as we continued to see headwinds on crude oil shipments which were down  to about  carloads in the quarter due to the lower crude oil prices and available pipeline capacity chemicals volume excluding crude oil was up  in the quarter partially offsetting the declines in crude oil was strength in plastics which was up  in the quarter due to increased polypropylene shipments for the rest of  our chemicals franchise is expected to remain stable strength is anticipated in plastics with new facilities and expansions beginning to come online as well as in industrial chemicals driven by improvement in industrial production both of these will continue to help offset the expected continued decline in crude oil shipments coal revenue increased  for the quarter on a  increase in volume and  improvement in average revenue per car on a tonnage basis powder river basin and other regions were up  and  respectively from higher natural gas prices and stronger west coast exports which benefited from favorable global economics for western us coal overall coal stockpiles were down in the quarter and they are nearing the fiveyear average looking forward we expect coal volumes will continue to benefit from favorable  comps in the second quarter for the second half the year we expect sustained volume assuming natural gas prices remain in the  range as always weather conditions will be a key factor of demand industrial products revenue was up  on a  increase in volume and a  increase in average revenue per car during the car minerals volume increased  in the quarter driven by a  increase in frac sand shipments through increased shale related drilling activity and profit intensity per drilling well construction products volume was down  due to projects completed in  that did not continue into  largely in south texas this market was also impacted by western region weather challenges specialized markets were impacted by reduced projectbased waste shipments partially offset by strength in our wind and government markets for the remainder of the year we anticipate continued strength in frac sand shipments as rig counts in our served territory continue to increase the strength of the us dollar negatively impacts a number of industrial products markets especially metals and creates some uncertainty in our outlook intermodal revenue was up  with flat volume and a  increase in average revenue per car domestic volume declined  in the quarter driven by a challenging competitive environment and abundant truck capacity international volume was up  in the quarter from stronger westbound shipments inventory restocking and volume pushes prior to the ocean carrier alliance changes effective april  looking forward we expect international intermodal volumes will continue to be impacted by ongoing ocean carrier financial stress industry consolidation and potential trade policy changes while trucking capacity is abundant currently making modal conversions challenging we expect a tightening of capacity late in the year with the implementation of electronic log books providing an opportunity to drive higher levels of over the road conversions to wrap up this slide recaps our outlook for the remainder of  mentioned in the previous slides favorable coal comps will continue into the second quarter we also anticipate strength in other key markets including continued growth in frac sand our diverse franchise remains well positioned for growth this year as the us economy continues to build momentum in the face of a number of uncertainties in the worldwide economy our team remains fully committed to developing new business opportunities and strengthening our overall customer value proposition with that ill turn it over to cameron for an update on our operating performance cameron a scott  union pacific corp thanks beth and good morning starting with safety performance our reportable personal injury rate increased to  versus the first quarter record of  achieved in  while disappointed with the results the team remains fully committed to successfully addressing risk in the workplace and i am confident in our efforts as we push towards our goal of zero incidents with respect to rail equipment incidents or derailments our reportable rate of  increased  versus the first quarter of last year to make improvement going forward well continue to focus on enhanced tey training to eliminate human factor incidents and making investments that harden our infrastructure to reduce incidents in addition were collecting millions of data points on the health of our track condition and are actively developing advanced analytical models to better identify and mitigate this risk in public safety our grade crossing incident rate improved  versus  to  as i mentioned on the fourth quarter call our crossing assessment process or cap couples our comprehensive safety culture with data analysis to help focus increased attention on the crossings where we can most substantially impact public safety moving on to network performance severe weather throughout much of our western region caused multiple track outages and service interruptions during the first quarter as a result velocity declined  while terminal dwell increased  when compared to  despite the weather challenges we were still able to generate efficiency gains within our terminals as cars switched per employee day increased  during the first quarter i would like to take a moment to thank the team for their hard work and dedication as they did an excellent job of restoring the network quickly and safely in an effort to minimize delays so we could continue delivering an excellent customer experience moving on to resources throughout the quarter as part of our ongoing business planning process we finetuned our resource levels to account for volume changes weather disruptions and productivity gains as a result our total tey work force was down  in the first quarter when compared to the same period in  and our engineering and mechanical work force was down a combined  employees or  at the end of the quarter we had approximately  tey furloughs we do expect those numbers to decline throughout the year as we look to the furlough pool first to backfill attrition the active locomotive fleet was up  for the first quarter of  primarily to help minimize the impact of weather related challenges and we had approximately  locomotives in storage at the end of the first quarter as always we will continue to adjust our work force levels and equipment fleet as volume and network performance dictate in addition to efficiently rightsizing our resource base we continued realizing gains in other key productivity initiatives such as train size our persistent focus on productivity once again resulted in train size performance improvement as we achieved best ever quarterly results in our automotive and manifest networks and first quarter records in our intermodal and grain networks to wrap up despite some first quarter challenges we expect to build positive momentum as we focus on critical initiatives that will drive improvement first and foremost is safety where we expect our safety strategy will yield record results on our way to incidentfree environment and our balanced resource base puts us in tremendous position to leverage volume growth to the bottom line as we maintain our intense focus on productivity and efficiency across the network with that ill turn it over to rob robert m knight jr  union pacific corp good morning lets start with a recap of our first quarter results operating revenue was  billion in the quarter up  versus last year higher volumes an increase in fuel surcharges and positive core price all contributed to the increase in revenue for the quarter operating expenses totaled  billion up  from  the increase in fuel cost represented a majority of the increased operating expense in the quarter operating income totaled almost  billion a  increase from last year below the line other income totaled  million up from  million in  this increase was primarily driven by a real estate pretax gain totaling  million or approximately  per share interest expense of  million was up  compared to the previous year the increase was driven by additional debt issuance over the last  months partially offset by a lower effective interest rate income tax expense increased about  to  million driven primarily by higher pretax earnings net income totaled nearly  billion up  versus last year while the outstanding share balance declined  as a result of our continued share repurchase activities these results combined to produce a record first quarter earnings per share of  per share and as we discussed back in march we encountered severe weather on the western part of our network which negatively impacted earnings per share by about  in the quarter a good portion of this was lost revenue the operating ratio was flat with the first quarter last year even with the fuel headwind we faced during the quarter higher fuel prices negatively impacted the operating ratio by about  points now turning to the top line freight revenue of  billion was up over  versus last year driven by a  increase in volume along with positive core pricing fuel surcharge revenue totaled  million up  million when compared to  and up about  million from the fourth quarter of last year all in we estimate the net impact of higher fuel prices was a  headwind to earnings in the first quarter versus last year the business mix impact on freight revenue in the first quarter was a positive  the primary drivers of this positive mix were yearoveryear growth in frac sand shipments and grain carloadings along with a reduction in shorter haul rock volumes core price was about  pricing in our energy and intermodal business continues to be under pressure given the competitiveness in those respective markets we expect these challenges to continue throughout the first part of  before beginning to strengthen later in the year assuming market conditions improve excluding coal and intermodal pricing in our other business lines was in the  to  range for the quarter and for the full year we are on track with our pricing initiatives to generate a revenue benefit that exceeds our inflation costs our strategy of pricing our service product based on the value proposition it represents in the competitive marketplace at levels that generate a reinvestable return remains intact turning now to the operating expense slide  provides a summary of our operating expenses for the quarter compensation and benefits expense increased  versus  the increase was primarily driven by a combination of higher wage and benefit inflation higher volume and weatherrelated costs labor inflation was about  in the quarter partially offsetting higher volumes were solid productivity gains and a smaller capital work force resulting in total work force levels declining  in the quarter versus last year or about  employees less for the remainder of  we do expect force levels to adjust with volume but will also reflect ongoing productivity initiatives fuel expense totaled  million up  when compared to last year higher diesel fuel prices and a  increase in gross ton miles drove the increase in fuel expense for the quarter compared to the first quarter of last year our fuel consumption rate improved  while our average fuel price increased  to  per gallon purchased services and materials expense decreased  to  million the reduction was primarily driven by lower joint facility expenses and locomotive material costs turning to slide  depreciation expense was  million up  compared to  primarily driven by a higher depreciable base for the full year  we estimate that depreciation expense will increase around  to  equipment and other rents expense totaled  million which is down  when compared to  lower locomotive lease expense and a mix of traffic were the primary drivers for the reduction other expenses came in at  million up  versus last year for  we would expect other expense to increase slightly excluding any unusual items looking at our cash flow cash from operations for the first quarter totaled about  billion down  million when compared to last year the decrease in cash was primarily related to a lower bonus depreciation benefit taking a look at adjusted debt levels the allin adjusted debt balance totaled  billion at quarter end this does not include the  billion of new debt which closed just after the quarter end we finished the first quarter with an adjusted debt to ebitda ratio of around  times and this keeps us close to our target ratio of just under two times dividend payments for the quarter totaled nearly  million compared to  million last year this includes a  dividend increase per share which occurred in the fourth quarter of  in addition to dividends we also bought back over  million shares totaling  million an increase of around  over last year and since initiating share repurchases in  we have repurchased nearly  of our outstanding shares and between our dividend payments and our share repurchases we returned about  billion to our shareholders in the first quarter which represented just over  of first quarter net income on the productivity side our g initiatives yielded around  million of productivity in the quarter a couple of examples of our productivity include effectively leveraging volume growth that we achieved in the quarter reducing locomotive servicing and repair costs turning back leased equipment no longer required and furthering our efforts to be more efficient on our support functions with these results we continue to progress as expected and we are on track to meet our  million to  million productivity goal for the full year looking forward we still expect full year volume growth to be up in the low single digit range second quarter volumes could be a little stronger driven primarily by the benefit of an easier comparison yearoveryear with positive volume positive core price and significant productivity benefits we are still on track to have an improved full year operating ratio longer term we are still focused on achieving our targeted  operating ratio plus or minus on a full year basis by  and we remain committed to reaching our goal of a  operating ratio beyond  as we continued the momentum of our volume pricing and productivity initiatives with that ill turn it back over to lance lance m fritz  union pacific corp thank you rob with a solid first quarter performance behind us well continue to press ahead with our volume pricing and productivity initiatives through the remainder of year as beth mentioned were seeing particular strength in a few markets such as frac sand coal seems to have stabilized and were seeing some signs of gradual improvement in other areas of the economy our sixtrack value strategy will keep us intensely focused on effectively leveraging volume growth while providing our customers an excellent experience and our shareholders a solid return on their investment with that lets open up the line for your questions questionandanswer session operator thank you due to the number of analysts joining us on the call today we will be limiting everyone to one primary question and one followup question to accommodate as many participants as possible our first question today comes from the line of ravi shanker with morgan stanley please proceed with your questions diane huang  morgan stanley  co llc hi this is diane huang on for ravi thank you for taking my question so a question here is the average number of employees was down about  yearoveryear despite volumes growing  so with your fullyear volume outlook of up lowsingle digits for the year do you expect to hold the first quarter head count level flat sequentially for the rest of the year and then a second part to that question is in the past you guys talked about  incremental margins so with your g initiative and also positive volume growth we can see higher levels of incremental margins for the rest of the year thank you lance m fritz  union pacific corp thank you diane well let rob answer those questions robert m knight jr  union pacific corp yeah on the head count question yeah youre exactly right in what you pointed out in terms of the great productivity that we saw in the first quarter in the face of some of the challenges that we talked about full year i mean ill just call you back to our guidance weve given and that is head count will move with volume but we obviously will achieve productivity along the way so it wont be oneforone so we stay away from giving a precise number but rest assured to achieve our objectives were going to continue to drive productivity and it will be reflected in those numbers in terms of the incremental margin as we look out to achieve both our  or guidance by  and then beyond that our  its going to require incremental margins in the  to  range and thats kind of how we think about it and thats what were focused on diane huang  morgan stanley  co llc great thats very helpful and then a quick one here can you quantify how much of the  to  eps headwind from weather was related to revenues versus expense robert m knight jr  union pacific corp we didnt break that out but i would just say a large portion of the  showed up on the revenue line diane huang  morgan stanley  co llc okay great thank you operator our next question is from the line of brandon oglenski with barclays please proceed with your questions eric morgan  barclays capital inc hey good morning this is eric morgan on for brandon thanks for taking my question i wanted to ask about the pricing pressure you mentioned and the competitive environment in intermodal just wondering if you could elaborate on that a bit and talk about how the current level of competition compares to what youve seen historically and maybe how thats progressed throughout the quarter and into april and your expectations on that front elizabeth f whited  union pacific corp we are seeing ample truck capacity in the market as well as pretty significant pricing pressure in the intermodal space it has not abated as weve gone into april as we think about the rest of the year we certainly are expecting to see capacity tighten as electronic logbooks come into play and so our expectation would be that you would start to see some rationalization of capacity and an opportunity for better pricing eric morgan  barclays capital inc all right appreciate that and then maybe just on frac sand can you just talk a little bit more about the fundamentals there it looks like youre seeing some acceleration in q i guess where are you relative to the prior peak in that business and has there been any significant change in the mix of business and i guess if youre able to quantify the positive mix impact that you mentioned earlier elizabeth f whited  union pacific corp okay so we are seeing substantial increases in demand in texas specifically in the permian basin wed mentioned that we were up  in the quarter we were up almost  in the permian basin and were up around  in eagle ford were seeing some spiking demand as well in the niobrara but not as substantial i would say that that is sustaining and maybe even growing a little bit as we enter into the second quarter and i dont see anything right now that changes that so thats been a bright spot for us you asked a question about mix we are starting to see some local brown sand come into play especially in the permian so were looking at something like  white sand  brown sand we expect the pie to continue to grow and its possible over time brown sand will take up a larger piece of the pie but still opportunity for us and were participating in that market as much as we can lance m fritz  union pacific corp hey eric just stepping back a couple of kind of highlevel things that are going on in that shale energy market one is many of these shale energy exploration plays are competitive at  oil and so it looks like its potentially a sustained marketplace and the second thing is the sand intensity per well has been increasing and that also looks like its a favorable trend eric morgan  barclays capital inc thanks for the time operator our next question is from the line of tom wadewitz of ubs please proceed with your question thomas wadewitz  ubs securities llc yeah good morning so i wanted to – i guess first ill just ask about coal i think lance you mentioned stabilization in coal i know there are a lot of factors that affect the business and probably natural gas price is one of the most important but how do you see the lay of the land maybe over the next year in terms of impact from facility closures impact potentially from renewables capacity coming on do you think that from that perspective that you would have some stability and youre really kind of weather dependent or are there some other faculties like that new capacity or shutdowns that we should consider over the next year elizabeth f whited  union pacific corp we do view that as being pretty stable over the next year you called out exactly the right factors that will impact it weather clearly will remain a factor and natural gas prices are really very key to keeping coalgenerated electricity on the dispatch curve so with those couple of things in mind we view it as being pretty stable over the horizon here thomas wadewitz  ubs securities llc okay great and one on the operating side how would you characterize  i mean seems like your growth is coming in aside from the coal growth youre getting a lot of growth in what might be in the manifest network not so much in intermodal so i think you get good operating leverage and seems like youre doing a good job of expanding train length how much capacity do you have to run longer trains in the manifest network i know its train by train segment by segment but overall have you got another  you could add to train length in manifest or whats the right ballpark for that cameron a scott  union pacific corp tom i wont give you an exact figure but there is plenty of headroom inside our network almost across the board between our three regions for more train size opportunities and we will on a case by case lane by lane basis take advantage of that thomas wadewitz  ubs securities llc okay so that leverage should continue in the near term cameron a scott  union pacific corp yes sir it should thomas wadewitz  ubs securities llc okay great thank you lance m fritz  union pacific corp thank you tom operator our next question is from the line of amit mehrotra with deutsche bank please proceed with your questions amit mehrotra  deutsche bank securities inc hey thanks everybody congrats on a good quarter just following up on the incremental question the first question i wanted to just ask the underlying – trying to understand what the underlying incrementals were in the quarter after adjusting for the weather impact i dont have perfect information from the data you provided but it looks like it was in the mid  level and then if you can just confirm that or correct me if im wrong and then if you look at the or targets over the longterm obviously this is an enormously capital intensive business what im trying to understand as you look at bridging where you are today to where you want to be how much of that trajectory is i guess fully kind of in your control via net cost savings and how much of it is volume growth thats kind of out of your control i would imagine the vast majority of it would be volume growth but please correct me if im wrong lance m fritz  union pacific corp rob you want to handle that robert m knight jr  union pacific corp yeah in the first quarter our incremental margins as reported were about  and if you adjust for the fuel they were closer to like  i didnt break out the impact of weather but obviously that had a slight impact on that calculus but those are the numbers as reported and as i said earlier to drive to our stated goals we need to be in the  to  range on an annualized basis to get from here to there and thats how were focused in terms of what will drive the incremental margins what will drive the leverage i would just say – you said volumes out of our control somewhat thats true because we have to play the hand the economy deals us but we also as part of our g initiatives are focused on developing business development opportunities where we can have some control over volume and obviously providing quality safe service to our customers is one of the key drivers to in fact encouraging volume growth on our railroad so we view a lot of that as in our control and were focused on driving quality volume continuing to focus on providing quality service so we can price it right above inflation and continue our focus on productivity initiatives which we have been successfully delivering you add all that up thats whats going to get us from where we are to the  and ultimately to the  cameron a scott  union pacific corp amit i thought i heard you ask a question on capex and as we look forward on capex thats driven you mentioned growth thats driven part by about a  billion spend to maintain a robust network and then the rest is about finding investments that have a reasonable and attractive return positive train control of course is in its last couple of years of significant investment so that will start trailing off and well see what the future brings amit mehrotra  deutsche bank securities inc okay thats helpful thanks and if i could just follow up one question on pricing rob youve kind of talked over the last couple quarters ad nauseam about core pricing dynamics and how you guys calculate it if you can just update us some of the energy volumes are coming back online now and just if you could provide some color if the pricing pressure or the decelerating pricing environment has abated at all as some of those volumes have come back online and also the positive spread between price increases and cost inflation that youve talked about has that spread changed at all since the start of the year in a more positive direction in some of the export volumes of coal and the energy volumes are a little bit better than expected thanks lance m fritz  union pacific corp yeah i would just say youre right we have attempted to explain how we calculate price and again im proud to announce as you all have heard me say for many years that we are very conservative in terms of how we accurately capture what we report on price but nothings changed from the guidance we gave and that is that were focused on driving dollars that we yield from our pricing initiatives higher than for the full year higher than the dollars we expend on inflation and coming into this year we called out that that gap this year was clearly going to be tighter than last year largely driven by some of the pressures that youre asking about in our energy and intermodal businesses on the one hand and on the other hand a higher inflation rate which for the full year we still see overall inflation in that  range which is obviously is higher than what we ended up with last year so nothing has changed but i would just point out that as beth commented in her remarks we are continuing to face competitive pressures in the energy and intermodal businesses so that has not abated that continues amit mehrotra  deutsche bank securities inc okay got it thats very clear all right thanks for taking my questions appreciate it operator our next questions coming from the line of scott group with wolfe research please proceed with your question scott h group  wolfe research llc hey thanks morning guys just wanted to follow up there so if i look at the segments coal had the best yield growth of any of the segments and im wondering is that a mix benefit or change or maybe do some of the contracts have something tied to higher natural gas prices and if not does the rising natural gas environment – we understand how it helps volumes but how do you think that impacts coal pricing lance m fritz  union pacific corp rob lets start with you and then we can have beth robert m knight jr  union pacific corp yeah beth can talk about the pricing but i would just say from a yield and depending on how youre calculating the yield scott i would just say that a large part of what we saw in terms of the overall yields and we dont break it out by commodity group as you may like us to as finitely but i would just say that the mix impact of the significant volume growth yearoveryear in coal really did impact the reported mix numbers on the yield that youre i think referring to in terms of the pricing dynamics beth elizabeth f whited  union pacific corp yeah the pricing dynamics remain as rob just said its really quite competitive but the length of haul helped us both coming out of the prb and going into texas as well as the export volumes which did grow a bit for us in the first quarter scott h group  wolfe research llc okay and then just maybe a bigger picture question lance relative to a quarter ago the big change in the industry is that youve got hunter now at csx and given what he does and the way he talks im wondering does that in any way change the way that you guys think about the longer term margin opportunity does it have any impact on the way you think about the business or manage the business or the pace in which you want to improve margins any kind of change in your thinking relative to a quarter ago lance m fritz  union pacific corp so scott lets start by saying we have great respect for csx the management team there their business they run a good business theyve got a great business model and im sure hunter is bringing significant change to that business model and hes got a great track record in our industry setting that aside we run our business with an eye towards being as efficient as we possibly can be and driving our six value tracks now we keep our eyes open and we learn from anybody we can outside of our business and weve done that historically and well continue to do that a great case in point is the someodd low horsepower locomotives weve taken out of our network over the past couple of years that was a lesson we learned from a couple of other entities and we figured out how to apply it to ourselves and weve done that effectively so our focus is get to that  plus minus by  and then get to  and well get there as quickly as we can keeping in mind weve got a number of levers that were moving in terms of growth on the top line productivity and trying to drive core price and again if somebodys got a great idea that looks like it can apply to our business model were going to use it but its not going to fundamentally change how we run our business or approach our strategy scott h group  wolfe research llc okay thank you for the thoughts guys operator our next question comes from the line of ari rosa with bank of america please proceed with your questions ariel luis rosa  bank of america merrill lynch hey good morning guys so just wanted to start on the balance sheet obviously youre getting closer to your level that youve set in terms of the target rate of two times debt to ebitda but it seems like youre still able to access some very low cost debt has there been any internal discussion in terms of raising that cap and maybe increasing returns to shareholders lance m fritz  union pacific corp rob you want to take a stab at that robert m knight jr  union pacific corp were comfortable with the guidance weve given of that two times but rest assured were very focused on driving cash flow and that with higher cash flow well support higher levels of debt and that then supports higher levels of continued share repurchases thats our focus ariel luis rosa  bank of america merrill lynch so it sounds like no that two times cap is a pretty hard cap at the moment robert m knight jr  union pacific corp we feel good with that as we look forward ariel luis rosa  bank of america merrill lynch okay great and then just turning quickly to crude by rail the volumes are obviously down pretty dramatically this quarter is that an area thats just not a viable area going forward for union pacific you go back a couple of years ago and everybody thought this was going to be a growth area for the rails it seems like pipeline has pretty much displaced that is there an opportunity that that growth could ever return just would love to hear your thoughts on that elizabeth f whited  union pacific corp yeah so union pacific really doesnt have a crude oil franchise like some of the other railroads so we will continue i think to be spot players as opportunities open up for arbitrage so you might see a little move to california out of canada you might see a little bit move to the gulf but in terms of our core franchise lanes i dont think that its a big market for union pacific going forward ariel luis rosa  bank of america merrill lynch okay fair enough thank you for the time operator our next question is from the line of jeff kauffman with aegis capital please proceed with your question jeffrey a kauffman  aegis capital corp thank you very much lot of focus on revenues and end markets i wanted to come back to capital investment and just get an idea on an updated basis where the capex guidance is im assuming unchanged and talk a little bit about what opportunities there may be going forward to take some of that capital investment down where need be lance m fritz  union pacific corp ill take a stab at that and then well let either rob or cam add some technicolor so our  billion for the year remains  billion of course there are moving parts in there but thats what were expecting for our full year as we look forward the moving parts again are about  billion of replacement capital annually we dont see much that changes that dramatically over time in order to maintain a really robust network positive train control is coming towards the end of its significant capital spend as we finally implement in its entirety of the project by  and then work through  to get the bugs kicked out and get it operating properly after that its all about growth and safety and productivity targeted investments robs also talked about a ballpark of  of revenue and i dont think theres much that we see that takes us off those numbers robert m knight jr  union pacific corp yeah i would just reiterate that jeff that that  is probably the best again thats not how we build our capital plan thats the best way to kind of think about how were thinking about it but i would also just to lances comments that we are pleased with the disciplined approach weve brought to the capital planning process and in fact our  billion is down about  billion on an annualized basis from the last couple of years jeffrey a kauffman  aegis capital corp looking at the  parked locomotives or locomotives in storage i guess i should think about theyre not all brand new locomotives some of them are older locomotives how much can you grow volume without having to make any kind of incremental investment in locomotive fleet lance m fritz  union pacific corp so ill let cam add some but bottom line is when you think about those  parked locomotives those are all the tail end of the fleet from the standpoint of we want to operate the most efficient most reliable units so those are generally going to be our newer units you know with that in mind theyre all serviceable and we did bring a fair number of them back call it  at some point during the first quarter to overcome the impacts of those weather issues that we had on the west coast so weve got plenty of headroom for growth prior to really needing to acquire new locomotives cameron cameron a scott  union pacific corp and lance weve had a lot of practice over the past several years in bringing that locomotive fleet back to life its reliable doesnt require a lot of further investment and weve got a lot of headroom to bring on additional business without even thinking about new purchases lance m fritz  union pacific corp yeah ill remind you we do have an obligation thats part of a longterm contract that includes purchases this year but absent the fact that we had a longterm contract we would not be in the market robert m knight jr  union pacific corp if i can lance just to remind everybody what those numbers are that weve said theres approximately  new ones this year and then  in  and that completes that longterm commitment jeffrey a kauffman  aegis capital corp all right well congratulations on a strong quarter and thanks guys lance m fritz  union pacific corp thanks jeff operator our next question is from the line of chris wetherbee with citigroup please go ahead with your questions chris wetherbee  citigroup global markets inc great thanks good morning guys wanted to touch on mix a little bit and rob i think i ask this question a lot and im not sure if youre ever able to answer it but wanted to get a sense when you think about sort of the mix of the business in the outlook that looks solid things like frac sand i think coals got a decent outlook for the rest of the year when we think about that just sort of directionally speaking we should be expecting some of the positive mix tailwinds that youve had over the last couple quarters to persist is that fair way to look at it or is it a little bit too difficult to get into the weeds there robert m knight jr  union pacific corp yeah chris you could probably write down my answer that well could play out that way i mean youre right we had a positive mix this quarter of  as youre pointing out largely driven by growth in coal and sand but we stay away from giving guidance on the mix because theres a lot of moving parts and because we have such a diverse book of business theres mix within mix in our varied business but youre not thinking about it wrong i mean if those are the commodities that continue to strengthen relative to the rest of the base throughout the year then thats not crazy thinking chris wetherbee  citigroup global markets inc okay thats helpful i appreciate that and then just wanted to come back to sort of the competitive dynamic in the western us between rail carriers weve heard some anecdotal stuff about your competitor in terms of service degradation mostly on the intermodal side but just a little bit around the margin there i know you guys compete very aggressively everyday against bn but just wanted to get a sense of maybe how that dynamic even if it has changed at all as we go forward here elizabeth f whited  union pacific corp i dont feel like anything about the competitive dynamic has significantly altered were competing every day with our direct competitor as well as all the other modes of transportation that are capable of handling the same sort of freight that we have it feels a little more intense on the intermodal side in the first quarter perhaps than what we had seen but its an ongoing competitive situation that we are engaged in playing chris wetherbee  citigroup global markets inc okay thats helpful thanks for the time this morning guys appreciate it lance m fritz  union pacific corp yes thank you operator our next question is from the line of bascome majors with susquehanna please proceed with your questions bascome majors  susquehanna financial group lllp yeah thank you you just talked a little bit more about the competitive intermodal environment with respect to pricing on the international side im curious are you looking for uppricing on the domestic side with your partners there this year and how does that compare to the  to  range ex coal ex international that you threw out earlier elizabeth f whited  union pacific corp like we said before if other things are up  to  then youre obviously having some pressure in other places to get to the  overall so we are very focused on whats going to happen with capacity as you move towards the end of the year and the electronic log books come into place because we do think youll see some rationalization at that time providing an opportunity for pricing to improve in that truckload space but thats not the only thing that were focused on we want to make sure that we have a great product thats very competitive so that as more freight wants to move away from the highway and onto rail were standing there ready to deliver it to our customers in the manner that they expect bascome majors  susquehanna financial group lllp and to follow up on that latter comment specifically with your domestic partners how do you balance your desire to improve your pricing and returns while still leaving them enough margin to continue to invest in growing in their business and grow their volumes on your lines elizabeth f whited  union pacific corp i would say certainly theres no percentage in it for us if we dont all win together so our goal is certainly to have a viable competitive product that enables all the people who are part of that supply chain to participate in a manner that makes sense to them from a business perspective bascome majors  susquehanna financial group lllp all right thank you for the time operator next question is from the line of jason seidl of cowen  company please proceed with your questions jason h seidl  cowen  co llc thank you operator and good morning all wanted to stick on the intermodal pricing a bit how should we expect it to start improving if in fact elds do like most of us think tighten up truck capacity is that pricing going to be a little bit of a lag so should we expect like a  improvement and not an improvement in  in price elizabeth f whited  union pacific corp no the elds come into play in late  the requirement gets hardened i think you just have to see depending on bid cycles and other things where you start to see the impact of that hard to predict jason h seidl  cowen  co llc okay and i wanted to jump back to something on the cost side rob you mentioned labor inflation i think was about  in the quarter is that something that we should think about going forward about that number  for labor inflation robert m knight jr  union pacific corp yeah i think its a reasonable number to assume jason both the  on labor and overall enterprise right around  for the full year jason h seidl  cowen  co llc right and so head count obviously will depend upon whats happening with the volume side robert m knight jr  union pacific corp thats right thats right jason h seidl  cowen  co llc okay fantastic i appreciate the time as always guys operator our next question is from the line of david vernon with sanford bernstein please proceed with your question j david scott vernon  sanford c bernstein  co llc hey good morning guys thanks for taking the question lance i wanted to ask you a question about some of the incentives that you guys maybe have put in place or are talking about putting in place through the board around the drive towards a  or one of the pushbacks we get in sort of recommending your stock is that theres a perception out there maybe management is a little bit taking their time on the margin side there isnt as much of a sense of urgency im just wondering if you guys have had any discussions about trying to address that through some specific initiatives tied towards margin goals or margin achievement lance m fritz  union pacific corp sure i assure you management is not taking its time on trying to improve our margins if you look at our longterm incentive plan our proxy lines out the fact that its built around an improved roic or encouraging us to improve our return on invested capital and in that theres a kicker thats designed around improving our operating margin but all of our incentives essentially line us up whether its our longterm incentive plan or the fact that were all significant shareholders or our shortterm incentive plan theyre essentially all lined up for us to improve our operating margin and our return on invested capital as quickly as we can the payouts get better and grow the faster and better we make those improvements robert m knight jr  union pacific corp and david i have to just jump in here this is rob were actually – while we have every incentive as lance just commented on and proud of the fact that everybody in our organization has  sort of on their mind were driving towards that we are also proud as the largest us railroad to have the lowest operating ratio of the us rails that is something that weve worked hard at and are very proud of and were going to continue that line of thinking to drive us to the  j david scott vernon  sanford c bernstein  co llc yeah and i just wanted to be clear that this is just a perception that i think some investors have in terms of maybe the radical change thats happening in the east and some of the targets that have been put out there even for like norfolk management around margin attainment i was just wondering if you guys were going to be thinking about making that more front and center as far as trying to give the market a little bit of confidence that you guys are really pushing this target toward  and its not just a target thats out there that youre going to drift towards which is lance m fritz  union pacific corp a couple of other reminders right we generated over  million in productivity last year we talked about generating over  million in productivity this year we are not just wandering around in the woods j david scott vernon  sanford c bernstein  co llc i appreciate that and thanks for the color operator our next question is from the line of allison landry with credit suisse please proceed with your questions allison m landry  credit suisse securities usa llc good morning thanks for fitting me in here could you remind us what percentage of your book of business is under multiyear contract and with pricing flat versus q first do you think were at a bottom here and then second could fullyear core price be up versus  on the increase in these inflation escalators alone lance m fritz  union pacific corp beth can you handle those questions on multiyear and what expect out of pricing elizabeth f whited  union pacific corp yeah so we have about  of the business thats in longer term deals with escalators of one sort or another on them we also do expect to see based on market conditions that weve been talking about this morning some improvement as we get towards the end of the year obviously volume helps us improvements in our customers ability to get price in their markets an improving economy helps us and volume can be our friend as well allison m landry  credit suisse securities usa llc okay and just a quick one on frac sand weve obviously seen some announcements from some of your customers for new facilities or expansions so with the significant increase that youve seen in the first quarter and thinking over the next few quarters do you think that at some point during  from a volume standpoint that you could get back to a peak run rate that you saw back in  elizabeth f whited  union pacific corp i dont see us coming back to that sort of a peak in  no we do see good investments happening and we feel positive about whats happening in those markets but i dont think well get back to peak levels soon allison m landry  credit suisse securities usa llc okay thank you lance m fritz  union pacific corp thank you operator our next question is from the line of brian ossenbeck with jpmorgan please proceed with your question james allen  jpmorgan securities llc hi guys its james allen on for brian a question my first question is on protectionism we noticed the softwood lumber penalties that the us is imposing on canada and the canadians have responded proposing a ban on us thermal coal going into canada so i guess we wondered if you had first off any direct exposure to the thermal coal and then just what your view was on protectionism more broadly if you thought there were any major risks or opportunities for your book of business as freight flows might change lance m fritz  union pacific corp ill take the freight the trade question and its broader and you can talk about coal beth so in terms of trade overall our perspective is the following that the us economy is tightly connected to our trading partners we understand that open global trade and more markets available to us manufacturers and producers is critical both for jobs in the united states as well as for the economic vibrancy of the united states we believe that thats well understood also in our current administration and we believe that while there are opportunities to both enforce existing trade agreements enhance them and negotiate new ones that the longterm answer is more markets available to us manufacturers and producers is better than fewer markets available thats essentially the pathway towards economic prosperity and job creation so with that ill let beth answer the thermal coal question elizabeth f whited  union pacific corp so we do not access the export facility in vancouver thats being referenced in the most recent discussions about access the coal that we export off the west coast is hitting locations in california james allen  jpmorgan securities llc great and then a quick followup question would be on the stb theres a slightly changing composition with a new chairperson and new board seats so just wondering in your interactions with the stb has there been any new flavor to your discussions or any changes that youd expect as they progress with existing regulatory initiatives lance m fritz  union pacific corp following the reauthorization in i think it was late  the stb got very active at clearing a docket of a number of different items that were in front of them weve seen that activity slow down a touch which makes sense given that the current administration has the opportunity to appoint board members of that organization what were encouraging the stb as theyre thinking about their docket of work is to not simply just look at each individual item as a standalone item but also bear in mind that they all work together as a quilt of overriding regulation on the industry and to think about the kind of interactivity of all the regulation they are contemplating we look at the stb historically and think the balance theyve struck has been good for the industry and mostly important is good for the customers letting the market work where the market will work and in those unique circumstances that require it imposing regulations so we keep encouraging them to be a deft hand when theyre looking at their docket operator thank you our next question is from the line of walter spracklin with rbc please proceed with your questions unknown speaker good morning this is indiscernible  on for walter spracklin just want to come back to the competitiveness there in the market your growth in grain volumes has remained strong is this a factor of the bumper grain crop moving and the export grain you mentioned or are there other share factors that might be helping to maintain that growth rate elizabeth f whited  union pacific corp yeah i wouldnt call that a share play we saw really strong demand for wheat stronger than weve seen in a while for export largely to mexico as well as good corn movements in the world markets so not a share issue i wouldnt say unknown speaker okay thats very helpful and then just switching to your or here how should we be thinking about the cadence towards an or improvement over the year are there going to be more impactful initiatives that could land in one quarter or do you expect it to be a more even pace over the year thank you robert m knight jr  union pacific corp yeah this is rob we dont give guidance by quarter on operating ratio but as a reminder we are giving guidance that we expect to improve our operating ratio for the full year but it never is a straight line volumes will dictate largely exactly what that cadence ends up being but were very focused on continuing to drive productivity we talked about the pricing a component of this being challenged in the first part of the year and hopefully improving later in the year so i wouldnt give you any indication that it would be a straight line it could be lumpy but the focus is the full year number lance m fritz  union pacific corp this quarter is a great example rob where whatd we have  percentage points impact by fuel lag robert m knight jr  union pacific corp yeah good point fuel can always be a factor in that unknown speaker all right thanks so much operator our next question comes from the line of justin long with stephens please proceed with your questions justin long  stephens inc thanks and good morning so just to follow up on intermodal i dont want to beat a dead horse here but from a directional standpoint do you think domestic intermodal pricing will still be up this year and you mentioned competitive pricing pressure in intermodal and really what i just want to get a sense for here is i want to understand how much of that is related to domestic intermodal versus international intermodal elizabeth f whited  union pacific corp the domestic and international intermodal are both under pricing pressure i would say we saw perhaps an acceleration of the pricing pressure in the domestic intermodal space in the first quarter again depending on what happens in those markets and what happens as we see the tightening capacity that we expect with electronic log books will really be the things that will determine what ends up happening overall with your pricing for the year justin long  stephens inc okay thats helpful but do you still think theres a possibility for your domestic intermodal pricing to be up in  lance m fritz  union pacific corp justin we dont guide on price specific to commodities justin long  stephens inc okay fair enough and then secondly i was wondering if you could give some additional color on the assumption youre making for coal volumes within the full year guidance what are you assuming for growth in coal volumes in the second quarter and just to clarify some of the earlier commentary were you suggesting that coal volumes in the back half of the year are likely to be relatively flat on a yearoveryear basis robert m knight jr  union pacific corp justin this is rob let me take a stab at that and as you know we dont give specific precise guidance by commodity for the year but i would just – as it relates to coal i would just remind you of some of the comments that beth made earlier and that is it feels stable to us the things to watch in coal as always will largely be whats happening with gas prices and whats happening with weather that will dictate from quarter to quarter whats actually happening with volume the other thing we did point out is that we do have an easier comp as we head into the second quarter as it relates to our overall volumes including coal and if you look at our last year numbers that kind of flips later in the year the third quarter gets a little more challenging so i think i would expect all things being constant that youll see some changes from quartertoquarter as it relates to yearoveryear volume growth in the coal line again comps are easier in the second quarter and get challenged in the third quarter and it feels like a stable environment for us justin long  stephens inc okay great ill leave it at that i appreciate the time lance m fritz  union pacific corp thank you justin operator our next question is from the line of ben hartford with robert w baird please proceed with your questions zax rosenberg  robert w baird  co inc broker hi this is actually zax rosenberg on for ben thanks for taking the question so late here just wanted to – a couple for me just wanted to follow up first on the trade questions from before and see if you have any specific thoughts on the proposed lumber tariff from earlier this week and how that potentially impacts your guys business specifically and then secondly flipping back over to intermodal there was a comment earlier about a volume push ahead of the some of the ocean freight the carrier lines changes and just wondering the expected impact of those alliance shifts and maybe possible diversion of ships to canadian ports or what your thoughts are generally there thank you elizabeth f whited  union pacific corp okay on the softwood lumber we really feel like those tariffs were priced in where you saw a very significant runup in the lumber prices in the first quarter so that doesnt feel like thats going to be impactful in terms of volume to us and then on the intermodal side in terms of the alliances that is still shaking itself out in terms of port usage and whos calling where and what size of ship and those sorts of things right now it seems to be going pretty well were not seeing any significant disruptions feels like the process is playing out well as you know there is more capacity coming online in canada later in the year i would expect that a large amount of that could be utilized for canadian shipping needs so were not really expecting to see significant shifts at this point but well have to see how it plays out and it will be wedded with the alliances lance m fritz  union pacific corp hey zax going back to your softwood lumber question whats really critical to us is getting housing starts and construction up we have a wonderful franchise that kind of regardless of where the woods coming from we just need it to be consumed zax rosenberg  robert w baird  co inc broker great thanks for the color operator the next question is from the line of brian konigsberg with vertical research please proceed with your questions brian adam konigsberg  vertical research partners llc hi good morning thanks for taking my question a lot of ground has been covered already just curious on the performance on rtms versus carloads obviously very good performance in rtms and also the relative difference in the carloads presumably like the haul just curious should we expect that theres going to be that type of divergence for the remainder of the year or might those kind of come together as we progress through the year robert m knight jr  union pacific corp yeah brian this is rob that measure and i kind of made this reference earlier in the qa that rtm impact that youre referring to was largely driven in the first quarter by the upswing in the coal volumes and were not going to give guidance in terms of how thats going to play out for the year because what will drive that is whats the mix of the volume that we in fact see come across the book brian adam konigsberg  vertical research partners llc right okay and actually this is more of a kind of theoreticaltype question im not sure how many specifics you can provide but just given the discussion around tax and proposals on rates and previously there was discussion on the treatment of deduction on debt interest in the pl so i dont know if you ran these scenarios through and have some thoughts around if they do not allow or they disallow interest tax deductions might that change the capital allocation policies that you currently have in place lance m fritz  union pacific corp rob you want to take that robert m knight jr  union pacific corp yeah theres a lot of devil in the details on the tax proposals we like everyone are staying in tuned and watching what happens on that but so yeah there could be some impact i wouldnt envision that depending on how the interest plays out i wouldnt envision that would change our capital spending or our debt guidance that weve given i wouldnt envision that that will be the result of any changes as it relates to the interest brian adam konigsberg  vertical research partners llc got it all right thank you operator thank you there are no further questions at this time i would like to turn the floor back over to mr lance fritz for closing comments lance m fritz  union pacific corp okay thank you rob and thank you for your questions and interest in union pacific we look forward to talking with all of you again in july operator this concludes todays teleconference you may
