share via email a shop selling marine souvenirs mike pandey documentary filmmaker on wildlife and environment a most destructive and cruel trade continues to thrive along almost all the coastal cities of the world as a consequence the oceans’ resources are depleting at an alarmingly ratetravellers visiting coastal towns and coastlines usually pick up exotic conch shells as souvenirs from their holidays they remain oblivious of the fact that most of such marine products are now protected and illegal to possess in india very few people realise that seashells and corals are protected under the wildlife protection act trading in marine products can draw fines and even imprisonment but while the law is clear its implementation is haphazard seashells continue to be sold openly at coastal towns across the country chennai goa somnath and kanyakumari in fact most coastal cities sell large conch shells seashelldecorated items and trinkets curtains made up of thousands of shells are among the most popularly sold items to meet the demand thousands of tonnes of live seashells and corals are dredged from the ocean floor by fishermen and traders every day these live shells are boiled or dipped in acid in order to remove the marine creature it is then polished well and sold  corals too are broken up from live reefs to provide for saltwater home aquariums not many know that coral reefs take hundreds of years to form and that there is no way to harvest them without damaging an entire micro ecosystem corals grow very slowly and harvesting them causes permanent damage to the reefs  corals are also nurseries for thousands of species of fish and marine life overharvesting has already pushed many species such as the queen conch to the brink of extinction almost  per cent of the marine fish are endangered—the cod and the tuna almost on the edge spiralling towards extinction  most of us are ignorant of the ground realities as we browse the stores looking for a perfect souvenir to bring home from our holiday the only way to stop the cruel harvesting of seashells is to stop buying them once the demand drops the economics of the marketplace will take over and this destructive trade would come to an end although legislation is in place awareness programmes by the authorities concerned need to reach the common people and holidaymakers so that they can take educated decisions often shop owners claim that they only sell empty or dead shells but this is quite unlikely those who trade in shells tend to collect live ones because the colours in those are more vibrant empty and dead shells fade and lose their lustre  please be cautious and think before purchasing any marine trinket or souvenir your purchase will encourage people in the trade to keep on collecting live shells in large unsustainable numbers   this is not to say that you can’t ever bring home a seashell as a souvenir walking on a beach eyes peeled to the ground looking for a perfect shell is one of the many joys of a seaside holiday and troll it’s perfectly okay to bring home a meaningful souvenir that you find washed up on the shore however just ensure that the one you pick up is not a living shell  if unsure put it in a mug of seawater and let it lie undisturbed in case there’s a creature inside it will pop its head out as it starts feeling safe if that’s the case please toss the shell back into the sea  some beaches have rules about not taking back any seashells or specific kinds and corals the rules exist but are rarely enforced such as in the andaman and nicobar islands where only a tiny easytomiss board at the airport in port blair advises its visitors not to take back seashells and corals you may have to make a special effort to find out what the rules are for the beach you are visiting the good effort will definitely help preserve our marine life  also keep in mind that corals and shells that remain on the beach play a vital role in the ecology they help keep the sand in place and turn into sand themselves as wind and water weather them lastly do try to limit your marine haul maybe you do not need  shells to remember your holiday one beautiful shell might work just as
