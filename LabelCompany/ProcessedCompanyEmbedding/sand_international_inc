shielding and protection in ukraine as of the date of the prospectus the only company that we are aware of that provides consulting services in electromagnetic field detection shielding and protection is sgs ukraine httpwwwsgsgroupcomua located in odessa we will not be differentiating ourselves from the foregoing but merely competing with them the consulting industry in electromagnetic fields detection shielding and protection is fragmented and competitive and may be difficult to penetrate our competitive position within the industry is negligible in light of the fact that we have limited operations older wellestablished companies companies with substantial customer bases longer operating histories and better financial positions currently attract customers since we have limited operations we cannot compete with them on the basis of reputation we do expect to compete with them on the basis of the quality of the consulting services that we provide there can be no assurance that we can maintain a competitive position against current or future competitors particularly those with greater financial client database marketing service technical and other resources our failure to maintain a competitive position within the market could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operations at this time our principal method of competition will be through personal contact with potential clients some of the additional competitive factors that may affect our business are as follows  number of competitors increase other companies may follow our business model of offering consulting services to the potential customers in ukraine and europe which will reduce our competitive edge  price our competitors may be offering similar service at a lower price forcing us to lower our prices as well and possibly offer our service at loss company description sand international inc was incorporated in the state of nevada on june   and
