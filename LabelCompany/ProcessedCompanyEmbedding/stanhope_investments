substantial private clients charities and endowments across the world as stated elsewhere on this website our overriding objective is to protect and increase the real wealth of our clients by achieving superior returns while minimising investment risks to an agreed level as we are not in the business of selling inhouse products to our clients we are able to look for the best investments to meet their needs without placing artificial restrictions on that search we aim to find the best investment managers and solutions across all asset classes irrespective of geographic location consistent with that objective and aim our principal strategy is to invest in funds which are managed by other investment managers who may have committed to the code as part of that we may on occasions invest directly into corporate vehicles such as investment trusts whether those vehicles are funds or otherwise we consider how to use the voting rights we have but must also take into account our objective of achieving superior returns while minimising investment risk to that agreed level consequently we may consistent with the level of risk decide to exit an investment where we disagree with the manager’s strategy and reinvest elsewhere rather than committing to spend a long period trying to change the manager’s strategy therefore while we support the general objectives behind the code we do not consider that it is appropriate for us to commit to the code discretionary management for private clients and institutions find out more about our core investment management

tool money is just a thing basic finances stanhope investments llc for your financial freedom jul   help how do i get a an apartment with bad credit or no credit published by eric under bad credit what to do find your audience if you haven’t found out already the larger apartment complexes and management teams will not be very open to renting to you they spend a fortune on advertising and as such will have a large number of tenants to choose from cry if you want to but let me save you some cash right now you can thank me later “you’d be wasting your time and money…” large companies run things by the numbers people with low credit scores tend to not pay their rent thats just statistics you can certainly try but unless you’re very convincing i think you’d be wasting your time and money on application fees your best bet is to find a small mom and pop operation and talk with them right up front most of their references will be from word of mouth free website postings and good old signs posted in the front yard don’t make the mistake of thinking you can just sweet talk your way into an ideal little apartment this is a unique little group just because they don’t have a system in place and an army of lawyers don’t think they are a bunch of knuckle heads that are waiting to help you out these folks are even more paranoid than large apartment complexes when you’ve got the time google a search for “professional tenant horror stories” you need to present yourself as a great tenant that will respect a landlords property scratch that you need to be a great tenant that will respect a landlords property and you need to prove it step one set yourself up to shine what is an ideal tenant for a small mom and pop landlord one that they don’t know exists an ideal tenant pays rent on time hooks up the utilities before they move into the unit lives a clean drugfree life each adult has a bachelors degree a steady middle management job of five years in a field thats stable if the tenants are a family it is a family of two nobel prize winning kids the ideal tenant has no drama but does have a long list of references that have known them for years and can attest as to how immaculately they left their last residence and how courteous they were to their fellow neighbors one that communicates clearly and with as few words as possible if you have bad credit it is your job to prove which of these characteristics you have as well as possible you need to be well organized and committed before meeting with a landlord get their application ahead of time fill it out get a letter from your employer stating how long you’ve been employed what your job is and how much you earn if you are new to the area get a letter from your previous employer stating the same thing if you are self employed get yourself a copy of your tax returns scan or photo copy all of these documents if you can email this to your potential landlord ahead of time you’ll be way ahead of the rest of your competition step  the number one thing to do because you have bad credit prequalify your landlord yep lets weed out the bad landlords do this by including a brief cover letter write in a formal but not a stuffy tone explain briefly exactly what you are looking for keep in mind it does not have to be exactly what the landlord is advertising ideally it shouldn’t be now since you have negative information about yourself bring it up first remember you are trying to get a very paranoid owner to hand over the keys to their investment you need to show that you understand and appreciate their concerns what you are doing is opening a conversation this letter may be the only time you get the chance to pitch yourself so make it good acknowledge that you had some set backs this shows respect for yourself and those you deal with identify some steps that you’ve taken maybe sold a car you couldn’t afford or are downsizing to a more affordable rental unit finish by asking for a simple bit of help as you continue on your path to improving your credit cutting to the chase shows that you value thier time in fact you may want to write that in there just to emphasize the point also by bringing it up first you eliminate a bad suprise and acknowledge that you are responsible you may think this will knock you off of thier list of candidates it might and that’s fine at least you won’t waste your money on an application fee rest assured anyone that turns you down at this point will have turned you down as soon as the credit report gets back to them they’re paranoid and if you don’t bring this up they’ll think you’ve lied to them true you’ve wasted some time but you’ve also organized your files and practiced your pitch step  ready to begin your pitch okay so you’ve found some ads and phone numbers from signs give them a call if it sounds like a company you can pretty much hang up if it sounds like a hesitant person congrats you’ve found a small time landlord or you got the number wrong  this is your route to success remember though they won’t know you at all so it wont be an easy sell on one hand they’ve probably had nonpaying tenants and on the other they certainly will have heard plenty of horror stories luckily you’ve got that cover letter and you know what they are looking for in an ideal tenant to start the conversation keep it simple and nonassuming you want to build a little rapport start by talking about the property “is the property still available great do you have a few moments to talk about it great well first off if i meet your standards how soon can i move in” it should go without saying to be overly polite next ask for their requirements mostly they’ll just say that they want the rent in on time write down any additional requirements now remember you are trying to show you are professional and will be a smart fiscally minded tenant ask the estimated monthly utilities they may not know so you can ask if it has energy efficient appliances fans shading from trees vaulted ceilings which are more expensive to heat and cool now be honest about being able to meet their rent if not don’t lead them on just say “well i wish i could but i know i cannot afford that right now” maybe they will lower the rent if it all sounds good tell them “it all sounds great and i want you to send me an application so i can get it all filled out ahead of time but i have to be honest and i really don’t want to waste your time i don’t have the most ideal credit if that’s a deal breaker for you i totally understand” they may want an explanation tell them short and direct if they object thank them for their time and then ask if they know anyone who would be open to helping you out end with “if you change your mind here’s my phone number feel free to contact me” thanks again if they are open to having you as a tenant send them all your info and their application filled out then contact them again to set up a date to check out the property don’t let them set up a date without looking over your paperwork you want them sold before you waste your time never do this do not and let me repeat that do not pay or even offer to pay multiple months of rent up front while it sounds like simple idea that would solve a lot of headaches it opens up too much legal problems for the landlord and it handcuffs you as a tenant lets face it there are plenty of crummy landlords out there hopefuly you won’t have to resort to this but it does get results the best approach offer a larger security deposit than the landlord is asking there are certain legal rights you are entitled to with a security deposit with a bit of proper documentation and a little bit of forethought you can be assured that you will be fully refunded rest assured obtaining a nice rental in a nice area can be done even if you have bad or no credit it just takes a little smarts best of luck eric gross no responses yet oct   market stabilization vs home buyer assistant published by eric under general okay so everyone is aware by now that the housing bubble was created by people borrowing more than they could afford money was easy to come by and you could buy a home sell it for a profit people thought they were geniuses prices rose even better people now had money for serious down payments to buy the dream homes they “deserved” or more likely thought hey prices are going up by  a year i can buy a more expensive one live like a player for a few years then sell it a more expensive “investment” home would yield a higher return take the profit from that and buy a home outright retire at  and live the good life then reality set in buyers became scarce owners couldn’t keep making mortgage payments home repairs and everyday living expenses banks started foreclosing so they looked at their loose lending policies and tightened them up resulting in even fewer buyers the market adjusted prices returned to realistic and even bargain levels in short people who shouldn’t have had money to play with and little experience with housing bought houses creating a market bubble in georgia in my favorite area you can buy a  bedroom bath for  and if there’s a little bit of repair work needed you can cut that price by a third now if you’re smart and ambitious you’ve got money saved up you can figure out cost of owning repairing and living you can capitalize on this in a big way using a few simple calculations you can even see if its smarter to rent it out generate a tax sheltered cash flow or live in the home if you have no money to purchase and more importantly have no experience owning a home the government will give you  tax credit for buying a new house you’ll also qualify for for st time lender rates and even with somewhat questionable credit fha secured loans now if this is a second home or a rental property you are exclnded from these bonuses in short people with limited cash and no experience are now encouraged and able to buy homes now i know i’ve seen this approach before… no responses yet mar   the american recovery and reinvestment act published by eric under general i just

a new property manager in place for bixler and lenora church moved someone into bixler had a handful of issues apparently the tenant homevestors had in place for me not only had to be evicted but had

craigslist ads and a link to bixler the duplex in snellville has taken a bit longer to rent out had to get creative pricing and will have someone move in for the beginning of february i heard the news on january nd of course my property manager will take his first months cut you know for opening the doors and having the paperwork hey it is tough work being a property manager i’ve also cut some personal expenses so i should be able to get to march without busting heavily into the reserves i need more cash flowing properties and have been keeping an eye on the bay for something that fits my needs no responses yet nov   bixler hits hard times published by eric under  bixler ouch well this property has now been vacant for two months i wound up having to have the tenant evicted after failing to pay back in september times are tough and they’ve hit pretty hard i may have to let this one go which ofcourse will tank my credit viranni did cover the eviction expenses and recommended a property manager but i’m afraid i can only float this one for another month or so before having to let it slip away but i’m not about to go gentle into that good night i’ve got silas frazier in charge

yesterdays purchase at  to close at  i placed a stop order to close at  and a limit sell of  selling off two thirds of the purchase the option won’t come due for about thirty days and i expected and still expect the timber reit’s stock price will continue to climb so i figured cash if it rises sharply and protect myself with the stop order at  and hold a third no matter what for expected monthly gains however opening price to day was  which triggered my sale ouch team bushpaulson tauting economic stability threw a curve ball by agreeing to purchase all illiquid assets held by the financial companies serious we’ll help the economy by purchasing things that are worthless with your tax dollar i suspect that was why the sudden decrease from closing price of pcl at  to current flat line at  taking the price of my options with it but its all an illusion financial stocks c gs ms snv are up today  to  lessons learned capitalize when you can put a limit order when the value has doubled as soon as you buy the stock one triggers other as for security stop limit orders should end at close of day clearly i’m still learning things just as i see a philosophy it gets turned yesterday they announced no fed rate cut and my silver and commodities increased contrary to what should have happened today they announce a huge spending of the american tax dollar which should push up silver yet it only increased  points  no responses yet sep   market watch published by eric under stocks so okay the us financials market is in turmoil i’ve got my eye on a few things and am trying to figure how to profit for that i need to journal my wins losses and reasonings feds announced yesterday that they will not be cutting the rates which should restore some faith to the dollar but that will take some time silver and gold on the other hand increased  and  percent today while the rest of the market dropped makes sense with all the news has stirred fears making some cling to commodities though long term should strengthen the dollar how long a term is that twenty years in two days the options market will be active as all september options will expire then that should mean there will be some movement can’t say i’ll know exactly up or down but i’ll place some calls when the market opens in my favorite timber reit pcl also taking calls on dba a commodities futures fund the dow is down to  a small  from yesterday well off from monday mornings open at  sunday night you’ll recall a bailout deal fell apart for lehman brothers creating panic and the downward spiral would have been great to see that coming oddly the money gains i made this month were early in the month calls on citigroup and puts in bucy and exm all of which had seen big hype over the past few months lost money on puts in aig placed on monday and puts in joyg trying to replicate my wins on bucy also lost on equinix puts which had appeared to be dropping it continued to but unless there is a point drop between now
