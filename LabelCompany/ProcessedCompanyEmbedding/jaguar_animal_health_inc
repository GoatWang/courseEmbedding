products and veterinary supplies for dairy and livestock producers additionally in conjunction with the launch of neonorm™ calf jaguar recently hired the first of several planned sales representatives to spearhead a focused direct sales effort intended to provide continuity for the education and scientific promotion of neonorm™ calf and to complement animart’s efforts in the sixstate “midwest” territory according to ian parker jaguar’s vice president of commercial development “the neonorm™ calf launch at the word dairy expo is a key milestone achievement for jaguar this is a meeting where global opinion leaders in the dairy industry including veterinarians dairy producers and industry partners convene to evaluate cuttingedge research in the field and modern technologies as scours causes significant financial loss to the dairy industry this meeting represents an important opportunity for jaguar to communicate the positive health and economic benefits of our product to the dairy community” “additionally” parker noted “jaguar believes that animart’s regional leadership combined with the impact of their recently hosted continuing education program to highlight calf care for certified veterinary technicians will increase the effectiveness of our outreach efforts” jaguar indicated the regional neonorm™ calf launch will focus on several key dairy states including wisconsin
