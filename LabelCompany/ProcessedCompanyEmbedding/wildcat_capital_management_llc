board of sorrento therapeutics wildcat capital issues letter to board of sorrento therapeutics demonstrates that sorrento ceo management and board are destroying significant shareholder value by failing to properly manage company operations and assetsbelieves management and board have engaged in multiple transactions that reflect blatant conflictsofinterest and selfdealingcalls on board to replace ceo terminate financing transactions and initiate a sale process for the company news provided by wildcat capital management llc may    et share this article new york may   prnewswire  wildcat capital management llc wildcat whose clients hold an ownership stake of  of the common stock of sorrento therapeutics inc nasdaq srne the company or sorrento today sent a letter to the companys board of directors the board urging the board to take specific actions to remedy the ongoing destruction of significant shareholder value  in particular the letter calls for the board to immediately terminate and replace dr henry ji as chief executive officer and to stop recently announced financing transactions to avoid further dilution to the existing shareholders  the letter also calls for the appointment of three wildcat nominees to the board to lead a special committee authorized to initiate a sales process for the company the letter outlines in detail several serious issues that reveal that dr ji sorrentos management team and its board have engaged in egregious and improper selfdealing and are squandering the companys assets including among other things the company has repeatedly transferred assets to newly created subsidiaries and then granted stock options and warrants to acquire significant amounts of stock in those subsidiaries at nominal prices to dr ji other executives and nonemployee directors the company has wasted money and time on numerous imprudent transactions that have destroyed shareholder value the company has repeatedly demonstrated an utter lack of fiscal and operational discipline the company has entered into inappropriate financing transactions including the pending highly dilutive sale of shares in which it effectively granted a free option to new investors to acquire  of the company at a price that is near the week low for the companys shares the letter calls upon the sorrento board of directors to meet wildcats demands to promptly take action to protect and maximize shareholder value or to immediately resign and allow another slate of directors to effect such actions the full text of the letter is below may   by email and fedex board of directors co sorrento therapeutics inc  judicial drive san diego ca  attn  corporate secretary dear directors i write on behalf of wildcat liquid alpha llc wla and bonderman family limited partnership bflp and together with wla the wildcat shareholders who collectively own  shares of common stock of sorrento therapeutics inc sorrento or the company  the wildcat shareholders believe that the companys chief executive officer ceo dr henry ji has consistently acted in a manner that is not in the best interests of shareholders and has destroyed significant shareholder value  further the wildcat shareholders believe that the companys board of directors the board has failed to act in the best interests of shareholders and that the directors have breached their fiduciary duties as set forth more fully herein three serious issues have come to light that expose the failure of dr ji and the board to properly manage the company as well as the intentional waste and diversion of company assets  first over the past several months the company has been acquiring andor transferring assets to newly created whollyowned subsidiaries and then issuing significant amounts of those subsidiaries shares back to the companys executive officers and directors through significant grants of options and warrants for class b supervoting stock all exercisable for nominal consideration thereby engineering a personal benefit for such officers and directors at the direct expense of the company and its shareholders  second the company has entered into and the board has approved numerous imprudent transactions including i the licensing of valuable assets to third parties including newly created joint ventures pursuant to arrangements where the company has lost the ability to control the development and monetization of those assets and ii the investment of significant capital to acquire minority interests in companies and joint ventures where the company has little or no control or influence in effect turning the company into a passive investor in entities controlled by others  third the company has demonstrated a complete inability to exercise financial discipline and has repeatedly entered into transactions in which it has acquired scientific assets without the financial ability to either pay for those assets or further develop them to a stage where they can be monetized  as a result to its detriment the company has been forced to renegotiate its obligations on several occasions and to enter into bargain sales of valuable assets  even further the company has entered into inappropriate financing transactions without the proper consideration of less costly alternatives including the massively dilutive financing that the company recently announced in which it effectively granted a free option to new investors to acquire  of the company at a price that is near the week low for the companys shares through the improper conduct of dr ji and the board the assets of the company  and therefore of its shareholders  are being looted and the value of the remaining assets dramatically diminished  accordingly we call upon the board to take immediate steps to protect and maximize shareholder value  in addition we request that the board immediately terminate dr ji as ceo or if it refuses to do so to resign and allow another slate of directors to do so i     improper option and warrant grants by subsidiaries to        sorrento executives and board members we have recently learned of an egregious series of transactions that reflect blatant conflictsofinterest and selfdealing by dr ji and other company executive officers endorsed and abetted by the board  in short the company has repeatedly transferred assets to newly created subsidiaries and then granted stock options to acquire significant amounts of stock at nominal prices to dr ji other executives and nonemployee directors of the company  compounding that misconduct dr ji has also taken for himself warrants to acquire extraordinary numbers of shares that have  votes per share  all for nominal consideration these equity stakes are in addition to the equity stakes in sorrento already granted to dr ji and the other members of management and the board effectively double dipping at the direct expense of the company and its shareholders  in addition these grants represent uncrossed virtually free options in each of the subsidiaries creating a situation where dr ji and the other recipients win even if the company and its other shareholders do not as disclosed in item  of the companys amendment no  dated april   amendment no  to its annual report on form k five of sorrentos subsidiaries have issued stock options to certain company executive officers and unidentified nonemployee members of the board  the five sorrento subsidiaries that issued such stock options are tnk therapeutics inc tnk la cell inc la cell sorrento biologics inc biologics concortis biosystems corp cbc and scintilla pharmaceuticals inc scintilla  in addition to dr ji other company executive officers that received such stock options are george ng executive vice president chief administrative officer and chief legal officer and jeffrey su executive vice president and chief operating officer in a telling sign of selfdealing dr ji is the president and ceo of four of the five subsidiaries tnk la cell cbc and scintilla that issued the stock options to him messrs ng and su and the unidentified nonemployee members of the board  each of the five subsidiaries have also issued warrants to dr ji to purchase class b common stock that have to voting rights thus giving dr ji super voting rights through this scheme the equity value in the companys subsidiaries has literally been ripped away from the companys shareholders and given instead to company insiders including the individual directors  by any standard this scheme constitutes various breaches of the fiduciary duties owed to the companys shareholders by the companys board its directors and its officers  the specifics of the scheme as identified in amendment no  are as follows in may  tnk granted options to purchase   and  shares of common stock to messrs ji ng and su respectively at an initial exercise price of  per share  tnk also granted a warrant to dr ji to purchase  shares of tnk class b common stock that have  to  voting rights  additionally tnk granted options to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock to certain unidentified nonemployee members of the board at an initial exercise price of  per share in may  la cell granted options to purchase   and  shares of common stock to messrs ji ng and su respectively at an initial exercise price of  per share  la cell also granted a warrant to dr ji to purchase  shares of la cell class b common stock that have  to  voting rights  additionally la cell granted options to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock to certain unidentified nonemployee members of the board at an initial exercise price of  per share in october  cbc granted options to purchase  and  shares of common stock to messrs ji and ng respectively at an initial exercise price of  per share  in may  cbc also granted a warrant to dr ji to purchase  shares of cbc class b common stock that have  to  voting rights  additionally cbc granted options to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock to certain unidentified nonemployee members of the board at an initial exercise price of  per share in october  biologics granted options to purchase   and  shares of common stock to messrs ji ng and su respectively at an initial exercise price of  per share  biologics also granted a warrant to dr ji to purchase  shares of biologics class b common stock that have  to  voting rights  additionally biologics granted options to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock to certain unidentified nonemployee members of the board at an initial exercise price of  per share in october  scintilla granted options to purchase  and  shares of common stock to messrs ji and ng respectively at an initial exercise price of  per share  scintilla also granted a warrant to dr ji to purchase  shares of scintilla class b common stock that have  to  voting rights  additionally scintilla granted options to purchase an aggregate of approximately  shares of common stock to certain unidentified nonemployee members of the board at an initial exercise price of  per share based on these belated disclosures this series of transactions appears to be little more than a looting of company assets by dr ji other company executives and perhaps most disturbingly the purportedly independent nonemployee members of the board  this is little more than theft and demonstrates a fundamental willingness of this board and this management to put their own personal interests above those of sorrento and its shareholders a situation that cannot continue ii     the failures of management and the board          regarding the companys operations management and the board have also failed in their responsibilities to manage and supervise the operations of the company  we believe that the company has failed to exercise any fiscal or operating discipline and has made numerous poor decisions  the company has expended far too much money and time collecting assets and not enough money or time actually developing and monetizing those assets  the company has also wasted corporate assets with incessant financial engineering including by repeatedly placing technology into newly created subsidiaries with the goal of financing them separately andor spinning them off into separate standalone companies  to date of course none of those expensive and timeconsuming efforts has resulted in any significant fundraising or development progress  dr ji has shown no ability to develop a responsible and cogent business plan supported by the financial resources of the company  instead the company has overextended itself repeatedly and has made financial commitments that it has been unable to honor  the company has also made a number of seemingly passive minority investments in public and private companies controlled by other parties  in allowing this to happen the companys board has failed miserably in its responsibility to the companys shareholders  below is a sampling of the numerous instances in which the company has made poor decisions and the board has failed to exercise appropriate oversight first the company has licensed valuable assets to third parties and retained little or no control or influence over the development and monetization of those assets  for example in april  the company entered into a license agreement with nantcell llc nantcell a private company controlled by dr patrick soonshiong pursuant to which the company licensed a number of antibodies antibody drug conjugates and cartnk products in exchange for  million in cash and  million of stock in nantcell  apparently the  million of illiquid stock was an insufficient investment for the company so it proceeded to invest the valuable cash it received by purchasing an additional  million of stock in nantcell  however as noted in the companys most recent form k the ownership interest in nantcell does not provide the company with any control or the ability to exercise significant influence over nantcell so the monetization of these assets and of the investment in nantcell are subject completely to the actions of outside parties second the lack of financial discipline in the company led it to sell cynviloq™ long before it had reached its potential value  the company bought cynviloq™ in  as part of the acquisition of igdrasol inc igdrasol  because it did not have the financial wherewithal to support clinical trials required to gain approval for the drug in july  the company sold igdrasol to nantpharma llc nantpharma for  million in cash plus potential future payments related to certain development and regulatory milestones  although the sales agreement was given confidential treatment dr soonshiong the controlling shareholder of nantpharma has publicly represented that there has been no progress on cynviloq™ since the sale and that all data required for regulatory approval would need to be redone  thus it is uncertain whether any future proceeds from the igdrasol sale will be received by the company third the company has repeatedly made minority investments in joint ventures and other entities controlled by third parties with little control or influence over the outcome of those investments  for example in april  the company entered an agreement to invest  million in exchange for a  interest in a joint venture with nantcell known as nantibody llc nantibody  as of september   nantibody had no significant operations and had recorded a net loss of  million for the period from its inception  in july  the company entered into another agreement to invest  million in exchange for a  interest in a joint venture with nantbioscience inc nantbioscience known as nantcancerstemcell llc nantstem  the company also contributed a number of potentially valuable small molecule compounds to nantstem  as of december   only five months after making the investment the company had to write down its nantstem investment by   similarly in april  the company invested  million to acquire one million shares of nantbioscience another private company owned by dr soonshiong  each of these transactions took valuable cash resources away from the companys own development resources in favor of obtaining minority investments in privately held opaque entities about which the shareholders of sorrento have been provided little or no information fourth the company has repeatedly made financial commitments that it has been unable to honor  as noted above the company made commitments to make minority investments of  million in each of nantibody and nantstem  with insufficient cash resources the company was seemingly forced to sell its interest in igdrasol in a poorly thoughtout sale as noted above to fund its investment obligations  the majority of the cash proceeds from the sale of igdrasol were invested in nantibody and nantstem but because the company did not have enough cash to meet its commitments and fund other needs it was forced to renegotiate the nantstem deal to reduce its funding obligation from  million to  million  as part of this negotiation the company was forced to grant an option to two entities controlled by dr soonshiong to acquire shares of nantkwest inc nantkwest held by the company depriving the company of substantial upside  the nantstem renegotiation is but one example of the company making cash commitments it could not honor  in august  at a time when the company was already suffering from a lack of cash it entered into two commitments to acquire technologies to drop into a new subsidiary tnk  however due to lack of cash the company was unable to honor its obligations to pay for these acquisitions and has since had to renegotiate to extend the date on which such payments must be made  also in august  the company entered into an agreement to develop and commercialize certain antibodies that it licensed from mabtech limited a holding company for antibody development and manufacturing companies in china  pursuant to the agreement the company made an initial license payment of  million and remains committed to make additional payments totaling up to  million over the next four years  it is unclear how the company is going to find the cash required to make these payments and develop these assets especially since such development will require many more millions of dollars for clinical trials and approvals in the locations where the company has marketing rights north america the european union and japan iii     the failures of management and the board           regarding financing of the company in light of the companys mismanagement of its assets and its balance sheet it is not surprising that it is in need of financing  despite the fact that the company had great visibility into its future cash needs it waited a perilously long time to seek to raise that cash  and in finally doing so the company failed miserably  apparently without conducting any sort of normal capital raising process  shockingly it failed to retain an investment banker and to our knowledge did not have any substantive discussions with any of its existing investors  on april   the company entered into contemporaneous purchase agreements with two investor groups the investors whereby such investors will invest up to approximately  million in separate private placements in newly issued common stock at  per share and receive warrants to purchase common stock with an exercise price of  per share collectively the financing transactions  if the company issues all of the shares contemplated by the financing transactions it will issue  shares of common stock to the investors representing over  of the companys outstanding shares posttransactions   the companys shareholders have not been provided with sufficient information about these financing transactions to determine among other things  i the likelihood that the transactions will actually close and the specifics of any condition that may cause the transactions not to close ii the actual number of shares of common stock that may be acquired in the case of one of the investors the companys filing states that up to  million of shares may be sold iii the transactions dilutive effect on the companys existing shareholders iv any other relationship or agreements between any of the investors and the company v the relationship if any between the investors or any agreements amongst the investors with respect to the company vi the governance rights of any investor or the investors collectively vii whether a vote by the companys shareholders is required to approve the transactions viii whether the transactions constitute a change of control under applicable regulations and law including without limitation pursuant to rule  of the nasdaq stock market rules and ix whether the board complied with its fiduciary duties as applicable to the transactions under delaware law  wla made a formal request for such information and filed a complaint in the delaware court of chancery seeking such information but was rebuffed by the company  why does the company feel that it need not disclose to its shareholders important information concerning these transactions  in fact just this week in announcing that it had closed one of the private placements for  million the company revealed for the first time that the investor in this private placement had agreed to vote all shares owned by such investor as instructed by the board of directors of the company  this voting agreement was not included in the companys disclosure to shareholders at any time prior to the closing of such transaction  this is yet another blatant attempt by dr ji and the board to mislead shareholders and further entrench themselves in complete disregard for the fundamental governance rights of shareholders one thing that is abundantly clear from the companys disclosure regarding the financing transactions is that rather than maximizing value for the companys shareholders the financing transactions will have a massive dilutive effect on the existing shareholders  the price at which the newly issued common stock is being offered ie  per share represents a price per share that is near the week low of  and very far from the week high of   the sale of such a large amount of stock at such low prices is simply not justified  moreover according to the companys public disclosures the financing transactions purchase agreements provide the investors with a due diligence out effectively granting the investors a free option to make the investment or even worse walk away from the financing transactions after the company has further depleted its cash reserves leaving the company vulnerable and with fewer if any available options    despite its lack of financial discipline and failure to operate and develop its assets within the constraints of its balance sheet the company is not without other means to finance its most important development projects  as of december   the company owned  million of nantkwest common stock that was carried on its balance sheet as available for sale  why has dr ji or the board not looked to this nonstrategic asset as a potential source of financing  further in the past the wildcat shareholders have communicated directly to dr ji that they would be interested in providing financing for the company  the wildcat shareholders offered to sign a nondisclosure agreement but were never offered the opportunity to do so  we have also been told by another significant shareholder of the company that it offered to discuss financing for the company but was also rebuffed  why did dr ji or the board not engage with the wildcat shareholders or other existing shareholders to discuss financing alternatives  finally we understand from our previous discussions with dr ji that several large companies have expressed interest in acquiring the entire company or certain assets of the company at valuations that imply a significantly higher stock price than current levels  why have dr ji and the board not engaged an investment banker to explore such a sale  no matter the course of action selected dr ji and the board have the obligation to seek to raise additional capital without the massive dilution of the proposed financing transactions for these and other reasons it is apparent that dr ji has consistently acted in a manner that is not in the best interests of shareholders and has destroyed significant shareholder value that the board has failed to act in the best interests of shareholders and that the directors have breached their fiduciary duties  accordingly the wildcat shareholders demand that the board i immediately terminate dr ji as the ceo of the company ii  immediately terminate the financing transactions that have not already closed to avoid further dilution to the existing shareholders iii appoint three directors to be nominated by the wildcat shareholders to lead a special committee of the board the special committee to

management and the special committee should develop a welldefined and financed business plan that maximizes the value of the companys existing assets further the company should immediately stop any further financial engineering efforts and under no circumstances should the company acquire any additional assets for development if the board refuses to meet the wildcat shareholders demands the board should immediately resign and allow another slate of directors to take the actions that are required to protect and maximize shareholder value finally with respect to the option and warrant grants that were made by the companys subsidiaries to dr ji other members of management and the directors please be advised that the wildcat shareholders are not demanding that the board take any legal or other action to address those transactions  rather in light of the fact that the companys directors have themselves received those grants and are therefore obviously conflicted and in no way disinterested the wildcat shareholders intend to pursue their available remedies including among other things legal action on the companys behalf to address this wrongdoing nothing contained herein shall constitute a waiver of any of the wildcat shareholders rights and remedies all of which are hereby reserved sincerelyleonard a potter  as a result of these options and warrants being uncrossed the recipients would benefit from the success of any one subsidiary even if the others failed a very different outcome than the shareholders would receive through their ownership in the parent company   it should be noted that some of these option and warrant issuances were granted as early as may  but were not reported until the companys form k was filed on march    further disclosure of these grants was buried in a footnote to the financial statements until the recent filing of amendment no    according to the companys recent filings the reported gain on the igdrasol sale was mm  we note that according to these same public filings the costs associated with the acquisition and development of cynviloq™ were  million consisting of  a  million option payment  the issuance of  shares at share  million  the issuance of  shares to former shareholders of igdrasol due upon sale at share  million and  pretax losses of  million related to the development of cynviloq™ from  through   the sale of igdrasol was reported to generate a cash payment of  million  without commenting on the accounting for the transactions it is hard to understand how the company could report a gain anywhere close to  million  as described supra the  million investment commitment was subsequently reduced to  million  based on  shares of common stock outstanding as of march   as reported in the companys
