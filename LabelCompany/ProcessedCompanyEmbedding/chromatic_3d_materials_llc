materials advance with fund raising shares     materials chromatic d materials advance with fund raising michael petch october th   pm   shares     sharesadding weight to the argument that the materials space is one of the most interesting aspects of d printing a new company has recently entered the additive manufacturing industry chromatic d materials llc of maple grove minnesota has raised  of a  financing goal leading the new d printing materials company is ceo cora leibig biochemicals and premier league football around this time last year leibig was employed as chief operating officer at segetis a venture capital backed company producing levulinic acid derivatives the assets of segetis including  patents were acquired earlier this year by gf biochemicals an italian company started in secret by former arsenal midfielder mathieu flamini mathieu flamini a future biochemical billionaire image via sky sports according to gf biochemicals’ website levulinic acid is “recognized by the us department of energy as one of the top biobased platform chemicals of the future” the company continue to explain that the material is an “incredibly versatile building block for chemicals and materials derived directly from biomass” leibig’s former company gained prominence in the previous decade and was among the initial wave of enterprises focusing on sustainable sources or renewable chemicals gf biochemicals expect the market for levulinic acid to grow from current levels of approximately  tons per year to  million tons a year during the next five years the levulinic acid market growth spiral image via gf biochemicals   emerging from stealth mode chromatic d materials are at the prerevenue stage and have a minimal online presence however with a phd in chemical engineering from the university of california an ms in chemical engineering practice from mit plus more than a decade with the dow chemical company leibig brings heavyweight chemical knowledge and experience to the young enterprise founded in january this year chromatic d materials are focused on “developing high performance materials for all major d printing platforms these materials will advance d printing from prototype to industrial functional applications” furthermore leibig is named as inventor on nearly  patents related to material science and chemistry with this there is an expectation that when chromatic emerge from stealth mode it will be with a bang for now dpi will be watching closely and keep readers informed of any updates michael petch michael petch is the editorinchief at dpi and the author of several books on d printing he is a regular keynote speaker at technology conferences where he has delivered presentations such as d printing with graphene and ceramics and the use of

hardware   make your bath accessories shinebecause your space always has a few constant fixtures shower tub toilet and sink the accessories are what make the room truly unique if you’re a matchymatchy type you can get a corresponding tissue box tray soap dispenser and trash can but make sure to include other designs for variation for a bit of luxury include a towel warmer a makeup mirror and even an armchair or stool for lounging and of course bright towels and bath mats plus a shower curtain if your shower needs one are mustsadd some color with unique bath materialsmuch like in the kitchen washroom materials are often neutral colors so try something new by opting for colorful surfaces give your vanity countertop a facelift by going green blue or yellow and use a multicolored mosaic tile backsplash to liven up your sink or shower wall instead of going with a neutral tile floor dare to be bold with patterned tile or a textured stonego for the bathroom remodelsometimes your washroom is beyond repair and no number of colorful mats or cutesy tissue boxes will do the trick instead think about a major revamp by adding a new shower tub sink and vanity although individual preferences take precedence pedestal tubs double sinks and walkin showers are always popular options if you’re looking to go big many contemporary showers now have multiple showerheads including a rain showerhead and handheld showerhead and vessel sinks and makeup vanities are always elegant additionsor make minor changes to your bath designif a remodel doesn’t fit into your budget there are several small things you can do to freshen up your bathroom changing the wall color towels and shower curtain is an easy way to make a big impact to make an old washroom feel less retro you can always switch out old towel racks cabinet hardware faucets lighting medicine cabinets and mirrors for newer trendier models you can even enhance your shower by replacing a dingy old showerhead with a more hightech version embed

pagesell on houzz  learn morewhat is the best material for wall or floor tilesevaluate your lifestyle and the area that you want to use tile in is it a high traffic or use area is it outdoors will it be exposed to moisture on a regular basis knowing the location and the type of wear and tear that product will experience is absolutely vital before making any type of design decision some common floor and wall tile materials include ceramic this is a great choice for any area that’s exposed to moisture bathrooms and kitchens outside elements entryways and patios or a lot of foot traffic it’s a highly durable material and typically treated with an abrasive to prevent slips making it well suited to be a floor tile while ceramic tile is definitely a pricier option it will wear extremely well with no fading and high resistance to tread wear just make sure there are no flaws in the glaze and if they are unglazed you’ll need to seal them so they become stain resistantporcelain porcelain is often chosen as a tile material because like it’s extremely dense very hard and resistant to wear and moisture even more so than ceramic porcelain tiles make excellent flooring and can be designed to imitate other natural materials to allow for all sorts of nontraditional designs in bathroom and kitchens for example putting hardwood in a bathroom is not recommended but using tile that looks like wood can help you achieve the same look with little to no maintenance make sure that porcelain tiles are rated by the porcelain enamel institute rating range from one to five with one and two being strictly for walls and countertops and three to five for floorsglass the smooth glossy finish of glass tile makes it ideal to accent any space it’s extremely watertight so water or moisture permeating the surface is not an issue it also doesn’t stain fade or scratch easily so it works well as kitchen backsplash tile or shower tile glass is also weatherproof making it the perfect pool tile glass is often a recycled or reclaimed material so if you’re environmentally conscious this may be the way to gogranite marble slate and other natural stone these tiles are extremely durable and hard they are more on the expensive side and often require some type of treatment to seal andor maintain them so be aware of what’s involved before purchasing them what’s the best shape and size for tile backsplash or flooringthe size and shape of your tile partly depends on the look you’re going for you can achieve a very different ambiance by using small or large tiles or by combining both for a cleaner more modern look stick to mid to largesized tiles in traditional shapes such as rectangular subway tile for something more interesting you can use smaller sizes and geometric shapes like hexagonal or circular penny tile don’t be afraid to mix shapes and sizes in the same color for a visually layered look be sure to consider the shape and of the surface you’ll be laying the tile on is it a flat rectangular space or an angularcurved space smaller designs will be easier to cut and fit to odd shaped spots as they tend to be more forgiving larger slabs can be quicker to lay and can require less grout and maintenance but can look odd if they require trimming or aren’t laid out properlyunited statesunited statesunited
