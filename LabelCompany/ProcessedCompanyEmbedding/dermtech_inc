pigmented lesion assay pla provides physicians with noninvasively obtained gene expression information for clinically atypical pigmented skin lesions the pla mage melanoma associated gene expression detects the presence or absence of expression for two specific genes prame and linc and is used as the primary profile assessment these two genes belong to separate classes of molecules that are known to have roles in oncogenesis and both are elevated in melanoma the pigmented lesion assay utilizes a sample collected with our adhesive patch skin biopsy kit and can be used to reduce unnecessary surgical biopsy procedures by ruling out false positives based on visual assessment prior to performing a surgical removal it may also be used to provide immediate information on lesions that

although we have no current commitments understandings or agreements to do so the molecular diagnostics market is highly competitive we compete with a number of manufacturers and distributors of molecular diagnostic tests as well as new and traditional medical devices and other technologies that are used to assist physicians with the diagnosis of melanoma and other diseases by testing and analyzing skin tissue samples in the area of melanoma myriad genetics inc recently launched a gene expression assay as a validated clia laboratory test for surgical biopsy specimens mela sciences inc markets a device that utilizes varying wavelengths to capture lesion images at different depths and algorithmic image analysis to determine the degree of lesion disorganization and the need for biopsy scibase ab is marketing an epidermal electrical impedance spectrometer to diagnose melanoma in europe and australia verisante technology inc has received regulatory approval in europe and australia to market a device that uses realtime raman spectroscopy to assess changes in the chemical composition of skin tissue welchallen inc and various others manufacture dermatoscopes which provide magnified views of a pigmented lesion during diagnosis of the devices mentioned above we believe that only the mela sciences inc device has received fda approval while fda approval is an important factor considered by physicians when evaluating a technology we believe that factors such as accuracy cost and ease of use are also given significant weight company description we are an emerging growth diagnostics company developing and marketing novel noninvasive gene expression tests to aid in the diagnosis of various skin conditions including skin cancer inflammatory diseases and agingrelated conditions our technology provides a highly accurate alternative to surgical biopsy eliminating patient pain scarring and risk of infection while maximizing convenience our scalable gene expression assays have been designed to work with a proprietary “adhesive patch biopsy” that provides a tissue sample noninvasively current dermatologic diagnosis is primarily based on subjective visual pattern recognition that is prone to error and results in a substantial number of unnecessary surgical biopsies we analyze the skin cells taken from the patient using our adhesive patch with a proprietary process that allows us to extract ribonucleic acid or rna from the patch with sufficient quality and quantity to run our gene expression analysis our quantitative polymerase chain reaction or qpcr tests provide objective biologybased information that is highly accurate and can significantly reduce unnecessary surgical biopsies we offer our gene expression tests through our  square foot stateoftheart governmentlicensed laboratory located in our company headquarters we believe we will be the first company to offer a noninvasive gene expression test to the clinical dermatology market which is in contrast to the vast majority of molecular diagnostic tests that are sold into the highly saturated pathology and oncology markets we are initially commercializing tests that will address unmet needs in the diagnostic pathway of pigmented skin lesions such as moles or dark colored skin spots our products are designed to facilitate the clinical assessment of pigmented skin lesions for melanoma aid the histopathologic staging of melanoma and determine the metastatic potential of melanoma our first product in this area is the pigmented lesion assay which can be used to reduce unnecessary surgical biopsy procedures by ruling out false positives based on visual assessment prior to performing a surgical biopsy the development of our pigmented lesion assay has involved over  lesion samples including over  melanomas we have completed the development of our pigmented lesion assay and plan to introduce our product in the second half of  we plan to initially market this test directly to a concentrated group of  to  dermatologists that treat a majority of the  patients with the highest risk of melanoma in the united states while we have not yet generated any sales from our pigmented lesion assay and have a history of net losses of  million since our inception we have begun generating revenue of  from our sample collection kits and clia testing services during the first quarter of  through research collaborations with biogen idec and others over the next three years we also plan to commercialize additional solutions in skin cancer and pursue additional partnering and licensing opportunities for our platform technology in areas such inflammatory skin diseases aestheticcosmetic indications and acne we have developed proofofconcept tests and gene expression profiles and classifiers in some of these areas that demonstrate the potential utility of our technology these opportunities involve clinical trial support and can produce revenue from sample processing in addition they may lead to companion diagnostic products for new or existing drug therapies we have begun recognizing revenue with customers who purchase our sample collection kits and clia testing services our proposed products have been validated as laboratory developed tests or ldts for use in our laboratory which has been certified under the clinical laboratory improvement amendments of  or clia our sample collection kit is a class i medical device that is manufactured by a supplier approved by the food and drug administration or fda our validation studies have been performed under quality system regulations or qsr standards our current plans are to launch our assay as an ldt in our clia laboratory there is uncertainty surrounding the regulatory path for new healthcare technologies and if the fda required us to submit our product for premarket approval or k clearance there would be significant delays in our product launch and our ability to generate revenue while we would incur additional costs for clinical trials and related expenses the fda indicated that it is reviewing the regulatory requirements that apply to ldts in july  the fda held a twoday public meeting to obtain input from stakeholders on how it should apply its authority to implement a reasonable riskbased and effective regulatory framework for ldts including genetic tests however the fda has not yet issued the additional guidance and they do not have such guidance in their current fiscal year goals but may generate such guidance in the future  we were incorporated in california in  in
