the future value of terniums valueadded steel products  ternium sa nysetx  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»the future value of terniums valueadded steel productsfeb  about ternium sa tx dc capital longshort equity special situations eventdriven arbitrageternium nysetx is one of the leading latin america companies operating in the steel and iron industry ternium is a foreign company and therefore its security is traded over the nyse as an american depositary receipt adr the nature of this security is unique it enables investors to purchase shares in a foreign company while realizing dividends as well as capital gains in us dollars following the  to  credit crisis the combination of acquisitions and a relatively stable demand for steel allowed ternium to make a quick recovery however due to the implementation of new projects and increased equity investments in outside firms terniums growth has slowed and its security market price has fell for the wrong reasons as a firm ternium provides investors with far more value than what the current market prices in investment thesis terniums operations are strategically positioned in mexico as well as argentina due to the fact that argentina is a developing country argentina reveals an extremely low correlation coefficient with respect to economic fundamentals that prompt downturns in the us economy on the other hand mexico is not a developing country and unfortunately is closely knit to the fundamentals that impact us markets consumers in mexico tend to be more elastic and sensitive to changes in price ultimately high levels of elasticity in demand have impacted profit margins for operations in mexico therefore with the us economy improving it is highly likely we will see a positive impact on terniums profit margins as consumption levels increase on a global scale ternium is positioned to benefit from chinas rapidly expanding population according to recent projections released by the united states census bureau it is estimated chinas population will exceed  billion by  a small percentage of terniums sales currently derive from its iron ore exports to china given the rate of economic development in china there is a favorable probability this will play out to be a lucrative growth option for ternium i recommend buying ternium with an anticipated price target of  in one year this implies an upside of roughly  from its current market value per share which is shown below in figure  note my price target is based on the consensus of multiple valuation models which i will explain in further detail in the valuation portion of this analysis figure  terniums five year price graph what does ternium do ternium is a steel manufacturing company that serves its customers with a broad spectrum of so called valueadded steel products these products include tinplate galvanized and electrogalvanized sheets prepainted sheets as well as various custom steel products designed to customer specifications these custom products are manufactured and designed on a jobcost basis through terniums service centers in addition ternium produces long steel products such as bars and wire rods terniums customer base is quite extensive its customers range from large companies operating across the globe to small enterprises operating in industries such as construction home appliances capital goods containers as well as food and automotive terniums operations are divided among three segments flat steel products this segment comprises the manufacturing and marketing of flat steel products including hot rolled coils and sheets cold rolled coils tin plates welded pipes hot dipped galvanized and electrogalvanized sheets and prepainted sheets long steel products  this segment is comprised of the manufacturing and marketing of long steel products which include billets wire rod and wire bars other  custom products  this segment includes all other products ternium manufacturers and products such as pig iron and pellets ternium has established a large footprint across latin america through its highly integrated operations terniums current annual production capacity for pellet and flat steel is approximately  million tons and  million respectively its inhouse manufacturing process is spread throughout  production centers in addition terniums distribution network is even more extensive than its production process it has a total of  service and distribution centers that are located in the following countries including argentina colombia costa rica el salvador guatemala honduras mexico nicaragua and panama the processes and services range from iron ore extraction to the delivery of highend steel products to the market as you are beginning to understand terniums value chain is highly integrated figure  terniums distribution network ternium has made significant progress towards incorporating sustainable practices within the last decade terniums management has implemented an integrated health safety and environment hse management system the system comprises a set of processes and practices that serve as an aid in helping ternium constantly improve its environmental performance to adhere with the guidelines of international standards figure  terniums sustainable development financial analysis currently among top investment banks and capital management firms there are thirteen analysts actively covering this security broadly speaking there is relatively little variation among these analysts estimates the only differences in analysts consensus seem to lie beneath a particular analysts opinion in regards to economic recover in  in effort to provide an accurate forecast i computed the average of these analysts estimates the average consensus of the final year in revenue figure for fy  is  billion looking forward into fy  i used the same method and projected to grow to  billion this implies a year over year growth rate of approximately  taking the historical averages of terniums gross margins and assuming there will be small increases in operating costs the earnings per share estimates are highly favorable for fy  the mean eps estimate for fy  is  which implies gross and operating margins of  and  respectively to understand why these margins will improve it is important investors realize the full extent of terniums recent expansion these margin improvements are a result of high capital expenditures in previous years the capital expenditures were allotted to new facilities and fixed assets which have ultimately provided ternium with excess capacity this excess capacity is going to allow for increased production and will aid in the reduction of terniums input costs for raw materials going forward into fy  we should see very little accumulation of new fixed assets which implies a reduction in capital expenditures also one more factor that will impact margins is the price of steel analysts are projecting that in commodity markets the price of steel will increase significantly over the next two years as we have seen before when there is an influx in the price of steel terniums market price per share has the ability to increase fast with improving margins as you are beginning to understand terniums balance sheet is loaded with fixed assets its attractive assets in both argentina and mexico amount to over  billion but how much debt financing does ternium engage in to fund its expansion from an accounting perspective ternium has an extremely clean balance sheet its total liabilities equate to roughly  billion of that total only half comprises terniums longterm debt outstanding this suggests terniums longterm debt to equity ratio is only  and historically this level remained relatively the same valuation terniums extensive product lines and varying streams of revenue can make valuation some what difficult to compute the fair value of terniums equity i used a variation of the corporate valuation model principally this model is identical to the traditional discounted free cash flow model however it also incorporates a modification of the gordon growth model that uses free cash flows to project a discrete value for the approximated value of the firms operations finally to arrive at the value of equity shortterm investments in nonoperating assets are added to the value of operations in this model i used a free cash flow estimate of  million for fy  in order to project the value of terniums operations as i previously mentioned ternium is in its final stages of several expansionary projects including a new slab hot strip and galvanized lines in both argentina as well as mexico therefore terniums capital expenditures are projected to decline by as much as  which has been taken into account in my free cash flow estimate also as a result of expansionary measures i anticipate ternium will consistently display an ebitda margin of roughly  the additional underlying assumptions include a constant growth rate of  and terniums weighted average cost of capital of  also you will notice i have provided a sensitivity analysts revealing the variation in terniums security price with respect to the changes in the constant growth rate figure  terniums intrinsic valuation as you will see above the price estimates change significantly with changes in the constant growth rate in terms of terniums operations i feel the most suitable growth rate to apply is  using a constant growth rate of  i arrived at an intrinsic price per share of  and  for fy  and fy  respectively in computing the intrinsic value of ternium one of the distinct differences between ternium compared to other firms is the weighted average cost of capital its clear terniums weighted average cost of capital is significantly low and while this is not a bad thing it makes valuation slightly more complex given the fact that terniums historical levels of free cash flows have been low and considering its extremely low cost of capital there is an alternative method i would like to illustrate to further support the valuation of this company this method is highly feasible for companies anticipating low levels of free cash flows and is conducted by using a sumoftheparts analysis by incorporating a variety of different evebitda multiples this valuation technique stops or does what some called breaksup the analysis by providing a range of values for a companys equity by summing the value of its individual business segments to arrive at the total enterprise value i am only using a variation of thesumoftheparts analysis in order to project a price target historically speaking ternium carries a forward evebitda premium  to  times due to substantial investments towards fixed assets as well as several associated sunk costs with expansion in brazil i am going to value ternium on the more conservative side the implied exit multiple i am using is approximately  times this is directly in line with the fy  eps projection of  applying a forward multiple of roughly  times to this earnings per share estimate reveals a price target of roughly  although this price target varies from the intrinsic valuation estimate for fy  by  i have concluded this price target is far more accurate and should be investors objective for the end of fy  conclusion it is clear terniums operations are highly impacted by the economic conditions in the us as well as the economic conditions in other countries where ternium operates as the us economy continues to recover the correlated impact between prospering economies and terniums global business will yield a positive impact on its profit margins in addition terniums recent expansion has not only provided cost reduction benefits to the firm but have provided perfect placement through new operating facilities to profit off an economic recovery based on terniums current financial position and conservative growth estimates my one year price target implies an upside of roughly  for investors who initiate a position today in conclusion ternium is undervalued and provides an investment catered to those seeking value and expecting a us
