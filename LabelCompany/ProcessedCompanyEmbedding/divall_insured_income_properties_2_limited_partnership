existing leases the potential need to fund tenant improvements or other capital expenditures out of operating cash flows our inability to realize value for limited partners upon disposition of the partnerships assets such other factors as discussed in our annual report on form k for the year end december   and other reports we file with the sec critical accounting policies and estimates managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on a regular basis we evaluate these estimates including investment impairment these estimates are based on managements historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates the partnership believes that its most significant accounting policies deal with depreciation methods and lives depreciation of the properties is provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the buildings and improvements while the partnership believes these are the appropriate lives and methods use of different lives and methods could result in different impacts on net income additionally the value of real estate is typically based on market conditions and property performance so depreciated book value of real estate may not reflect the market value of real estate assets revenue recognition rental revenue from investment properties is recognized on a straightline basis over the life of the respective lease when collectability is assured percentage rents are accrued only when the tenant has reached the sales breakpoint stipulated in the lease impairment the partnership periodically reviews its longlived assets primarily real estate for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the partnerships review involves comparing current and future operating performance of the assets the most significant of which is undiscounted operating cash flows to the carrying value of the assets based on this analysis if deemed necessary a provision for possible loss is recognized investment properties as of june   the partnership owned the properties which are leased to eleven fully constructed fastfood restaurants in addition one property is located on a parcel of land that is subject to a ground lease the eleven tenants are comprised of the following nine wendys restaurants an applebees restaurant and a kfc restaurant the properties are located in a total of four states property taxes general maintenance insurance and ground rent on the properties are the responsibility of the tenant however when a tenant fails to make the required tax payments or when a property becomes table of contents vacant the partnership makes the appropriate property tax payments to avoid possible foreclosure of the property such as the des moines iowa property which formerly operated as daytonas all sports cafe in a property vacancy the partnership pays for insurance and maintenance related to the vacant property such taxes insurance and ground rent are accrued in the period in which the liability is incurred the partnership leases property to one restaurant which is located on a parcel of land where the partnership holds a longterm ground lease as lessee which is set to expire in  the partnership has the option to extend the ground lease for two additional ten year periods the partnership owns all improvements constructed on the land including the building and

additional rents due from tenants if those tenants experience increased sales levels which require the payment of additional rent to the partnership operating percentage rents included in rental

anticipated to be used to fund the anticipated distribution to our limited partners for the  second quarter which is expected to be made on august   and cash of  is anticipated to be used for the payment of quarterend accrued liabilities net of property tax cash escrow which are included in the balance sheets the remainder of the cash balance represents amounts deemed necessary to allow the partnership to operate normally the partnerships principal demands for funds are expected to be for the payment of operating expenses and distributions management anticipates that cash generated through the operations of the properties and from potential sales of properties will primarily provide the sources for future partnership liquidity and limited partner distributions during the process of leasing the properties the partnership may experience competition from owners and managers of other properties as a result in connection with negotiating tenant leases along with recognizing market conditions the partnership may offer rental concessions or other inducements which may have an adverse impact on the results of the partnerships operations the partnership is also in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers for its properties the two primary liquidity risks in the absence of mortgage debt are the partnerships inability to collect rent receivables and near or chronic property vacancies the amount of cash to be distributed to our limited partners is determined by the general partner and is dependent on a number of factors including funds available for payment of distributions capital expenditures and taxable income recognition matching which is primarily attributable to percentage rents and property sales table of contents as of june   the current eleven operating properties were  percent leased in addition the partnership collected  of its base rent from current operating tenants for the period ended june   and the fiscal year ended december   which we believe is a good indication of overall tenant quality and stability there are no leases expiring in  nine of the partnerships eleven properties operate as wendys fast food restaurants which are franchises of the international wendys company operating base rents from the nine wendys leases comprised approximately  of the total  operating base rents todate at december   additional  percentage rents totaled  all of which were unbilled and accrued in relation to the wendys properties therefore during the fiscal year  the partnership generated approximately  of its total operating revenues from these nine properties additionally as of june   these nine properties exceeded  of the partnerships total properties both by asset value and number one of the wendys leases is set to expire in november  another seven are set to expire in november  with a ninth lease set to expire in november  since more than  of the properties both by historical asset value and number are leased to wendys franchises the financial status of the three tenants may be considered relevant to investors at the request of the partnership wendgusta wendcharles i and wendcharles ii provided the partnership with a copy of their reviewed financial statements for the fiscal years ended december   and december   those reviewed financial statements prepared by wendgustas wendcharles is and wendcharles iis accountants are attached as exhibits   and  respectively to the partnerships december   annual report on form k filed with the sec on march   the partnership has no rights to audit or review wendgustas wendcharles is or wendcharles iis financial statements and the partnerships independent registered public accounting firm has not audited or reviewed the financial statements received from wendgusta wendcharles i or wencharles ii disposition policies management intends to hold the properties until such time as a sale or other disposition appears to be advantageous to achieve the partnerships investment objectives or until it appears that such objectives will either currently not be met or not be met in the future in deciding whether to sell properties management considers factors such as potential capital appreciation or depreciation cash flow and federal income tax considerations including possible adverse federal income tax consequences to the limited partners the general partner may exercise its discretion as to whether and when to sell a property and there is no obligation to sell any of the properties at any particular time except upon partnership termination on november   or if limited partners holding a majority of the limited partnership units vote to liquidate and dissolve the partnership in response

partnerships assets and such other factors as discussed in part i item a risk factors of our annual report on form k for the year end december   critical accounting policies and estimates managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on a regular basis we evaluate these estimates including investment impairment these estimates are based on managements historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates the partnership believes that its most significant accounting policies deal with depreciation methods and lives depreciation of the properties is provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the buildings and improvements while the partnership believes these are the appropriate lives and methods use of different lives and methods could result in different impacts on net income additionally the value of real estate is typically based on market conditions and property performance so depreciated book value of real estate may not reflect the market value of real estate assets revenue recognition rental revenue from investment properties is recognized on a straightline basis over the life of the respective lease when collectability is assured percentage rents are accrued only when the tenant has reached the sales breakpoint stipulated in the lease impairmentthe partnership periodically reviews its longlived assets primarily real estate for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the partnerships review involves comparing current and future operating performance of the assets the most significant of which is undiscounted operating cash flows to the carrying value of the assets based on this analysis if deemed necessary a provision for possible loss is recognized investment properties as of march   the partnership owned property leased to twelve fully constructed fastfood restaurants in addition one property is located on a parcel of land that is subject to a ground lease the twelve tenants are composed of the following nine wendys restaurants an applebees restaurant a kfc restaurant and a daytonas all sports cafe the twelve properties are located in a total of five states property taxes general maintenance insurance and ground rent on the properties are the responsibility of the tenant however when a tenant fails to make the required tax payments or when a property becomes vacant the partnership makes the appropriate property tax payments to avoid possible foreclosure of the property in a property vacancy the partnership pays for insurance and maintenance related to the vacant property table of contents such taxes insurance and ground rent are accrued in the period in which the liability is incurred the partnership leases property to one restaurant which is located on a parcel of land where the partnership holds a longterm ground lease as lessee which is set to expire in  the partnership has the option to extend the ground lease for two additional ten year periods the partnership owns all improvements constructed on the land including the building and improvements until the termination of the ground lease at which time all constructed improvements will become the land owners property the tenant kfc is responsible for the  per month ground lease payment per the terms of its lease with the partnership there were no building improvements capitalized during the three month period ending march   net income net loss income for the three month periods ended march   and  were  and  respectively net loss income per limited partnership interest for the three month periods ended march   and  were  and  respectively the decrease is due to the increase in state income taxes owed for the year ended december   as a result of the sale of condemned land in south carolina in august  the sale resulted in  of south carolina taxes due in  results of operations loss income from continuing operations for the three month periods ended march   and  was  and  respectively three month period ended march   as compared to the three month period ended march   operating rental income rental income for the three month periods

registration and annual report filing fees xbrl outsourced fees office supplies printing costs outside storage expenses copyfax costs postage and shipping expenses longdistance telephone expenses website fees bank fees and state income tax expenses the increase is due primarily to an increase in state income taxes owed for  largely a result of the gain on the sale of condemned land in mt

primarily comprised of investor relations data processing investor mailings processing website design legal auditing and tax preparation fees and sec report conversion and processing fees the increase is due to higher audit and tax return preparation fees as well as higher legal fees related to isolated investor and tenant matters table of contents cash flow analysis net cash flows provided by operating activities for the three month periods ended march   and  were  and  respectively the variance in cash provided by operating activities from  to  is primarily due to lower net income as a result of higher state income taxes cash flows provided from investing activities for the three month periods ended march   and  were  and  respectively the  and  amounts were comprised of the receipt of note receivable principal payments from the buyers note in relation to the  sale of the panda buffet property and the decrease in deferred rent relating to the revised terms of the wendys  mt pleasant south carolina lease  the  amount is lower because of the amortization of the deferred rent proceeds related to the wendysmt pleasant transaction for the three month period ended march   cash flows used in financing activities was  and consisted of aggregate limited partner distributions which included  in buyers note principal payments received in relation to the  sale of the panda buffet property for the three month period ended march   cash flows used in financing activities was  and consisted of aggregate limited partner distributions of  which included  in net sale proceeds from

buyers note principal and interest payments and  of  percentage rents received is anticipated to be used to fund the anticipated  first quarter aggregate distribution to limited partners on may   and cash of approximately  is anticipated to be used for the payment of quarterend accrued liabilities net of property tax cash escrow which are included in the balance sheets the remainder represents amounts deemed necessary to allow the partnership to operate normally the partnerships principal demands for funds are expected to be for the payment of operating expenses and distributions management anticipates that cash generated through the operations of the properties and sales of properties will primarily provide the sources for future partnership liquidity and limited partner distributions during the process of leasing the properties the partnership may experience competition from owners and managers of other properties as a result in connection with negotiating tenant leases along with recognizing market conditions the partnership may offer rental concessions or other inducements which may have an adverse impact on the results of the partnerships operations the partnership is also in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers for its properties the two primary liquidity risks in the absence of mortgage debt are the partnerships inability to collect rent receivables and near or chronic property vacancies the amount of cash to be distributed to our limited partners is determined by the general partner and is dependent on a number of factors including funds available for payment of distributions capital expenditures and taxable income recognition matching which is primarily attributable to percentage rents and property sales as of march   the current twelve operating properties were leased  percent in addition the partnership collected  and  of its base rent from current operating tenants for the period ended march   and the fiscal year ended december   respectively which we believe is a good indication of overall tenant quality and stability there are two leases set to expire in  daytonas lease expires may   and management does not expect to renew their lease applebees lease expires october   and management expects them to exercise their next two year option table of contents nine of the partnerships twelve properties operate as wendys fast food restaurants and are franchises of the international wendys company operating base rents from the nine wendys leases comprised approximately  of the total  operating base rents todate at december   additional  percentage rents totaled  all of which were unbilled and accrued in relation to the wendys properties therefore during the fiscal year  the partnership generated approximately  of its total operating revenues from these nine properties additionally as of march   these nine properties exceeded  of the partnerships total properties both by asset value and number one of the wendys leases is set to expire in november  another seven are set to expire in november  with a ninth lease set to expire in november  since more than  of the properties both by historical asset value and number are leased to wendys franchises the financial status of the three tenants may be considered relevant to investors at the request of the partnership wendgusta wendcharles i and wendcharles ii provided the partnership with a copy of their reviewed financial statements for the fiscal years ended december   and december   those reviewed financial statements prepared by wendgustas wendcharles is and wendcharles iis accountants are attached as exhibits   and  respectively to the partnerships december   annual report on form k filed with the sec on march   the partnership has no rights to audit or review wendgustas wendcharles is or wendcharles iis financial statements and the partnerships independent registered public accounting firm has not audited or reviewed the financial statements received from wendgusta wendcharles i or wencharles ii disposition policies management intends to hold the properties until such time as a sale or other disposition appears to be advantageous to achieve the partnerships investment objectives or until it appears that such objectives will either currently not be met or not be met in the future in deciding whether to sell properties management considers factors such as potential capital appreciation or depreciation cash flow and federal income tax considerations including possible adverse federal income tax consequences to the limited partners the general partner may exercise its discretion as to whether and when to sell a property and there is no obligation to sell any of the properties at any particular time except upon partnership termination on november   or if limited partners holding a majority of the units vote to liquidate and dissolve the partnership in response to

insured limits the partnership has not experienced any losses in such accounts and does not believe it is exposed to any significant credit risk financial instruments that potentially subject the partnership to significant concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash investments and leases additionally as of june   nine of the eleven properties are leased to three significant tenants wendgusta llc wendgusta wendcharles i llc wendcharles i and wendcharles ii llc wendcharles ii all three of whom are wendys restaurant franchisees the property leases for these three tenants comprised approximately   and  respectively of the partnerships total operating base rents reflected as of june   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates assets disposed of or deemed to be classified as held for sale require the reclassification of current and previous years operations to discontinued operations in accordance with gaap applicable to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets as such prior year operating results    table of contents for those properties considered as held for sale or properties no longer considered for sale have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation without affecting total income when properties are considered held for sale depreciation of the properties is discontinued and the properties are valued at the lower of the depreciated cost or fair value less costs to dispose if circumstances arise that were previously considered unlikely and as a result the property previously classified as held for sale is no longer to be sold the property is reclassified as held and used such property is measured at the lower of its carrying amount adjusted for any depreciation and amortization expense that would have been recognized had the property been continuously classified as held and used or fair value at the date of the subsequent decision not to sell assets are classified as held for sale generally when all criteria within gaap applicable to accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets have been met the partnership periodically reviews its longlived assets primarily real estate for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the partnerships review involves comparing current and future operating performance of the assets the most significant of which is undiscounted operating cash flows to the carrying value of the assets based on this analysis a provision for possible loss is recognized if any there were no adjustments to carrying values for the three or six month periods ended june   and  the financial accounting standards board fasb guidance on fair value measurements and disclosure defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and enhances disclosures about fair value measures required under other accounting pronouncements but does not change existing guidance as to whether or not an instrument is carried at fair value the adoption of the provisions of this fasb issuance with respect to nonrecurring fair value measurements of nonfinancial assets and liabilities including but not limited to the valuation of reporting units for the purpose of assessing goodwill impairment and the valuation of property and equipment when assessing longlived asset impairment did not have a material impact on how the partnership estimated its fair value measurements but did result in increased disclosures about fair value measurements in the partnerships financial statements as of and for the six month period ended june   and the year ended december   see note  for further disclosure gaap applicable to disclosure about fair value of financial instruments requires entities to disclose the fair value of all financial assets and liabilities for which it is practicable to estimate fair value is defined as the amount at which the instrument could be exchanged in a current transaction between willing parties other than in a forced or liquidation sale the general partner believes that the carrying value of the partnerships assets exclusive of the properties and liabilities approximate fair value due to the relatively short maturity of these instruments no provision for federal income taxes has been made as any liability for such taxes would be that of the individual partners rather than of the partnership the partnership is not subject to federal income tax because its income and losses are includable in the tax returns of its partners but may be subject to certain state taxes fasb has provided guidance for how uncertain tax positions should be recognized measured disclosed and presented in the financial statements this requires the evaluation of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in the course of preparing the entitys tax returns to determine whether the tax positions are morelikelythannot of being sustained when challenged or when examined by the applicable taxing authority management has determined that there were no material uncertain income tax positions tax returns filed by the partnership generally are subject to examination by us and state taxing authorities for the years ended after december      table of contents  regulatory

limited partners pursuant to section  of the partnership agreement the general partner can modify these provisions without a vote of the limited partners  leases original lease terms for the majority of the properties are generally five to twenty years from their inception the leases generally provide for minimum rents and additional rents based upon percentages of gross sales in excess of

income except in circumstances where in managements opinion the partnership will be required to pay such costs to preserve its assets ie payment of pastdue real estate taxes management has determined

disclosures the partnership has determined the fair value based on hierarchy that gives the highest priority to quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities level  and the lowest priority to unobservable inputs level  inputs are broadly defined as assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability the three levels of the fair value hierarchy under the accounting principle are described below   level     quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level     quoted prices for similar investments in active markets quoted prices for identical or similar investments in markets that are not active and inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the investment level     unobservable inputs for which there is little if any market activity for the investment the inputs into the determination of fair value are based upon the best information in the circumstances and may require significant management judgment or estimation and the use of discounted cash flow models to value the investment the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurements the partnerships assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the investment the partnership assesses the levels of the investments at each measurement date and transfers between levels are recognized on the actual date of the event or change in circumstances that caused the transfer in accordance with the partnerships accounting policy regarding the recognition of transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy for the three month periods ended june   and  there were no such transfers  subsequent events biannual consent solicitation on or about june   consent solicitations were circulated as defined above the  consent which if approved would have

statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act these forwardlooking statements are not historical facts but are the intent belief or current expectations of management of divall insured income properties  limited partnership the partnership based on its knowledge and understanding of the business and industry words such as may anticipates expects intends plans believes seeks estimates would could should and variations of these words and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements although we believe that the expectations reflected in these forwardlooking statements are reasonable we can give no assurance that these expectations will prove to have been correct these statements are not guarantees of future performance and are subject to risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control are difficult to predict and could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or forecasted in the forwardlooking statements examples of forwardlooking statements include but are not limited to statements we make regarding        our expectations regarding financial condition or results of operations in future periods        our future sources of and needs for liquidity and capital resources        our expectations regarding economic and business conditions        our business strategies and our ability to grow our business        our ability to collect rents on our leases        our ability to maintain relationships with our tenants        future capital expenditures        our ability to hire and retain key personnel and consultants and        other risks and uncertainties described from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission the sec forwardlooking statements that were true at the time made may ultimately prove to be incorrect or false the partnership cautions readers not to place undue reliance on forwardlooking statements which reflect managements view only as of the date of this form q all subsequent written and oral forwardlooking statements attributable to the partnership or persons acting on the partnerships behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by this cautionary statement management undertakes no obligation to update or revise forwardlooking statements to reflect changed assumptions the occurrence of unanticipated events or changes to future operating results factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from any forwardlooking statements made in this form q include without limitation changes in general economic conditions changes in real estate conditions including without limitation decreases in valuations of real properties increases in property taxes and lack of buyers should    table of contents the partnership want to dispose of a property leaseup risks ability of tenants to fulfill their obligations to the partnership under existing leases sales levels of tenants whose leases include a percentage rent component adverse changes to the restaurant market entrance of competitors to the partnerships lessees in markets in which the properties are located inability to obtain new tenants upon the expiration of existing leases the potential need to fund tenant improvements or other capital expenditures out of operating cash flows our inability to realize value for limited partners upon disposition of the partnerships assets such other factors as discussed in our annual report on form k for the year end december   and other reports we file with the sec critical accounting policies and estimates managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities on a regular basis we evaluate these estimates including investment impairment these estimates are based on managements historical industry experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates the partnership believes that its most significant accounting policies deal with depreciation methods and lives  depreciation of the properties is provided on a straightline basis over the estimated useful life of the buildings and improvements while the partnership believes these are the appropriate lives and methods use of different lives and methods could result in different impacts on net income additionally the value of real estate is typically based on market conditions and property performance so depreciated book value of real estate may not reflect the market value of real estate assets revenue recognition  rental revenue from investment properties is recognized on a straightline basis over the life of the respective lease when collectability is assured percentage rents are accrued only when the tenant has reached the sales breakpoint stipulated in the lease impairment  the partnership periodically reviews its longlived assets primarily real estate for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable the partnerships review involves comparing current and future operating performance of the assets the most significant of which is undiscounted operating cash flows to the carrying value of the assets based on this analysis if deemed necessary a provision for possible loss is recognized investment properties as of june   the partnership owned the properties which are leased to eleven fully constructed fastfood restaurants in addition one property is located on a parcel of land that is subject to a ground lease the eleven tenants are comprised of the following nine wendys restaurants an applebees restaurant and a kfc restaurant the properties are located in a total of four states property taxes general maintenance insurance and ground rent on the properties are the responsibility of the tenant however when a tenant fails to make the required tax payments or when a property becomes    table of contents vacant the partnership makes the appropriate property tax payments to avoid possible foreclosure of the property such as the des moines iowa property which formerly operated as daytonas all sports café in a property vacancy the partnership pays for insurance and maintenance related to the vacant property such taxes insurance and ground rent are accrued in the period in which the liability is incurred the partnership leases property to one restaurant which is located on a parcel of land where the partnership holds a longterm ground lease as lessee which is set to expire in  the partnership has the option to extend the ground lease for two additional ten year periods the partnership owns all improvements constructed on the land including the building and improvements until the termination of the ground lease at which time all constructed improvements will become the land owners property the tenant kfc is responsible for the  per month ground lease

additional rents due from tenants if those tenants experience increased sales levels which require the payment of additional rent to the partnership operating percentage rents included in rental

is anticipated to be used to fund the anticipated distribution to our limited partners for the  second quarter which is expected to be made on august   and cash of  is anticipated to be used for the payment of quarterend accrued liabilities net of property tax cash escrow which are included in the balance sheets the remainder of the cash balance represents amounts deemed necessary to allow the partnership to operate normally the partnerships principal demands for funds are expected to be for the payment of operating expenses and distributions management anticipates that cash generated through the operations of the properties and from potential sales of properties will primarily provide the sources for future partnership liquidity and limited partner distributions during the process of leasing the properties the partnership may experience competition from owners and managers of other properties as a result in connection with negotiating tenant leases along with recognizing market conditions the partnership may offer rental concessions or other inducements which may have an adverse impact on the results of the partnerships operations the partnership is also in competition with sellers of similar properties to locate suitable purchasers for its properties the two primary liquidity risks in the absence of mortgage debt are the partnerships inability to collect rent receivables and near or chronic property vacancies the amount of cash to be distributed to our limited partners is determined by the general partner and is dependent on a number of factors including funds available for payment of distributions capital expenditures and taxable income recognition matching which is primarily attributable to percentage rents and property sales    table of contents as of june   the current eleven operating properties were  percent leased in addition the partnership collected  of its base rent from current operating tenants for the period ended june   and the fiscal year ended december   which we believe is a good indication of overall tenant quality and stability there are no leases expiring in  nine of the partnerships eleven properties operate as wendys fast food restaurants which are franchises of the international wendys company operating base rents from the nine wendys leases comprised approximately  of the total  operating base rents todate at december   additional  percentage rents totaled  all of which were unbilled and accrued in relation to the wendys properties therefore during the fiscal year  the partnership generated approximately  of its total operating revenues from these nine properties additionally as of june   these nine properties exceeded  of the partnerships total properties both by asset value and number one of the wendys leases is set to expire in november  another seven are set to expire in november  with a ninth lease set to expire in november  since more than  of the properties both by historical asset value and number are leased to wendys franchises the financial status of the three tenants may be considered relevant to investors at the request of the partnership wendgusta wendcharles i and wendcharles ii provided the partnership with a copy of their reviewed financial statements for the fiscal years ended december   and december   those reviewed financial statements prepared by wendgustas wendcharles is and wendcharles iis accountants are attached as exhibits   and  respectively to the partnerships december   annual report on form k filed with the sec on march   the partnership has no rights to audit or review wendgustas wendcharles is or wendcharles iis financial statements and the partnerships independent registered public accounting firm has not audited or reviewed the financial statements received from wendgusta wendcharles i or wencharles ii disposition policies management intends to hold the properties until such time as a sale or other disposition appears to be advantageous to achieve the partnerships investment objectives or until it appears that such objectives will either currently not be met or not be met in the future in deciding whether to sell properties management considers factors such as potential capital appreciation or depreciation cash flow and federal income tax considerations including possible adverse federal income tax consequences to the limited partners the general partner may exercise its discretion as to whether and when to sell a property and there is no obligation to sell any of the properties at any particular time except upon partnership termination on november   or if limited partners holding a majority of the limited partnership units vote to liquidate and dissolve the partnership in response
