alcohol infused ice pops and sn�bar alcohol infused ice cream and sorbet sn�bar ice pops are original frozen alcohol beverage bars similar to popsicles on a stick but made with premium liquor such as premium tequila and vodka and are currently manufactured in three flavors margarita cosmopolitan and mojito the alcohol freezing technology used to produce these beverage bars can be applied to almost any alcohol type and mixture presenting significant market potential and an almost unlimited variety of flavors and employment of premium brands each ice pop is the equivalent of a full cocktail    sn�bar ice cream is an additional innovative product that the company is marketing using proprietary formulas and technology these products are premium ice cream and sorbets that are distilled spirit cocktails containing up to  quality liqueurs and liquors currently there are four flavors available what makes the sn�bar products unique is the proprietary formulation and method of manufacturing sn�bar ice pops and sn�bar ice cream use a system to stabilize the alcohol molecule whereby the alcohol content quality and flavor is not degraded during the production process the technology is also applicable to other food and beverage products such as yogurt water ice creations and alcohol based goods ipic has begun the process of obtaining trade secret and other intellectual property protections as to these unique technologies the sn�bar brand is fully trademarked within the usa and is currently seeking worldwide trademark rights sn�bar brand products have been through extensive consumer testing across all age groups and sexes over  years of age according to the results of the consumer testing there is a large untapped market potential for frozen alcohol desserts market research shows that there are very few alcohol infused icecreams and ice pops available in the us markets and the few that are out there are of lower quality ingredients and are not mass produced ipic holds several federal and state granted liquor licenses these licenses allow the sn�bar product line to be introduced and distributed in  of the united states ipic desires to be the first to mass market the sn�bar alcoholinfused products in this untapped and sizeable market segment and capitalize on these two exclusive products ipic only uses the finest of ingredients and dairy to produce sn�bar products and strives to achieve the highest quality of texture and taste for all of the sn�bar products ipic believes that the sn�bar brand has the potential to scale on a national and international level with worldwide distribution capabilities market the alcohol and distilled spirits market and ice cream markets have consistently exhibited yearoveryear growth and are projected to continue this positive trend the alcohol beverage and dessert industries are extremely innovative and continuously add new and original products ipic has determined that capturing even a small portion of these markets would surpass the initial production capabilities of the sn�bar products and provide a platform for exponential growth nationally and internationally the offering of sn�bar alcoholinfused ice cream and ice pop products worldwide seeks to take advantage of the success of the worldwide alcohol beverage market and the thriving frozen desserts market in  the sn�bar brand was introduced in the usa in the state of arizona the brand was well received and was immediately placed in the top chain stores and restaurants resorts including total wine and the bevmo chains in  the sn�bar brand was launched in nevada immediately the sn�bar products were in demand in all the major casinos and resorts the sn�bar brand joined forces with reputable hotels and resorts including but

breakers resort in  the sn�bar brand was launched in california over  accounts with retailers for sn�bar products were established in the  day period following the launch in california the focus in california has been ensuring that the accounts are reordering product and being serviced and supported properly currently sn�bar products are being offered by gelsons markets and there has also been interest from other chains such as ralphs kroger and costco    walmart the largest retailer in the world approved the sn�bar brand to be test marketed in a few stores in the florida market the first store sold out of more than  cases of sn�bar products within the first two weeks prompting an  case reorder after a three month trial period walmart approved the expansion of sn�bar products in to more stores in the florida market in  the sn�bar brand was launched in north carolina and south carolina teaming up with a distributor who is well known in the market place the brand has been very well received within the market in the first two months of  ipic restructured its approach to distribution of sn�bar products and scaled back the operating expenditures by reducing its expenses most notably sn�bar products are now distributed by a local nestle distributor in the california markets resulting in almost a  decrease in distribution expenses to ipic ipic has recently entered into contracts with three international distributors pursuant to which ipic has licensed to the international distributors a right to distribute sn�bar products to certain international destinations one of the contracts provides for a nonexclusive right to distribute for a minimum term of three years with an aggregate of  worth of sn�bar products for distribution in grand cayman island slovenia croatia serbia and cuba if and when trade is permissible with cuba another contract provides for an exclusive right to distribute for a minimum term of two years with an aggregate of  worth of sn�bar products for distribution in puerto rico costa rica dominican republic and panama the last contract provides for an exclusive right to distribute for a minimum term of two years with an aggregate of  worth of sn�bar products for the first year and  worth of sn�bar products for each year thereafter for distribution in mainland china hong kong macau and thailand ipic has already received the initial orders from these international distributors ipic is also in negotiations with other international distributors for exportation of sn�bar products to territories including australia new zealand and europe ipic has recently entered into a contract with a distributor in the united states pursuant to which ipic has licensed to the domestic distributor an exclusive right to distribute sn�bar products the contract provides for a minimum of two years with an aggregate of  worth of sn�bar products for distribution in north carolina and south carolina ipic is also in negotiations with other domestic distributors for distribution of sn�bar products to texas where a large retail chain named specs has approved of offering sn�bar products for sale as well as alabama ice cream and ice pops while the majority of ice cream sales have long been regularfat products ice cream manufacturers continue to diversify their lines of frozen desserts in order to fit into various lifestyles however most consumers are looking for an indulgence when eating ice creams which makes these products well situated with its ideal formula of two enjoyable products ice cream and alcohol in an affordable combination alcohol the second ingredient in sn�bar ice cream and sn�bar ice pops is alcohol the us beverage alcohol market is over  billion according to the distilled spirits council of the united states discus the sn�bar alcoholinfused ice cream and ice pop products take advantage of the success of the thriving frozen desserts industry and the successful alcohol beverage industry making sn�bar ice cream and ice pop products a hybrid of uniqueness conducive to the consumer markets opportunity ipic has created a proprietary formula and the methodology and manufacturing technique to mass produce alcoholinfused ice cream leveraging production facilities warehousing distribution and merchandising methods currently used for ice cream specifically the proprietary formulation and manufacturing method stabilize the alcohol molecules from interacting with ice crystals and milk proteins making it possible to massproduce a solid alcoholinfused ice cream that has a flavoring system of up to  distilled spirits to date sn�bar ice cream is one of the only products of its kind in the us    the original invention of these frozen alcohol desserts follows the same recipes used by americas finest bars and restaurants the sn�bar products are distilled spirit cocktails that contain up to  quality liqueurs and liquors what makes liquor ice cream and sorbet different is that the product is solid just like regular ice cream not semisoft or in a milk shake consistency like one would find at bars and restaurants these products are readytoeat solid or can be blended into a cocktail while sn�bar products look like ice cream and frozen popsicles the bureau of alcohol tobacco firearms and explosives atf and food and drug administration fda have classified sn�bar ice cream and sn�bar pops as distilled spirits due to the alcohol content this formulation positions these two products in a unique market opportunity taking advantage of the  billion a year frozen dessert market and the over  billion a year alcohol beverage market a  ounce serving represents a significant consumer value when compared to the cost of a traditional drink additionally the concept of a frozen alcohol dessert product is seen by female consumers in our studies as being innovative and fun female consumers have generally been high consumers of the dessert market consequently males have been the greater consumer of alcohol the primary target market for these two products is adult women  to  an alcoholicinfused ice cream drink would appear to combine the best of both worlds for the female consumer of course to a large degree the market for frozen alcohol desserts includes all adults excluding those who have dietary medical or socialreligious concerns this presents an opportunity for a new innovative product that specifically addresses both females and males ipic will market and promote the sn�bar brand utilizing a proprietary manufacturing and freezing method where the alcohol content and flavor is not degraded during the production process sn�bar ice pops are frozen beverage alcohol bars similar to a popsicle on a stick and are currently manufactured in three flavors margarita cosmopolitan and mojito both recipes include premium liquors of blue agave tequila and vodka however the alcohol freezing technology can be applied to almost any alcohol type and mixture presenting significant market potential and an almost unlimited variety of flavors and employment of premium brands while sn�bar popsicles are included in the frozen dessert and alcohol beverage category initially sales are expected to be driven mostly by onpremise accounts the spirits category represents over  licensed retail accounts absorbing sales of over  million x  liter equivalent cases annually ipic can viably reach  of this market approximately  outlets accounting for  million equivalent cases while a coretarget audience of females  to  years old have been highly accepting and positive regarding the product our market studies show that the actual acceptance band of the product is much wider and that if cost is not a purchase condition most people of drinking age will try one or more with a confidentialproprietary formula and exclusive manufacturing process coupled with a focused launch and national distribution network ipic strives to be the first to market in this unique segment and capitalize on a revolutionary product strategy the international dairy food association idfa reported that approximately  of packaged ice cream retail sales occur in supermarkets convenience store sales represented  drug stores were at nearly  while  occurred at other locations the current marketing strategy is to sell products to highend restaurants resorts cruise lines and hotels additionally various celebrity branding and product endorsements are currently being explored initially ipic will focus on major accounts in four core markets consisting of southern california phoenix las vegas and miami the larger vision is to sell products in grocery stores such as kroger walmart and others and thereafter to begin a national marketing program to all us retailers it is essentially a top down marketing plan where products are placed with the largest retailer then trickle down to the smallest seller in each market area the fact that sn�bar products are unique and exclusive allows sn�bar to bring new consumers and revenue to our vendors hence creating incremental growth in their overall sales a national direct mail campaign to liquor retailers and leading food service operators will support these efforts by sn�bar creating a new vehicle for distilled spirits many consumers will be tasting liqueurs and liquors for the first time and in the very favorable mixed medium of premium ice cream    the initial target market for sn�bar popsicles consists of bars night clubs restaurants resorts hotels event banquet and catering firms and cruise lines negotiations are currently underway with several more las vegas resorts and a major cruise line to initially launch the sn�bar products heavy attention will also be given to consumer and trade shows in the beverage industry to provide exposure and sampling as well as to enlist new accounts ipic intends to provide sn�bar products to more major groceries stores at a later date at the outset the target consumer is  to  year olds predominately females that frequent restaurants bars and events on a regular basis while the consumer demographic is predominantly female the slight majority of the purchasers are male for female consumption our marketing studies and strategy have identified these trends and structured promotional efforts accordingly ipic will coordinate and oversee all outsourced brand awareness and public relations activities many of the strategies used will be replications of the past successes experienced by management and other similar demographicallyoriented products mas global distributors inc a california corporation mgd formed in december   a majority owned subsidiary of sn�bar holdings is the sole marketer for sn�bar ice cream and sn�bar ice pops mgd handles all the marketing and promotional aspect for the sn�bar product line seasonality while it is anticipated that sn�bar ice cream will be consumed year round with special holiday flavors and promotions planned it is anticipated that sn�bar consumption will be strong in warm climates specialty venues cruise lines resorts and of course seasonal occasions raw materials and other supplies the principal raw materials for the production storage and aging of distilled products are primarily corn and other grains for whiskies and other spirits agave for tequila molasses for rum grapes for cognac sticks for the popsicles and milk and other dairy products for the ice cream ipic does not currently have any longterm supply agreements with thirdparty suppliers for the purchase of any of raw materials used in our products from time to time these raw materials are affected by weather and other forces that may impact production and quality and ultimately their price manufacturing due to the confidentiality of the sn�bar ice cream and sn�bar formulas and manufacturing processes ipic has established a manufacturing agreement with a large frozen dessert manufacturer and packer in southern california that is large enough to meet initial and all anticipated future demand for the sn�bar brands the copacking facility can scale to handle worldwide demand of the sn�bar products the copacking facility currently manufactures for such retailers as trader joes and whole foods inventory ipic maintains inventory of sn�bar products with the thirdparty manufacturercopacker of its icepops and ice creams as well as with thirdparty distributors of its products  ipics products that are in inventory may be subject to spoliation theft or other hazards that could adversely affect the financial condition results of operations or business of ipic while ipic tries to take precautions to prevent such occurrences the ice pops in particular require refrigeration to a certain temperature that if not maintained can cause the degradation in the products consistency ultimate end consumers may not maintain their freezers at the required temperatures which may cause them to believe that there icepops have partially melted and therefore they may return the icepops requiring ipic to reimburse its distributors and take such product back in to inventory for possible disposal no assurance can be given that individual consumers will be educated in the proper freezing requirements of the sn�bar products    distribution in order to scale distribution sn�bar will partner with more food beverage and alcohol distributors the sn�bar products are primarily sold through direct sales forces to distributors the product delivery will occur through frozen distribution channels transportation of the product from the manufacturing facility to customers will be handled by third parties contracted by ipic ipic is utilizing frozen warehouse facilities in los angeles and phoenix and accounts in las vegas and miami will be shipped directly to the distributor in addition ipic may sell the sn�bar products through joint ventures with and global or regional duty free customers ipic may also sell the sn�bar products through governmental liquor authorities in jurisdictions where aspects of the purchase and distribution of products that contain alcohol are under government control examples of such authorities are the eighteen control states and one county in the united states and the liquor control boards in canada trademarks ipic sells the sn�bar products under a number of trademarks brand names and trade names that are important to its continued success the sn�bar brand is fully trademarked within the usa and is currently seeking worldwide trademark rights ipics business could be adversely affected by the loss of any major brand or by material infringement of its intellectual property rights the sn�bar products are also subject to intellectual property risks because existing trademark laws offer only limited protection and the laws of some countries in which the sn�bar products are or may be developed manufactured or sold may not fully protect the sn�bar products from infringement by others competition the global distilled spirits industry is very competitive and the dessert industry is very competitive the sn�bar products compete on the basis of product quality brand image price service and innovation in response to consumer preferences while the industry is highly fragmented major competitors on the alcoholside of the business include brownforman corporation diageo plc beam inc pernod ricard sa bacardi limited davide campari milanosp a remy cointreau sa and constellation brands inc and major competitors on the dessertside of the business include such premium brands as haagen dazs and dreyers which are owned by nestles and ben and jerrys which is owned by unilever regulatory environment the production storage transportation distribution and sale of the sn�bar products are subject to regulation by federal state local and foreign authorities various countries and local jurisdictions prohibit or restrict the marketing or
