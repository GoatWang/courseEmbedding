is a londonbased team of investment and asset management professionals and has affiliate offices in uk switzerland hong kong and dubai interview with craig reeves who is platinum capital management platinum capital management was set up by myself and peter sprecher nearly six years ago peter an experienced hedge fund investor and entrepreneur and myself have known each other for many years i was previously head of risk management at titan capital management ltd and a proprietary trader for its parent company gaiacorp trading and peter was a prospective investor when i first met him over the years our business relationship developed into a personal friendship six years ago i resigned from titan to join ubs but never actually joined instead peter persuaded me to form platinum capital management our initial product equity plus fund of fund was launched with  initial hedge fund investments it now holds over  funds we manage in excess of  million aum in group assets spread over a variety of fund of funds and single manager products as well as insurancelinked wealth products what are the main characteristics of your fund and how do you differentiate yourselves from your peers we judge each fund on the merits of the fund managers ability looking at our various single manager and fund of fund products there are a number of common threads we dont like leverage  we view it as a dangerous and much misunderstood tool neither do we like black box nor commodity strategies although we are not adverse to them it is just not the areas we have focused on we like a strong team composed of four or more individuals with significant working history together its important that the team know each others strengthsweaknesses and personal nuances and still like each other from our perspective it also offers good contingency liability should a cataclysmic event occur eg sep  aug  we like a lot of the managers net worth to be invested in the vehicles its not unusual for our managers to have over  million invested in their own fund and finally we favour steadyeddy funds over volatile gungho managers as capital preservation coupled with growth are key to us describe the selection process of the underlying funds its a part process that ends with the decision of our investment committee we look at over  funds a year but only allocate to  discovery this is the physical process of discovering a manager and happens on an ongoing basis through word of mouth email prime brokers third party marketers websites etc quant analysis if we like a fund then we put the numbers through our proprietary systems to evaluate them if the fund is still interesting and it would potentially add value to our existing portfolio then we make contact with the fund to obtain more information which we will analyse conference call if after the two rounds of quant analysis the fund still appeals we organise a conference call with our risk management board plus peter and myself the call itself may take anything from half an hour to two hours depending on the fund site visit if the conference call went well we will conduct a site visit to get to know the team risk processes contingency liability etc if the visit was successful we recommend the fund to our investment committee who will determine the initial allocation from our fund of funds product   what is the breakdown by sectorstylegeography we dont allocate like that as we have a more macro vision how long do you track a manager before you invest the track record is the initial door opener it has to be good its a given we usually like a fouryear track record but the longer the track record the better our step investment process is outlined above what information do you require from managers and how often we like weekly nav estimates full position disclosure which we treat with complete confidence and regular dialogues what risk management processes do you employ our selection process is fairly exhaustive each year we analyse over  funds but only invest in  but we view it as only the beginning once a manager is selected we stay in close touch we constantly review the numbers monitoring for statistically significant anomalies and stylestrategy drift we monitor and regularly meet the team on a monthly basis we filter the selected funds and decide on ongoing allocation to each underlying fund how has the capital raising been for your products and do you have a typical investor we have over  million aum in group assets and have had net cash inflow for the past plus months our investor base is about twothird institutional with onethird coming from highnetworths geographically our capital has come from europe middle east asia and south america primarily we have affiliate offices in uk switzerland hong kong and dubai do you run any other products we run a variety of product ranges spanning funds of funds to single manager funds from institutional and retail investors our wealth management company platinum wealth management also has a number of insurancelinked products all of which allocate to hedge funds   platinum premier fund platinum dynasty fund platinum turnberry fund

comments about this past week i recently returned from the oxford club’s private wealth seminar held at the historic grand hotel on michigan’s mackinac island the hotel which some of you might remember as the setting for the  film “somewhere in time” starring christopher reeve and jane seymour took a mere  days to build in the s—impossible by today’s standards especially when you consider that it boasts the world’s largest front porch at  feet while there i had the privilege of catching up with some old friends and contacts including alex green the oxford club’s chief investment strategist you might have read some of his wonderful work for investment u the group’s educational arm alex reminded me over lunch that the difference between democrats and republicans in his view is that democrats are for personal freedom and some economic restrictions while republicans are for economic freedom and some personal restrictions i prefer to focus on policies instead of partisan politics but alex has a point i’m convinced that donald trump a republican won the presidential election because his pledge to reform the tax code and deregulate resonated with both whitecollar and bluecollar americans who felt as if the us economy was no longer working for them us corporate taxes are among the highest in the organization for economic cooperation and development oecd spurring large multinationals to move operations overseas and outofcontrol regulations threaten to strangle business growth but just as green insinuated the trump administration has enacted or has hinted at enacting policies that rankle americans of all political stripes precisely because they could be used to encroach upon personal liberties take attorney general jeff sessions’ recent decision to strengthen the government’s ability to seize private property from suspected criminals the operative word here is “suspected” many now are arguing this directive could be abused by police and other officials it could in fact violate the fourth amendment which of course protects americans against “unreasonable searches and seizures” this is just one among numerous policymaking decisions that have members of both political parties as well as independents scratching their heads trump was elected to reform taxes slash regulations and generally make business and capital formation run more smoothly it’s unclear how privateasset seizures fit into that picture if this administration resolved to stay on message and on course and worked to bring fiscal relief to everyday americans it might receive greater support from those who voted for trump—and perhaps even from those who didn’t us dollar in bear market a boon for gold since the start of the year the fiveyear treasury yield adjusted for inflation has risen about  percent normally this would put remarkable pressure on the price of gold—higher yields raise the opportunity cost of buying gold—but over the same period the us dollar has steadily weakened and is now officially in a bear market because gold is priced in dollars this has been supportive for prices yeartodate the yellow metal is up more than  percent click to enlarge as i said the greenback’s been on the decline for most of the year so far but it slumped to a month low against the euro this week following european central bank ecb president mario draghi’s remark that “monetary accommodation” would continue in the european union eu until at least the end of the year “we need to be persistent and patient and prudent because we’re not there yet” draghi said referring to the fact that eu inflation and wage growth have been disappointingly slow despite the bloc’s economic recovery since the financial crisis indeed the june purchasing manager’s indexes for emerging european markets were all above the key  mark for the first time in recent memory ubs we’re still constructive on gold that gold is still holding at its current level—despite rising rates despite a stock market that continues to rally—is “encouraging” that’s one of the key takeaways from a ubs note this week in which the swiss financial services firm maintains its constructive view of the yellow metal investor demand this year has been slower than expected but ubs analyst joni teves makes the case that expectations of a good monsoon season in india this summer could help push consumption in the world’s secondlargest importer of gold to a new record high by the end of the year with india having imported a phenomenal  metric tons in the first half of  alone teves writes that “we expect gold demand in india this year to be around historic averages” which would be very supportive for prices etps attracted a record  billion in the first half of  exchangetraded products etps also had a knockout first half as deutsche bank reports this week etps attracted a record  billion in the first six months of  in what has historically been the weaker half of the year to put into perspective just how impressive this figure is  billion would be the secondlargest fullyear record amount following ’s  billion we could see etp inflows climb as high as  billion by the end of this year deutsche estimates click to enlarge of course runaway demand for etps and other risk assets has contributed to muted interest in gold having said that though bullionvault—the world’s number one online precious metals market—reported last week that private gold holdings among its users leaped to a record  metric tons as of the beginning of july that’s enough gold to make more than  million carat wedding rings bullionvault says or to supply the microchips for  billion iphones the site points out that investor demand has lately been driven by lower prices following three months of “light liquidation” global debt on alert all of what i’ve said so far pertains to the nearterm gold’s medium to longterm investment case i believe looks even brighter many unsettling risks loom on the horizon—not least of which is a record amount of global debt—that could potentially spell trouble for the investor who hasn’t adequately prepared with some allocation in a “safe haven” according to the highlyrespected institute of international finance iif global debt levels reached an astronomical  trillion in the first quarter of —that’s  percent of world gross domestic product gdp notice that before the financial crisis global debt was “only” around  trillion meaning we’ve added close to  trillion in as little as a decade much of the leveraging occurred in emerging markets specifically china which is spending big on international infrastructure projects click to enlarge it goes without saying that this is a huge risk some are calling this mountain of debt “the mother of all bubbles” and we all remember how the last two bubbles ended in  the tech or dotcom bubble and  the housing bubble paying down this debt will not be easy as scotiabank mentions in a note this week “higher interest rates are going to make the burden of refinancing the debt considerably heavier and as more money goes into servicing the debt it means less money is available to spend on other things which could lead to less infrastructure spending and increased austerity” add to this the fact that global pension levels are also sharply on the rise with people living longer and population growth—and therefore workforce growth—slowing in many advanced economies in may the world economic forum wef estimated that by  the size of the retirement savings gap—unfunded pensions in other words—could be as much as  trillion an unimaginably large number the us alone adds about  trillion every year to the pension deficit i shared with you earlier in the month that the state of illinois’s unfunded pensions could be as high as  billion putting each illinoisan on the hook for  central banks’ efforts to promote economic growth through monetary easing haven’t exactly been a raging success nor can they continue forever plus nearzero interest rates are precisely what encouraged such inflated levels of borrowing in the first place you can probably tell where i’m headed with all of this another crisis could be in the works savvy investors and savers might very well see this as a sign to allocate a part of their portfolios in “safe haven” assets that have historically held their value in times of economic contraction gold is one such asset that’s been a good store of value in such times and gold stocks have tended to outperform the yellow metal as production costs have fallen according to seabridge
