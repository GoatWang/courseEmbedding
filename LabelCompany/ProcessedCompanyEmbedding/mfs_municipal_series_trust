decline in value as the result of declines in the credit quality of the issuer borrower counterparty or other entity responsible for payment underlying collateral or changes in economic political issuerspecific or other conditions certain types of debt instruments can be more sensitive to these factors and therefore more volatile in addition debt instruments entail interest rate risk as interest rates rise prices usually fall therefore the funds share price may decline during rising rates funds that consist of debt instruments with longer durations are generally more sensitive to a rise in interest rates than those with shorter durations at times and particularly during periods of market turmoil all or a large portion of segments of the market may not have an active trading market as a result it may be difficult to value these investments and it may not be possible to sell a particular investment or type of investment at any particular time or at an acceptable price the price of an instrument trading at a negative interest rate responds to interest rate changes like other debt instruments however an instrument purchased at a negative interest rate is expected to produce a negative return if held to maturity investments in derivatives can be used to take both long and short positions be highly volatile involve leverage which can magnify losses and involve risks in addition to the risks of the underlying indicators on which the derivative is based such as counterparty and liquidity risk investments in municipal instruments can be volatile and significantly affected by adverse tax or court rulings legislative or political changes market and economic conditions issuer industryspecific including the credit quality of municipal insurers and other conditions the fund’s performance could be closely tied to the economic political and other conditions in the states and us territories and possessions in which the fund invests and could be more volatile than the performance of more geographically diversified funds please see the prospectus for further information on these and other risk considerations product insights  capital gains estimates november     dividend and capital gain schedule  dividend and capital gain schedule  morningstar ratings see the results of our collaborative approach for mfs “all star” portfolios  definitions average effective duration average effective duration is a measure of how much a bond’s price is likely to fluctuate with general changes in interest rates eg if rates rise  a bond with a year duration is likely to lose about  of its value average effective maturity average effective maturity is a weighted average of maturity of the bonds held in a portfolio taking into account any prepayments puts and adjustable coupons which may shorten the maturity longermaturity funds are generally considered more interestrate sensitive than shorter maturity funds morningstar disclosure the morningstar rating for funds or star rating is calculated for funds with at least a threeyear history exchangetraded funds and openended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes it is calculated based on a morningstar riskadjusted return measure that accounts for variation in a funds monthly excess performance placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance the top  of products in each product category receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars the next  receive  stars and the bottom  receive  star the overall morningstar rating for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three five and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics the weights are  threeyear rating for  months of total returns  fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  months of total returns and  year rating fiveyear rating threeyear rating for  or more months of total returns while the year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the year period the most recent threeyear period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods morningstar rankings may vary among share classes and are based on historical total returns which are not indicative of future results class a share star ratings do not include any frontend sales load and are intended for those investors who have access to such purchase terms eg plan participants of a defined contribution plan therefore morningstar strongly encourages investors to contact their investment professional to determine whether they are eligible to purchase the a share without paying the front load this publication is authorized for distribution only when preceded or
