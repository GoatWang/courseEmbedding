clarifies the framework for determining whether an integrated set of assets and activities meets the definition of a business the revised framework establishes a screen for determining whether an integrated set of assets and activities is a business and narrows the definition of a business which is expected to result in fewer transactions being accounted for as business combinations acquisitions of integrated sets of assets and activities that do not meet the definition of a business are accounted for as asset acquisitions we anticipate that our acquisitions of real estate in the future will generally not meet the definition of a business combination and accordingly transaction costs which have historically been expensed will be capitalized as part of the basis of the real estate assets acquired asu  was applied prospectively  b investors in and analysts following the real estate industry utilize funds from operations ffo net operating income noi adjusted ebitda and adjusted funds from operations affo variously defined below as supplemental performance measures  while we believe net income available to first industrial realty trust incs common stockholders and participating securities as defined by gaap is the most appropriate measure we consider ffo noi adjusted ebitda and affo given their wide use by and relevance to investors and analysts appropriate supplemental performance measures  ffo reflecting the assumption that real estate asset values rise or fall with market conditions principally adjusts for the effects of gaap depreciation and amortization of real estate assets  noi provides a measure of rental operations and does not factor in depreciation and amortization and nonproperty specific expenses such as general and administrative expenses  adjusted ebitda provides a tool to further evaluate the ability to incur and service debt and to fund dividends and other cash needs  affo provides a tool to further evaluate the ability to fund dividends  in addition ffo noi adjusted ebitda and affo are commonly used in various ratios pricing multiplesyields and returns and valuation calculations used to measure financial position performance and value as used herein we calculate ffo to be equal to net income available to first industrial realty trust incs common stockholders and participating securities plus depreciation and other amortization of real estate minus gain on sale of depreciable real estate noi is defined as our revenues minus property expenses such as real estate taxes repairs and maintenance property management utilities insurance and other expenses adjusted ebitda is defined as noi minus general and administrative expenses and acquisition costs affo is defined as adjusted ebitda minus gaap interest expense minus capitalized interest and overhead plus amortization of debt discounts  premiums and hedge costs minus straightline rental income amortization of above below market leases and lease inducements minus provision for income taxes or plus benefit for income taxes plus restricted stockunit amortization minus nonincremental capital expenditures nonincremental capital expenditures refer to building improvements and leasing costs required to maintain current revenues plus tenant improvements amortized back to the tenant over the lease term excluded are first generation leasing costs capital expenditures underwritten at acquisition and developmentredevelopment costs  ffo noi adjusted ebitda and affo do not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and are not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs including the repayment of principal on debt and payment of dividends and distributions  ffo noi adjusted ebitda and affo should not be considered as substitutes for net income available to common stockholders and participating securities calculated in accordance with gaap as a measure of results of operations or cash flows calculated in accordance with gaap as a measure of liquidity  ffo noi adjusted ebitda and affo as currently calculated by us may not be comparable to similarly titled but variously calculated measures of other reits                                                                                                                                                                                    in addition we consider cashbasis same store noi ss noi to be a useful supplemental measure of our operating performance same store properties include all properties owned prior to january   and held as an in service property through the end of the current reporting period and developments and redevelopments that were placed in service or were substantially completed for  months prior to january   the same store pool we define ss noi as noi less noi of properties not in the same store pool less the impact of straightline rent the amortization of lease inducements the amortization of above below market rent and the impact of lease termination fees we exclude straightline rent amortization of lease inducements and above below market rent in calculating ss noi because we believe it provides a better measure of actual cash basis rental growth for a yearoveryear comparison in addition we believe that ss noi helps the investing public compare the operating performance of a companys real estate as compared to other companies while ss noi is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of real estate investment trusts it does not represent cash flow from operations or net income as defined by gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to those measures in evaluating our liquidity or operating performance ss noi also does not reflect general and administrative expense acquisition costs interest expense depreciation and amortization income tax benefit and expense gains and losses on retirement of debt sale of real estate capital expenditures and leasing costs or trends in development and construction activities that could materially impact our results from operations further our computation of ss noi may not be comparable to that of other real estate companies as they may use different methodologies for calculating ss noi   view original content with
