and sustaining a standard of living consistent with realtime population and industry growth within any successful thriving society clean water and the sophisticated generation and use of energy are vital elements necessary to ensure economic and social viability the economic strength of industry the speed of transportation the conveniences of home and workplace a strong and healthy societal foundation and the security of a nation are each derived from ingenious and efficient provisions and applications of various sources and forms of energy distributed energy power system deps dominovas energy’s distributed energy power system “deps” represents a shift in power generation philosophy from a centralized natural monopoly of utilities toward open competitive markets—a methodology approach that will sweep the globe and revolutionize the near trillion dollar energy industry as the cost of everlarger power supply or “diseconomies of scale” come under greater scrutiny dominovas energy recognizes that a smaller and more efficient locationspecific energy source closer to the “end user” is the best approach and methodology in addition to becoming more economical when massproduced modular systems can be adjusted to match the scale of demand and installed in considerably less time than a centralized power station taking all factors into consideration it is the qualified opinion of dominovas energy that the solution to the “energy crisis” rests in a strategy rooted in the implementation of what we call a “distributed energy power system deps” the “deps” consists of strategically deploying geographically separate modular systems from kw mobile systems to mw power plants the solution contains both transformational and operational approaches to insure optimal methodology in order to best solve an entity’s energy requirements combined strategies deploying “deps” is a game changer relative to any system and solution that an entity may be considering the “deps” improves reliability by reducing demands on transmission systems many electrical grids are often over capacity and experience more than  degradation and loss rubicon™ deployment strategy reduced transmission and theft losses as new transmission lines are buried combined technical and nontechnical transmission and distribution losses are significantly reduced reduced environmental impact increased fuel diversity in most cases location is selected close to the best possible fuel supply route however as long as a fuel source can be delivered to the rubicon™ the system will continue to function efficiently and reliably increased opportunity for economic development and job creation through “deps” dedicated rubicon™ stations are located in immediate proximity to manufacturing plant facilities and corporate offices of businesses to ensure  energy reliability rubicon™ solution fuel cell technology  the rubicon™ system monitoring global impact gallery of

javascript to view this website select a page  select a page global impact dominovas energy has a global reach focused on emerging and developing markets to provide reliable efficient and clean electricity for uninterrupted power for all families communities and surrounding businesses the rubicon™ is versatile and designed to encourage the efficient use of natural resources in the production of energy and equally to require accountability for the stewardship of those natural resources lacking access to electricity communities are often forced to rely on dirty inefficient coal plants diesel generators and kerosene lanterns in many areas of the world decentralized technologies have enormous potential to bring power to the people allowing for the deployment of standalone systems resulting in the doing away with the need for expensive grid design and time consuming construction moreover for a rapidly growing urban base smallscale systems can substantially reduce the economic and environmental cost of electrical products and services the acceptance of ‘climate change’ and its impact around the globe are forcing many nations to reconsider their energy policies concurrently energy demand is on the rise because of growing populations as a result research development and deployment of clean and renewable energy technologies that lead to a significantly reduced dependence on fossil fuels are urgently being sought and sorely needed the rubicon™ fuel cell is an energy technology that can significantly mitigate both air pollution and foreign oil import dependency at current levels it is quiet compact flexible highly efficient and exceptionally clean and it curbs emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon dioxide the rubicon™ is much more efficient than conventional energy processes because it converts the chemical energy of the fuel directly into electricity without going through an intermediate combustion step the rubicon™ is cleaner than any carbon fueled combustion process even when using carbon fuel as its hydrogen source additionally the heat and water produced in the conversion process can be used for space and water heating the positive global impact of fuel cell technology is undeniable with a  percent market penetration carbon dioxide emissions – the major greenhouse gas – would be reduced by over  million tons a year global warming is depicted as the increase in the average temperature of the earth’s near surface and ocean’s air the greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide methane and nitrous oxide trap heat in the earth’s atmosphere and thus result in increasing the temperature of the earth the intergovernmental panel on climate change ipcc states that anthropogenic greenhouse gases are responsible for most of the observed temperature increases since the middle of the twentieth century the rubicon™ fuel cell’s byproducts are heat and water with significantly reduced emissions of carbon dioxide co over current industry standards the ultimate integer in emission levels is the fuel source based on measured data a rubicon™ based on measured data a rubicon™ “deps” creates  less co emissions than the conventional combustion generating systems for the same kwh of electricity production a major source of carbon dioxide emissions are power plants power plants emit inordinate amounts of carbon dioxide as a direct result of burning fossil fuels for the purpose of electricity generation coal is the major fuel that is burned in these power plants the “deps” can greatly reduce costly investment in new power plants it also facilitates more local control over power use contributing to economic development within the community and reducing the reliance on and inefficiency of “distant” power producing plants the environmental benefit is one of the greatest advantages of the “deps” modern micropower systems will leave a lighter ecological footprint than currently deployed predominantly fossil fuelbased networks that host a myriad of environmentally damaging emissions candidly dominovas energy realizes it takes vastly different skills and resources to successfully execute the principal strategies for the implementation of the “deps” the operational approach doggedly focuses on conventional measures like capacity utilization throughput and customer service the traditional strategies by contrast require decisions must be made in concert with the current leadership and done so in a manner that considers the necessary investment in technology and the configuration of any resultant new business system most monopoly utilities perceive downsized systems as a threat to their core business of generating and distributing power nevertheless communities stand at the threshold of a brave new reality and must avoid the temptation to “lockin” dirtier less efficient less reliable and more expensive old century combustion power generation technologies through dominovas energy and its rubicon™

caribbean and africa i knew there was a solution and i challenged myself and my business partners to find it we studied the energy business as a whole initially but quickly determined fuel cell technology was the best solution understanding there are less financially taxing solutions to provide energy on a short term basis the challenge however was to deliver a long term solution that could yield exponential benefit to the end user there is no better solution than the fuel cell the next determination was to decipher what type of fuel cell technology would best represent the impact i felt needed to be made to truly make an undeniable difference for the customer after many months of study and exploration we chose solid oxide fuel cell technology it was about this time dominovas energy llc was introduced to western standard energy group a canadian based oil and gas concern after months of negotiations and planning we perfected an rto reverse merger in order to provide the
