department of justice in lieu of possible federal criminal prosecution the plea bargain relates to the march  discovery of severe corrosion in the pressure vessel of the nuclear reactor contained

habitat for humanity as well as to pay for costs related to the federal investigation in addition two former employees and one former contractor were indicted for purposely deceiving nuclear regulatory commission nrc inspectors in multiple documents including one videotape over several years hiding evidence that the reactor pressure vessel was being seriously corroded by boric acid the maximum penalty for the three is  years in prison the indictment also cites other employees as providing false information to inspectors but does not name them in  the nrc identified two earlier
