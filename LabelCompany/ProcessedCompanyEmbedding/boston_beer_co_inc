brewer reports firstquarter  results soon heres what investors should be watching steve symington tmfsymington apr   at am boston beer launched new nitro project cans this quarter image source boston beer company after leaving the market thirsty for more with its fourthquarter  report in february boston beer co nysesam investors sure could use a pickmeup when the craft brewer announces firstquarter  results next week  boston beer stock has fallen more than  over the past year including a  decline so far in  after boston beer founder jim koch admitted last quarter the company likely lost market share even as overall growth within its core better beer and craft categories remains healthy primarily to blame boston beer says is increased competition as new craft brewers enter the market while existing competitors expand regional distribution make no mistake thats a great thing in terms of choice for todays beerdrinking consumer but it stifles the growth of established brewers like boston beer as they attempt to maintain share in this increasingly crowded segment so what should boston beer investors be watching this time around first boston beer management hasnt provided specific financial guidance for the current quarter they did note however that depletions  a key measure for how quickly boston beers products travel from warehouses to consumer outlets  fell a worrisome  year over year through the first six weeks of  nonetheless boston beer ceo martin roper insisted the company intends to strategically maintain a high level of brand investment as it continues to pursue sustainable growth a glass half fullrelatedly keep an eye on boston beers fullyear guidance as it stands boston beers most recent  outlook calls for depletions and shipments growth in the midsingledigit percent range indicating the figure should improve as the year wears on at the same time boston beer called for  ad promo and selling expenses between  million and  million capital spending between  million and  million national price increases between  and  and gross margin between  and  when all is said and done  and assuming all else remains constant  boston beer says that should translate to earnings per share this year between  and  good for yearoveryear growth between  and  to be fair  and with the caveat that we dont lend much credence to wall streets nearterm demands  that guidance disappointed analysts at the time who called on average for higher  earnings of  per share now however wall street has ratcheted down its expectations with consensus estimates modeling  earnings of  per share  digging deeperbut its not all about boston beers bottom line so what will actually drive these results this time one year ago boston beer founder and chairman jim koch partly credited the companys firstquarter  earnings beat to the fact their spring seasonal samuel adams cold snap was not only well received by drinkers retailers and distributors but also segued into a smooth transition late in the quarter to its alwayspopular summer seasonal samuel adams summer ale in recent quarters however boston beers depletions declines were led by decreases in its core samuel adams varieties as well broader declines in the cider category which hurt its angry orchard brands boston beer also introduced several new varieties this quarter including the introduction of its samuel adams nitro project beers  the cans which contain a nitro widget to mimic the effect of a nitro tap on draft  as well as the national roll out of grapefruit ipa and the narrower state launch of its new alcoholinfused seltzer line truly spiked and sparkling listen for updates then from management on consumers early response to these novel offerings if boston beers core beer brands continue to underperform in the near term these new brands could offer just the edge boston beer needs to continue driving marketbeating returns steve symington has no position in any stocks mentioned
