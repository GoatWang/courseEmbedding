beaumont financial partners bfp believes that asset allocation is the single most important factor in achieving strong longterm performance after determining the appropriate allocation of assets they implement sector decisions and individual actions designed to generate performance results that will achieve or surpass the goals of their clients the firm also believes that a top down asset allocation driven investment approach with superior global macroeconomic insight leads to top tier riskadjusted investment results bfp seeks to identify and select specific investments that will benefit from these valuecreating themes and construct customized portfolios to meet each client’s unique objectives bfps investment approach begins with a consideration of all asset classes from a global macroeconomic standpoint to determine themes they think offer the best prospects on a riskreward basis screening factors include historical market data global demographic analysis balance of

are identified bfp conducts additional fundamental bottom up research and analysis on the specific investments ie individual securities mutual funds etfs hedge funds etc for the core equity component of client portfolios bfp tends to focus on companies that have a history of generating significant free cash flow and sharing that cash flow with investors via their dividends they prefer companies that have a long history of increasing their dividend annually and have a modest dividend payout ratio in sectors in which they are more speculative bfp’s analysis might focus on the value of a company’s assets and the discount these assets are valued at relative to the company’s stock price other value catalysts they look for include management changes stock buyback plans sectors that are consolidating mispriced stocks due to market overreactions and improving business modelsbfp uses a method of categorizing the diverse investment universe which is referred to as the dominant benefit theory of investing the dominant benefit theory defines all investments into one of five categories based on the dominant characteristic of each investment the categories are safety income equity
