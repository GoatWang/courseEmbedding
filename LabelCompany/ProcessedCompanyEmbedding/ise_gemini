the options market bloomberg tradebook august   the international securities exchange ise won approval and will launch the th us options exchange ise gemini on august th in our post spy options customized vs fragmented liquidity we discussed the trend of increased liquidity fragmentation due to the introduction of new expirations weeklys and quarterlys and different contract specifications minis and jumbos if we assume that the amount of liquidity supplied by market makers is constant and limited then spreading it across different products only increases fragmentation adding another exchange will also increase fragmentation in other words it might become harder to determine market liquidity and harder to execute a big trade photographer andrey rudakovbloomberg if you are trading options electronically given the increased liquidity fragmentation there are ‘must have’ tools to intelligently route and post orders first you need access to fast and accurate composite quotes and bidask quantities second you need to be able to ‘sweep’ liquidity at a given price level using a smart order router sor third the sor needs to be able to use historical volume patterns as an input to determine where to post bids and offers across multiple venues this is even more important for less liquid names in a recent july  tabb report titled us options trading looking for the edge andy nybo states that  of all us listed options volume comes from the top  names this statistic is noteworthy considering there are approximately  listed options the list of ‘must haves’ also applies to the electronic trading of spreads or strategies with more than one leg there are currently seven exchangesupported complex order books we expect this number to grow plus there is liquidity spread across the individual natural legs of the spread including an equity or futures leg the ability to sweep and post across multiple spread books in addition to accessing the liquidity in the natural legs has quickly become a ‘must have’ for the serious options trader algorithms and advanced order types are important in options just like in other asset classes but the foundation of a reliable electronic
