patients with cancer and other life threatening illnesses our products are manufactured and cryopreserved on an ongoing basis allowing for a bank of doses that are available for immediate on demand use this is tremendously advantageous with regards to the ease and timing of treatment the ability to provide repeated dosing for immuneoncology indications and reduction in patient risk and cost

cell expansion hematologyoncology cgmp manufacturing process development and scaleup meet the team directors our board of directors consists of carefully appointed industry leaders who are capable of navigating a flagship company through the unchartered waters of novel science view our board of directors scientific advisory board nohla therapeutics scientific advisors provide diversified expertise across our external advisory network see our scientific advisors research partners fred hutchinson cancer research center pioneered the medical invention of bone marrow transplantation a procedure that has saved hundreds of thousands of lives worldwide this discovery set the stage for our pursuit of innovative treatments and cures such as the lifesaving transplantation technique using cord blood that could make stem cell treatments available to thousands of patients who cannot find tissuematched bone marrow donors our research partners clinical applications – nohla therapeutics clinical applications the first clinical trial using notchmediated ex vivo expanded cord blood hspc was opened by dr delaney in  in the myeloablative double cord blood transplant setting this trial used patientspecific cord blood units for ex vivo expansion followed by immediate infusion no serious adverse events related to the expanded cell product were reported in this phase  trial and the clinical relevance of using notch ligand for ex vivo generation of increased numbers of human stem and progenitor cells was established this was the first trial demonstrating that infusion of ex vivo expanded cord blood progenitor cells without coinfusion of t cells from the same donor could result in a significant decrease in the time to hematopoietic recovery of both neutrophils and platelets thus with established proof of concept the goal was further development of this t cell deplete cellular therapy as an economically and clinically feasible product with ready patient access specifically as a cryopreserved universal donor cell product without the need for hla matching the product can be cryopreserved for future on demand use in contrast to the initial patientspecific product patient access to this cryopreserved product would be dramatically enhanced as all of the expanded products would be potentially available for any given patient regardless of hla typing or location of the patient two clinical trials have been completed in adults using this cryopreserved universal donor product in the context of cord blood transplant and high dose chemotherapy with no unexpected safety issues and preliminary efficacy data demonstrating reduction in treatment side effects and time to engraftment other trials are ongoing including a multicenter randomized trial comparing cord blood transplant with and without use of the expanded cell product and a pediatric trial using the product in the setting of intensive chemotherapy advantages of the product the cryopreserved universal donor expanded cb progenitor product has many advantages it is devoid of tcells and can thus be administered without need for hla matching making it a true universal donor product it is a “preexpanded” cryopreserved product and can be distributed and stored for immediate on demand use it has potential uses in a broad variety of indications requiring temporary myeloid engraftment for example chemotherapyinduced severe neutropenia sepsis or accidental radiation exposure advantage of the platform the true advantage of this ex vivo expansion platform is the ability to manipulate the notch signaling pathway with tight regulation thereby optimizing this methodology to direct stem and progenitor cell fate in vitro for the ex vivo generation of other cell types nk cells pret cells

his past appointments include a member of the scientific advisory board for the university of minnesota cancer center and board membership for the leukemia and lymphoma society irwin’s research interests have focused on developmental aspects of hematopoiesis including normal and leukemic hematopoietic stem cells studies conducting in dr bernstein’s lab were credited with the identification of maturationlinked cell surface antigens used to develop mylotarg as a targeted anticd therapy for aml and for the development of stem cell transplantation using isolated cd cells additional studies of normal hematopoiesis in his lab are aimed at determining methods to direct primitive hematopoietic precursors to commit to a particular maturational pathway or to selfrenew these studies focused on the role of notch signaling demonstrated that constitutive notch signaling can enhance selfrenewal and lead to the immortalization of cytokinedependent pluripotent murine hematopoietic stem cells this in turn led to the finding that notch signaling induced by exogenously presented engineered notch ligands enhances the ex vivo generation of primitive multipotent precursors and has served as the basis for the development of novel clinically relevant expansion methods of human cord blood stem and progenitor cells now being developed by nohla therapeutics clinical advisory board – nohla

in seattle washington is pleased to announce the signing of an exclusive licensing and collaboration agreement with the fred hutchinson cancer research center fred hutch nohla has also secured an investment term sheet for a usd m investment round which it expects to close in december and has also announced several high profile appointments to its scientific advisory board and clinical advisory board the transaction with the fred hutch provides nohla with a  year worldwide exclusive licensing agreement to seven patent families and knowhow relating to an ex vivo expanded umbilical cord blood platform two inds also transfer as part of the transaction patents under this agreement cover the use of a nonhla matched expanded cord blood product which has been used in a number of clinical trials already the ex vivo expanded allogeneic cord blood product can be manufactured to provide a truly “off the shelf” cell therapy distinct from several other emerging technologies in addition to the license agreement nohla has executed a five year collaboration agreement with fred hutch in the form of sponsored research agreement the collaboration agreement will accelerate both preclinical and clinical research being conducted within labs at the fred hutch the collaboration commitment consists of usd m per annum with initial capital directed toward manufacturing transfer nohla’s most progressed clinical trial currently enrolling is a multicenter randomized phase iib trial in which patients undergoing a conventional cord blood transplant are randomized to receive the nonhla matched ex vivo expanded umbilical cord blood product as an adjuvant graft in the pilot safety trial using the nonhla matched ex vivo expanded cord blood product in the cord blood transplant setting rates of acute graftversushost disease were significantly lowered and so too were rates of transplant related mortality in addition to enhancing the kinetics of hematopoietic recovery commenting on the agreement nohla ceo benjamin bergo said “we are delighted with the relationship we have formed with the scientific inventors and research team at fred hutch and our executive team is fully committed
