to rehearsals richards then joined the band jones and stewarts acceptance of richards and the chuck berry songs he wanted to play coincided with the departure of blues purists geoff bradford and brian knight who had no tolerance for chuck berry as keith richards tells it jones came up with the name the rollin stones later with the g while on the phone with a venue owner the voice on the other end of the line obviously said what are you called panic the best of muddy waters album was lying on the floor—and track five side one was rollin stone blues the rollin stones played their first gig on

credits jones and richards spent day after day playing guitar while listening to blues records notably jimmy reed muddy waters willie dixon and howlin wolf during this time jones also taught jagger how to play harmonica the four rollin stones went searching for a bassist and drummer finally settling on bill wyman on bass because he had a spare vox ac guitar amplifier and always had cigarettes as well as a bass guitar that he had built himself after playing with mick avory tony chapman and carlo little in january  they finally persuaded jazzinfluenced charlie watts to join them at the time watts was considered by fellow musicians to be one of the better drummers in london he had played with among others alexis korners group blues incorporated watts described joness role in these early

love to you walking the dog money im alright you better move on and its all over now he contributed backing vocals as late as  on sympathy for the devil he is also responsible for the whistling on walking the dog richards maintains that what he calls guitar weaving emerged from this period from listening to jimmy reed albums we listened to the teamwork trying to work out what was going on in those records how you could play together with two guitars and make it sound like four or five joness and richardss guitars became a signature of the sound of the rolling stones with both guitarists playing rhythm and lead without clear boundaries between the two roles his aptitude for playing a wide variety of instruments is particularly evident on the albums aftermath  between the buttons  and their satanic majesties request  estrangement from bandmatesedit michael cooper mick jagger marianne faithfull al vandenberg jones and maharishi mahesh yogi amsterdam  andrew loog oldhams arrival as manager marked the beginning of joness slow estrangement oldham recognised the financial advantages of bandmembers writing their own songs as exemplified by lennon–mccartney and that playing covers would not sustain a band in the limelight for long further oldham wanted to make jaggers charisma and flamboyance a focus of live performances jones saw his influence over the stones direction slide as their repertoire comprised fewer of the blues covers than he preferred more jaggerrichards originals developed and oldham increased his own managerial control displacing jones from yet another role according to oldham in his book stoned jones was an outsider from the beginning when the first tours were arranged in  he travelled separately from the band stayed at different hotels and demanded extra pay according to oldham jones was very emotional and felt alienated because he was not a prolific songwriter and his management role had been taken away he resisted the symbiosis demanded by the group lifestyle and so life was becoming more desperate for him day by day none of us were looking forward to brian totally cracking up the toll from days on the road the money and fame and the feeling of being alienated from the group resulted in joness overindulgence in alcohol and other drugs these excesses had a debilitative effect on his physical and mental health and according to oldham jones became unfriendly and antisocial at times jones was arrested for drug possession on  may  shortly after the redlands incident at richards sussex home authorities found marijuana cocaine and methamphetamine in his flat he confessed to marijuana use but claimed he did not use hard drugscitation needed in june  jones attended the monterey pop festival there he met frank zappa and dennis hopper and went on stage to introduce the jimi hendrix experience who were not yet well known in the united states hostility grew between jones jagger and richards alienating jones further from the group although many noted that jones could be friendly and outgoing wyman richards and watts have commented that he could also be cruel and difficult by most accounts joness attitude changed frequently he was one minute caring and generous the next making an effort to anger everyone as wyman observed in stone alone there were at least two sides to brians personality one brian was introverted shy sensitive deepthinking the other was a preening peacock gregarious artistic desperately needing assurance from his peers he pushed every friendship to the limit and way beyond in march  anita pallenberg joness girlfriend of two years left him for richards when jones was hospitalised during a trip the three made to morocco further damaging the already strained relations between jones and richards as tensions and joness substance abuse increased his musical contributions became sporadic he became bored with the guitar and sought exotic instruments to play and he was increasingly absent from recording sessions in peter whiteheads promotional film for we love you made in july  he appears extremely groggy and disoriented joness last substantial sessions with the stones occurred in spring and summer of  when the stones produced jumpin jack flash and the beggars banquet album he can be seen in the jeanluc godard film one plus one playing acoustic guitar and chatting and sharing cigarettes with richards although jones is neglected in the musicmaking the film chronicles the making of sympathy for the devil where once jones played multiple instruments on many tracks he now played only minor roles on a few pieces joness last formal appearance was in the december  the rolling stones rock and roll circus a part concert part circusact film organised by the band it went unreleased for  years because jagger was unhappy with the bands performance compared to others in the film such as jethro tull john lennon the who and taj mahal commentary included as bonus material indicated that almost everyone at the concert sensed that the end of joness time with the rolling stones was near and roger daltrey and pete townshend of the who thought it would be joness last live musical performance departure from the bandedit jones was arrested a second time on  may  for possession of cannabis which jones said had been left by previous tenants of the flat due to his being on probation he was facing a long jail sentence if found guilty the jury found him guilty but the judge had sympathy for jones instead of jailing him he fined him £ plus £ in costs and told him for goodness sake dont get into trouble again or it really will be serious joness legal troubles estrangement from his bandmates substance abuse and mood swings became too much of an obstacle to his active participation in the band the rolling stones wanted to tour the united states in  for the first time in three years but jones was not in fit condition to tour and his second arrest exacerbated problems with acquiring a us work visa in addition jones attendance at rehearsals and recording sessions had become erratic and when he did appear he either rarely contributed anything musically or when he did his bandmates would switch off his amplifier leaving richards to play nearly all the guitars according to author gary herman jones was literally incapable of making music when he tried to play harmonica his mouth started bleeding this behaviour was problematic during the beggars banquet sessions and had worsened by the time the band commenced recording let it bleed in march  jones borrowed the groups jaguar and went shopping in pimlico road after the parked car was towed away by police jones hired a chauffeurdriven car to get home in may  jones crashed his motorcycle into a shop window and was secretly taken to hospital under an assumed name from this point jones was still attending recording sessions but was no longer a major contributor to the bands music by may he had made two contributions to the work in progress autoharp on you got the silver and percussion on midnight rambler jagger informed jones that he would be fired from the band if he did not turn up to a photo session looking frail he nonetheless showed up and his last photo session as a rolling stone took place on  may  first at st katherine docks tower bridge london and then at ethan russells photographic studio in south kensington the photos would appear on the album through the past darkly big hits vol in september  the stones decided that following the release of the let it bleed album scheduled for a july  release in the us they would start a north american tour in november  however the stones management was informed that because of his drug convictions jones would not receive a work permit at the suggestion of pianist and road manager ian stewart the stones decided to add a new guitarist and on  june  jones was visited by mick jagger keith richards and charlie watts and was told that the group he had formed would continue without him to the public it appeared as if jones had left voluntarily the other band members told him that although he was being asked to leave it was his choice how to break it to the public jones released a statement on  june  announcing his departure in this statement he said among other things that i no longer see eyetoeye with the others over the discs we are cutting jones was replaced by yearold guitarist mick taylor formerly of john mayalls bluesbreakers during the period of his decreasing involvement in the band jones was living at cotchford farm in east sussex the residence formerly owned by winniethepooh author a a milne which jones had purchased in november  alexis korner who visited in late june noted that jones seemed happier than he had ever been jones is known to have contacted korner ian stewart john lennon mitch mitchell and jimmy miller about intentions to put together another band jones had apparently demoed a few of his own songs in the weeks before his death including has anybody seen my baby and chow time equipmentedit joness main guitar in the early years was a harmony stratotone which he replaced with a gretsch double anniversary in twotone green in  and  he often used a teardropshaped prototype vox mark iii from late  until his death jones used gibson models various firebirds es and a les paul model as well as two rickenbacker string models he can also be seen playing a fender telecaster in the  jumpin jack flash promo video deathedit joness grave in cheltenham cemetery at around midnight on the night of – july  jones was discovered motionless at the bottom of his swimming pool at cotchford farm his swedish girlfriend anna wohlin was convinced jones was alive when he was taken out of the pool insisting he still had a pulse however by the time the doctors arrived it was too late and he was pronounced dead the coroners report stated death by misadventure and noted his liver and heart were heavily enlarged by drug and alcohol abuse upon joness death the whos pete townshend wrote a poem titled a normal day for brian a man who died every day printed in the times jimi hendrix dedicated a song to him on us television and jim morrison of the doors published a poem titled ode to la while thinking of brian jones deceased coincidentally hendrix and morrison both died within the following two years all three at age  jones hendrix and morrison are considered the th th and th members of the  club respectively the rolling stones performed at a free concert in hyde park on  july  two days after joness death the concert had been scheduled weeks earlier as an opportunity to present the stones new guitarist mick taylor and the band decided to dedicate the concert to jones before the rolling stones set jagger read excerpts from adonais a poem by percy bysshe shelley about the death of his friend john keats and stagehands released hundreds of white butterflies as part of the tribute the band opened with a johnny winter song that was one of joness favourites im yours and im hers jones was reportedly buried  feet  m deep in cheltenham cemetery to prevent exhumation by trophy hunters his body was embalmed hair bleached white and was placed in an airtight metal casket watts and wyman were the only rolling stones who attended the funeral mick jagger and marianne faithfull were travelling to australia to begin the filming of ned kelly they stated that their contracts did not allow them to delay the trip to attend the funeral when asked if he felt guilty about joness death mick jagger told rolling stone in  no i dont really i do feel that i behaved in a very childish way but we were very young and in some ways we picked on him but unfortunately he made himself a target for it he was very very jealous very difficult very manipulative and if you do that in this kind of a group of people you get back as good as you give to be honest i wasnt understanding enough about his drug addiction no one seemed to know much about drug addiction things like lsd were all new no one knew the harm people thought cocaine was good for you murder claimsedit theories surrounding joness death developed soon afterwards with associates of the stones claiming to have information that he was murdered according to rock biographer philip norman the murder theory would bubble back to the surface every five years or so in  it was reported that jones was murdered by frank thorogood who was doing some construction work on the property he was the last person to see jones alive thorogood allegedly confessed the murder to the rolling stones driver tom keylock who later denied this the thorogood theory was dramatised in the  movie stoned in august  sussex police decided to review joness death for the first time since  after new evidence was handed to them by scott jones an investigative journalist in the uk scott jones had traced many of the people who were at brian joness house the night he died plus unseen police files held at the national archives according to trevor hobley chairman of the brian jones fan club a neighbour saw a large bonfire on jones estate in which documentation was being burned on the morning of jones death as he was leaving for work at  am in the mail on sunday in november  scott jones said frank thorogood killed brian jones in a fight and senior police officers covered up the true cause of death following the review the sussex police stated that they would not be reopening the case they asserted that this has been thoroughly reviewed by sussex polices crime policy and review branch but there is no new evidence to suggest that the coroners original verdict of death by misadventure was incorrect songwriting creditsedit unsure and insecure as a composer jones was not a prolific songwriter the second rice krispies jingle for kelloggs cowritten with the j walter thompson advertising agency in  and performed by the rolling stones incognito was credited to jones this did not sit well with the rest of the band who felt it was a group effort and all should benefit equally jones was also included in the nankerphelge songwriting credit a pseudonym used on fourteen tracks that were composed by the entire band and andrew oldham according to andrew oldham the main reason for joness not writing songs was that jones being a blues purist did not love simple pop music enough oldham tried to establish a songwriting partnership between jones and gene pitney after becoming bored senseless by joness bleating about the potential of halffinished melodies that by no means deserved completion but after two days of sessions the results remain best to be unheard even by rolling stones completists when asked in  if he had written songs jones replied always tried ive written quite a few but mostly in blues style many years later after his death keith richards stated no no absolutely not that was the one thing he would never do brian wouldnt show them to anybody within the stones brian as far as i know never wrote a single finished song in his life he wrote bits and pieces but he never presented them to us no doubt he spent hours weeks working on things but his paranoia was so great that he could never bring himself to present them to uspage needed in  mick jagger told rolling stone magazine that jones had been jealous of the jaggerrichards songwriting team and added to be honest brian had no talent for writing songs none ive never known a guy with less talent for songwriting marianne faithfull reported that jones wrote an early version of the melody for ruby tuesday and presented it to the group victor bockris reported that keith richards and brian jones worked out the final melody in the studio additionally jones is credited along with keith richards for the instrumental piece hear it however in  jones composed produced and played on the soundtrack to mord und totschlag english title a degree of murder an avantgarde german film with anita pallenberg adding the majority of the instrumentation to the soundtrack the only known released

beautifully joness death at  was the first of the s rock movement jimi hendrix janis joplin and jim morrison found their own drugrelated deaths at the same age within two years morrison died two years to the day after jones the coincidence of ages has been described as the  club when alastair johns who owned cotchford farm for over  years after joness death refurbished the pool he sold the original tiles to joness fans for £ each which paid for half of the work johns noted that cotchford farm remained for decades an attraction for jones fans songs have been written about jones morrison

jack bruce and others who made up the small london rhythm and blues and jazz scene there he became a blues musician for a brief time calling himself elmo lewis and playing slide guitar jones also started a group with paul jones called the roosters and in january  after both brian and paul left the group eric clapton took over brians position as guitarist jones placed an advertisement in jazz news a soho club information sheet on  may  inviting musicians to audition for a new rb group at the bricklayers arms pub pianist ian stu stewart was the first to respond later singer mick jagger also joined this band jagger and his childhood friend keith richards had met jones when he and paul jones were playing elmore james dust my broom with korners band at the ealing jazz club jagger brought guitarist richards to rehearsals richards then joined the band jones and stewarts acceptance of richards and the chuck berry songs he wanted to play coincided with the departure of blues purists geoff bradford and brian knight who had no tolerance for chuck berry as keith richards tells it jones came up with the name the rollin stones later with the g while on the phone with a venue owner the voice on the other end of the line obviously said what are you called panic the best of muddy waters album was lying on the floor—and track five side one was rollin stone blues the rollin stones played their first gig on  july  in the marquee club in london with jagger richards jones stewart bass player dick taylor later of the pretty things and drummer tony chapman from september  to september  jones jagger and richards shared a flat referred to by richards as a beautiful dump at  edith grove chelsea with james phelge a future photographer whose name was used in some of the groups early nankerphelge writing credits jones and richards spent day after day playing guitar while listening to blues records notably jimmy reed muddy waters willie dixon and howlin wolf during this time jones also taught jagger how to play harmonica the four rollin stones went searching for a bassist and drummer finally settling on bill wyman on bass because he had a spare vox ac guitar amplifier and always had cigarettes as well as a bass guitar that he had built himself after playing with mick avory tony chapman and carlo little in january  they finally persuaded jazzinfluenced charlie watts to join them at the time watts was considered by fellow musicians to be one of the better drummers in london he had played with among others alexis korners group blues incorporated watts described joness role in these early days brian was very instrumental in pushing the band at the beginning keith and i would look at him and say he was barmy it was a crusade to him to get us on the stage in a club and be paid halfacrown and to be billed as an rb bandpage needed while acting as the bands business manager jones received £ more than the other members equivalent to £ in  which did not sit well with the rest of the band and created resentmentpage needed keith richards has said that both he and jagger were surprised to learn that jones considered himself the leader and was receiving the extra £

just wanna make love to you walking the dog money im alright you better move on and its all over now he contributed backing vocals as late as  on sympathy for the devil he is also responsible for the whistling on walking the dog richards maintains that what he calls guitar weaving emerged from this period from listening to jimmy reed albums we listened to the teamwork trying to work out what was going on in those records how you could play together with two guitars and make it sound like four or five joness and richardss guitars became a signature of the sound of the rolling stones with both guitarists playing rhythm and lead without clear boundaries between the two roles his aptitude for playing a wide variety of instruments is particularly evident on the albums aftermath  between the buttons  and their satanic majesties request  estrangement from bandmatesedit michael cooper mick jagger marianne faithfull al vandenberg jones and maharishi mahesh yogi amsterdam  andrew loog oldhams arrival as manager marked the beginning of joness slow estrangement oldham recognised the financial advantages of bandmembers writing their own songs as exemplified by lennon–mccartney and that playing covers would not sustain a band in the limelight for long further oldham wanted to make jaggers charisma and flamboyance a focus of live performances jones saw his influence over the stones direction slide as their repertoire comprised fewer of the blues covers than he preferred more jaggerrichards originals developed and oldham increased his own managerial control displacing jones from yet another role according to oldham in his book stoned jones was an outsider from the beginning when the first tours were arranged in  he travelled separately from the band stayed at different hotels and demanded extra pay according to oldham jones was very emotional and felt alienated because he was not a prolific songwriter and his management role had been taken away he resisted the symbiosis demanded by the group lifestyle and so life was becoming more desperate for him day by day none of us were looking forward to brian totally cracking up the toll from days on the road the money and fame and the feeling of being alienated from the group resulted in joness overindulgence in alcohol and other drugs these excesses had a debilitative effect on his physical and mental health and according to oldham jones became unfriendly and antisocial at times jones was arrested for drug possession on  may  shortly after the redlands incident at richards sussex home authorities found marijuana cocaine and methamphetamine in his flat he confessed to marijuana use but claimed he did not use hard drugscitation needed in june  jones attended the monterey pop festival there he met frank zappa and dennis hopper and went on stage to introduce the jimi hendrix experience who were not yet well known in the united states hostility grew between jones jagger and richards alienating jones further from the group although many noted that jones could be friendly and outgoing wyman richards and watts have commented that he could also be cruel and difficult by most accounts joness attitude changed frequently he was one minute caring and generous the next making an effort to anger everyone as wyman observed in stone alone there were at least two sides to brians personality one brian was introverted shy sensitive deepthinking the other was a preening peacock gregarious artistic desperately needing assurance from his peers he pushed every friendship to the limit and way beyond in march  anita pallenberg joness girlfriend of two years left him for richards when jones was hospitalised during a trip the three made to morocco further damaging the already strained relations between jones and richards as tensions and joness substance abuse increased his musical contributions became sporadic he became bored with the guitar and sought exotic instruments to play and he was increasingly absent from recording sessions in peter whiteheads promotional film for we love you made in july  he appears extremely groggy and disoriented joness last substantial sessions with the stones occurred in spring and summer of  when the stones produced jumpin jack flash and the beggars banquet album he can be seen in the jeanluc godard film one plus one playing acoustic guitar and chatting and sharing cigarettes with richards although jones is neglected in the musicmaking the film chronicles the making of sympathy for the devil where once jones played multiple instruments on many tracks he now played only minor roles on a few pieces joness last formal appearance was in the december  the rolling stones rock and roll circus a part concert part circusact film organised by the band it went unreleased for  years because jagger was unhappy with the bands performance compared to others in the film such as jethro tull john lennon the who and taj mahal commentary included as bonus material indicated that almost everyone at the concert sensed that the end of joness time with the rolling stones was near and roger daltrey and pete townshend of the who thought it would be joness last live musical performance departure from the bandedit jones was arrested a second time on  may  for possession of cannabis which jones said had been left by previous tenants of the flat due to his being on probation he was facing a long jail sentence if found guilty the jury found him guilty but the judge had sympathy for jones instead of jailing him he fined him £ plus £ in costs and told him for goodness sake dont get into trouble again or it really will be serious joness legal troubles estrangement from his bandmates substance abuse and mood swings became too much of an obstacle to his active participation in the band the rolling stones wanted to tour the united states in  for the first time in three years but jones was not in fit condition to tour and his second arrest exacerbated problems with acquiring a us work visa in addition jones attendance at rehearsals and recording sessions had become erratic and when he did appear he either rarely contributed anything musically or when he did his bandmates would switch off his amplifier leaving richards to play nearly all the guitars according to author gary herman jones was literally incapable of making music when he tried to play harmonica his mouth started bleeding this behaviour was problematic during the beggars banquet sessions and had worsened by the time the band commenced recording let it bleed in march  jones borrowed the groups jaguar and went shopping in pimlico road after the parked car was towed away by police jones hired a chauffeurdriven car to get home in may  jones crashed his motorcycle into a shop window and was secretly taken to hospital under an assumed name from this point jones was still attending recording sessions but was no longer a major contributor to the bands music by may he had made two contributions to the work in progress autoharp on you got the silver and percussion on midnight rambler jagger informed jones that he would be fired from the band if he did not turn up to a photo session looking frail he nonetheless showed up and his last photo session as a rolling stone took place on  may  first at st katherine docks tower bridge london and then at ethan russells photographic studio in south kensington the photos would appear on the album through the past darkly big hits vol in september  the stones decided that following the release of the let it bleed album scheduled for a july  release in the us they would start a north american tour in november  however the stones management was informed that because of his drug convictions jones would not receive a work permit at the suggestion of pianist and road manager ian stewart the stones decided to add a new guitarist and on  june  jones was visited by mick jagger keith richards and charlie watts and was told that the group he had formed would continue without him to the public it appeared as if jones had left voluntarily the other band members told him that although he was being asked to leave it was his choice how to break it to the public jones released a statement on  june  announcing his departure in this statement he said among other things that i no longer see eyetoeye with the others over the discs we are cutting jones was replaced by yearold guitarist mick taylor formerly of john mayalls bluesbreakers during the period of his decreasing involvement in the band jones was living at cotchford farm in east sussex the residence formerly owned by winniethepooh author a a milne which jones had purchased in november  alexis korner who visited in late june noted that jones seemed happier than he had ever been jones is known to have contacted korner ian stewart john lennon mitch mitchell and jimmy miller about intentions to put together another band jones had apparently demoed a few of his own songs in the weeks before his death including has anybody seen my baby and chow time equipmentedit joness main guitar in the early years was a harmony stratotone which he replaced with a gretsch double anniversary in twotone green in  and  he often used a teardropshaped prototype vox mark iii from late  until his death jones used gibson models various firebirds es and a les paul model as well as two rickenbacker string models he can also be seen playing a fender telecaster in the  jumpin jack flash promo video deathedit joness grave in cheltenham cemetery at around midnight on the night of – july  jones was discovered motionless at the bottom of his swimming pool at cotchford farm his swedish girlfriend anna wohlin was convinced jones was alive when he was taken out of the pool insisting he still had a pulse however by the time the doctors arrived it was too late and he was pronounced dead the coroners report stated death by misadventure and noted his liver and heart were heavily enlarged by drug and alcohol abuse upon joness death the whos pete townshend wrote a poem titled a normal day for brian a man who died every day printed in the times jimi hendrix dedicated a song to him on us television and jim morrison of the doors published a poem titled ode to la while thinking of brian jones deceased coincidentally hendrix and morrison both died within the following two years all three at age  jones hendrix and morrison are considered the th th and th members of the  club respectively the rolling stones performed at a free concert in hyde park on  july  two days after joness death the concert had been scheduled weeks earlier as an opportunity to present the stones new guitarist mick taylor and the band decided to dedicate the concert to jones before the rolling stones set jagger read excerpts from adonais a poem by percy bysshe shelley about the death of his friend john keats and stagehands released hundreds of white butterflies as part of the tribute the band opened with a johnny winter song that was one of joness favourites im yours and im hers jones was reportedly buried  feet  m deep in cheltenham cemetery to prevent exhumation by trophy hunters his body was embalmed hair bleached white and was placed in an airtight metal casket watts and wyman were the only rolling stones who attended the funeral mick jagger and marianne faithfull were travelling to australia to begin the filming of ned kelly they stated that their contracts did not allow them to delay the trip to attend the funeral when asked if he felt guilty about joness death mick jagger told rolling stone in  no i dont really i do feel that i behaved in a very childish way but we were very young and in some ways we picked on him but unfortunately he made himself a target for it he was very very jealous very difficult very manipulative and if you do that in this kind of a group of people you get back as good as you give to be honest i wasnt understanding enough about his drug addiction no one seemed to know much about drug addiction things like lsd were all new no one knew the harm people thought cocaine was good for you murder claimsedit theories surrounding joness death developed soon afterwards with associates of the stones claiming to have information that he was murdered according to rock biographer philip norman the murder theory would bubble back to the surface every five years or so in  it was reported that jones was murdered by frank thorogood who was doing some construction work on the property he was the last person to see jones alive thorogood allegedly confessed the murder to the rolling stones driver tom keylock who later denied this the thorogood theory was dramatised in the  movie stoned in august  sussex police decided to review joness death for the first time since  after new evidence was handed to them by scott jones an investigative journalist in the uk scott jones had traced many of the people who were at brian joness house the night he died plus unseen police files held at the national archives according to trevor hobley chairman of the brian jones fan club a neighbour saw a large bonfire on jones estate in which documentation was being burned on the morning of jones death as he was leaving for work at  am in the mail on sunday in november  scott jones said frank thorogood killed brian jones in a fight and senior police officers covered up the true cause of death following the review the sussex police stated that they would not be reopening the case they asserted that this has been thoroughly reviewed by sussex polices crime policy and review branch but there is no new evidence to suggest that the coroners original verdict of death by misadventure was incorrect songwriting creditsedit unsure and insecure as a composer jones was not a prolific songwriter the second rice krispies jingle for kelloggs cowritten with the j walter thompson advertising agency in  and performed by the rolling stones incognito was credited to jones this did not sit well with the rest of the band who felt it was a group effort and all should benefit equally jones was also included in the nankerphelge songwriting credit a pseudonym used on fourteen tracks that were composed by the entire band and andrew oldham according to andrew oldham the main reason for joness not writing songs was that jones being a blues purist did not love simple pop music enough oldham tried to establish a songwriting partnership between jones and gene pitney after becoming bored senseless by joness bleating about the potential of halffinished melodies that by no means deserved completion but after two days of sessions the results remain best to be unheard even by rolling stones completists when asked in  if he had written songs jones replied always tried ive written quite a few but mostly in blues style many years later after his death keith richards stated no no absolutely not that was the one thing he would never do brian wouldnt show them to anybody within the stones brian as far as i know never wrote a single finished song in his life he wrote bits and pieces but he never presented them to us no doubt he spent hours weeks working on things but his paranoia was so great that he could never bring himself to present them to uspage needed in  mick jagger told rolling stone magazine that jones had been jealous of the jaggerrichards songwriting team and added to be honest brian had no talent for writing songs none ive never known a guy with less talent for songwriting marianne faithfull reported that jones wrote an early version of the melody for ruby tuesday and presented it to the group victor bockris reported that keith richards and brian jones worked out the final melody in the studio additionally jones is credited along with keith richards for the instrumental piece hear it however in  jones composed produced and played on the soundtrack to mord und totschlag english title a degree of murder an avantgarde german film with anita pallenberg adding the majority of the instrumentation to the soundtrack the only known released

months after his death jones also played percussion on the jimi hendrix song all along the watchtower that’s him playing the thwack you hear at the end of each bar in the intro on an instrument called a vibraslap  public image and legacyedit anita pallenberg has stated in an interview that he wanted to look like françoise hardy he loved dressing up and posing about and that he would ask her to do his hair and makeup bo diddley described brian as a little dude that was trying to pull the group ahead i saw him as the leader he didnt take no mess he was a fantastic cat he handled the group beautifully joness death at  was the first of the s rock movement jimi hendrix janis joplin and jim morrison found their own drugrelated deaths at the same age within two years morrison died two years to the day after jones the coincidence of ages has been described as the  club when alastair johns who owned cotchford farm for over  years after joness death refurbished the pool he sold the original tiles to joness fans for £ each which paid for half of the work johns noted that cotchford farm remained for decades an attraction for jones fans songs have been written about jones morrison originally wrote the doors song tightrope ride for jones but after morrisons death ray manzarek rewrote some of the lyrics so that they apply to both musicianscitation needed the psychic tv song

august  both joness parents were interested in music his mother louisa was a piano teacher and in addition to his job as an aeronautical engineer lewis jones played piano and organ and led the choir

first acoustic guitar as a th birthday present jones attended local schools including dean close school from september  to july  and cheltenham grammar school for boys which he entered in september  after passing the elevenplus exam he enjoyed badminton and diving at school and attained first clarinet in the school orchestra in  he reportedly obtained seven olevel passes then he continued into the sixth form and obtained a further two olevels he also took three alevels in physics chemistry and biology and passed in physics and chemistry but failed in biology jones was able to perform well in exams despite a lack of academic effort however he found school regimented and disliked conforming he disliked the school uniforms and angered teachers with his behaviour though he was popular with classmates jones himself said when i made the sixth form i found myself accepted by the older boys suddenly i was in his hostility to authority figures resulted in his suspension from school on two occasions according to dick hattrell a childhood friend he was a rebel without a cause but when examinations came he was brilliant in late summer  jones yearold girlfriend a cheltenham schoolgirl named valerie corbett became pregnant although jones is said to have encouraged her to have an abortion she carried the child to term and placed baby barry david later simon for adoption jones quit school in disgrace and left home travelling for a summer through northern europe and scandinavia during this period he lived a bohemian lifestyle busking with his guitar on the streets for money and living off the charity of others eventually he ran short of money and returned to england jones listened to classical music as a child but preferred blues particularly elmore james and robert johnson he began performing at local blues and jazz clubs while busking and working odd jobs he reportedly stole small amounts of money from work to pay for cigarettes for which he was fired in november  jones went to the wooden bridge hotel in guildford to see a band perform he met a young married woman named angeline and the two had a onenight stand that resulted in her pregnancy angeline and her husband decided to raise the baby belinda born on  august  jones never knew about her birth in  jones applied for a scholarship to cheltenham art college he was initially accepted into the programme but two days later the offer was withdrawn after an unidentified acquaintance wrote to the college calling jones an irresponsible drifter on  october  jones girlfriend pat andrews gave birth to his third child julian mark andrews jones sold his record collection to buy flowers for pat and clothes for the newborn he lived with them for a while on  july  another woman linda lawrence later married to donovan gave birth to jones fourth child julian brian in early october  an occasional girlfriend of brians dawn molloy announced to brian and the bands management that she was pregnant by brian she received a cheque for £ from andrew loog oldham ltd in return she signed an agreement that the matter was now closed and she would make no statement about brian jones or the child to the public or the press the undated statement was signed by molloy and witnessed by mick jagger in march  dawn gave birth to brians fifth child paul molloy renamed john maynard by his adoptive parents forming the rolling stonesedit jones left cheltenham and moved to london where he became friends with fellow musicians alexis korner future manfred mann singer paul jones then named paul pond future cream bassist jack bruce and others who made up the small london rhythm and blues and jazz scene there he became a blues musician for a brief time calling himself elmo lewis and playing slide guitar jones also started a group with paul jones called the roosters and in january  after both brian and paul left the group eric clapton took over brians position as guitarist jones placed an advertisement in jazz news a soho club information sheet on  may  inviting musicians to audition for a new rb group at the bricklayers arms pub pianist ian stu stewart was the first to respond later singer mick jagger also joined this band jagger and his childhood friend keith richards had met jones when he and paul jones were playing elmore james dust my broom with korners band at the ealing jazz club jagger brought guitarist richards to rehearsals richards then joined the band jones and stewarts acceptance of richards and the chuck berry songs he wanted to play coincided with the departure of blues purists geoff bradford and brian knight who had no tolerance for chuck berry as keith richards tells it jones came up with the name the rollin stones later with the g while on the phone with a venue owner the voice on the other end of the line obviously said what are you called panic the best of muddy waters album was lying on the floor—and track five side one was rollin stone blues the rollin stones played their first gig on  july  in the marquee club in london with jagger richards jones stewart bass player dick taylor later of the pretty things and drummer tony chapman from september  to september  jones jagger and richards shared a flat referred to by richards as a beautiful dump at  edith grove chelsea with james phelge a future photographer whose name was used in some of the groups early nankerphelge writing credits jones and richards spent day after day playing guitar while listening to blues records notably jimmy reed muddy waters willie dixon and howlin wolf during this time jones also taught jagger how to play harmonica the four rollin stones went searching for a bassist and drummer finally settling on bill wyman on bass because he had a spare vox ac guitar amplifier and always had cigarettes as well as a bass guitar that he had built himself after playing with mick avory tony chapman and carlo little in january  they finally persuaded jazzinfluenced charlie watts to join them at the time watts was considered by fellow musicians to be one of the better drummers in london he had played with among others alexis korners group blues incorporated watts described joness role in these early days brian was very instrumental in pushing the band at the beginning keith and i would look at him and say he was barmy it was a crusade to him to get us on the stage in a club and be paid halfacrown and to be billed as an rb bandpage needed while acting as the bands business manager jones received £ more than the other members equivalent to £ in  which did not sit well with the rest of the band and created resentmentpage needed keith richards has said that both he and jagger were surprised to learn that jones considered himself the leader and was receiving the extra £

just wanna make love to you walking the dog money im alright you better move on and its all over now he contributed backing vocals as late as  on sympathy for the devil he is also responsible for the whistling on walking the dog richards maintains that what he calls guitar weaving emerged from this period from listening to jimmy reed albums we listened to the teamwork trying to work out what was going on in those records how you could play together with two guitars and make it sound like four or five joness and richardss guitars became a signature of the sound of the rolling stones with both guitarists playing rhythm and lead without clear boundaries between the two roles his aptitude for playing a wide variety of instruments is particularly evident on the albums aftermath  between the buttons  and their satanic majesties request  estrangement from bandmatesedit michael cooper mick jagger marianne faithfull al vandenberg jones and maharishi mahesh yogi amsterdam  andrew loog oldhams arrival as manager marked the beginning of joness slow estrangement oldham recognised the financial advantages of bandmembers writing their own songs as exemplified by lennon–mccartney and that playing covers would not sustain a band in the limelight for long further oldham wanted to make jaggers charisma and flamboyance a focus of live performances jones saw his influence over the stones direction slide as their repertoire comprised fewer of the blues covers than he preferred more jaggerrichards originals developed and oldham increased his own managerial control displacing jones from yet another role according to oldham in his book stoned jones was an outsider from the beginning when the first tours were arranged in  he travelled separately from the band stayed at different hotels and demanded extra pay according to oldham jones was very emotional and felt alienated because he was not a prolific songwriter and his management role had been taken away he resisted the symbiosis demanded by the group lifestyle and so life was becoming more desperate for him day by day none of us were looking forward to brian totally cracking up the toll from days on the road the money and fame and the feeling of being alienated from the group resulted in joness overindulgence in alcohol and other drugs these excesses had a debilitative effect on his physical and mental health and according to oldham jones became unfriendly and antisocial at times jones was arrested for drug possession on  may  shortly after the redlands incident at richards sussex home authorities found marijuana cocaine and methamphetamine in his flat he confessed to marijuana use but claimed he did not use hard drugscitation needed in june  jones attended the monterey pop festival there he met frank zappa and dennis hopper and went on stage to introduce the jimi hendrix experience who were not yet well known in the united states hostility grew between jones jagger and richards alienating jones further from the group although many noted that jones could be friendly and outgoing wyman richards and watts have commented that he could also be cruel and difficult by most accounts joness attitude changed frequently he was one minute caring and generous the next making an effort to anger everyone as wyman observed in stone alone there were at least two sides to brians personality one brian was introverted shy sensitive deepthinking the other was a preening peacock gregarious artistic desperately needing assurance from his peers he pushed every friendship to the limit and way beyond in march  anita pallenberg joness girlfriend of two years left him for richards when jones was hospitalised during a trip the three made to morocco further damaging the already strained relations between jones and richards as tensions and joness substance abuse increased his musical contributions became sporadic he became bored with the guitar and sought exotic instruments to play and he was increasingly absent from recording sessions in peter whiteheads promotional film for we love you made in july  he appears extremely groggy and disoriented joness last substantial sessions with the stones occurred in spring and summer of  when the stones produced jumpin jack flash and the beggars banquet album he can be seen in the jeanluc godard film one plus one playing acoustic guitar and chatting and sharing cigarettes with richards although jones is neglected in the musicmaking the film chronicles the making of sympathy for the devil where once jones played multiple instruments on many tracks he now played only minor roles on a few pieces joness last formal appearance was in the december  the rolling stones rock and roll circus a part concert part circusact film organised by the band it went unreleased for  years because jagger was unhappy with the bands performance compared to others in the film such as jethro tull john lennon the who and taj mahal commentary included as bonus material indicated that almost everyone at the concert sensed that the end of joness time with the rolling stones was near and roger daltrey and pete townshend of the who thought it would be joness last live musical performance departure from the bandedit jones was arrested a second time on  may  for possession of cannabis which jones said had been left by previous tenants of the flat due to his being on probation he was facing a long jail sentence if found guilty the jury found him guilty but the judge had sympathy for jones instead of jailing him he fined him £ plus £ in costs and told him for goodness sake dont get into trouble again or it really will be serious joness legal troubles estrangement from his bandmates substance abuse and mood swings became too much of an obstacle to his active participation in the band the rolling stones wanted to tour the united states in  for the first time in three years but jones was not in fit condition to tour and his second arrest exacerbated problems with acquiring a us work visa in addition jones attendance at rehearsals and recording sessions had become erratic and when he did appear he either rarely contributed anything musically or when he did his bandmates would switch off his amplifier leaving richards to play nearly all the guitars according to author gary herman jones was literally incapable of making music when he tried to play harmonica his mouth started bleeding this behaviour was problematic during the beggars banquet sessions and had worsened by the time the band commenced recording let it bleed in march  jones borrowed the groups jaguar and went shopping in pimlico road after the parked car was towed away by police jones hired a chauffeurdriven car to get home in may  jones crashed his motorcycle into a shop window and was secretly taken to hospital under an assumed name from this point jones was still attending recording sessions but was no longer a major contributor to the bands music by may he had made two contributions to the work in progress autoharp on you got the silver and percussion on midnight rambler jagger informed jones that he would be fired from the band if he did not turn up to a photo session looking frail he nonetheless showed up and his last photo session as a rolling stone took place on  may  first at st katherine docks tower bridge london and then at ethan russells photographic studio in south kensington the photos would appear on the album through the past darkly big hits vol in september  the stones decided that following the release of the let it bleed album scheduled for a july  release in the us they would start a north american tour in november  however the stones management was informed that because of his drug convictions jones would not receive a work permit at the suggestion of pianist and road manager ian stewart the stones decided to add a new guitarist and on  june  jones was visited by mick jagger keith richards and charlie watts and was told that the group he had formed would continue without him to the public it appeared as if jones had left voluntarily the other band members told him that although he was being asked to leave it was his choice how to break it to the public jones released a statement on  june  announcing his departure in this statement he said among other things that i no longer see eyetoeye with the others over the discs we are cutting jones was replaced by yearold guitarist mick taylor formerly of john mayalls bluesbreakers during the period of his decreasing involvement in the band jones was living at cotchford farm in east sussex the residence formerly owned by winniethepooh author a a milne which jones had purchased in november  alexis korner who visited in late june noted that jones seemed happier than he had ever been jones is known to have contacted korner ian stewart john lennon mitch mitchell and jimmy miller about intentions to put together another band jones had apparently demoed a few of his own songs in the weeks before his death including has anybody seen my baby and chow time equipmentedit joness main guitar in the early years was a harmony stratotone which he replaced with a gretsch double anniversary in twotone green in  and  he often used a teardropshaped prototype vox mark iii from late  until his death jones used gibson models various firebirds es and a les paul model as well as two rickenbacker string models he can also be seen playing a fender telecaster in the  jumpin jack flash promo video deathedit joness grave in cheltenham cemetery at around midnight on the night of – july  jones was discovered motionless at the bottom of his swimming pool at cotchford farm his swedish girlfriend anna wohlin was convinced jones was alive when he was taken out of the pool insisting he still had a pulse however by the time the doctors arrived it was too late and he was pronounced dead the coroners report stated death by misadventure and noted his liver and heart were heavily enlarged by drug and alcohol abuse upon joness death the whos pete townshend wrote a poem titled a normal day for brian a man who died every day printed in the times jimi hendrix dedicated a song to him on us television and jim morrison of the doors published a poem titled ode to la while thinking of brian jones deceased coincidentally hendrix and morrison both died within the following two years all three at age  jones hendrix and morrison are considered the th th and th members of the  club respectively the rolling stones performed at a free concert in hyde park on  july  two days after joness death the concert had been scheduled weeks earlier as an opportunity to present the stones new guitarist mick taylor and the band decided to dedicate the concert to jones before the rolling stones set jagger read excerpts from adonais a poem by percy bysshe shelley about the death of his friend john keats and stagehands released hundreds of white butterflies as part of the tribute the band opened with a johnny winter song that was one of joness favourites im yours and im hers jones was reportedly buried  feet  m deep in cheltenham cemetery to prevent exhumation by trophy hunters his body was embalmed hair bleached white and was placed in an airtight metal casket watts and wyman were the only rolling stones who attended the funeral mick jagger and marianne faithfull were travelling to australia to begin the filming of ned kelly they stated that their contracts did not allow them to delay the trip to attend the funeral when asked if he felt guilty about joness death mick jagger told rolling stone in  no i dont really i do feel that i behaved in a very childish way but we were very young and in some ways we picked on him but unfortunately he made himself a target for it he was very very jealous very difficult very manipulative and if you do that in this kind of a group of people you get back as good as you give to be honest i wasnt understanding enough about his drug addiction no one seemed to know much about drug addiction things like lsd were all new no one knew the harm people thought cocaine was good for you murder claimsedit theories surrounding joness death developed soon afterwards with associates of the stones claiming to have information that he was murdered according to rock biographer philip norman the murder theory would bubble back to the surface every five years or so in  it was reported that jones was murdered by frank thorogood who was doing some construction work on the property he was the last person to see jones alive thorogood allegedly confessed the murder to the rolling stones driver tom keylock who later denied this the thorogood theory was dramatised in the  movie stoned in august  sussex police decided to review joness death for the first time since  after new evidence was handed to them by scott jones an investigative journalist in the uk scott jones had traced many of the people who were at brian joness house the night he died plus unseen police files held at the national archives according to trevor hobley chairman of the brian jones fan club a neighbour saw a large bonfire on jones estate in which documentation was being burned on the morning of jones death as he was leaving for work at  am in the mail on sunday in november  scott jones said frank thorogood killed brian jones in a fight and senior police officers covered up the true cause of death following the review the sussex police stated that they would not be reopening the case they asserted that this has been thoroughly reviewed by sussex polices crime policy and review branch but there is no new evidence to suggest that the coroners original verdict of death by misadventure was incorrect songwriting creditsedit unsure and insecure as a composer jones was not a prolific songwriter the second rice krispies jingle for kelloggs cowritten with the j walter thompson advertising agency in  and performed by the rolling stones incognito was credited to jones this did not sit well with the rest of the band who felt it was a group effort and all should benefit equally jones was also included in the nankerphelge songwriting credit a pseudonym used on fourteen tracks that were composed by the entire band and andrew oldham according to andrew oldham the main reason for joness not writing songs was that jones being a blues purist did not love simple pop music enough oldham tried to establish a songwriting partnership between jones and gene pitney after becoming bored senseless by joness bleating about the potential of halffinished melodies that by no means deserved completion but after two days of sessions the results remain best to be unheard even by rolling stones completists when asked in  if he had written songs jones replied always tried ive written quite a few but mostly in blues style many years later after his death keith richards stated no no absolutely not that was the one thing he would never do brian wouldnt show them to anybody within the stones brian as far as i know never wrote a single finished song in his life he wrote bits and pieces but he never presented them to us no doubt he spent hours weeks working on things but his paranoia was so great that he could never bring himself to present them to uspage needed in  mick jagger told rolling stone magazine that jones had been jealous of the jaggerrichards songwriting team and added to be honest brian had no talent for writing songs none ive never known a guy with less talent for songwriting marianne faithfull reported that jones wrote an early version of the melody for ruby tuesday and presented it to the group victor bockris reported that keith richards and brian jones worked out the final melody in the studio additionally jones is credited along with keith richards for the instrumental piece hear it however in  jones composed produced and played on the soundtrack to mord und totschlag english title a degree of murder an avantgarde german film with anita pallenberg adding the majority of the instrumentation to the soundtrack the only known released

beautifully joness death at  was the first of the s rock movement jimi hendrix janis joplin and jim morrison found their own drugrelated deaths at the same age within two years morrison died two years to the day after jones the coincidence of ages has been described as the  club when alastair johns who owned cotchford farm for over  years after joness death refurbished the pool he sold the original tiles to joness fans for £ each which paid for half of the work johns noted that cotchford farm remained for decades an attraction for jones fans songs have been written about jones morrison

guitarist richards to rehearsals richards then joined the band jones and stewarts acceptance of richards and the chuck berry songs he wanted to play coincided with the departure of blues purists geoff

also taught jagger how to play harmonica the four rollin stones went searching for a bassist and drummer finally settling on bill wyman on bass because he had a spare vox ac guitar amplifier and always had cigarettes as well as a bass guitar that he had built himself after playing with mick avory tony chapman and carlo little in january  they finally persuaded jazzinfluenced charlie watts to join them at the time watts was considered by fellow musicians to be one of the better drummers in london he had played with among others alexis korners group blues incorporated watts described joness

just wanna make love to you walking the dog money im alright you better move on and its all over now he contributed backing vocals as late as  on sympathy for the devil he is also responsible for the whistling on walking the dog richards maintains that what he calls guitar weaving emerged from this period from listening to jimmy reed albums we listened to the teamwork trying to work out what was going on in those records how you could play together with two guitars and make it sound like four or five joness and richardss guitars became a signature of the sound of the rolling stones with both guitarists playing rhythm and lead without clear boundaries between the two roles his aptitude for playing a wide variety of instruments is particularly evident on the albums aftermath  between the buttons  and their satanic majesties request  estrangement from bandmatesedit michael cooper mick jagger marianne faithfull al vandenberg jones and maharishi mahesh yogi amsterdam  andrew loog oldhams arrival as manager marked the beginning of joness slow estrangement oldham recognised the financial advantages of bandmembers writing their own songs as exemplified by lennon–mccartney and that playing covers would not sustain a band in the limelight for long further oldham wanted to make jaggers charisma and flamboyance a focus of live performances jones saw his influence over the stones direction slide as their repertoire comprised fewer of the blues covers than he preferred more jaggerrichards originals developed and oldham increased his own managerial control displacing jones from yet another role according to oldham in his book stoned jones was an outsider from the beginning when the first tours were arranged in  he travelled separately from the band stayed at different hotels and demanded extra pay according to oldham jones was very emotional and felt alienated because he was not a prolific songwriter and his management role had been taken away he resisted the symbiosis demanded by the group lifestyle and so life was becoming more desperate for him day by day none of us were looking forward to brian totally cracking up the toll from days on the road the money and fame and the feeling of being alienated from the group resulted in joness overindulgence in alcohol and other drugs these excesses had a debilitative effect on his physical and mental health and according to oldham jones became unfriendly and antisocial at times jones was arrested for drug possession on  may  shortly after the redlands incident at richards sussex home authorities found marijuana cocaine and methamphetamine in his flat he confessed to marijuana use but claimed he did not use hard drugscitation needed in june  jones attended the monterey pop festival there he met frank zappa and dennis hopper and went on stage to introduce the jimi hendrix experience who were not yet well known in the united states hostility grew between jones jagger and richards alienating jones further from the group although many noted that jones could be friendly and outgoing wyman richards and watts have commented that he could also be cruel and difficult by most accounts joness attitude changed frequently he was one minute caring and generous the next making an effort to anger everyone as wyman observed in stone alone there were at least two sides to brians personality one brian was introverted shy sensitive deepthinking the other was a preening peacock gregarious artistic desperately needing assurance from his peers he pushed every friendship to the limit and way beyond in march  anita pallenberg joness girlfriend of two years left him for richards when jones was hospitalised during a trip the three made to morocco further damaging the already strained relations between jones and richards as tensions and joness substance abuse increased his musical contributions became sporadic he became bored with the guitar and sought exotic instruments to play and he was increasingly absent from recording sessions in peter whiteheads promotional film for we love you made in july  he appears extremely groggy and disoriented joness last substantial sessions with the stones occurred in spring and summer of  when the stones produced jumpin jack flash and the beggars banquet album he can be seen in the jeanluc godard film one plus one playing acoustic guitar and chatting and sharing cigarettes with richards although jones is neglected in the musicmaking the film chronicles the making of sympathy for the devil where once jones played multiple instruments on many tracks he now played only minor roles on a few pieces joness last formal appearance was in the december  the rolling stones rock and roll circus a part concert part circusact film organised by the band it went unreleased for  years because jagger was unhappy with the bands performance compared to others in the film such as jethro tull john lennon the who and taj mahal commentary included as bonus material indicated that almost everyone at the concert sensed that the end of joness time with the rolling stones was near and roger daltrey and pete townshend of the who thought it would be joness last live musical performance departure from the bandedit jones was arrested a second time on  may  for possession of cannabis which jones said had been left by previous tenants of the flat due to his being on probation he was facing a long jail sentence if found guilty the jury found him guilty but the judge had sympathy for jones instead of jailing him he fined him £ plus £ in costs and told him for goodness sake dont get into trouble again or it really will be serious joness legal troubles estrangement from his bandmates substance abuse and mood swings became too much of an obstacle to his active participation in the band the rolling stones wanted to tour the united states in  for the first time in three years but jones was not in fit condition to tour and his second arrest exacerbated problems with acquiring a us work visa in addition jones attendance at rehearsals and recording sessions had become erratic and when he did appear he either rarely contributed anything musically or when he did his bandmates would switch off his amplifier leaving richards to play nearly all the guitars according to author gary herman jones was literally incapable of making music when he tried to play harmonica his mouth started bleeding this behaviour was problematic during the beggars banquet sessions and had worsened by the time the band commenced recording let it bleed in march  jones borrowed the groups jaguar and went shopping in pimlico road after the parked car was towed away by police jones hired a chauffeurdriven car to get home in may  jones crashed his motorcycle into a shop window and was secretly taken to hospital under an assumed name from this point jones was still attending recording sessions but was no longer a major contributor to the bands music by may he had made two contributions to the work in progress autoharp on you got the silver and percussion on midnight rambler jagger informed jones that he would be fired from the band if he did not turn up to a photo session looking frail he nonetheless showed up and his last photo session as a rolling stone took place on  may  first at st katherine docks tower bridge london and then at ethan russells photographic studio in south kensington the photos would appear on the album through the past darkly big hits vol in september  the stones decided that following the release of the let it bleed album scheduled for a july  release in the us they would start a north american tour in november  however the stones management was informed that because of his drug convictions jones would not receive a work permit at the suggestion of pianist and road manager ian stewart the stones decided to add a new guitarist and on  june  jones was visited by mick jagger keith richards and charlie watts and was told that the group he had formed would continue without him to the public it appeared as if jones had left voluntarily the other band members told him that although he was being asked to leave it was his choice how to break it to the public jones released a statement on  june  announcing his departure in this statement he said among other things that i no longer see eyetoeye with the others over the discs we are cutting jones was replaced by yearold guitarist mick taylor formerly of john mayalls bluesbreakers during the period of his decreasing involvement in the band jones was living at cotchford farm in east sussex the residence formerly owned by winniethepooh author a a milne which jones had purchased in november  alexis korner who visited in late june noted that jones seemed happier than he had ever been jones is known to have contacted korner ian stewart john lennon mitch mitchell and jimmy miller about intentions to put together another band jones had apparently demoed a few of his own songs in the weeks before his death including has anybody seen my baby and chow time equipmentedit joness main guitar in the early years was a harmony stratotone which he replaced with a gretsch double anniversary in twotone green in  and  he often used a teardropshaped prototype vox mark iii from late  until his death jones used gibson models various firebirds es and a les paul model as well as two rickenbacker string models he can also be seen playing a fender telecaster in the  jumpin jack flash promo video deathedit joness grave in cheltenham cemetery at around midnight on the night of – july  jones was discovered motionless at the bottom of his swimming pool at cotchford farm his swedish girlfriend anna wohlin was convinced jones was alive when he was taken out of the pool insisting he still had a pulse however by the time the doctors arrived it was too late and he was pronounced dead the coroners report stated death by misadventure and noted his liver and heart were heavily enlarged by drug and alcohol abuse upon joness death the whos pete townshend wrote a poem titled a normal day for brian a man who died every day printed in the times jimi hendrix dedicated a song to him on us television and jim morrison of the doors published a poem titled ode to la while thinking of brian jones deceased coincidentally hendrix and morrison both died within the following two years all three at age  jones hendrix and morrison are considered the th th and th members of the  club respectively the rolling stones performed at a free concert in hyde park on  july  two days after joness death the concert had been scheduled weeks earlier as an opportunity to present the stones new guitarist mick taylor and the band decided to dedicate the concert to jones before the rolling stones set jagger read excerpts from adonais a poem by percy bysshe shelley about the death of his friend john keats and stagehands released hundreds of white butterflies as part of the tribute the band opened with a johnny winter song that was one of joness favourites im yours and im hers jones was reportedly buried  feet  m deep in cheltenham cemetery to prevent exhumation by trophy hunters his body was embalmed hair bleached white and was placed in an airtight metal casket watts and wyman were the only rolling stones who attended the funeral mick jagger and marianne faithfull were travelling to australia to begin the filming of ned kelly they stated that their contracts did not allow them to delay the trip to attend the funeral when asked if he felt guilty about joness death mick jagger told rolling stone in  no i dont really i do feel that i behaved in a very childish way but we were very young and in some ways we picked on him but unfortunately he made himself a target for it he was very very jealous very difficult very manipulative and if you do that in this kind of a group of people you get back as good as you give to be honest i wasnt understanding enough about his drug addiction no one seemed to know much about drug addiction things like lsd were all new no one knew the harm people thought cocaine was good for you murder claimsedit theories surrounding joness death developed soon afterwards with associates of the stones claiming to have information that he was murdered according to rock biographer philip norman the murder theory would bubble back to the surface every five years or so in  it was reported that jones was murdered by frank thorogood who was doing some construction work on the property he was the last person to see jones alive thorogood allegedly confessed the murder to the rolling stones driver tom keylock who later denied this the thorogood theory was dramatised in the  movie stoned in august  sussex police decided to review joness death for the first time since  after new evidence was handed to them by scott jones an investigative journalist in the uk scott jones had traced many of the people who were at brian joness house the night he died plus unseen police files held at the national archives according to trevor hobley chairman of the brian jones fan club a neighbour saw a large bonfire on jones estate in which documentation was being burned on the morning of jones death as he was leaving for work at  am in the mail on sunday in november  scott jones said frank thorogood killed brian jones in a fight and senior police officers covered up the true cause of death following the review the sussex police stated that they would not be reopening the case they asserted that this has been thoroughly reviewed by sussex polices crime policy and review branch but there is no new evidence to suggest that the coroners original verdict of death by misadventure was incorrect songwriting creditsedit unsure and insecure as a composer jones was not a prolific songwriter the second rice krispies jingle for kelloggs cowritten with the j walter thompson advertising agency in  and performed by the rolling stones incognito was credited to jones this did not sit well with the rest of the band who felt it was a group effort and all should benefit equally jones was also included in the nankerphelge songwriting credit a pseudonym used on fourteen tracks that were composed by the entire band and andrew oldham according to andrew oldham the main reason for joness not writing songs was that jones being a blues purist did not love simple pop music enough oldham tried to establish a songwriting partnership between jones and gene pitney after becoming bored senseless by joness bleating about the potential of halffinished melodies that by no means deserved completion but after two days of sessions the results remain best to be unheard even by rolling stones completists when asked in  if he had written songs jones replied always tried ive written quite a few but mostly in blues style many years later after his death keith richards stated no no absolutely not that was the one thing he would never do brian wouldnt show them to anybody within the stones brian as far as i know never wrote a single finished song in his life he wrote bits and pieces but he never presented them to us no doubt he spent hours weeks working on things but his paranoia was so great that he could never bring himself to present them to uspage needed in  mick jagger told rolling stone magazine that jones had been jealous of the jaggerrichards songwriting team and added to be honest brian had no talent for writing songs none ive never known a guy with less talent for songwriting marianne faithfull reported that jones wrote an early version of the melody for ruby tuesday and presented it to the group victor bockris reported that keith richards and brian jones worked out the final melody in the studio additionally jones is credited along with keith richards for the instrumental piece hear it however in  jones composed produced and played on the soundtrack to mord und totschlag english title a degree of murder an avantgarde german film with anita pallenberg adding the majority of the instrumentation to the soundtrack the only known released brian jones song is thank you for being there which reportedly is a poem by jones put to music by carla olson it appeared on the  album true voices as performed by krysia kristianne and robin williamson other contributionsedit joness vox mark vi retired for display in summer  jones recorded the moroccobased ensemble the master musicians of joujouka jajouka which was later used by the band

a vibraslap  public image and legacyedit anita pallenberg has stated in an interview that he wanted to look like françoise hardy he loved dressing up and posing about and that he would ask her to do his hair and makeup bo diddley described brian as a little dude that was trying to pull the group ahead i saw him as the leader he didnt take no mess he was a fantastic cat he handled the group beautifully joness death at  was the first of the s rock movement jimi hendrix janis joplin and jim morrison found their own drugrelated deaths at the same age within two years morrison died two years to the day after jones the coincidence of ages has been described as the  club when alastair johns who owned cotchford farm for over  years after joness death refurbished the pool he sold the original tiles to joness fans for £ each which paid for half of the work johns noted that cotchford farm remained for decades an attraction for jones fans songs have been written about jones morrison originally wrote the doors song tightrope ride for jones but after morrisons death ray manzarek rewrote some of the lyrics so that they apply to both musicianscitation needed the psychic tv song

guitarist richards to rehearsals richards then joined the band jones and stewarts acceptance of richards and the chuck berry songs he wanted to play coincided with the departure of blues purists geoff bradford and brian knight who had no tolerance for chuck berry as keith richards tells it jones came up with the name the rollin stones later with the g while on the phone with a venue owner the voice on the other end of the line obviously said what are you called panic the best of muddy waters album was lying on the floor—and track five side one was rollin stone blues the rollin stones played their first gig on  july  in the marquee club in london with jagger richards jones stewart bass player dick taylor later of the pretty things and drummer tony chapman from september  to september  jones jagger and richards shared a flat referred to by richards as a beautiful dump at  edith grove chelsea with james phelge a future photographer whose name was used in some of the groups early nankerphelge writing credits jones and richards spent day after day playing guitar while listening to blues records notably jimmy reed muddy waters willie dixon and howlin wolf during this time jones also taught jagger how to play harmonica the four rollin stones went searching for a bassist and drummer finally settling on bill wyman on bass because he had a spare vox ac guitar amplifier and always had cigarettes as well as a bass guitar that he had built himself after playing with mick avory tony chapman and carlo little in january  they finally persuaded jazzinfluenced charlie watts to join them at the time watts was considered by fellow musicians to be one of the better drummers in london he had played with among others alexis korners group blues incorporated watts described joness role in these early days brian was very instrumental in pushing the band at the beginning keith and i would look at him and say he was barmy it was a crusade to him to get us on the stage in a club

just wanna make love to you walking the dog money im alright you better move on and its all over now he contributed backing vocals as late as  on sympathy for the devil he is also responsible for the whistling on walking the dog richards maintains that what he calls guitar weaving emerged from this period from listening to jimmy reed albums we listened to the teamwork trying to work out what was going on in those records how you could play together with two guitars and make it sound like four or five joness and richardss guitars became a signature of the sound of the rolling stones with both guitarists playing rhythm and lead without clear boundaries between the two roles his aptitude for playing a wide variety of instruments is particularly evident on the albums aftermath  between the buttons  and their satanic majesties request  estrangement from bandmatesedit michael cooper mick jagger marianne faithfull al vandenberg jones and maharishi mahesh yogi amsterdam  andrew loog oldhams arrival as manager marked the beginning of joness slow estrangement oldham recognised the financial advantages of bandmembers writing their own songs as exemplified by lennon–mccartney and that playing covers would not sustain a band in the limelight for long further oldham wanted to make jaggers charisma and flamboyance a focus of live performances jones saw his influence over the stones direction slide as their repertoire comprised fewer of the blues covers than he preferred more jaggerrichards originals developed and oldham increased his own managerial control displacing jones from yet another role according to oldham in his book stoned jones was an outsider from the beginning when the first tours were arranged in  he travelled separately from the band stayed at different hotels and demanded extra pay according to oldham jones was very emotional and felt alienated because he was not a prolific songwriter and his management role had been taken away he resisted the symbiosis demanded by the group lifestyle and so life was becoming more desperate for him day by day none of us were looking forward to brian totally cracking up the toll from days on the road the money and fame and the feeling of being alienated from the group resulted in joness overindulgence in alcohol and other drugs these excesses had a debilitative effect on his physical and mental health and according to oldham jones became unfriendly and antisocial at times jones was arrested for drug possession on  may  shortly after the redlands incident at richards sussex home authorities found marijuana cocaine and methamphetamine in his flat he confessed to marijuana use but claimed he did not use hard drugscitation needed in june  jones attended the monterey pop festival there he met frank zappa and dennis hopper and went on stage to introduce the jimi hendrix experience who were not yet well known in the united states hostility grew between jones jagger and richards alienating jones further from the group although many noted that jones could be friendly and outgoing wyman richards and watts have commented that he could also be cruel and difficult by most accounts joness attitude changed frequently he was one minute caring and generous the next making an effort to anger everyone as wyman observed in stone alone there were at least two sides to brians personality one brian was introverted shy sensitive deepthinking the other was a preening peacock gregarious artistic desperately needing assurance from his peers he pushed every friendship to the limit and way beyond in march  anita pallenberg joness girlfriend of two years left him for richards when jones was hospitalised during a trip the three made to morocco further damaging the already strained relations between jones and richards as tensions and joness substance abuse increased his musical contributions became sporadic he became bored with the guitar and sought exotic instruments to play and he was increasingly absent from recording sessions in peter whiteheads promotional film for we love you made in july  he appears extremely groggy and disoriented joness last substantial sessions with the stones occurred in spring and summer of  when the stones produced jumpin jack flash and the beggars banquet album he can be seen in the jeanluc godard film one plus one playing acoustic guitar and chatting and sharing cigarettes with richards although jones is neglected in the musicmaking the film chronicles the making of sympathy for the devil where once jones played multiple instruments on many tracks he now played only minor roles on a few pieces joness last formal appearance was in the december  the rolling stones rock and roll circus a part concert part circusact film organised by the band it went unreleased for  years because jagger was unhappy with the bands performance compared to others in the film such as jethro tull john lennon the who and taj mahal commentary included as bonus material indicated that almost everyone at the concert sensed that the end of joness time with the rolling stones was near and roger daltrey and pete townshend of the who thought it would be joness last live musical performance departure from the bandedit jones was arrested a second time on  may  for possession of cannabis which jones said had been left by previous tenants of the flat due to his being on probation he was facing a long jail sentence if found guilty the jury found him guilty but the judge had sympathy for jones instead of jailing him he fined him £ plus £ in costs and told him for goodness sake dont get into trouble again or it really will be serious joness legal troubles estrangement from his bandmates substance abuse and mood swings became too much of an obstacle to his active participation in the band the rolling stones wanted to tour the united states in  for the first time in three years but jones was not in fit condition to tour and his second arrest exacerbated problems with acquiring a us work visa in addition jones attendance at rehearsals and recording sessions had become erratic and when he did appear he either rarely contributed anything musically or when he did his bandmates would switch off his amplifier leaving richards to play nearly all the guitars according to author gary herman jones was literally incapable of making music when he tried to play harmonica his mouth started bleeding this behaviour was problematic during the beggars banquet sessions and had worsened by the time the band commenced recording let it bleed in march  jones borrowed the groups jaguar and went shopping in pimlico road after the parked car was towed away by police jones hired a chauffeurdriven car to get home in may  jones crashed his motorcycle into a shop window and was secretly taken to hospital under an assumed name from this point jones was still attending recording sessions but was no longer a major contributor to the bands music by may he had made two contributions to the work in progress autoharp on you got the silver and percussion on midnight rambler jagger informed jones that he would be fired from the band if he did not turn up to a photo session looking frail he nonetheless showed up and his last photo session as a rolling stone took place on  may  first at st katherine docks tower bridge london and then at ethan russells photographic studio in south kensington the photos would appear on the album through the past darkly big hits vol in september  the stones decided that following the release of the let it bleed album scheduled for a july  release in the us they would start a north american tour in november  however the stones management was informed that because of his drug convictions jones would not receive a work permit at the suggestion of pianist and road manager ian stewart the stones decided to add a new guitarist and on  june  jones was visited by mick jagger keith richards and charlie watts and was told that the group he had formed would continue without him to the public it appeared as if jones had left voluntarily the other band members told him that although he was being asked to leave it was his choice how to break it to the public jones released a statement on  june  announcing his departure in this statement he said among other things that i no longer see eyetoeye with the others over the discs we are cutting jones was replaced by yearold guitarist mick taylor formerly of john mayalls bluesbreakers during the period of his decreasing involvement in the band jones was living at cotchford farm in east sussex the residence formerly owned by winniethepooh author a a milne which jones had purchased in november  alexis korner who visited in late june noted that jones seemed happier than he had ever been jones is known to have contacted korner ian stewart john lennon mitch mitchell and jimmy miller about intentions to put together another band jones had apparently demoed a few of his own songs in the weeks before his death including has anybody seen my baby and chow time equipmentedit joness main guitar in the early years was a harmony stratotone which he replaced with a gretsch double anniversary in twotone green in  and  he often used a teardropshaped prototype vox mark iii from late  until his death jones used gibson models various firebirds es and a les paul model as well as two rickenbacker string models he can also be seen playing a fender telecaster in the  jumpin jack flash promo video deathedit joness grave in cheltenham cemetery at around midnight on the night of – july  jones was discovered motionless at the bottom of his swimming pool at cotchford farm his swedish girlfriend anna wohlin was convinced jones was alive when he was taken out of the pool insisting he still had a pulse however by the time the doctors arrived it was too late and he was pronounced dead the coroners report stated death by misadventure and noted his liver and heart were heavily enlarged by drug and alcohol abuse upon joness death the whos pete townshend wrote a poem titled a normal day for brian a man who died every day printed in the times jimi hendrix dedicated a song to him on us television and jim morrison of the doors published a poem titled ode to la while thinking of brian jones deceased coincidentally hendrix and morrison both died within the following two years all three at age  jones hendrix and morrison are considered the th th and th members of the  club respectively the rolling stones performed at a free concert in hyde park on  july  two days after joness death the concert had been scheduled weeks earlier as an opportunity to present the stones new guitarist mick taylor and the band decided to dedicate the concert to jones before the rolling stones set jagger read excerpts from adonais a poem by percy bysshe shelley about the death of his friend john keats and stagehands released hundreds of white butterflies as part of the tribute the band opened with a johnny winter song that was one of joness favourites im yours and im hers jones was reportedly buried  feet  m deep in cheltenham cemetery to prevent exhumation by trophy hunters his body was embalmed hair bleached white and was placed in an airtight metal casket watts and wyman were the only rolling stones who attended the funeral mick jagger and marianne faithfull were travelling to australia to begin the filming of ned kelly they stated that their contracts did not allow them to delay the trip to attend the funeral when asked if he felt guilty about joness death mick jagger told rolling stone in  no i dont really i do feel that i behaved in a very childish way but we were very young and in some ways we picked on him but unfortunately he made himself a target for it he was very very jealous very difficult very manipulative and if you do that in this kind of a group of people you get back as good as you give to be honest i wasnt understanding enough about his drug addiction no one seemed to know much about drug addiction things like lsd were all new no one knew the harm people thought cocaine was good for you murder claimsedit theories surrounding joness death developed soon afterwards with associates of the stones claiming to have information that he was murdered according to rock biographer philip norman the murder theory would bubble back to the surface every five years or so in  it was reported that jones was murdered by frank thorogood who was doing some construction work on the property he was the last person to see jones alive thorogood allegedly confessed the murder to the rolling stones driver tom keylock who later denied this the thorogood theory was dramatised in the  movie stoned in august  sussex police decided to review joness death for the first time since  after new evidence was handed to them by scott jones an investigative journalist in the uk scott jones had traced many of the people who were at brian joness house the night he died plus unseen police files held at the national archives according to trevor hobley chairman of the brian jones fan club a neighbour saw a large bonfire on jones estate in which documentation was being burned on the morning of jones death as he was leaving for work at  am in the mail on sunday in november  scott jones said frank thorogood killed brian jones in a fight and senior police officers covered up the true cause of death following the review the sussex police stated that they would not be reopening the case they asserted that this has been thoroughly reviewed by sussex polices crime policy and review branch but there is no new evidence to suggest that the coroners original verdict of death by misadventure was incorrect songwriting creditsedit unsure and insecure as a composer jones was not a prolific songwriter the second rice krispies jingle for kelloggs cowritten with the j walter thompson advertising agency in  and performed by the rolling stones incognito was credited to jones this did not sit well with the rest of the band who felt it was a group effort and all should benefit equally jones was also included in the nankerphelge songwriting credit a pseudonym used on fourteen tracks that were composed by the entire band and andrew oldham according to andrew oldham the main reason for joness not writing songs was that jones being a blues purist did not love simple pop music enough oldham tried to establish a songwriting partnership between jones and gene pitney after becoming bored senseless by joness bleating about the potential of halffinished melodies that by no means deserved completion but after two days of sessions the results remain best to be unheard even by rolling stones completists when asked in  if he had written songs jones replied always tried ive written quite a few but mostly in blues style many years later after his death keith richards stated no no absolutely not that was the one thing he would never do brian wouldnt show them to anybody within the stones brian as far as i know never wrote a single finished song in his life he wrote bits and pieces but he never presented them to us no doubt he spent hours weeks working on things but his paranoia was so great that he could never bring himself to present them to uspage needed in  mick jagger told rolling stone magazine that jones had been jealous of the jaggerrichards songwriting team and added to be honest brian had no talent for writing songs none ive never known a guy with less talent for songwriting marianne faithfull reported that jones wrote an early version of the melody for ruby tuesday and presented it to the group victor bockris reported that keith richards and brian

term marketing comes from the latin mercatus meaning a marketplace pictured la boqueria barcelona spain the moorish bazaar the study of the history of marketing as a discipline is meaningful because it helps to define the baselines upon which change can be recognized and understand how the discipline evolves in response to those changes the practice of marketing has been known for millennia but the term marketing used to describe commercial activities buying and selling a products or services came into popular use in the late nineteenth century the study of the history of marketing as an academic field emerged in the early twentieth century marketers tend to distinguish between the history of marketing practice and the history of marketing thought a the history of marketing practice refers to an investigation into the ways that marketing has been practiced and how those practices have evolved over time as they respond to changing socioeconomic conditions b the history of marketing thought refers to an examination of the ways that marketing has been studied and taught although the history of marketing thought and the history of marketing practice are distinct fields of study they intersect at different junctures marketing practitioners engage in innovative practices that capture the attention of marketing scholars who codify and disseminate such practices at the same time marketing academics often develop new research methods or theories that are subsequently adopted by practitioners thus developments in marketing theory inform marketing practice and vice versa the history of marketing will remain incomplete if one disassociates academia from practitioners the publication in  of robert keiths article the marketing revolution was a pioneering work in the study of the history of marketing practice and in  the publication of robert bartels book the history of marketing thought marked a turningpoint in the understanding of how marketing theory evolved since it first emerged as a separate discipline around the turn of last century contents  marketing history an overview  marketing in antiquity  marketing in the middle ages  marketing in

the distinctive shape of amphora served some of the functions of a label communicating information about region of origin the name of the producer and may have carried product quality claims according to etymologists the term marketing first appeared in dictionaries in the sixteenth century where it referred to the process of buying and selling at a market the contemporary definition of marketing as a process of moving goods from producer to consumer with an emphasis on sales and advertising first appeared in dictionaries in  the term marketing is a derivation of the latin word mercatus meaning market or merchant historians of marketing tend to fall into two distinct branches of marketing history  the history of marketing practice and the history of marketing thought these branches are often deeply divided these branches have very different roots the history of marketing practice is based in management and marketing studies while the history of marketing thought is based in economic and cultural history this means that they ask very different types of research questions and employ different research tools and frameworks historians of marketing have undertaken considerable investigation into the emergence of marketing yet there is little agreement about when marketing first began some researchers argue that marketing practices can be found in antiquity  while others suggest that marketing in its modern form emerged in conjunction with the rise of consumer culture in seventeenth and eighteenth century europe  while yet other researchers suggest that modern marketing was only fully realised in the decades following the industrial revolution in britain from where it subsequently spread to europe and north america hollander and others have suggested that the different dates for the emergence of marketing can be explained by problems surrounding the way that marketing has been defined  whether reference to modern marketing as a planned programmed repertoire of professional practice including activities such as segmentation product differentiation positioning and marketing communications versus marketing as a simple form distribution and exchange marketing in antiquityedit mosaic showing garum container from the house of umbricius scaurus of pompeii the inscription which reads gari flos scombri scauri ex officina scauri has been translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus from the shop of scaurus a number of studies have found evidence of advertising branding packaging and labelling in antiquity umbricius scauras for example was a manufacturer of fish sauce also known as garum in pompeii circa  ce mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house were decorated with images of amphora bearing his personal brand and quality claims the mosaic comprises four different amphora one at each corner of the atrium and bearing labels as follows  gari flos scom scauri ex officina scauri translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus from the shop of scaurus  liquminis flos translated as the flower of liquamen  gari flos scombri scauri translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus  liquamen optimum ex officina scauri translated as the best liquamen from the shop of scaurus the reputation of scauras fish sauce was known to be of very high quality across the mediterannean and its reputation travelled as far away as modern france curtis has described this mosaic as a an advertisement and a rare unequivocal example of a motif inspired by a patron rather than by the artist  in pompeii and nearby herculaneum archeaological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labelling in relatively common use wine jars for example were stamped with names such as lassius and l eumachius probably references to the name of the producer carbonized loaves of bread found at herculaneum indicate that some bakers stamped their bread with the producers name david wengrow has argued that branding became necessary following the urban revolution in ancient mesopotamia in the th century bce when largescale economies started massproducing commodities such as alcoholic drinks cosmetics and textiles these ancient societies imposed strict forms of quality control over commodities and also needed to convey value to the consumer through branding producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which over time were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images often associated with the producers personal identity thus giving the product a personality diana twede has argued that the consumer packaging functions of protection utility and communication have been necessary whenever packages were the object of transactions p  she has shown that amphoras used in mediterranean trade between  and  bce exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings which provided information for transactions systematic use of stamped labels dates from around the fourth century bce in a largely preliterate society the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings conveyed information about the contents region of origin and even the identity of the producer which were understood to convey information about product quality not all historians agree that these markings can be compared with modern brands or labels moore and reid for example have argued that the distinctive shapes and markings in ancient containers should be termed protobrands rather than modern brands marketing in the middle agesedit market scene by pieter aertsen c in england and europe during the middle ages market towns sprang up some analysts have suggested that the term marketing may have first been used in the context of market towns where producers used the term to describe the process of carting and selling their produce and wares in market towns blintiff has investigated the early medieval networks of market towns and suggests that by the th century there was an upsurge in the number of market towns and the emergence of merchant circuits as traders bulked up surpluses from smaller regional different day markets and resold them at the larger centralised market towns braudel and reynold have made a systematic study of these european market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week while daily markets were more common in the larger cities and towns over time permanent shops began to open daily and gradually supplanted the periodic markets peddlers filled in the gaps in distribution by travelling doortodoor selling produce and wares the physical market was characterised by transactional exchange and the economy was characterised by local trading braudel reports that in  goods travelled relatively short distances  grain – miles cattle – miles wool and wollen cloth – miles however following the european age of discovery goods were imported from afar  calico cloth from india porcelain silk and tea from china spices from india and southeast asia and tobacco sugar rum and coffee from the new world bronze plate for printing an advertisement for the liu family needle shop at jinan song dynasty china it is considered the worlds earliest identified printed advertising medium although the rise of consumer culture and marketing in britain and europe have been studied extensively less is known about developments elsewhere nevertheless recent research suggests that china exhibited a rich history of early marketing practices including branding packaging advertising and retail signage from as early as  bce chinese packaging and branding was used to signal family place names and product quality and the use of government imposed product branding was used between  and  ad eckhart and bengtsson have argued that during the song dynasty – chinese society developed a consumerist culture where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite p  the rise of a consumer culture led to the commercial investment in carefully managed company image retail signage symbolic brands trademark protection and the brand concepts of baoji hao lei gongpin piazi and pinpai which roughly equate with western concepts of family status quality grading and upholding traditional chinese values p  eckhardt and bengtssons analysis suggests that brands emerged in china as a result of the social needs and tensions implicit in consumer culture in which brands provide social status and stratification thus the evolution of brands in china stands in sharp contrast to the west where manufacturers pushed brands onto the market in order to differentiate increase market share and ultimately profits pp – marketing in seventeenth and eighteenth century europeedit josiah wedgewoods th century techniques exhibited many of the characteristics of modern marketing scholars have identified specific instances of marketing practices in england and europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as trade between countries or regions grew companies required information on which to base business decisions individuals and companies carried out formal and informal research on trade conditions in  johann fugger travelled from augsburg to graben in order to gather information on the international textile industry he exchanged detailed letters on trade conditions in relevant areas in the early s british industrial houses were demanding information that could be used for business decisions during this period daniel defoe a london merchant published information on trade and economic resources of england and scotland defoe was a prolific publisher and among his many publications are titles devoted to trade including trade of britain stated  trade of scotland with france  and the trade to india critically and calmly considered  all books that were highly popular with merchants and business houses of the period while such activities might now be recognised as marketing research at that time they were known as commercial research or commercial intelligence and not seen as part of the repertoire of activities that make up contemporary marketing practice in a major review of consumer society mckendrick brewer and plumb found extensive evidence of eighteenth century english entrepreneurs using modern marketing techniques including product differentiation sales promotion and loss leader pricing english industrialists josiah wedgewood and matthew boulton are often portrayed as pioneers of modern mass marketing methods wedgewood was known to have used marketing techniques such as direct mail travelling salesmen and catalogues in the eighteenth century wedgewood also carried out serious investigations into the fixed and variable costs of production and recognised that increased production would lead to lower unit costs he also inferred that selling at lower prices would lead to higher demand and recognised the value of achieving scale economies in production by cutting costs and lowering prices wedgewood was able to generate higher overall profits similarly one of wedgewoods contemporaries matthew boulton pioneered early mass production techniques and product differentiation at his soho manufactory in the s he also practiced planned obsolescence and understood the importance of celebrity marketing  that is supplying the nobility often at prices below cost and of obtaining royal patronage for the sake of the publicity and cudos generated evidence of early marketing practices has also been noted across europe a study of the german book trade found examples of both product differentiation and market segmentation in the s other works have documented the use of persuasive advertising practices in eighteenth century italy england and france as early as the s marketing in the nineteenth and twentieth centuriesedit henry ford began manufacturing the massproduced model t in  ford famously said that customers could own a car in any colour as long as it was black until the nineteenth century western economies were characterised by small regional suppliers who sold goods on a local or regional basis however as transportation systems improved from the mid nineteenth century the economy became more unified allowing companies to distribute standardised branded goods a national level this gave rise to a much broader mass marketing mindset manufacturers tended to insist on strict standardisation in order to achieve scale economies with a view to keeping production costs down and also to achieving market penetration in the early stages of a products life cycle the model t ford was an example of a product being manufactured at a price that was affordable for the burgeoning middle classes havenmason hall at the university of michigan where the first academic course in marketing was taught in the early twentieth century as market size increased it became more commonplace for manufacturers to produce a variety of models pitched at different quality points designed to meet the needs of various demographic and lifestyle market segments giving rise to the widespread practice of market segmentation and product differentation between   george b waldron working at mahins advertising agency used tax registers city directories and census data to show advertisers the proportion of educated versus illiterate consumers and the earning capacity of different occupations in what is believed to be the first example of demographic segmentation of a population within little more than a decade paul cherington had developed the abcd household typology  the first sociodemographic segmentation tool when wendell r smith published his now classic article product differentiation and market segmentation as alternative marketing strategies in  he noted that he was simply documenting marketing practices that had been observed for some time and which he described as a natural force other theorists agree that smith was simply codifying implicit knowledge that had been used in marketing and brand management from the early twentieth century as industry grew the demand for skilled business professionals also grew to meet this demand universities began offering courses in commerce economics and marketing marketing as a discipline was first taught in universities in the very early twentieth century however researchers only became interested in investigating the history of marketing in the mid twentieth century from the outset researchers tended to identify two strands of historical research the history of marketing practice  and the history of marketing thought which was fundamentally concerned with the rise of marketing education and dissecting the way that marketing was taught and studied early historical studies were primarily descriptive history of marketing practiceedit the practice of marketing may have been carried out for millennia but the modern concept of marketing as a professional practice appears to have emerged the post industrial corporate world in addition to the studies of specific cultures or time periods discussed in the preceding section some historians of marketing have sought to write more general histories of marketings evolution in the modern era to do this historians often turn to a method known as periodisation periodisation refers to the process or study of categorizing the past into discrete quantified named units for the purpose of analysis or study a key question that has preoccupied researchers is whether specific orientations or mindsets that inform key periods of marketings evolution can be identified marketers disagree about the precise periods that outline marketing practice and describe the way that marketing practice has evolved over time orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practiceedit in the marketing literature continuing debate surrounds the orientations or philosophies that might have informed marketing practice at different periods of time an orientation may be defind as the type of activity or subject that an organization seems most interested in and gives most attention to  in relation to marketing orientations the term has been defined as a philosophy of business management  or a corporate state of mind  or as an organisational culture  hollander et al have identified fourteen different stage theories or short periodisations as well as a total of nineteen long periodisations that have been carried out since  of these the contributions of robert keith  and ronald fullerton  are the most frequently cited keiths periodisationedit robert keiths marketing eras production →selling →marketing were based entirely on his experience at the pillsbury company in  robert keith the then vice president of pillsbury set the stage for decades of controversy when he published an article entitled the marketing revolution in which he set out the way that the pillsbury company had shifted from a focus on production in the s through to a consumer focus in the s he traced three distinct eras in pillsburys evolution the production oriented era from  s  characterised by a focus on production processes the sales oriented era from the s to the s  characterised by investment in research to develop new products and advertising to persuade markets of product benefits the marketing oriented era from the beginning of the s  characterised by a focus on the customers latent and existing needs in addition keith hypothesised that a marketing control era was about to emerge although keiths article explicitly documented pillsburys evolution the article appears to suggest that the stages observed at pillsbury constitute a standard or normal evolutionary path production→sales→marketing for most large organisations keiths notion of distinct eras in the evolution of marketing practice has been widely criticised and his periodisation described as hopelessly flawed specific criticisms of keiths tripartite periodisation include that it ignores historical facts about business conditions  it misstates the nature of supply and demand  it slights the growth of marketing institutions  the article which is entirely based on keiths personal recollections and did not use a single reference is best described as anecdotal systematic studies carried out since keiths work have failed to replicate keiths periodisation instead other studies suggest that many companies exhibited a marketing orientation in the nineteenth century and that the business schools were teaching marketing decades before pillsbury adopted a marketing oriented approach jones and richardson also investigated historical accounts of marketing practice and found evidence for both the sales and marketing era during the socalled production era and concluded that there was no marketing revolution  a detailed study of the chocolate manufacturer rowntree found that this company had shifted from a production orientation through to a marketing orientation by the s without having transitioned through the socalled sales orientation other critiques of keiths work have pointed out that the socalled production era fails to align with historical facts and have suggested that it is a myth keiths eras have become known somewhat cynically as the standard chronology fullertons periodisationedit the english industrial revolution is often seen as a trigger for the rise of modern marketing in  fullerton developed a more subtle and nuanced periodisation for the socalled marketing eras fullertons eras were the era of antecedents    a long gestational period in which people were largely selfsufficient and rural economy characterised by low levels of consumption commerce was seen as suspicious the era of origins   precipitated by the dislocations of the english industrial revolution and the rise of a more urban population this era is characterised by more attention to persuasive tactics designed to stimulate demand the era of institutional development   many of the large institutions and modern marketing practices emerged during this period the era of refinement and formalisation –present   further development and refinement of principles and practices developed in the preceding period in spite of the intense criticism levelled at keiths eras of marketing practice his periodisation is the most frequently cited in textbooks  and has become the accepted wisdom one content analysis of  introductory and advanced texts found that keiths eras were reproduced in all but four another study which examined  of the top selling marketing texts found that the although the incidence of repeating keiths eras was waning it had not been replaced by fullertons periodisation nor any other more meaningful framework other periodisationsedit for all the controversies surrounding the socalled marketing stages or periods keith and others appear to have contributed a lasting legacy a study by grundey  suggests that many contemporary textbooks begin with keiths eras and expand on it by including newer concepts such as the societal marketing concept the relationship marketing concept and the interfunctional concept as shown in the table below more recently kotler and keller added the holistic marketing concept to the list of eras in marketing marketing theorists continue to debate whether the holistic era represents a genuine new orientation or whether it is an extension of the marketing concept grundey summarised five different periodisations in the history of marketing as shown in

commerce and tourism vol  no   p  brief description of the most commonly cited periodsedit the general lack of agreement amongst scholars as to what constitutes clearly identifiable periods and the orientation that characterised each distinct period has spawned a lengthy list of orientations space prevents an exhaustive description of all periods or eras however the most commonly cited periods appear in the following section production orientationedit the production orientation is one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers a production orientation is often proposed as the first of the socalled orientations that dominated business thought keith dated the production era from the s to the s but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries specifically kotler and armstrong note that the production philosophy is one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers and is still useful in some situations  the production orientation is characterised by a focus on production manufacturing and efficiency attainment of economies of scale economies of scope experience effects or all three an assumption that demand exceeds supply a mindset that is encapsulated by says law supply creates its own demand or if somebody makes a product somebody else will want to buy it limited research  and largely limited to technicalproduct research rather than customer research this orientation rose to prominence in an environment which had a shortage of manufactured goods relative to demand so goods sold easily minimal promotion and advertising marketing communications limited to raising awareness of the products existence selling orientationedit the sales orientation often characterised by doortodoor selling is thought to have begun during the great depression of the s and continues to this day pictured a rawleighs salesman in  the selling orientation is thought to have begun during the great depression and continued well into the s although examples of this orientation can still be found today kotler et al note that the selling concept is typically practised with unsought goods  the selling orientation is characterised by aggressive selling to push products often involving doortodoor selling accepting every possible sale or booking regardless of its suitability for the business has a strongly transactional focus ignores potential relationships the marketing orientationedit the marketing orientation or the marketing concept emerged in the s characteristics of the marketing orientation a thorough understanding of the customers needs wants and behaviours should be the focal point of all marketing decisions marketing efforts sales advertising product management pricing should be integrated and in tune with the customer new product concepts should flow from extensive market analysis and product testing the societal marketing conceptedit main article societal marketing societal marketing orientation or societal marketing concept was first proposed in the s  by phillip kotler in an article published in the harvard business review the societal marketing concept adopts the position that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior value instead marketing activities should strive to benefit societys overall wellbeing marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups including employees customers local communities the wider public and government they ensure that marketing activities do not damage the environment and are not hazardous to broader society societal marketing developed into sustainable marketing characteristics of societal marketing an attempt to balance corporate commitments to groups and individuals in its environment including customers other businesses employees and investors companies must include social and ethical considerations into their marketing practices consideration is given to the environment includes problems such as air water and land pollution consideration is given to consumer rights unfair pricing and ethics in advertising relationship orientationedit main article relationship marketing starting in the s a new stage of marketing emerged called relationship marketing the focus of relationship marketing is on a longterm relationship that benefits both the company and the customer the relationship is based on trust and commitment and both companies tend to shift their operating activities to be able to work more efficiently together one of the most prominent reasons for relationship marketing comes from kotlers idea that it costs about five times more to obtain a new customer than to maintain the relationship with an existing customer a relationship marketing approach seeks to maximise the value of all the potential exchanges an organisation could have into the future the characteristics of relationship marketing include a focus on the relationship between seller and buyer an investment in the lifetime of relationships customer lifetime value rather than single transactions an orientation on product benefits andor customer value high customer service high customer commitment high customer contact quality is the concern of all all activities are coordinated with the customer interface including the customers involvement in the firm’s processes customised offerings where practical empirical support for relationship marketing as a distinct paradigm is very weak one study suggests that relationship marketing is really a subcomponent of large scale movements of the valueadded process rather than a separate era or framework some theorists suggest that marketing is moving from a relationship marketing paradigm and towards a social media paradigm where marketers have access to a more controlled environment and are able to customise offers and communications messages history of marketing thoughtedit university of pennsylvania was among the first universities to offer courses in marketing dating the history of marketing thought is just as problematic as the history of markting practice marketing historians cannot agree on how to date the beginnings of marketing thought eric shaw for instance suggests that a period of preacademic marketing thought can be identified prior to  other historians on the other hand suggest that the theory of marketing only emerged in the th century when the discipline began to offer courses at universities nevertheless the birth of marketing as a discipline is usually designated to the first decade of the twentieth century when marketing courses appeared in universities in  the university of michigan offered what many believe to be the very first course in marketing in the academic year  the university of pennsylvania commenced teaching marketing other universities soon followed including the harvard business school prior to the emergence of marketing courses marketing was treated as a branch of economics and was often called applied economics early marketing theories were described as modifications or adaptations of economic theories a periodisation approachedit several scholars have attempted to describe the evolution of marketing thought chronologically and to connect it with broader intellectual and academic trends bartels  sketched an account of marketings formative periods and shah and gardner  briefly considered the development of the six dominant schools in contemporary marketing however these initial attempts have been described as descriptive savitt  one of the first theorists to consider the stages in the development of marketing thought was robert bartels who in the the history of marketing thought  used a periodisation approach he categorised the development of marketing theory decade by decade from the beginning of the th century s discovery of basic concepts and their exploration s conceptualisation classification and definition of terms s integration on the basis of principles s development of specialisation and variation in theory s reappraisal in the light of new demands and a more scientific approach s reconceptualisation in the light of managerialism social development and quantitative approaches s differentiation on bases such as managerialism holism environmentalism systems and internationalism s socialisation the adaptation of marketing to social change a schools of thought approachedit other marketing historians have eschewed the periodisation approach and instead considered whether distinct schools within marketing reflect different facets of common theory and whether a more unifying intellectual structure has emerged these approaches tend to identify distinct schools of thought a school of thought refers to an intellectual tradition or a group of scholars who share a common philosophy or set of ideas marketing historians shaw and jones define a school of thought as one that has a substantial body of knowledge developed by a number of scholars and describing at least one aspect of the what how who why when and where of performing marketing activities  of those who identify schools there is no real agreement about which schools were dominant at different stages in marketings development it should be noted that two or more schools of thought can coexist at the same time in the following section a brief overview of the contributions of key thinkers will be outlined with respect to the prevailing schools that have dominated marketing thought to a certain extent there is some agreement that in early marketing thought three socalled traditional schools namely the commodity school the functional school and the institutional school coexisted marketing historians such as eric shaw and barton a weitz point to the publication of wroe aldersons book marketing behavior and executive action  as a breakpoint in the history of marketing thought moving from the macro functionsinstitutionscommodities approach to a micromarketing management paradigm following on from alderson marketing began to incorporate other fields of knowledge besides economics notably behavioral science becoming a multidisciplinary field for some scholars aldersons book marks the beginning of the marketing management era hunt and goolsby identified four schools of thought that have dominated marketing namely the commodity school the institutional school the functional school and the managerial school the commodity school a focus on different types of goods in the marketplace and how they are marketed the institutional school emphasised the functions of middlemen or intermediaries similar to the functional school but with a focus on channel flows the functional school a focus on the characteristics of marketing identifying the functions and systems of marketing adopts a systems approach the managerial school a focus on the problems faced by marketing managers focuses on the perspective of the seller some marketing historians like jagdish sheth have identified the modern marketing schools as the managerial school emerged during the late s and became arguably the predominant and most influential school of thought in the field the consumerbuyer behavior school which dominated the academic field in the second half of the twentieth century apart from the managerial school features theories emerging from behavioral science the social exchange school which focuses on exchange as the fundamental concept of marketing yet other commentators identify a broader range of schools omalley and lichrou for example document the schools as functional what activities does marketing perform focus on intermediaries and value adding commodities how are goods classified focus on classification of goods trade flows marketing institutions who performs marketing functions on commodities focus on retailers wholesalers intermediaries distribution channels marketing management how should marketers and managers market products and services to consumers business firm as seller supplier marketing systems what is a marketing system and how does it work channels of distribution and aggregate systems consumer behaviour how and why do consumers buy organisational buyer and consumer buyer macromarketing how do marketing systems impact on society industries channels consumer movement environmentalism exchange what are the forms of exchange who are the parties to the exchange process aggregations of buyers and sellers marketing history when did marketing practice and ideas emerge and evolve marketing thought and marketing practice brief description of the dominant schools of thoughtedit the following sections briefly outlines the schools of thought as conceptualised by key thinkers in the discipline marketing managementedit the marketing management school which emerged as the dominant school in  following the publication of basic marketing a managerial approach written by e jerome mccarthy replaced the socalled functional school which had been the dominant for the first part of the twentieth century in the words of hunt and goolsby the publication of mccarthys text sounded the beginning of the end for the functional school  however hunt and goolsby note that the s was a transitional period in which both the functional school and the managerial school coexisted shaw and jones have described the emergence of the managerial school in the mid twentieth century as a paradigm shift  key works in the marketing management tradition include wroe aldersons marketing behavior and executive action

v t e the term marketing comes from the latin mercatus meaning a marketplace pictured la boqueria barcelona spain the moorish bazaar the study of the history of marketing as a discipline is meaningful because it helps to define the baselines upon which change can be recognized and understand how the discipline evolves in response to those changes the practice of marketing has been known for millennia but the term marketing used to describe commercial activities buying and selling a products or services came into popular use in the late nineteenth century the study of the history of marketing as an academic field emerged in the early twentieth century marketers tend to distinguish between the history of marketing practice and the history of marketing thought a the history of marketing practice refers to an investigation into the ways that marketing has been practiced and how those practices have evolved over time as they respond to changing socioeconomic conditions b the history of marketing thought refers to an examination of the ways that marketing has been studied and taught although the history of marketing thought and the history of marketing practice are distinct fields of study they intersect at different junctures marketing practitioners engage in innovative practices that capture the attention of marketing scholars who codify and disseminate such practices at the same time marketing academics often develop new research methods or theories that are subsequently adopted by practitioners thus developments in marketing theory inform marketing practice and vice versa the history of marketing will remain incomplete if one disassociates academia from practitioners the publication in  of robert keiths article the marketing revolution was a pioneering work in the study of the history of marketing practice and in  the publication of robert bartels book the history of marketing thought marked a turningpoint in the understanding of how

the distinctive shape of amphora served some of the functions of a label communicating information about region of origin the name of the producer and may have carried product quality claims according to etymologists the term marketing first appeared in dictionaries in the sixteenth century where it referred to the process of buying and selling at a market the contemporary definition of marketing as a process of moving goods from producer to consumer with an emphasis on sales and advertising first appeared in dictionaries in  the term marketing is a derivation of the latin word mercatus meaning market or merchant historians of marketing tend to fall into two distinct branches of marketing history  the history of marketing practice and the history of marketing thought these branches are often deeply divided these branches have very different roots the history of marketing practice is based in management and marketing studies while the history of marketing thought is based in economic and cultural history this means that they ask very different types of research questions and employ different research tools and frameworks historians of marketing have undertaken considerable investigation into the emergence of marketing yet there is little agreement about when marketing first began some researchers argue that marketing practices can be found in antiquity  while others suggest that marketing in its modern form emerged in conjunction with the rise of consumer culture in seventeenth and eighteenth century europe  while yet other researchers suggest that modern marketing was only fully realised in the decades following the industrial revolution in britain from where it subsequently spread to europe and north america hollander and others have suggested that the different dates for the emergence of marketing can be explained by problems surrounding the way that marketing has been defined  whether reference to modern marketing as a planned programmed repertoire of professional practice including activities such as segmentation product differentiation positioning and marketing communications versus marketing as a simple form distribution and exchange marketing in antiquityedit mosaic showing garum container from the house of umbricius scaurus of pompeii the inscription which reads gari flos scombri scauri ex officina scauri has been translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus from the shop of scaurus a number of studies have found evidence of advertising branding packaging and labelling in antiquity umbricius scauras for example was a manufacturer of fish sauce also known as garum in pompeii circa  ce mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house were decorated with images of amphora bearing his personal brand and quality claims the mosaic comprises four different amphora one at each corner of the atrium and bearing labels as follows  gari flos scom scauri ex officina scauri translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus from the shop of scaurus  liquminis flos translated as the flower of liquamen  gari flos scombri scauri translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus  liquamen optimum ex officina scauri translated as the best liquamen from the shop of scaurus the reputation of scauras fish sauce was known to be of very high quality across the mediterannean and its reputation travelled as far away as modern france curtis has described this mosaic as a an advertisement and a rare unequivocal example of a motif inspired by a patron rather than by the artist  in pompeii and nearby herculaneum archeaological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labelling in relatively common use wine jars for example were stamped with names such as lassius and l eumachius probably references to the name of the producer carbonized loaves of bread found at herculaneum indicate that some bakers stamped their bread with the producers name david wengrow has argued that branding became necessary following the urban revolution in ancient mesopotamia in the th century bce when largescale economies started massproducing commodities such as alcoholic drinks cosmetics and textiles these ancient societies imposed strict forms of quality control over commodities and also needed to convey value to the consumer through branding producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which over time were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images often associated with the producers personal identity thus giving the product a personality diana twede has argued that the consumer packaging functions of protection utility and communication have been necessary whenever packages were the object of transactions p  she has shown that amphoras used in mediterranean trade between  and  bce exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings which provided information for transactions systematic use of stamped labels dates from around the fourth century bce in a largely preliterate society the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings conveyed information about the contents region of origin and even the identity of the producer which were understood to convey information about product quality not all historians agree that these markings can be compared with modern brands or labels moore and reid for example have argued that the distinctive shapes and markings in ancient containers should be termed protobrands rather than modern brands marketing in the middle agesedit market scene by pieter aertsen c in england and europe during the middle ages market towns sprang up some analysts have suggested that the term marketing may have first been used in the context of market towns where producers used the term to describe the process of carting and selling their produce and wares in market towns blintiff has investigated the early medieval networks of market towns and suggests that by the th century there was an upsurge in the number of market towns and the emergence of merchant circuits as traders bulked up surpluses from smaller regional different day markets and resold them at the larger centralised market towns braudel and reynold have made a systematic study of these european market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week while daily markets were more common in the larger cities and towns over time permanent shops began to open daily and gradually supplanted the periodic markets peddlers filled in the gaps in distribution by travelling doortodoor selling produce and wares the physical market was characterised by transactional exchange and the economy was characterised by local trading braudel reports that in  goods travelled relatively short distances  grain – miles cattle – miles wool and wollen cloth – miles however following the european age of discovery goods were imported from afar  calico cloth from india porcelain silk and tea from china spices from india and southeast asia and tobacco sugar rum and coffee from the new world bronze plate for printing an advertisement for the liu family needle shop at jinan song dynasty china it is considered the worlds earliest identified printed advertising medium although the rise of consumer culture and marketing in britain and europe have been studied extensively less is known about developments elsewhere nevertheless recent research suggests that china exhibited a rich history of early marketing practices including branding packaging advertising and retail signage from as early as  bce chinese packaging and branding was used to signal family place names and product quality and the use of government imposed product branding was used between  and  ad eckhart and bengtsson have argued that during the song dynasty – chinese society developed a consumerist culture where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite p  the rise of a consumer culture led to the commercial investment in carefully managed company image retail signage symbolic brands trademark protection and the brand concepts of baoji hao lei gongpin piazi and pinpai which roughly equate with western concepts of family status quality grading and upholding traditional chinese values p  eckhardt and bengtssons analysis suggests that brands emerged in china as a result of the social needs and tensions implicit in consumer culture in which brands provide social status and stratification thus the evolution of brands in china stands in sharp contrast to the west where manufacturers pushed brands onto the market in order to differentiate increase market share and ultimately profits pp – marketing in seventeenth and eighteenth century europeedit josiah wedgewoods th century techniques exhibited many of the characteristics of modern marketing scholars have identified specific instances of marketing practices in england and europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as trade between countries or regions grew companies required information on which to base business decisions individuals and companies carried out formal and informal research on trade conditions in  johann fugger travelled from augsburg to graben in order to gather information on the international textile industry he exchanged detailed letters on trade conditions in relevant areas in the early s british industrial houses were demanding information that could be used for business decisions during this period daniel defoe a london merchant published information on trade and economic resources of england and scotland defoe was a prolific publisher and among his many publications are titles devoted to trade including trade of britain stated  trade of scotland with france  and the trade to india critically and calmly considered  all books that were highly popular with merchants and business houses of the period while such activities might now be recognised as marketing research at that time they were known as commercial research or commercial intelligence and not seen as part of the repertoire of activities that make up contemporary marketing practice in a major review of consumer society mckendrick brewer and plumb found extensive evidence of eighteenth century english entrepreneurs using modern marketing techniques including product differentiation sales promotion and loss leader pricing english industrialists josiah wedgewood and matthew boulton are often portrayed as pioneers of modern mass marketing methods wedgewood was known to have used marketing techniques such as direct mail travelling salesmen and catalogues in the eighteenth century wedgewood also carried out serious investigations into the fixed and variable costs of production and recognised that increased production would lead to lower unit costs he also inferred that selling at lower prices would lead to higher demand and recognised the value of achieving scale economies in production by cutting costs and lowering prices wedgewood was able to generate higher overall profits similarly one of wedgewoods contemporaries matthew boulton pioneered early mass production techniques and product differentiation at his soho manufactory in the s he also practiced planned obsolescence and understood the importance of celebrity marketing  that is supplying the nobility often at prices below cost and of obtaining royal patronage for the sake of the publicity and cudos generated evidence of early marketing practices has also been noted across europe a study of the german book trade found examples of both product differentiation and market segmentation in the s other works have documented the use of persuasive advertising practices in eighteenth century italy england and france as early as the s marketing in the nineteenth and twentieth centuriesedit henry ford began manufacturing the massproduced model t in  ford famously said that customers could own a car in any colour as long as it was black until the nineteenth century western economies were characterised by small regional suppliers who sold goods on a local or regional basis however as transportation systems improved from the mid nineteenth century the economy became more unified allowing companies to distribute standardised branded goods a national level this gave rise to a much broader mass marketing mindset manufacturers tended to insist on strict standardisation in order to achieve scale economies with a view to keeping production costs down and also to achieving market penetration in the early stages of a products life cycle the model t ford was an example of a product being manufactured at a price that was affordable for the burgeoning middle classes havenmason hall at the university of michigan where the first academic course in marketing was taught in the early twentieth century as market size increased it became more commonplace for manufacturers to produce a variety of models pitched at different quality points designed to meet the needs of various demographic and lifestyle market segments giving rise to the widespread practice of market segmentation and product differentation between   george b waldron working at mahins advertising agency used tax registers city directories and census data to show advertisers the proportion of educated versus illiterate consumers and the earning capacity of different occupations in what is believed to be the first example of demographic segmentation of a population within little more than a decade paul cherington had developed the abcd household typology  the first sociodemographic segmentation tool when wendell r smith published his now classic article product differentiation and market segmentation as alternative marketing strategies in  he noted that he was simply documenting marketing practices that had been observed for some time and which he described as a natural force other theorists agree that smith was simply codifying implicit knowledge that had been used in marketing and brand management from the early twentieth century as industry grew the demand for skilled business professionals also grew to meet this demand universities began offering courses in commerce economics and marketing marketing as a discipline was first taught in universities in the very early twentieth century however researchers only became interested in investigating the history of marketing in the mid twentieth century from the outset researchers tended to identify two strands of historical research the history of marketing practice  and the history of marketing thought which was fundamentally concerned with the rise of marketing education and dissecting the way that marketing was taught and studied early historical studies were primarily descriptive history of marketing practiceedit the practice of marketing may have been carried out for millennia but the modern concept of marketing as a professional practice appears to have emerged the post industrial corporate world in addition to the studies of specific cultures or time periods discussed in the preceding section some historians of marketing have sought to write more general histories of marketings evolution in the modern era to do this historians often turn to a method known as periodisation periodisation refers to the process or study of categorizing the past into discrete quantified named units for the purpose of analysis or study a key question that has preoccupied researchers is whether specific orientations or mindsets that inform key periods of marketings evolution can be identified marketers disagree about the precise periods that outline marketing practice and describe the way that marketing practice has evolved over time orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practiceedit in the marketing literature continuing debate surrounds the orientations or philosophies that might have informed marketing practice at different periods of time an orientation may be defind as the type of activity or subject that an organization seems most interested in and gives most attention to  in relation to marketing orientations the term has been defined as a philosophy of business management  or a corporate state of mind  or as an organisational culture  hollander et al have identified fourteen different stage theories or short periodisations as well as a total of nineteen long periodisations that have been carried out since  of these the contributions of robert keith  and ronald fullerton  are the most frequently cited keiths periodisationedit robert keiths marketing eras production →selling →marketing were based entirely on his experience at the pillsbury company in  robert keith the then vice president of pillsbury set the stage for decades of controversy when he published an article entitled the marketing revolution in which he set out the way that the pillsbury company had shifted from a focus on production in the s through to a consumer focus in the s he traced three distinct eras in pillsburys evolution the production oriented era from  s  characterised by a focus on production processes the sales oriented era from the s to the s  characterised by investment in research to develop new products and advertising to persuade markets of product benefits the marketing oriented era from the beginning of the s  characterised by a focus on the customers latent and existing needs in addition keith hypothesised that a marketing control era was about to emerge although keiths article explicitly documented pillsburys evolution the article appears to suggest that the stages observed at pillsbury constitute a standard or normal evolutionary path production→sales→marketing for most large organisations keiths notion of distinct eras in the evolution of marketing practice has been widely criticised and his periodisation described as hopelessly flawed specific criticisms of keiths tripartite periodisation include that it ignores historical facts about business conditions  it misstates the nature of supply and demand  it slights the growth of marketing institutions  the article which is entirely based on keiths personal recollections and did not use a single reference is best described as anecdotal systematic studies carried out since keiths work have failed to replicate keiths periodisation instead other studies suggest that many companies exhibited a marketing orientation in the nineteenth century and that the business schools were teaching marketing decades before pillsbury adopted a marketing oriented approach jones and richardson also investigated historical accounts of marketing practice and found evidence for both the sales and marketing era during the socalled production era and concluded that there was no marketing revolution  a detailed study of the chocolate manufacturer rowntree found that this company had shifted from a production orientation through to a marketing orientation by the s without having transitioned through the socalled sales orientation other critiques of keiths work have pointed out that the socalled production era fails to align with historical facts and have suggested that it is a myth keiths eras have become known somewhat cynically as the standard chronology fullertons periodisationedit the english industrial revolution is often seen as a trigger for the rise of modern marketing in  fullerton developed a more subtle and nuanced periodisation for the socalled marketing eras fullertons eras were the era of antecedents    a long gestational period in which people were largely selfsufficient and rural economy characterised by low levels of consumption commerce was seen as suspicious the era of origins   precipitated by the dislocations of the english industrial revolution and the rise of a more urban population this era is characterised by more attention to persuasive tactics designed to stimulate demand the era of institutional development   many of the large institutions and modern marketing practices emerged during this period the era of refinement and formalisation –present   further development and refinement of principles and practices developed in the preceding period in spite of the intense criticism levelled at keiths eras of marketing practice his periodisation is the most frequently cited in textbooks  and has become the accepted wisdom one content analysis of  introductory and advanced texts found that keiths eras were reproduced in all but four another study which examined  of the top selling marketing texts found that the although the incidence of repeating keiths eras was waning it had not been replaced by fullertons periodisation nor any other more meaningful framework other periodisationsedit for all the controversies surrounding the socalled marketing stages or periods keith and others appear to have contributed a lasting legacy a study by grundey  suggests that many contemporary textbooks begin with keiths eras and expand on it by including newer concepts such as the societal marketing concept the relationship marketing concept and the interfunctional concept as shown in the table below more recently kotler and keller added the holistic marketing concept to the list of eras in marketing marketing theorists continue to debate whether the holistic era represents a genuine new orientation or whether it is an extension of the marketing concept grundey summarised five different periodisations in the history of marketing as shown in the following table as a means of highlighting the general lack of agreement among scholars marketing philosophies or orientations cited in popular texts dibb  simkin   lancaster  reynolds   blythe

commerce and tourism vol  no   p  brief description of the most commonly cited periodsedit the general lack of agreement amongst scholars as to what constitutes clearly identifiable periods and the orientation that characterised each distinct period has spawned a lengthy list of orientations space prevents an exhaustive description of all periods or eras however the most commonly cited periods appear in the following section production orientationedit the production orientation is one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers a production orientation is often proposed as the first of the socalled orientations that dominated business thought keith dated the production era from the s to the s but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries specifically kotler and armstrong note that the production philosophy is one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers and is still useful in some situations  the production orientation is characterised by a focus on production manufacturing and efficiency attainment of economies of scale economies of scope experience effects or all three an assumption that demand exceeds supply a mindset that is encapsulated by says law supply creates its own demand or if somebody makes a product somebody else will want to buy it limited research  and largely limited to technicalproduct research rather than customer research this orientation rose to prominence in an environment which had a shortage of manufactured goods relative to demand so goods sold easily minimal promotion and advertising marketing communications limited to raising awareness of the products existence selling orientationedit the sales orientation often characterised by doortodoor selling is thought to have begun during the great depression of the s and continues to this day pictured a rawleighs salesman in  the selling orientation is thought to have begun during the great depression and continued well into the s although examples of this orientation can still be found today kotler et al note that the selling concept is typically practised with unsought goods  the selling orientation is characterised by aggressive selling to push products often involving doortodoor selling accepting every possible sale or booking regardless of its suitability for the business has a strongly transactional focus ignores potential relationships the marketing orientationedit the marketing orientation or the marketing concept emerged in the s characteristics of the marketing orientation a thorough understanding of the customers needs wants and behaviours should be the focal point of all marketing decisions marketing efforts sales advertising product management pricing should be integrated and in tune with the customer new product concepts should flow from extensive market analysis and product testing the societal marketing conceptedit main article societal marketing societal marketing orientation or societal marketing concept was first proposed in the s  by phillip kotler in an article published in the harvard business review the societal marketing concept adopts the position that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior value instead marketing activities should strive to benefit societys overall wellbeing marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups including employees customers local communities the wider public and government they ensure that marketing activities do not damage the environment and are not hazardous to broader society societal marketing developed into sustainable marketing characteristics of societal marketing an attempt to balance corporate commitments to groups and individuals in its environment including customers other businesses employees and investors companies must include social and ethical considerations into their marketing practices consideration is given to the environment includes problems such as air water and land pollution consideration is given to consumer rights unfair pricing and ethics in advertising relationship orientationedit main article relationship marketing starting in the s a new stage of marketing emerged called relationship marketing the focus of relationship marketing is on a longterm relationship that benefits both the company and the customer the relationship is based on trust and commitment and both companies tend to shift their operating activities to be able to work more efficiently together one of the most prominent reasons for relationship marketing comes from kotlers idea that it costs about five times more to obtain a new customer than to maintain the relationship with an existing customer a relationship marketing approach seeks to maximise the value of all the potential exchanges an organisation could have into the future the characteristics of relationship marketing include a focus on the relationship between seller and buyer an investment in the lifetime of relationships customer lifetime value rather than single transactions an orientation on product benefits andor customer value high customer service high customer commitment high customer contact quality is the concern of all all activities are coordinated with the customer interface including the customers involvement in the firm’s processes customised offerings where practical empirical support for relationship marketing as a distinct paradigm is very weak one study suggests that relationship marketing is really a subcomponent of large scale movements of the valueadded process rather than a separate era or framework some theorists suggest that marketing is moving from a relationship marketing paradigm and towards a social media paradigm where marketers have access to a more controlled environment and are able to customise offers and communications messages history of marketing thoughtedit university of pennsylvania was among the first universities to offer courses in marketing dating the history of marketing thought is just as problematic as the history of markting practice marketing historians cannot agree on how to date the beginnings of marketing thought eric shaw for instance suggests that a period of preacademic marketing thought can be identified prior to  other historians on the other hand suggest that the theory of marketing only emerged in the th century when the discipline began to offer courses at universities nevertheless the birth of marketing as a discipline is usually designated to the first decade of the twentieth century when marketing courses appeared in universities in  the university of michigan offered what many believe to be the very first course in marketing in the academic year  the university of pennsylvania commenced teaching marketing other universities soon followed including the harvard business school prior to the emergence of marketing courses marketing was treated as a branch of economics and was often called applied economics early marketing theories were described as modifications or adaptations of economic theories a periodisation approachedit several scholars have attempted to describe the evolution of marketing thought chronologically and to connect it with broader intellectual and academic trends bartels  sketched an account of marketings formative periods and shah and gardner  briefly considered the development of the six dominant schools in contemporary marketing however these initial attempts have been described as descriptive savitt  one of the first theorists to consider the stages in the development of marketing thought was robert bartels who in the the history of marketing thought  used a periodisation approach he categorised the development of marketing theory decade by decade from the beginning of the th century s discovery of basic concepts and their exploration s conceptualisation classification and definition of terms s integration on the basis of principles s development of specialisation and variation in theory s reappraisal in the light of new demands and a more scientific approach s reconceptualisation in the light of managerialism social development and quantitative approaches s differentiation on bases such as managerialism holism environmentalism systems and internationalism s socialisation the adaptation of marketing to social change a schools of thought approachedit other marketing historians have eschewed the periodisation approach and instead considered whether distinct schools within marketing reflect different facets of common theory and whether a more unifying intellectual structure has emerged these approaches tend to identify distinct schools of thought a school of thought refers to an intellectual tradition or a group of scholars who share a common philosophy or set of ideas marketing historians shaw and jones define a school of thought as one that has a substantial body of knowledge developed by a number of scholars and describing at least one aspect of the what how who why when and where of performing marketing activities  of those who identify schools there is no real agreement about which schools were dominant at different stages in marketings development it should be noted that two or more schools of thought can coexist at the same time in the following section a brief overview of the contributions of key thinkers will be outlined with respect to the prevailing schools that have dominated marketing thought to a certain extent there is some agreement that in early marketing thought three socalled traditional schools namely the commodity school the functional school and the institutional school coexisted marketing historians such as eric shaw and barton a weitz point to the publication of wroe aldersons book marketing behavior and executive action  as a breakpoint in the history of marketing thought moving from the macro functionsinstitutionscommodities approach to a micromarketing management paradigm following on from alderson marketing began to incorporate other fields of knowledge besides economics notably behavioral science becoming a multidisciplinary field for some scholars aldersons book marks the beginning of the marketing management era hunt and goolsby identified four schools of thought that have dominated marketing namely the commodity school the institutional school the functional school and the managerial school the commodity school a focus on different types of goods in the marketplace and how they are marketed the institutional school emphasised the functions of middlemen or intermediaries similar to the functional school but with a focus on channel flows the functional school a focus on the characteristics of marketing identifying the functions and systems of marketing adopts a systems approach the managerial school a focus on the problems faced by marketing managers focuses on the perspective of the seller some marketing historians like jagdish sheth have identified the modern marketing schools as the managerial school emerged during the late s and became arguably the predominant and most influential school of thought in the field the consumerbuyer behavior school which dominated the academic field in the second half of the twentieth century apart from the managerial school features theories emerging from behavioral science the social exchange school which focuses on exchange as the fundamental concept of marketing yet other commentators identify a broader range of schools omalley and lichrou for example document the schools as functional what activities does marketing perform focus on intermediaries and value adding commodities how are goods classified focus on classification of goods trade flows marketing institutions who performs marketing functions on commodities focus on retailers wholesalers intermediaries distribution channels marketing management how should marketers and managers market products and services

consumers buy organisational buyer and consumer buyer macromarketing how do marketing systems impact on society industries channels consumer movement environmentalism exchange what are the forms of exchange who are the parties to the exchange process aggregations of buyers and sellers marketing history when did marketing practice and ideas emerge and evolve marketing thought and marketing practice brief description of the dominant schools of thoughtedit the following sections briefly outlines the schools of thought as conceptualised by key thinkers in the discipline marketing managementedit the marketing management school which emerged as the dominant school in  following the publication of basic marketing a managerial approach written by e jerome mccarthy replaced the socalled functional school which had been the dominant for the first part of the twentieth century in the words of hunt and goolsby the publication of mccarthys text sounded the beginning of the end for the functional school  however hunt and goolsby note that the s was a transitional period in which both the functional school and the managerial school coexisted shaw and jones have described the emergence of the managerial school in the mid twentieth century as a paradigm shift  key works in the marketing management tradition include wroe aldersons marketing behavior and executive action

v t e the term marketing comes from the latin mercatus meaning a marketplace pictured la boqueria barcelona spain the moorish bazaar the study of the history of marketing as a discipline is meaningful because it helps to define the baselines upon which change can be recognized and understand how the discipline evolves in response to those changes the practice of marketing has been known for millennia but the term marketing used to describe commercial activities buying and selling a products or services came into popular use in the late nineteenth century the study of the history of marketing as an academic field emerged in the early twentieth century marketers tend to distinguish between the history of marketing practice and the history of marketing thought a the history of marketing practice refers to an investigation into the ways that marketing has been practiced and how those practices have evolved over time as they respond to changing socioeconomic conditions b the history of marketing thought refers to an examination of the ways that marketing has been studied and taught although the history of marketing thought and the history of marketing practice are distinct fields of study they intersect at different junctures marketing practitioners engage in innovative practices that capture the attention of marketing scholars who codify and disseminate such practices at the same time marketing academics often develop new research methods or theories that are subsequently adopted by practitioners thus developments in marketing theory inform marketing practice and vice versa the history of marketing will remain incomplete if one disassociates academia from practitioners the publication in  of robert keiths article the marketing revolution was a pioneering work in the study of the history of marketing practice and in  the publication of robert bartels book the history of marketing thought marked a turningpoint in the understanding of how marketing theory evolved since it first emerged as a separate discipline around the turn of last century contents  marketing history an overview  marketing in antiquity  marketing in the middle ages

the distinctive shape of amphora served some of the functions of a label communicating information about region of origin the name of the producer and may have carried product quality claims according to etymologists the term marketing first appeared in dictionaries in the sixteenth century where it referred to the process of buying and selling at a market the contemporary definition of marketing as a process of moving goods from producer to consumer with an emphasis on sales and advertising first appeared in dictionaries in  the term marketing is a derivation of the latin word mercatus meaning market or merchant historians of marketing tend to fall into two distinct branches of marketing history  the history of marketing practice and the history of marketing thought these branches are often deeply divided these branches have very different roots the history of marketing practice is based in management and marketing studies while the history of marketing thought is based in economic and cultural history this means that they ask very different types of research questions and employ different research tools and frameworks historians of marketing have undertaken considerable investigation into the emergence of marketing yet there is little agreement about when marketing first began some researchers argue that marketing practices can be found in antiquity  while others suggest that marketing in its modern form emerged in conjunction with the rise of consumer culture in seventeenth and eighteenth century europe  while yet other researchers suggest that modern marketing was only fully realised in the decades following the industrial revolution in britain from where it subsequently spread to europe and north america hollander and others have suggested that the different dates for the emergence of marketing can be explained by problems surrounding the way that marketing has been defined  whether reference to modern marketing as a planned programmed repertoire of professional practice including activities such as segmentation product differentiation positioning and marketing communications versus marketing as a simple form distribution and exchange marketing in antiquityedit mosaic showing garum container from the house of umbricius scaurus of pompeii the inscription which reads gari flos scombri scauri ex officina scauri has been translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus from the shop of scaurus a number of studies have found evidence of advertising branding packaging and labelling in antiquity umbricius scauras for example was a manufacturer of fish sauce also known as garum in pompeii circa  ce mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house were decorated with images of amphora bearing his personal brand and quality claims the mosaic comprises four different amphora one at each corner of the atrium and bearing labels as follows  gari flos scom scauri ex officina scauri translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus from the shop of scaurus  liquminis flos translated as the flower of liquamen  gari flos scombri scauri translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus  liquamen optimum ex officina scauri translated as the best liquamen from the shop of scaurus the reputation of scauras fish sauce was known to be of very high quality across the mediterannean and its reputation travelled as far away as modern france curtis has described this mosaic as a an advertisement and a rare unequivocal example of a motif inspired by a patron rather than by the artist  in pompeii and nearby herculaneum archeaological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labelling in relatively common use wine jars for example were stamped with names such as lassius and l eumachius probably references to the name of the producer carbonized loaves of bread found at herculaneum indicate that some bakers stamped their bread with the producers name david wengrow has argued that branding became necessary following the urban revolution in ancient mesopotamia in the th century bce when largescale economies started massproducing commodities such as alcoholic drinks cosmetics and textiles these ancient societies imposed strict forms of quality control over commodities and also needed to convey value to the consumer through branding producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which over time were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images often associated with the producers personal identity thus giving the product a personality diana twede has argued that the consumer packaging functions of protection utility and communication have been necessary whenever packages were the object of transactions p  she has shown that amphoras used in mediterranean trade between  and  bce exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings which provided information for transactions systematic use of stamped labels dates from around the fourth century bce in a largely preliterate society the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings conveyed information about the contents region of origin and even the identity of the producer which were understood to convey information about product quality not all historians agree that these markings can be compared with modern brands or labels moore and reid for example have argued that the distinctive shapes and markings in ancient containers should be termed protobrands rather than modern brands marketing in the middle agesedit market scene by pieter aertsen c in england and europe during the middle ages market towns sprang up some analysts have suggested that the term marketing may have first been used in the context of market towns where producers used the term to describe the process of carting and selling their produce and wares in market towns blintiff has investigated the early medieval networks of market towns and suggests that by the th century there was an upsurge in the number of market towns and the emergence of merchant circuits as traders bulked up surpluses from smaller regional different day markets and resold them at the larger centralised market towns braudel and reynold have made a systematic study of these european market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week while daily markets were more common in the larger cities and towns over time permanent shops began to open daily and gradually supplanted the periodic markets peddlers filled in the gaps in distribution by travelling doortodoor selling produce and wares the physical market was characterised by transactional exchange and the economy was characterised by local trading braudel reports that in  goods travelled relatively short distances  grain – miles cattle – miles wool and wollen cloth – miles however following the european age of discovery goods were imported from afar  calico cloth from india porcelain silk and tea from china spices from india and southeast asia and tobacco sugar rum and coffee from the new world bronze plate for printing an advertisement for the liu family needle shop at jinan song dynasty china it is considered the worlds earliest identified printed advertising medium although the rise of consumer culture and marketing in britain and europe have been studied extensively less is known about developments elsewhere nevertheless recent research suggests that china exhibited a rich history of early marketing practices including branding packaging advertising and retail signage from as early as  bce chinese packaging and branding was used to signal family place names and product quality and the use of government imposed product branding was used between  and  ad eckhart and bengtsson have argued that during the song dynasty – chinese society developed a consumerist culture where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite p  the rise of a consumer culture led to the commercial investment in carefully managed company image retail signage symbolic brands trademark protection and the brand concepts of baoji hao lei gongpin piazi and pinpai which roughly equate with western concepts of family status quality grading and upholding traditional chinese values p  eckhardt and bengtssons analysis suggests that brands emerged in china as a result of the social needs and tensions implicit in consumer culture in which brands provide social status and stratification thus the evolution of brands in china stands in sharp contrast to the west where manufacturers pushed brands onto the market in order to differentiate increase market share and ultimately profits pp – marketing in seventeenth and eighteenth century europeedit josiah wedgewoods th century techniques exhibited many of the characteristics of modern marketing scholars have identified specific instances of marketing practices in england and europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as trade between countries or regions grew companies required information on which to base business decisions individuals and companies carried out formal and informal research on trade conditions in  johann fugger travelled from augsburg to graben in order to gather information on the international textile industry he exchanged detailed letters on trade conditions in relevant areas in the early s british industrial houses were demanding information that could be used for business decisions during this period daniel defoe a london merchant published information on trade and economic resources of england and scotland defoe was a prolific publisher and among his many publications are titles devoted to trade including trade of britain stated  trade of scotland with france  and the trade to india critically and calmly considered  all books that were highly popular with merchants and business houses of the period while such activities might now be recognised as marketing research at that time they were known as commercial research or commercial intelligence and not seen as part of the repertoire of activities that make up contemporary marketing practice in a major review of consumer society mckendrick brewer and plumb found extensive evidence of eighteenth century english entrepreneurs using modern marketing techniques including product differentiation sales promotion and loss leader pricing english industrialists josiah wedgewood and matthew boulton are often portrayed as pioneers of modern mass marketing methods wedgewood was known to have used marketing techniques such as direct mail travelling salesmen and catalogues in the eighteenth century wedgewood also carried out serious investigations into the fixed and variable costs of production and recognised that increased production would lead to lower unit costs he also inferred that selling at lower prices would lead to higher demand and recognised the value of achieving scale economies in production by cutting costs and lowering prices wedgewood was able to generate higher overall profits similarly one of wedgewoods contemporaries matthew boulton pioneered early mass production techniques and product differentiation at his soho manufactory in the s he also practiced planned obsolescence and understood the importance of celebrity marketing  that is supplying the nobility often at prices below cost and of obtaining royal patronage for the sake of the publicity and cudos generated evidence of early marketing practices has also been noted across europe a study of the german book trade found examples of both product differentiation and market segmentation in the s other works have documented the use of persuasive advertising practices in eighteenth century italy england and france as early as the s marketing in the nineteenth and twentieth centuriesedit henry ford began manufacturing the massproduced model t in  ford famously said that customers could own a car in any colour as long as it was black until the nineteenth century western economies were characterised by small regional suppliers who sold goods on a local or regional basis however as transportation systems improved from the mid nineteenth century the economy became more unified allowing companies to distribute standardised branded goods a national level this gave rise to a much broader mass marketing mindset manufacturers tended to insist on strict standardisation in order to achieve scale economies with a view to keeping production costs down and also to achieving market penetration in the early stages of a products life cycle the model t ford was an example of a product being manufactured at a price that was affordable for the burgeoning middle classes havenmason hall at the university of michigan where the first academic course in marketing was taught in the early twentieth century as market size increased it became more commonplace for manufacturers to produce a variety of models pitched at different quality points designed to meet the needs of various demographic and lifestyle market segments giving rise to the widespread practice of market segmentation and product differentation between   george b waldron working at mahins advertising agency used tax registers city directories and census data to show advertisers the proportion of educated versus illiterate consumers and the earning capacity of different occupations in what is believed to be the first example of demographic segmentation of a population within little more than a decade paul cherington had developed the abcd household typology  the first sociodemographic segmentation tool when wendell r smith published his now classic article product differentiation and market segmentation as alternative marketing strategies in  he noted that he was simply documenting marketing practices that had been observed for some time and which he described as a natural force other theorists agree that smith was simply codifying implicit knowledge that had been used in marketing and brand management from the early twentieth century as industry grew the demand for skilled business professionals also grew to meet this demand universities began offering courses in commerce economics and marketing marketing as a discipline was first taught in universities in the very early twentieth century however researchers only became interested in investigating the history of marketing in the mid twentieth century from the outset researchers tended to identify two strands of historical research the history of marketing practice  and the history of marketing thought which was fundamentally concerned with the rise of marketing education and dissecting the way that marketing was taught and studied early historical studies were primarily descriptive history of marketing practiceedit the practice of marketing may have been carried out for millennia but the modern concept of marketing as a professional practice appears to have emerged the post industrial corporate world in addition to the studies of specific cultures or time periods discussed in the preceding section some historians of marketing have sought to write more general histories of marketings evolution in the modern era to do this historians often turn to a method known as periodisation periodisation refers to the process or study of categorizing the past into discrete quantified named units for the purpose of analysis or study a key question that has preoccupied researchers is whether specific orientations or mindsets that inform key periods of marketings evolution can be identified marketers disagree about the precise periods that outline marketing practice and describe the way that marketing practice has evolved over time orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practiceedit in the marketing literature continuing debate surrounds the orientations or philosophies that might have informed marketing practice at different periods of time an orientation may be defind as the type of activity or subject that an organization seems most interested in and gives most attention to  in relation to marketing orientations the term has been defined as a philosophy of business management  or a corporate state of mind  or as an organisational culture  hollander et al have identified fourteen different stage theories or short periodisations as well as a total of nineteen long periodisations that have been carried out since  of these the contributions of robert keith  and ronald fullerton  are the most frequently cited keiths periodisationedit robert keiths marketing eras production →selling →marketing were based entirely on his experience at the pillsbury company in  robert keith the then vice president of pillsbury set the stage for decades of controversy when he published an article entitled the marketing revolution in which he set out the way that the pillsbury company had shifted from a focus on production in the s through to a consumer focus in the s he traced three distinct eras in pillsburys evolution the production oriented era from  s  characterised by a focus on production processes the sales oriented era from the s to the s  characterised by investment in research to develop new products and advertising to persuade markets of product benefits the marketing oriented era from the beginning of the s  characterised by a focus on the customers latent and existing needs in addition keith hypothesised that a marketing control era was about to emerge although keiths article explicitly documented pillsburys evolution the article appears to suggest that the stages observed at pillsbury constitute a standard or normal evolutionary path production→sales→marketing for most large organisations keiths notion of distinct eras in the evolution of marketing practice has been widely criticised and his periodisation described as hopelessly flawed specific criticisms of keiths tripartite periodisation include that it ignores historical facts about business conditions  it misstates the nature of supply and demand  it slights the growth of marketing institutions  the article which is entirely based on keiths personal recollections and did not use a single reference is best described as anecdotal systematic studies carried out since keiths work have failed to replicate keiths periodisation instead other studies suggest that many companies exhibited a marketing orientation in the nineteenth century and that the business schools were teaching marketing decades before pillsbury adopted a marketing oriented approach jones and richardson also investigated historical accounts of marketing practice and found evidence for both the sales and marketing era during the socalled production era and concluded that there was no marketing revolution  a detailed study of the chocolate manufacturer rowntree found that this company had shifted from a production orientation through to a marketing orientation by the s without having transitioned through the socalled sales orientation other critiques of keiths work have pointed out that the socalled production era fails to align with historical facts and have suggested that it is a myth keiths eras have become known somewhat cynically as the standard chronology fullertons periodisationedit the english industrial revolution is often seen as a trigger for the rise of modern marketing in  fullerton developed a more subtle and nuanced periodisation for the socalled marketing eras fullertons eras were the era of antecedents    a long gestational period in which people were largely selfsufficient and rural economy characterised by low levels of consumption commerce was seen as suspicious the era of origins   precipitated by the dislocations of the english industrial revolution and the rise of a more urban population this era is characterised by more attention to persuasive tactics designed to stimulate demand the era of institutional development   many of the large institutions and modern marketing practices emerged during this period the era of refinement and formalisation –present   further development and refinement of principles and practices developed in the preceding period in spite of the intense criticism levelled at keiths eras of marketing practice his periodisation is the most frequently cited in textbooks  and has become the accepted wisdom one content analysis of  introductory and advanced texts found that keiths eras were reproduced in all but four another study which examined  of the top selling marketing texts found that the although the incidence of repeating keiths eras was waning it had not been replaced by fullertons periodisation nor any other more meaningful framework other periodisationsedit for all the controversies surrounding the socalled marketing stages or periods keith and others appear to have contributed a lasting legacy a study by grundey  suggests that many contemporary textbooks begin with keiths eras and expand on it by including newer concepts such as the societal marketing concept the relationship marketing concept and the interfunctional concept as shown in the table below more recently kotler and keller added the holistic marketing concept to the list of eras in marketing marketing theorists continue to debate whether the holistic era represents a genuine new orientation or whether it is an extension of the marketing concept grundey summarised five different periodisations in the history of marketing as shown in

commerce and tourism vol  no   p  brief description of the most commonly cited periodsedit the general lack of agreement amongst scholars as to what constitutes clearly identifiable periods and the orientation that characterised each distinct period has spawned a lengthy list of orientations space prevents an exhaustive description of all periods or eras however the most commonly cited periods appear in the following section production orientationedit the production orientation is one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers a production orientation is often proposed as the first of the socalled orientations that dominated business thought keith dated the production era from the s to the s but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries specifically kotler and armstrong note that the production philosophy is one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers and is still useful in some situations  the production orientation is characterised by a focus on production manufacturing and efficiency attainment of economies of scale economies of scope experience effects or all three an assumption that demand exceeds supply a mindset that is encapsulated by says law supply creates its own demand or if somebody makes a product somebody else will want to buy it limited research  and largely limited to technicalproduct research rather than customer research this orientation rose to prominence in an environment which had a shortage of manufactured goods relative to demand so goods sold easily minimal promotion and advertising marketing communications limited to raising awareness of the products existence selling orientationedit the sales orientation often characterised by doortodoor selling is thought to have begun during the great depression of the s and continues to this day pictured a rawleighs salesman in  the selling orientation is thought to have begun during the great depression and continued well into the s although examples of this orientation can still be found today kotler et al note that the selling concept is typically practised with unsought goods  the selling orientation is characterised by aggressive selling to push products often involving doortodoor selling accepting every possible sale or booking regardless of its suitability for the business has a strongly transactional focus ignores potential relationships the marketing orientationedit the marketing orientation or the marketing concept emerged in the s characteristics of the marketing orientation a thorough understanding of the customers needs wants and behaviours should be the focal point of all marketing decisions marketing efforts sales advertising product management pricing should be integrated and in tune with the customer new product concepts should flow from extensive market analysis and product testing the societal marketing conceptedit main article societal marketing societal marketing orientation or societal marketing concept was first proposed in the s  by phillip kotler in an article published in the harvard business review the societal marketing concept adopts the position that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior value instead marketing activities should strive to benefit societys overall wellbeing marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups including employees customers local communities the wider public and government they ensure that marketing activities do not damage the environment and are not hazardous to broader society societal marketing developed into sustainable marketing characteristics of societal marketing an attempt to balance corporate commitments to groups and individuals in its environment including customers other businesses employees and investors companies must include social and ethical considerations into their marketing practices consideration is given to the environment includes problems such as air water and land pollution consideration is given to consumer rights unfair pricing and ethics in advertising relationship orientationedit main article relationship marketing starting in the s a new stage of marketing emerged called relationship marketing the focus of relationship marketing is on a longterm relationship that benefits both the company and the customer the relationship is based on trust and commitment and both companies tend to shift their operating activities to be able to work more efficiently together one of the most prominent reasons for relationship marketing comes from kotlers idea that it costs about five times more to obtain a new customer than to maintain the relationship with an existing customer a relationship marketing approach seeks to maximise the value of all the potential exchanges an organisation could have into the future the characteristics of relationship marketing include a focus on the relationship between seller and buyer an investment in the lifetime of relationships customer lifetime value rather than single transactions an orientation on product benefits andor customer value high customer service high customer commitment high customer contact quality is the concern of all all activities are coordinated with the customer interface including the customers involvement in the firm’s processes customised offerings where practical empirical support for relationship marketing as a distinct paradigm is very weak one study suggests that relationship marketing is really a subcomponent of large scale movements of the valueadded process rather than a separate era or framework some theorists suggest that marketing is moving from a relationship marketing paradigm and towards a social media paradigm where marketers have access to a more controlled environment and are able to customise offers and communications messages history of marketing thoughtedit university of pennsylvania was among the first universities to offer courses in marketing dating the history of marketing thought is just as problematic as the history of markting practice marketing historians cannot agree on how to date the beginnings of marketing thought eric shaw for instance suggests that a period of preacademic marketing thought can be identified prior to  other historians on the other hand suggest that the theory of marketing only emerged in the th century when the discipline began to offer courses at universities nevertheless the birth of marketing as a discipline is usually designated to the first decade of the twentieth century when marketing courses appeared in universities in  the university of michigan offered what many believe to be the very first course in marketing in the academic year  the university of pennsylvania commenced teaching marketing other universities soon followed including the harvard business school prior to the emergence of marketing courses marketing was treated as a branch of economics and was often called applied economics early marketing theories were described as modifications or adaptations of economic theories a periodisation approachedit several scholars have attempted to describe the evolution of marketing thought chronologically and to connect it with broader intellectual and academic trends bartels  sketched an account of marketings formative periods and shah and gardner  briefly considered the development of the six dominant schools in contemporary marketing however these initial attempts have been described as descriptive savitt  one of the first theorists to consider the stages in the development of marketing thought was robert bartels who in the the history of marketing thought  used a periodisation approach he categorised the development of marketing theory decade by decade from the beginning of the th century s discovery of basic concepts and their exploration s conceptualisation classification and definition of terms s integration on the basis of principles s development of specialisation and variation in theory s reappraisal in the light of new demands and a more scientific approach s reconceptualisation in the light of managerialism social development and quantitative approaches s differentiation on bases such as managerialism holism environmentalism systems and internationalism s socialisation the adaptation of marketing to social change a schools of thought approachedit other marketing historians have eschewed the periodisation approach and instead considered whether distinct schools within marketing reflect different facets of common theory and whether a more unifying intellectual structure has emerged these approaches tend to identify distinct schools of thought a school of thought refers to an intellectual tradition or a group of scholars who share a common philosophy or set of ideas marketing historians shaw and jones define a school of thought as one that has a substantial body of knowledge developed by a number of scholars and describing at least one aspect of the what how who why when and where of performing marketing activities  of those who identify schools there is no real agreement about which schools were dominant at different stages in marketings development it should be noted that two or more schools of thought can coexist at the same time in the following section a brief overview of the contributions of key thinkers will be outlined with respect to the prevailing schools that have dominated marketing thought to a certain extent there is some agreement that in early marketing thought three socalled traditional schools namely the commodity school the functional school and the institutional school coexisted marketing historians such as eric shaw and barton a weitz point to the publication of wroe aldersons book marketing behavior and executive action  as a breakpoint in the history of marketing thought moving from the macro functionsinstitutionscommodities approach to a micromarketing management paradigm following on from alderson marketing began to incorporate other fields of knowledge besides economics notably behavioral science becoming a multidisciplinary field for some scholars aldersons book marks the beginning of the marketing management era hunt and goolsby identified four schools of thought that have dominated marketing namely the commodity school the institutional school the functional school and the managerial school the commodity school a focus on different types of goods in the marketplace and how they are marketed the institutional school emphasised the functions of middlemen or intermediaries similar to the functional school but with a focus on channel flows the functional school a focus on the characteristics of marketing identifying the functions and systems of marketing adopts a systems approach the managerial school a focus on the problems faced by marketing managers focuses on the perspective of the seller some marketing historians like jagdish sheth have identified the modern marketing schools as the managerial school emerged during the late s and became arguably the predominant and most influential school of thought in the field the consumerbuyer behavior school which dominated the academic field in the second half of the twentieth century apart from the managerial school features theories emerging from behavioral science the social exchange school which focuses on exchange as the fundamental concept of marketing yet other commentators identify a broader range of schools omalley and lichrou for example document the schools as functional what activities does marketing perform focus on intermediaries and value adding commodities how are goods classified focus on classification of goods trade flows marketing institutions who performs marketing functions on commodities focus on retailers wholesalers intermediaries distribution channels marketing management how should marketers and managers market products and services to consumers business firm as seller supplier marketing systems what is a marketing system and how does it work channels of distribution and aggregate systems consumer behaviour how and why do consumers buy organisational buyer and consumer buyer macromarketing how do marketing systems impact on society industries channels consumer movement environmentalism exchange what are the forms of exchange who are the parties to the exchange process aggregations of buyers and sellers marketing history when did marketing practice and ideas emerge and evolve marketing thought and marketing practice brief description of the dominant schools of thoughtedit the following sections briefly outlines the schools of thought as conceptualised by key thinkers in the discipline marketing managementedit the marketing management school which emerged as the dominant school in  following the publication of basic marketing a managerial approach written by e jerome mccarthy replaced the socalled functional school which had been the dominant for the first part of the twentieth century in the words of hunt and goolsby the publication of mccarthys text sounded the beginning of the end for the functional school  however hunt and goolsby note that the s was a transitional period in which both the functional school and the managerial school coexisted shaw and jones have described the emergence of the managerial school in the mid twentieth century as a paradigm shift  key works in the marketing management tradition include wroe aldersons marketing behavior and executive action

v t e the term marketing comes from the latin mercatus meaning a marketplace pictured la boqueria barcelona spain the moorish bazaar the study of the history of marketing as a discipline is meaningful because it helps to define the baselines upon which change can be recognized and understand how the discipline evolves in response to those changes the practice of marketing has been known for millennia but the term marketing used to describe commercial activities buying and selling a products or services came into popular use in the late nineteenth century the study of the history of marketing as an academic field emerged in the early twentieth century marketers tend to distinguish between the history of marketing practice and the history of marketing thought a the history of marketing practice refers to an investigation into the ways that marketing has been practiced and how those practices have evolved over time as they respond to changing socioeconomic conditions b the history of marketing thought refers to an examination of the ways that marketing has been studied and taught although the history of marketing thought and the history of marketing practice are distinct fields of study they intersect at different junctures marketing practitioners engage in innovative practices that capture the attention of marketing scholars who codify and disseminate such practices at the same time marketing academics often develop new research methods or theories that are subsequently adopted by practitioners thus developments in marketing theory inform marketing practice and vice versa the history of marketing will remain incomplete if one disassociates academia from practitioners the publication in  of robert keiths article the marketing revolution was a pioneering work in the study of the history of marketing practice and in  the publication of robert bartels book the history of marketing thought marked a turningpoint in the understanding of how

the distinctive shape of amphora served some of the functions of a label communicating information about region of origin the name of the producer and may have carried product quality claims according to etymologists the term marketing first appeared in dictionaries in the sixteenth century where it referred to the process of buying and selling at a market the contemporary definition of marketing as a process of moving goods from producer to consumer with an emphasis on sales and advertising first appeared in dictionaries in  the term marketing is a derivation of the latin word mercatus meaning market or merchant historians of marketing tend to fall into two distinct branches of marketing history  the history of marketing practice and the history of marketing thought these branches are often deeply divided these branches have very different roots the history of marketing practice is based in management and marketing studies while the history of marketing thought is based in economic and cultural history this means that they ask very different types of research questions and employ different research tools and frameworks historians of marketing have undertaken considerable investigation into the emergence of marketing yet there is little agreement about when marketing first began some researchers argue that marketing practices can be found in antiquity  while others suggest that marketing in its modern form emerged in conjunction with the rise of consumer culture in seventeenth and eighteenth century europe  while yet other researchers suggest that modern marketing was only fully realised in the decades following the industrial revolution in britain from where it subsequently spread to europe and north america hollander and others have suggested that the different dates for the emergence of marketing can be explained by problems surrounding the way that marketing has been defined  whether reference to modern marketing as a planned programmed repertoire of professional practice including activities such as segmentation product differentiation positioning and marketing communications versus marketing as a simple form distribution and exchange marketing in antiquityedit mosaic showing garum container from the house of umbricius scaurus of pompeii the inscription which reads gari flos scombri scauri ex officina scauri has been translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus from the shop of scaurus a number of studies have found evidence of advertising branding packaging and labelling in antiquity umbricius scauras for example was a manufacturer of fish sauce also known as garum in pompeii circa  ce mosaic patterns in the atrium of his house were decorated with images of amphora bearing his personal brand and quality claims the mosaic comprises four different amphora one at each corner of the atrium and bearing labels as follows  gari flos scom scauri ex officina scauri translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus from the shop of scaurus  liquminis flos translated as the flower of liquamen  gari flos scombri scauri translated as the flower of garum made of the mackerel a product of scaurus  liquamen optimum ex officina scauri translated as the best liquamen from the shop of scaurus the reputation of scauras fish sauce was known to be of very high quality across the mediterannean and its reputation travelled as far away as modern france curtis has described this mosaic as a an advertisement and a rare unequivocal example of a motif inspired by a patron rather than by the artist  in pompeii and nearby herculaneum archeaological evidence also points to evidence of branding and labelling in relatively common use wine jars for example were stamped with names such as lassius and l eumachius probably references to the name of the producer carbonized loaves of bread found at herculaneum indicate that some bakers stamped their bread with the producers name david wengrow has argued that branding became necessary following the urban revolution in ancient mesopotamia in the th century bce when largescale economies started massproducing commodities such as alcoholic drinks cosmetics and textiles these ancient societies imposed strict forms of quality control over commodities and also needed to convey value to the consumer through branding producers began by attaching simple stone seals to products which over time were transformed into clay seals bearing impressed images often associated with the producers personal identity thus giving the product a personality diana twede has argued that the consumer packaging functions of protection utility and communication have been necessary whenever packages were the object of transactions p  she has shown that amphoras used in mediterranean trade between  and  bce exhibited a wide variety of shapes and markings which provided information for transactions systematic use of stamped labels dates from around the fourth century bce in a largely preliterate society the shape of the amphora and its pictorial markings conveyed information about the contents region of origin and even the identity of the producer which were understood to convey information about product quality not all historians agree that these markings can be compared with modern brands or labels moore and reid for example have argued that the distinctive shapes and markings in ancient containers should be termed protobrands rather than modern brands marketing in the middle agesedit market scene by pieter aertsen c in england and europe during the middle ages market towns sprang up some analysts have suggested that the term marketing may have first been used in the context of market towns where producers used the term to describe the process of carting and selling their produce and wares in market towns blintiff has investigated the early medieval networks of market towns and suggests that by the th century there was an upsurge in the number of market towns and the emergence of merchant circuits as traders bulked up surpluses from smaller regional different day markets and resold them at the larger centralised market towns braudel and reynold have made a systematic study of these european market towns between the thirteenth and fifteenth century their investigation shows that in regional districts markets were held once or twice a week while daily markets were more common in the larger cities and towns over time permanent shops began to open daily and gradually supplanted the periodic markets peddlers filled in the gaps in distribution by travelling doortodoor selling produce and wares the physical market was characterised by transactional exchange and the economy was characterised by local trading braudel reports that in  goods travelled relatively short distances  grain – miles cattle – miles wool and wollen cloth – miles however following the european age of discovery goods were imported from afar  calico cloth from india porcelain silk and tea from china spices from india and southeast asia and tobacco sugar rum and coffee from the new world bronze plate for printing an advertisement for the liu family needle shop at jinan song dynasty china it is considered the worlds earliest identified printed advertising medium although the rise of consumer culture and marketing in britain and europe have been studied extensively less is known about developments elsewhere nevertheless recent research suggests that china exhibited a rich history of early marketing practices including branding packaging advertising and retail signage from as early as  bce chinese packaging and branding was used to signal family place names and product quality and the use of government imposed product branding was used between  and  ad eckhart and bengtsson have argued that during the song dynasty – chinese society developed a consumerist culture where a high level of consumption was attainable for a wide variety of ordinary consumers rather than just the elite p  the rise of a consumer culture led to the commercial investment in carefully managed company image retail signage symbolic brands trademark protection and the brand concepts of baoji hao lei gongpin piazi and pinpai which roughly equate with western concepts of family status quality grading and upholding traditional chinese values p  eckhardt and bengtssons analysis suggests that brands emerged in china as a result of the social needs and tensions implicit in consumer culture in which brands provide social status and stratification thus the evolution of brands in china stands in sharp contrast to the west where manufacturers pushed brands onto the market in order to differentiate increase market share and ultimately profits pp – marketing in seventeenth and eighteenth century europeedit josiah wedgewoods th century techniques exhibited many of the characteristics of modern marketing scholars have identified specific instances of marketing practices in england and europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries as trade between countries or regions grew companies required information on which to base business decisions individuals and companies carried out formal and informal research on trade conditions in  johann fugger travelled from augsburg to graben in order to gather information on the international textile industry he exchanged detailed letters on trade conditions in relevant areas in the early s british industrial houses were demanding information that could be used for business decisions during this period daniel defoe a london merchant published information on trade and economic resources of england and scotland defoe was a prolific publisher and among his many publications are titles devoted to trade including trade of britain stated  trade of scotland with france  and the trade to india critically and calmly considered  all books that were highly popular with merchants and business houses of the period while such activities might now be recognised as marketing research at that time they were known as commercial research or commercial intelligence and not seen as part of the repertoire of activities that make up contemporary marketing practice in a major review of consumer society mckendrick brewer and plumb found extensive evidence of eighteenth century english entrepreneurs using modern marketing techniques including product differentiation sales promotion and loss leader pricing english industrialists josiah wedgewood and matthew boulton are often portrayed as pioneers of modern mass marketing methods wedgewood was known to have used marketing techniques such as direct mail travelling salesmen and catalogues in the eighteenth century wedgewood also carried out serious investigations into the fixed and variable costs of production and recognised that increased production would lead to lower unit costs he also inferred that selling at lower prices would lead to higher demand and recognised the value of achieving scale economies in production by cutting costs and lowering prices wedgewood was able to generate higher overall profits similarly one of wedgewoods contemporaries matthew boulton pioneered early mass production techniques and product differentiation at his soho manufactory in the s he also practiced planned obsolescence and understood the importance of celebrity marketing  that is supplying the nobility often at prices below cost and of obtaining royal patronage for the sake of the publicity and cudos generated evidence of early marketing practices has also been noted across europe a study of the german book trade found examples of both product differentiation and market segmentation in the s other works have documented the use of persuasive advertising practices in eighteenth century italy england and france as early as the s marketing in the nineteenth and twentieth centuriesedit henry ford began manufacturing the massproduced model t in  ford famously said that customers could own a car in any colour as long as it was black until the nineteenth century western economies were characterised by small regional suppliers who sold goods on a local or regional basis however as transportation systems improved from the mid nineteenth century the economy became more unified allowing companies to distribute standardised branded goods a national level this gave rise to a much broader mass marketing mindset manufacturers tended to insist on strict standardisation in order to achieve scale economies with a view to keeping production costs down and also to achieving market penetration in the early stages of a products life cycle the model t ford was an example of a product being manufactured at a price that was affordable for the burgeoning middle classes havenmason hall at the university of michigan where the first academic course in marketing was taught in the early twentieth century as market size increased it became more commonplace for manufacturers to produce a variety of models pitched at different quality points designed to meet the needs of various demographic and lifestyle market segments giving rise to the widespread practice of market segmentation and product differentation between   george b waldron working at mahins advertising agency used tax registers city directories and census data to show advertisers the proportion of educated versus illiterate consumers and the earning capacity of different occupations in what is believed to be the first example of demographic segmentation of a population within little more than a decade paul cherington had developed the abcd household typology  the first sociodemographic segmentation tool when wendell r smith published his now classic article product differentiation and market segmentation as alternative marketing strategies in  he noted that he was simply documenting marketing practices that had been observed for some time and which he described as a natural force other theorists agree that smith was simply codifying implicit knowledge that had been used in marketing and brand management from the early twentieth century as industry grew the demand for skilled business professionals also grew to meet this demand universities began offering courses in commerce economics and marketing marketing as a discipline was first taught in universities in the very early twentieth century however researchers only became interested in investigating the history of marketing in the mid twentieth century from the outset researchers tended to identify two strands of historical research the history of marketing practice  and the history of marketing thought which was fundamentally concerned with the rise of marketing education and dissecting the way that marketing was taught and studied early historical studies were primarily descriptive history of marketing practiceedit the practice of marketing may have been carried out for millennia but the modern concept of marketing as a professional practice appears to have emerged the post industrial corporate world in addition to the studies of specific cultures or time periods discussed in the preceding section some historians of marketing have sought to write more general histories of marketings evolution in the modern era to do this historians often turn to a method known as periodisation periodisation refers to the process or study of categorizing the past into discrete quantified named units for the purpose of analysis or study a key question that has preoccupied researchers is whether specific orientations or mindsets that inform key periods of marketings evolution can be identified marketers disagree about the precise periods that outline marketing practice and describe the way that marketing practice has evolved over time orientations or philosophies that inform marketing practiceedit in the marketing literature continuing debate surrounds the orientations or philosophies that might have informed marketing practice at different periods of time an orientation may be defind as the type of activity or subject that an organization seems most interested in and gives most attention to  in relation to marketing orientations the term has been defined as a philosophy of business management  or a corporate state of mind  or as an organisational culture  hollander et al have identified fourteen different stage theories or short periodisations as well as a total of nineteen long periodisations that have been carried out since  of these the contributions of robert keith  and ronald fullerton  are the most frequently cited keiths periodisationedit robert keiths marketing eras production →selling →marketing were based entirely on his experience at the pillsbury company in  robert keith the then vice president of pillsbury set the stage for decades of controversy when he published an article entitled the marketing revolution in which he set out the way that the pillsbury company had shifted from a focus on production in the s through to a consumer focus in the s he traced three distinct eras in pillsburys evolution the production oriented era from  s  characterised by a focus on production processes the sales oriented era from the s to the s  characterised by investment in research to develop new products and advertising to persuade markets of product benefits the marketing oriented era from the beginning of the s  characterised by a focus on the customers latent and existing needs in addition keith hypothesised that a marketing control era was about to emerge although keiths article explicitly documented pillsburys evolution the article appears to suggest that the stages observed at pillsbury constitute a standard or normal evolutionary path production→sales→marketing for most large organisations keiths notion of distinct eras in the evolution of marketing practice has been widely criticised and his periodisation described as hopelessly flawed specific criticisms of keiths tripartite periodisation include that it ignores historical facts about business conditions  it misstates the nature of supply and demand  it slights the growth of marketing institutions  the article which is entirely based on keiths personal recollections and did not use a single reference is best described as anecdotal systematic studies carried out since keiths work have failed to replicate keiths periodisation instead other studies suggest that many companies exhibited a marketing orientation in the nineteenth century and that the business schools were teaching marketing decades before pillsbury adopted a marketing oriented approach jones and richardson also investigated historical accounts of marketing practice and found evidence for both the sales and marketing era during the socalled production era and concluded that there was no marketing revolution  a detailed study of the chocolate manufacturer rowntree found that this company had shifted from a production orientation through to a marketing orientation by the s without having transitioned through the socalled sales orientation other critiques of keiths work have pointed out that the socalled production era fails to align with historical facts and have suggested that it is a myth keiths eras have become known somewhat cynically as the standard chronology fullertons periodisationedit the english industrial revolution is often seen as a trigger for the rise of modern marketing in  fullerton developed a more subtle and nuanced periodisation for the socalled marketing eras fullertons eras were the era of antecedents    a long gestational period in which people were largely selfsufficient and rural economy characterised by low levels of consumption commerce was seen as suspicious the era of origins   precipitated by the dislocations of the english industrial revolution and the rise of a more urban population this era is characterised by more attention to persuasive tactics designed to stimulate demand the era of institutional development   many of the large institutions and modern marketing practices emerged during this period the era of refinement and formalisation –present   further development and refinement of principles and practices developed in the preceding period in spite of the intense criticism levelled at keiths eras of marketing practice his periodisation is the most frequently cited in textbooks  and has become the accepted wisdom one content analysis of  introductory and advanced texts found that keiths eras were reproduced in all but four another study which examined  of the top selling marketing texts found that the although the incidence of repeating keiths eras was waning it had not been replaced by fullertons periodisation nor any other more meaningful framework other periodisationsedit for all the controversies surrounding the socalled marketing stages or periods keith and others appear to have contributed a lasting legacy a study by grundey  suggests that many contemporary textbooks begin with keiths eras and expand on it by including newer concepts such as the societal marketing concept the relationship marketing concept and the interfunctional concept as shown in the table below more recently kotler and keller added the holistic marketing concept to the list of eras in marketing marketing theorists continue to debate whether the holistic era represents a genuine new orientation or whether it is an extension of the marketing concept grundey summarised five different periodisations in the history of marketing as shown in the following table as a means of highlighting the general lack of agreement among scholars marketing philosophies or orientations cited in popular texts dibb  simkin   lancaster  reynolds   blythe

commerce and tourism vol  no   p  brief description of the most commonly cited periodsedit the general lack of agreement amongst scholars as to what constitutes clearly identifiable periods and the orientation that characterised each distinct period has spawned a lengthy list of orientations space prevents an exhaustive description of all periods or eras however the most commonly cited periods appear in the following section production orientationedit the production orientation is one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers a production orientation is often proposed as the first of the socalled orientations that dominated business thought keith dated the production era from the s to the s but other theorists argue that evidence of the production orientation can still be found in some companies or industries specifically kotler and armstrong note that the production philosophy is one of the oldest philosophies that guides sellers and is still useful in some situations  the production orientation is characterised by a focus on production manufacturing and efficiency attainment of economies of scale economies of scope experience effects or all three an assumption that demand exceeds supply a mindset that is encapsulated by says law supply creates its own demand or if somebody makes a product somebody else will want to buy it limited research  and largely limited to technicalproduct research rather than customer research this orientation rose to prominence in an environment which had a shortage of manufactured goods relative to demand so goods sold easily minimal promotion and advertising marketing communications limited to raising awareness of the products existence selling orientationedit the sales orientation often characterised by doortodoor selling is thought to have begun during the great depression of the s and continues to this day pictured a rawleighs salesman in  the selling orientation is thought to have begun during the great depression and continued well into the s although examples of this orientation can still be found today kotler et al note that the selling concept is typically practised with unsought goods  the selling orientation is characterised by aggressive selling to push products often involving doortodoor selling accepting every possible sale or booking regardless of its suitability for the business has a strongly transactional focus ignores potential relationships the marketing orientationedit the marketing orientation or the marketing concept emerged in the s characteristics of the marketing orientation a thorough understanding of the customers needs wants and behaviours should be the focal point of all marketing decisions marketing efforts sales advertising product management pricing should be integrated and in tune with the customer new product concepts should flow from extensive market analysis and product testing the societal marketing conceptedit main article societal marketing societal marketing orientation or societal marketing concept was first proposed in the s  by phillip kotler in an article published in the harvard business review the societal marketing concept adopts the position that marketers have a greater social responsibility than simply satisfying customers and providing them with superior value instead marketing activities should strive to benefit societys overall wellbeing marketing organisations that have embraced the societal marketing concept typically identify key stakeholder groups including employees customers local communities the wider public and government they ensure that marketing activities do not damage the environment and are not hazardous to broader society societal marketing developed into sustainable marketing characteristics of societal marketing an attempt to balance corporate commitments to groups and individuals in its environment including customers other businesses employees and investors companies must include social and ethical considerations into their marketing practices consideration is given to the environment includes problems such as air water and land pollution consideration is given to consumer rights unfair pricing and ethics in advertising relationship orientationedit main article relationship marketing starting in the s a new stage of marketing emerged called relationship marketing the focus of relationship marketing is on a longterm relationship that benefits both the company and the customer the relationship is based on trust and commitment and both companies tend to shift their operating activities to be able to work more efficiently together one of the most prominent reasons for relationship marketing comes from kotlers idea that it costs about five times more to obtain a new customer than to maintain the relationship with an existing customer a relationship marketing approach seeks to maximise the value of all the potential exchanges an organisation could have into the future the characteristics of relationship marketing include a focus on the relationship between seller and buyer an investment in the lifetime of relationships customer lifetime value rather than single transactions an orientation on product benefits andor customer value high customer service high customer commitment high customer contact quality is the concern of all all activities are coordinated with the customer interface including the customers involvement in the firm’s processes customised offerings where practical empirical support for relationship marketing as a distinct paradigm is very weak one study suggests that relationship marketing is really a subcomponent of large scale movements of the valueadded process rather than a separate era or framework some theorists suggest that marketing is moving from a relationship marketing paradigm and towards a social media paradigm where marketers have access to a more controlled environment and are able to customise offers and communications messages history of marketing thoughtedit university of pennsylvania was among the first universities to offer courses in marketing dating the history of marketing thought is just as problematic as the history of markting practice marketing historians cannot agree on how to date the beginnings of marketing thought eric shaw for instance suggests that a period of preacademic marketing thought can be identified prior to  other historians on the other hand suggest that the theory of marketing only emerged in the th century when the discipline began to offer courses at universities nevertheless the birth of marketing as a discipline is usually designated to the first decade of the twentieth century when marketing courses appeared in universities in  the university of michigan offered what many believe to be the very first course in marketing in the academic year  the university of pennsylvania commenced teaching marketing other universities soon followed including the harvard business school prior to the emergence of marketing courses marketing was treated as a branch of economics and was often called applied economics early marketing theories were described as modifications or adaptations of economic theories a periodisation approachedit several scholars have attempted to describe the evolution of marketing thought chronologically and to connect it with broader intellectual and academic trends bartels  sketched an account of marketings formative periods and shah and gardner  briefly considered the development of the six dominant schools in contemporary marketing however these initial attempts have been described as descriptive savitt  one of the first theorists to consider the stages in the development of marketing thought was robert bartels who in the the history of marketing thought  used a periodisation approach he categorised the development of marketing theory decade by decade from the beginning of the th century s discovery of basic concepts and their exploration s conceptualisation classification and definition of terms s integration on the basis of principles s development of specialisation and variation in theory s reappraisal in the light of new demands and a more scientific approach s reconceptualisation in the light of managerialism social development and quantitative approaches s differentiation on bases such as managerialism holism environmentalism systems and internationalism s socialisation the adaptation of marketing to social change a schools of thought approachedit other marketing historians have eschewed the periodisation approach and instead considered whether distinct schools within marketing reflect different facets of common theory and whether a more unifying intellectual structure has emerged these approaches tend to identify distinct schools of thought a school of thought refers to an intellectual tradition or a group of scholars who share a common philosophy or set of ideas marketing historians shaw and jones define a school of thought as one that has a substantial body of knowledge developed by a number of scholars and describing at least one aspect of the what how who why when and where of performing marketing activities  of those who identify schools there is no real agreement about which schools were dominant at different stages in marketings development it should be noted that two or more schools of thought can coexist at the same time in the following section a brief overview of the contributions of key thinkers will be outlined with respect to the prevailing schools that have dominated marketing thought to a certain extent there is some agreement that in early marketing thought three socalled traditional schools namely the commodity school the functional school and the institutional school coexisted marketing historians such as eric shaw and barton a weitz point to the publication of wroe aldersons book marketing behavior and executive action  as a breakpoint in the history of marketing thought moving from the macro functionsinstitutionscommodities approach to a micromarketing management paradigm following on from alderson marketing began to incorporate other fields of knowledge besides economics notably behavioral science becoming a multidisciplinary field for some scholars aldersons book marks the beginning of the marketing management era hunt and goolsby identified four schools of thought that have dominated marketing namely the commodity school the institutional school the functional school and the managerial school the commodity school a focus on different types of goods in the marketplace and how they are marketed the institutional school emphasised the functions of middlemen or intermediaries similar to the functional school but with a focus on channel flows the functional school a focus on the characteristics of marketing identifying the functions and systems of marketing adopts a systems approach the managerial school a focus on the problems faced by marketing managers focuses on the perspective of the seller some marketing historians like jagdish sheth have identified the modern marketing schools as the managerial school emerged during the late s and became arguably the predominant and most influential school of thought in the field the consumerbuyer behavior school which dominated the academic field in the second half of the twentieth century apart from the managerial school features theories emerging from behavioral science the social exchange school which focuses on exchange as the fundamental concept of marketing yet other commentators identify a broader range of schools omalley and lichrou for example document the schools as functional what activities does marketing perform focus on intermediaries and value adding commodities how are goods classified focus on classification of goods trade flows marketing institutions who performs marketing functions on commodities focus on retailers wholesalers intermediaries distribution channels marketing management how should marketers and managers market products and services

consumers buy organisational buyer and consumer buyer macromarketing how do marketing systems impact on society industries channels consumer movement environmentalism exchange what are the forms of exchange who are the parties to the exchange process aggregations of buyers and sellers marketing history when did marketing practice and ideas emerge and evolve marketing thought and marketing practice brief description of the dominant schools of thoughtedit the following sections briefly outlines the schools of thought as conceptualised by key thinkers in the discipline marketing managementedit the marketing management school which emerged as the dominant school in  following the publication of basic marketing a managerial approach written by e jerome mccarthy replaced the socalled functional school which had been the dominant for the first part of the twentieth century in the words of hunt and goolsby the publication of mccarthys text sounded the beginning of the end for the functional school  however hunt and goolsby note that the s was a transitional period in which both the functional school and the managerial school coexisted shaw and jones have described the emergence of the managerial school in the mid twentieth century as a paradigm shift  key works in the marketing management tradition include wroe aldersons marketing behavior and executive action
