pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th appendix a some of the terms used in the prospectus and statement of additional information are described below bank obligations include certificates of deposit which are negotiable certificates evidencing the indebtedness of a commercial bank to repay funds deposited with it for a definite period of time usually from  days to one year at a stated interest rate bankers acceptances are credit instruments evidencing the obligation of a bank to pay a draft which has been drawn on it by a customer these instruments reflect the obligation both of the bank and of the drawer to pay the face amount of the instrument upon maturity bond anticipation notes normally are issued to provide interim financing until longterm financing can be arranged the longterm bonds then provide the money for the repayment of the notes bonds municipal bonds may be issued to raise money for various public purposes  like constructing public facilities and making loans to public institutions certain types of municipal bonds such as certain project notes are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states certain types of municipal bonds are issued to obtain funding for privately operated facilities the two principal classifications of municipal bonds are general obligation and revenue bonds general obligation bonds are backed by the taxing power of the issuing municipality and are considered the safest type of municipal bond issuers of general obligation bonds include states counties cities towns and regional districts the proceeds of these obligations are used to fund a wide range of public projects including the construction or improvement of schools highways and roads water and sewer systems and a variety of other public purposes the basic security of general obligation bonds is the issuers pledge of its faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds are backed by the net revenues derived from a particular facility or group of facilities of a municipality or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise or other specific revenue source although the principal security behind these bonds varies widely many provide additional security in the form of a debt service reserve fund whose monies may also be used to make principal and interest payments on the issuers obligations industrial development revenue bonds are a specific type of revenue bond backed by the credit and security of a private user and therefore investments in these bonds have more potential risk although nominally issued by municipal authorities industrial development revenue bonds are generally not secured by the taxing power of the municipality but are secured by the revenues of the authority derived from payments by the industrial user commercial paper consists of shortterm usually one to  days unsecured promissory notes issued by corporations in order to finance their current operations corporate debt obligations are bonds and notes issued by corporations and other business organizations including business trusts in order to finance their longterm credit needs money market refers to the marketplace composed of the financial institutions which handle the purchase and sale of liquid shortterm high pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th grade debt instruments the money market is not a single entity but consists of numerous separate markets each of which deals in a different type of shortterm debt instrument these include us government securities commercial paper certificates of deposit and bankers acceptances which are generally referred to as money market instruments portfolio securities loans the trust on behalf of each of the funds may lend limited amounts of its portfolio securities not to exceed  of a particular funds total assets to brokerdealers or other institutional investors management of the trust understands that it is the current view of the staff of the sec that the funds are permitted to engage in loan transactions only if the following conditions are met  the applicable fund must receive  collateral in the form of cash or cash equivalents eg us treasury bills or notes from the borrower  the borrower must increase the collateral whenever the market value of the securities determined on a daily basis rises above the level of the collateral  the trust must be able to terminate the loan after notice  the applicable fund must receive reasonable interest on the loan or a flat fee from the borrower as well as amounts equivalent to any dividends interest or other distributions on the securities loaned and any increase in market value  the applicable fund may pay only reasonable custodian fees in connection with the loan  voting rights on the securities loaned may pass to the borrower however if a material event affecting the investment occurs the trust must be able to terminate the loan and vote proxies or enter into an alternative arrangement with the borrower to enable the trust to vote proxies excluding items  and  these practices may be amended from time to time as regulatory provisions permit repurchase agreements a repurchase agreement is a transaction in which a fund purchases a security and simultaneously commits to sell the security to the seller at an agreed upon price and date usually not more than seven days after the date of purchase the resale price reflects the purchase price plus an agreed upon market rate of interest which is unrelated to the coupon rate or maturity of the purchased security a funds risk is limited to the ability of the seller to pay the agreed upon amount on the delivery date in the opinion of management this risk is not material if the seller defaults the underlying security constitutes collateral for the sellers obligations to pay this collateral will be held by the custodian for the trusts assets however in the absence of compelling legal precedents in this area there can be no assurance that the trust will be able to maintain its rights to such collateral upon default of the issuer of the repurchase agreement to the extent that the proceeds from a sale upon a default in the obligation to repurchase are less than the repurchase price the particular fund would suffer a loss revenue anticipation notes are issued in expectation of receipt of other kinds of revenue such as federal revenues available under the federal revenue sharing program reverse repurchase agreements transactions where a fund temporarily transfers possession of a portfolio security to another party such as a bank or brokerdealer in return for cash and agrees to buy the security back at a future date and price the use of reverse repurchase agreements will create leverage which is speculative reverse repurchase agreements are borrowings subject to the funds investment restrictions applicable to that activity pst�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st the trust will enter into reverse repurchase agreements solely for the purpose of obtaining funds necessary for meeting redemption requests the proceeds received from a reverse repurchase agreement will not be used to purchase securities for investment purposes shortterm discount notes taxexempt commercial paper are promissory notes issued by municipalities to supplement their cash flow the ratings a and p are the highest commercial paper ratings assigned by sp and moodys respectively tax anticipation notes are to finance working capital needs of municipalities and are issued in anticipation of various seasonal tax revenues to be payable from these specific future taxes time deposits are nonnegotiable deposits maintained in a banking institution for a specified period of time at a stated interest rate time deposits which may be held by the funds will not benefit from insurance from the federal deposit insurance corporation us government securities are debt securities including bills notes and bonds issued by the us treasury or issued by an agency or instrumentality of the us government which is established under the authority of an act of congress such agencies or instrumentalities include but are not limited to the federal national mortgage association government national mortgage association the federal farm credit bank and the federal home loan bank although all obligations of agencies authorities and instrumentalities are not direct obligations of the us treasury payment of the interest and principal on these obligations is generally backed directly or indirectly by the us government this support can range from the backing of the full faith and credit of the united states to us treasury guarantees or to the backing solely of the issuing instrumentality itself in the case of securities not backed by the full faith and credit of the united states the investor must look principally to the agency issuing or guaranteeing the obligation for ultimate repayment and may not be able to assert a claim against the united states itself in the event the agency or instrumentality does not meet its commitments ratings of municipal and corporate debt obligations the four highest ratings of moodys and standard  poors for municipal and corporate debt obligations are aaa aa a and baa and aaa aa a and bbb respectively moodys the characteristics of these debt obligations rated by moodys are generally as follows aaa  bonds which are rated aaa are judged to be of the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as gilt edge interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues aa  bonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds pnd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the longterm risks appear somewhat larger than in aaa securities moodys applies the numerical modifiers   and  to the aa rating classification the modifier  indicates a ranking for the security in the higher end of this rating category the modifier  indicates a mid range ranking and the modifier  indicates a ranking in the lower end of this rating category a  bonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future baa  bonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well moodys ratings for state and municipal notes and other shortterm loans are designated moodys investment grade mig this distinction is in recognition of the difference between shortterm credit and longterm credit a shortterm rating may also be assigned on an issue having a demand feature such ratings are designated as vmig shortterm ratings on issues with demand features are differentiated by the use of the vmig symbol to reflect such characteristics as payment upon demand rather than fixed maturity dates and payment relying on external liquidity mig vmig   notes and loans bearing this designation are of the best quality enjoying strong protection from established cash flows of funds for their servicing or from established and broadbased access to the market for refinancing or both mig vmig   notes and loans bearing this designation are of high quality with margins of protection ample although not so large as in the preceding group standard  poors the characteristics of these debt obligations rated by standard  poors ratings group are generally as follows aaa  this is the highest rating assigned by standard  poors to a debt obligation and indicates an extremely strong capacity to pay principal and interest aa  bonds rated aa also qualify as high quality debt obligations capacity to pay principal and interest is very strong and in the majority of instances they differ from aaa issues only in small degree a  debt rated a has a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal although it is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects prd�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than debt in higher rated categories bbb  debt rated bbb is regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay interest and repay principal whereas it normally exhibits adequate protection parameters adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for debt in this category than in higher rated categories standard  poors ratings for shortterm notes are as follows sp  very strong capacity to pay principal and interest sp  satisfactory capacity to pay principal and interest sp  speculative capacity to pay principal and interest a debt rating is not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold a security inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor ratings of commercial paper description of moodys commercial paper ratings among the factors considered by moodys investors services inc in assigning commercial paper ratings are the following  evaluation of the management of the issuer  economic evaluation of the issuers industry or industries and an appraisal of the risks which may be inherent in certain areas  evaluation of the issuers products in relation to competition and customer acceptance  liquidity  amount and quality of longterm debt  trend of earnings over a period of ten years  financial strength of a parent company and the relationships which exist with the issuer and  recognition by the management of obligations which may be present or may arise as a result of public interest questions and preparations to meet such obligations relative differences in strength and weakness in respect to these criteria would establish a rating of one of three classifications p highest quality p higher quality or p high quality description of standard  poors commercial paper ratings a standard  poors commercial paper rating is a current assessment of the likelihood of timely payment of debt having an original maturity of no more than  days ratings are graded into four categories ranging from a for the highest quality obligations to d for the lowest the a categories are as follows a  issues assigned this highest rating are regarded as having the greatest capacity for timely payment issues in this category are delineated with the numbers   and  to indicate the relative degree of safety a  this designation indicates that the degree of safety regarding timely payment is either overwhelming or very strong a  capacity for timely payment on issues with this designation is strong however the relative degree of safety is not as high as for issues designated a

obligation the taxexempt fund may acquire a right to sell the obligation to another party at a guaranteed price approximating par value either on demand or at specified intervals the right to sell may form part of the obligation or be acquired separately by the taxexempt fund these rights may be referred to as demand features standby commitments or puts depending on their characteristics collectively referred to as standby commitments and may involve letters of credit or other credit support arrangements supplied by domestic or foreign banks supporting the other partys ability to purchase the obligation from the taxexempt fund in considering whether an obligation meets the taxexempt funds quality standards the fund may look to the creditworthiness of the party providing the right to sell or to the quality of the obligation itself these transactions improve portfolio liquidity by making available sameday settlements on sales of portfolio securities the taxexempt fund may engage in such transactions subject to any limitations contained in the rules under the investment company act of  a standby commitment is a right acquired by the fund when it purchases a municipal obligation from a broker dealer or other financial institution seller to sell up to the same principal amount of such securities back to the seller at the funds option at a specified price the exercise by the taxexempt fund of a standby commitment is subject to the ability of the other party to fulfill its contractual commitment standby commitments acquired by the taxexempt fund will have the following features  they will be in writing and will be physically held by the funds custodian  the funds rights to exercise them will be unconditional and unqualified  they will be entered into only with sellers which in the advisers opinion present a minimal risk of default  although standby commitments will not be transferable municipal obligations purchased subject to such commitments may be sold to a third party at any time even though the commitment is outstanding and  their exercise price will be i the funds acquisition cost excluding the cost if any of the standby commitment of the municipal obligations which are subject to the commitment excluding any accrued interest which the fund paid on their acquisition less any amortized market premium or plus any amortized market or original issue discount during the period the fund owned the securities plus ii all interest accrued on the securities since the last interest payment date the trust on behalf of the taxexempt fund expects that standby commitments generally will be available without the payment of any direct or indirect consideration however if necessary or advisable the taxexempt fund will pay for standby commitments either separately in cash or by paying a higher price for portfolio securities which are acquired subject to the commitments pth�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th it is difficult to evaluate the likelihood of use or the potential benefit of a standby commitment therefore it is expected that the trustees of the trust will determine that standby commitments ordinarily have a fair value of zero regardless of whether any direct or indirect consideration was paid when the taxexempt fund has paid for a standby commitment its cost will be reflected as unrealized depreciation for the period during which the commitment is held management of the trust understands that the internal revenue service the service has issued a favorable revenue ruling to the effect that under specified circumstances a registered investment company will be the owner of taxexempt municipal obligations acquired subject to a put option the service has also issued private letter rulings to certain taxpayers which do not serve as precedent for other taxpayers to the effect that taxexempt interest received by a regulated investment company with respect to such obligations will be taxexempt in the hands of such company and may be distributed to shareholders as exemptinterest dividends the service has subsequently announced that it will not ordinarily issue advance ruling letters as to the identity of the true owner of property in cases involving the sale of securities or participation interests therein if the purchaser has the right to cause the security or the participation interest therein to be purchased by either the seller or a third party the taxexempt fund intends to take the position that it is the owner of any municipal obligations acquired subject to a standby commitment and that taxexempt interest earned with respect to such municipal obligations will be taxexempt in its hands there is no assurance that standby commitments will be available to the fund nor has the fund assumed that such commitments would continue to be available under all market conditions officers and trustees listed below are the trustees and executive officers of the

if a capital gain dividend was paid with respect to such funds shares while they were held by the investor then any loss realized by the investor will be treated as longterm capital loss to the extent

of any exemptinterest dividends received during such six month period although the period may be reduced under treasury regulations to be issued section  of the code provides for a nondeductible

the adviser for its analysis and consideration as investment adviser to the funds and its other accounts the views and information of individuals and research staffs of many securities firms although such information may be a useful supplement to the advisers own investment information the value of such research and services is not expected to reduce materially the expenses of the adviser in the performance of its services under the investment advisory agreement and will not reduce the advisory fee payable to the adviser by the funds the adviser may follow a policy of considering sales of shares of the trust as a factor in the selection of dealers to execute portfolio transactions subject to the primary objective of best execution discussed above on occasions when the adviser deems the purchase or sale of a security to be in the best interest of the funds as well as other customers the adviser to the extent permitted by applicable laws and regulations may aggregate the securities to be so purchased or sold for such parties in order to obtain best execution and lower brokerage commissions in such event allocation of the securities so purchased or sold as well as the expenses incurred in the transaction will be made by the adviser in the manner it considers to be most equitable and consistent with its fiduciary obligations to all such customers including the funds in some cases the aggregation of securities to be sold or purchased could have a detrimental effect on the price of the security insofar as each fund is concerned however in other cases the ability of a fund

fund may advertise its yield and effective yield both yield figures are based on historical earnings and are not intended to indicate future performance the yield of the fund refers to the income generated by an investment in the fund over a sevenday period which period will be stated in the advertisement this income is then annualized that is the amount of income generated by the investment during that week is assumed to be generated each week over a week period and is shown as a percentage of the investment the effective yield is calculated similarly but when annualized the income earned by an investment in the fund is assumed to be reinvested the effective yield will be slightly higher than the yield because of the compounding effect of this assumed reinvestment each fund normally computes its yield by determining for a sevenday base period the net change exclusive of capital changes for a hypothetical preexisting account having a balance of one share at the beginning of the base period subtracting a hypothetical charge reflecting deductions from shareholder accounts and dividing the difference by the value of the account at the beginning of the base period to obtain the base period return multiplying the result by  with the resulting yield figure carried to at least the nearest hundredth of one percent each fund may also compute a standardized effective yield this is computed by compounding the base period return which is done by adding one to the base period return raising the sum to a power equal to  divided by seven and subtracting one from the result the yield paid by the funds will result in payment of taxable interest to the fund shareholders miscellaneous principal shareholders as of april   the following entities were known by the money

constant net asset value of  per share despite minor shifts in the market value of its portfolio securities under the amortized cost method of valuation securities are valued at cost on the date of purchase thereafter the value of the security is increased or decreased incrementally each day so that at maturity any purchase discount or premium is fully amortized and the value of the security is equal to its principal the amortized cost method may result in periods during which the amortized cost value of the securities may be higher or lower than their market value and the yield on a shareholders investment may be higher or lower than that which would be recognized if the net asset value of a funds portfolio was not constant and was permitted to fluctuate with the market value of the portfolio securities it is believed that any such differences will normally be minimal during periods of declining interest rates the quoted yield on shares of each fund may tend to be higher than a like computation made by a fund with identical investments utilizing a method of valuation based upon market prices and estimates of market prices for all of its portfolio instruments thus if the use of amortized cost by a fund resulted in a lower aggregate net asset value on a particular day a prospective investor in the fund would be able to obtain a somewhat higher yield if he or she purchased shares of the fund on that day than would result from investment in a fund utilizing solely market values the converse would apply in a period of rising interest rates the trustees of the
