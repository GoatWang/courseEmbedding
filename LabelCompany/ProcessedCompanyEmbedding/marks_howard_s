a fluent welsh speaker he gained a place at balliol college oxford after he impressed russell meiggs in his interview and read physics there from  to  at the university he was first introduced to cannabis by denys irving after his friend joshua macmillan son of maurice macmillan died marks swore off ever getting involved with hard drugs among his other friends at balliol were the epidemiologist julian peto and the journalist lynn barber through a mixture of cheating and last minute cramming he passed his finals this was despite months of taking drugs rather than attending classes and a serious infection he developed a few weeks before the exams in  he began teacher training and married ilze kadegis a latvian student at st annes college oxford who was also training to become a teacher he gave up teacher training to continue his education at the university of london – grad inst p then back to balliol oxford – dip hph sc and then on to the university of sussex – to study philosophy of science drug empireedit though involved with drugs at university he sold cannabis only to his friends or acquaintances until  when he was persuaded to assist graham plinston who had been arrested in germany on drug trafficking charges through plinston he met mohammed durrani a pakistani hashish exporter who was a descendant of the durranis who had run afghanistan in the th century with plinston behind bars durrani offered marks the opportunity to sell the drug on a large scale in london and he agreed to the proposition he formed a fourway partnership with charlie radcliffe charlie weatherly and a dealer named jarvis durrani never contacted them and so the group acquired smaller quantities of hashish from various sources and began selling the drug on in oxford brighton and london after six months he returned to germany to help bail plinston out of jail marks was a useful means of transferring money as he did not have a criminal record now a free man plinston gave marks a job transporting hashish in frankfurt marks in turn hired a new zealand smuggler named lang as his driver after paying marks £ for his work in frankfurt plinston then sold hashish on to marks and his three friends radcliffe weatherly and jarvis in london in selling on  kilos within a week the four men made a profit of £ durrani then arranged for hashish to be smuggled in the furniture of pakistani diplomats who were moving to london marks would then intercept the furniture to find the drugs – this arrangement netted him a profit of £ marks expanded his enterprise employing two friends from wales mike bell and david thomas to stash the drugs and help with transportation the gang became unsatisfied with the way the profits were being split  of the money they made went to durrani and contacted james mccann a gunrunner for the provisional irish republican army ira marks and plinston persuaded mccann to smuggle hashish into ireland from kabul which the pair would then ferry over to wales and into england mccann would get the drugs into ireland through the freeport at shannon airport using his ira connections marks avoided the attention of hm revenue and customs by creating a paper trail that indicated he made his money from selling stamps and dresses by  he was making £ with each shipment by the end of the year he was approached by hamilton mcmillan of the secret intelligence service mi a friend from oxford university who recruited marks to work for mi because of his connections in the hashishproducing countries of lebanon pakistan and afghanistan for his ability to seduce women and for his contacts with the ira the next year marks began exporting cannabis to the united states to the brotherhood of eternal love hiding the drugs in the music equipment of fictional british pop groups that were supposed to be touring the country he further expanded his operations with other smugglers and other methods of trafficking often using his oxford connections as mccann was in danger of being executed by the ira should mi tip them off about his involvement in drugs marks then gave up the smuggling operation at shannon airport following the littlejohn affair mi ceased their relationship with marks while his american operation came to an end after police opened a speaker full of cannabis and arrested gang member james gater leading to other arrests in europe marks was arrested by dutch police in  but skipped bail in april  the british press then made him a nationally known figure reporting that he was feared abducted by the ira for his connections with mi with most of his fortune confiscated by the authorities he made his way to italy where he lived in a winnebago for three months before returning to england in secret in october  at this point he began a relationship with judy lane the couple married in  and had three children together he had previously been in a fiveyear relationship with rosie lewis with whom he had a daughter marks then connected ernie combs member of the brotherhood of eternal love with john denbigh a man with connections in the hashishproducing nation of nepal with the help of the yakuza large quantities of the drug would be exported to john f kennedy international airport in the guise of air conditioning equipment where don browns mob headed by carmine galante would then take possession of the drugs a kilo deal was set up and executed on  july  leaving marks a wealthy man other deals up to  kilos followed and marks continued to live under assumed names in the united kingdom in  he travelled to america and set up a kilo deal between combs and lebanese sam – making himself £ in the process he continued to regularly set up deals between his various american and far east connections in need of a new identity after his alias of anthony tunnicliffe was compromised in a police sting in  he bought donald nices passport between  and  twentyfour loads totalling  pounds of marijuana and hashish had been successfully imported through john f kennedy airport new york they had involved the mafia the yakuza the brotherhood of eternal love the thai army the palestine liberation organization the pakistani armed forces nepalese monks and other individuals from all walks of life the total profit made by all concerned was  theyd had a good run — marks concluding the jfk episode of drug trafficking in his mr nice autobiography the run had ended after the drug enforcement administration dea began intercepting the drugs and arresting mafia associates in new york in the late s the trafficante crime family under the leadership of santo trafficante jr were importing colombian cannabis into the us on freighter ships thus driving down the price of the drug on the streets in america in december  trafficante exported  tons of cannabis direct from colombia to marks and his contacts in the uk enough to supply the entire british market for the drug for almost a year in  marks was arrested by customs officers for his part in importing £ million of cannabis police had followed associates of the trafficante family to a large stash of cannabis when arrested he was in possession of numerous pieces of incriminating evidence as well as £ in cash defended by lord hutchinson marks pleaded not guilty concocting a story that he was an agent for mi concealing the fact that his relation with mi ended in  and the mexican secret service that had set up an identity as a drug smuggler in order to close the net on james mccann wanted in britain for his ira activities the jury found him innocent of drug smuggling but guilty of using false passports and marks was sentenced to two years imprisonment but was released after five days having already served most of this time before sentencing was passed hm customs then arrested him for his part of a  smuggling operation but following a plea bargain and time off for remission he served just three months of a threeyear sentence released in may  though with most of his employees still in prison for the crime marks was found innocent of he spent the next year running a legitimate wine importing business but he continued to spend more money than he was making and the savings he made from drug smuggling in the s began to dwindle in  mccann was still at large and his smuggling enterprise was flourishing he offered marks the chance to sell  kilos of cannabis and marks accepted dutch police confiscated the full shipment and arrested mickey williams a member of the london underworld who had agreed to help marks on the deal marks then travelled to the far east to set up cannabis deals with salim malik a pakistani hashish exporter who he had met through durrani durrani had since suffered a fatal heart attack and phil sparrowhawk an exporter from bangkok they would smuggle their product over to ernie combs in america he also arranged a kilo deal with mickey williams who had travelled to bangkok after his release from prison in amsterdam marks laundered his money through various fronts a travel agency a paper mill a wine importers a bulk water transportation company and a secretarial service in  he was approached to sell  worth of cannabis to a central intelligence agency cia agent looking to fund and arm the mujahideen in their war against the soviet occupation operation cyclone the agents contact on the apl ship suffered a heart attack and died on the journey to the us leaving the drugs in the hands of us officials the agent subsequently fled to brazil to avoid prosecution though under surveillance marks continued to expand his underworld operations and set up a massage parlour in a bangkok hotel with the help of phil sparrowhawk and lord moynihan in  he settled in majorca and continued to make vast sums smuggling salim maliks hashish into america the dea were meanwhile tapping markss phones and keeping him under surveillance and having arrested ernie combs they came close to busting a large shipment of cannabis when marks was tipped off the ship was redirected to mauritius and the operation aborted as he continued to avoid dea stings he continued to make millions and continued to add to his underworld contacts finding that he could use chinese triads to launder his drug money more effectively a philippinebrothelowning member of the house of lords moynihan was staying at the house of a spanish chief inspector of police rafael llofriu the lord was being watched by an american cia operative who was staying at the house of an english convicted sex offender jim hobbs the cia operative was sharing accommodation with an ira terrorist mccann the ira terrorist was discussing a moroccan hashish deal with a georgian pilot of colombias medellín cartel organising these scenarios was an exmi agent marks currently supervising the sale of thirty tons of thai weed in canada and at whose house could be found pakistans major supplier of hashish malik attempting to understand the scenarios was a solitary dea agent the stage was set for something — the deas efforts to apprehend marks were made extremely difficult thanks to the many wideranging contacts marks had in september  many of these contacts were with marks in palma when friends of his were busted by the royal canadian mounted police marks decided to retire from drug smuggling to concentrate on his legitimate businesses citing the fate of his friends and contacts who were either in jail informing the dea or smuggling heavier drugs in  dea agent craig lovato arrested both howard and judy marks and extradited the couple to the united states arrests of those involved in markss various criminal activities were made in britain spain the philippines thailand the netherlands pakistan switzerland the united states and canada this was the work of operation eclectic set up in  by both the dea and scotland yard and aided by numerous law enforcement organisations from around the world trial and imprisonmentedit marks was taken from palma to modelo prison in barcelona and then to alcalameco in madrid there he was handed a page document which detailed the allegations of his drug smuggling activities between  and  charging him with operating a racket as described in the rico act in his autobiography marks stated that although the charge against judy and some others were absurd the formal accusations against me in general terms were true the recently passed sentencing reform act meant that he was facing a minimum of ten years to a maximum life sentence without the possibility for parole the audiencia nacional ordered his extradition to florida after being shown the prosecution evidence against him marks attempted to construct the defence that his smuggling operations were directed to australia and that he never exported to the united states and therefore never broke us law he again cultivated the myth that he was a spy for mi and claimed that he was set up by the cia because he had discovered that cia agents were smuggling drugs into australia he and his lawyers spent hours reviewing the phone tapping evidence to make the coded conversations about smuggling into america seem to suggest that the drugs were actually being smuggled into australia research was done into weather patterns to prove tentative links between what was said by marks and his associates and what was happening at the time in australia marks and his wife were extradited in  and he was given the miranda rights on the flight from spain to the us in florida judy pleaded guilty to her small part in the racket and was released having already served some months in prison in spain the money marks made from his smuggling operations was spent on legal fees he refused to pleabargain or to inform on his associates gambling that he could again convince a jury that the authorities had got the wrong man as the trial began in july  peter lane his brotherinlaw and fellow smuggler wrote to marks to inform him that he was going to testify against marks in court to get a more lenient sentence himself marks still was confident of beating the dea in court but ernie combs also agreed to testify for the prosecution so as to secure the release of his wife and marks had little choice but to change his plea to guilty to racketeering charges he was sentenced to  years in jail and given a  fine though he had originally been sentenced to  years he was taken back into court after the judge realised he had misspoken and said that his  and year sentences were to run consecutively and not as he had originally stated concurrently he spent seven years imprisoned in the federal correctional complex terre haute indiana a rough prison he had originally been sentenced to butner but agent lovato insisted that he instead serve time at terre haute one of the six most secure prisons in the country terre haute had the worst reputation of the six for gang rape and violence despite this marks remained on good terms with the many violent inmates housed there as he was british and a famous nonrat and avoided conflict by being nice charming and eccentric during his time there he befriended many notorious criminals and members of four of the reputed five families including gennaro gerry lang langella colombo crime family james jimmy c coonan john johnny carnegs carneglia vittorio little vic amuso and frank frankie loc locascio gambino crime family anthony bruno indelicato bonanno crime family and joey testa lucchese crime family he also made friends with veronza bowers jr black panther party and big jim of the outlaw motorcycle club owing to his status as an oxford university graduate with alleged connections to the british secret intelligence service he was treated as a potential escapee and spent many weeks in solitary confinement though he never attempted to escape or threatened other prisoners or prison staff during his time in prison he found success as a jailhouse lawyer for the other inmates securing one overturned conviction he gave up cigarettes for the last three years of his sentence in january  marks was granted parole after a

exmi agent marks currently supervising the sale of thirty tons of thai weed in canada and at whose house could be found pakistans major supplier of hashish malik attempting to understand the scenarios was a solitary dea agent the stage was set for something — the deas efforts to apprehend marks were made extremely difficult thanks to the many wideranging contacts marks had in september  many of these contacts were with marks in palma when friends of his were busted by the royal canadian mounted police marks decided to retire from drug smuggling to concentrate on his legitimate businesses citing the fate of his friends and contacts who were either in jail informing the dea or smuggling heavier drugs in  dea agent craig lovato arrested both howard and judy marks and extradited the couple to the united states arrests of those involved in markss various criminal activities were made in britain spain the philippines thailand the netherlands pakistan switzerland the united states and canada this was the work of operation eclectic set up in  by both the dea and scotland yard and aided by numerous law enforcement organisations from around the world trial and imprisonmentedit marks was taken from palma to modelo prison in barcelona and then to alcalameco in madrid there he was handed a page document which detailed the allegations of his drug smuggling activities between  and  charging him with operating a racket as described in the rico act in his autobiography marks stated that although the charge against judy and some others were absurd the formal accusations against me in general terms were true the recently passed sentencing reform act meant that he was facing a minimum of ten years to a maximum life sentence without the possibility for parole the audiencia nacional ordered his extradition to florida after being shown the prosecution evidence against him marks attempted to construct the defence that his smuggling operations were directed to australia and that he never exported to the united states and therefore never broke us law he again cultivated the myth that he was a spy for mi and claimed that he was set up by the cia because he had discovered that cia agents were smuggling drugs into australia he and his lawyers spent hours reviewing the phone tapping evidence to make the coded conversations about smuggling into america seem to suggest that the drugs were actually being smuggled into australia research was done into weather patterns to prove tentative links between what was said by marks and his associates and what was happening at the time in australia marks and his wife were extradited in  and he was given the miranda rights on the flight from spain to the us in florida judy pleaded guilty to her small part in the racket and was released having already served some months in prison in spain the money marks made from his smuggling operations was spent on legal fees he refused to pleabargain or to inform on his associates gambling that he could again convince a jury that the authorities had got the wrong man as the trial began in july  peter lane his brotherinlaw and fellow smuggler wrote to marks to inform him that he was going to testify against marks in court to get a more lenient sentence himself marks still was confident of beating the dea in court but ernie combs also agreed to testify for the prosecution so as to secure the release of his wife and marks had little choice but to change his plea to guilty to racketeering charges he was sentenced to  years in jail and given a  fine though he had originally been sentenced to  years he was taken back into court after the judge realised he had misspoken and said that his  and year sentences were to run consecutively and not as he had originally stated concurrently he spent seven years imprisoned in the federal correctional complex terre haute indiana a rough prison he had originally been sentenced to butner but agent lovato insisted that he instead serve time at terre haute one of the six most secure prisons in the country terre haute had the worst reputation of the six for gang rape and violence despite this marks

germany on drug trafficking charges through plinston he met mohammed durrani a pakistani hashish exporter who was a descendant of the durranis who had run afghanistan in the th century with plinston behind bars durrani offered marks the opportunity to sell the drug on a large scale in london and he agreed to the proposition he formed a fourway partnership with charlie radcliffe charlie weatherly and a dealer named jarvis durrani never contacted them and so the group acquired smaller quantities of hashish from various sources and began selling the drug on in oxford brighton and london after six months he returned to germany to help bail plinston out of jail marks was a useful means of transferring money as he did not have a criminal record now a free man plinston gave marks a job transporting hashish in frankfurt marks in turn hired a new zealand smuggler named lang as his driver after paying marks £ for his work in frankfurt plinston then sold hashish on to marks and his three friends radcliffe weatherly and jarvis in london in selling on  kilos within a week the four men made a profit of £ durrani then arranged for hashish to be smuggled in the furniture of pakistani diplomats who were moving to london marks would then intercept the furniture to find the drugs – this arrangement netted him a profit of £ marks expanded his enterprise employing two friends from wales mike bell and david thomas to stash the drugs and help with transportation the gang became unsatisfied with the way the profits were being split  of the money they made went to durrani and contacted james mccann a gunrunner for the provisional irish republican army ira marks and plinston persuaded mccann to smuggle hashish into ireland from kabul which the pair would then ferry over to wales and into england mccann would get the drugs into ireland through the freeport at shannon airport using his ira connections marks avoided the attention of hm revenue and customs by creating a paper trail that indicated he made his money from selling stamps and dresses by  he was making £ with each shipment by the end of the year he was approached by hamilton mcmillan of the secret

ability to seduce women and for his contacts with the ira the next year marks began exporting cannabis to the united states to the brotherhood of eternal love hiding the drugs in the music equipment of fictional british pop groups that were supposed to be touring the country he further expanded his operations with other smugglers and other methods of trafficking often using his oxford connections as mccann was in danger of being executed by the ira should mi tip them off about his involvement in drugs marks then gave up the smuggling operation at shannon airport following the littlejohn affair mi ceased their relationship with marks while his american operation came to an end after police opened a speaker full of cannabis and arrested gang member james gater leading to other arrests in europe marks was arrested by dutch police in  but skipped bail in april  the british press then made him a nationally known figure reporting that he was feared abducted by the ira for his connections

he began a relationship with judy lane the couple married in  and had three children together he had previously been in a fiveyear relationship with rosie lewis with whom he had a daughter marks then connected ernie combs member of the brotherhood of eternal love with john denbigh a man with connections in the hashishproducing nation of nepal with the help of the yakuza large quantities of the drug would be exported to john f kennedy international airport in the guise of air conditioning equipment where don browns mob headed by carmine galante would then take possession of the drugs a kilo deal was set up and executed on  july  leaving marks a wealthy man other deals up to  kilos followed and marks continued to live under assumed names in the united kingdom in  he travelled to america

behind bars durrani offered marks the opportunity to sell the drug on a large scale in london and he agreed to the proposition he formed a fourway partnership with charlie radcliffe charlie weatherly and a dealer named jarvis durrani never contacted them and so the group acquired smaller quantities of hashish from various sources and began selling the drug on in oxford brighton and london after six months he returned to germany to help bail plinston out of jail marks was a useful means of transferring money as he did not have a criminal record now a free man plinston gave marks a job

contacted james mccann a gunrunner for the provisional irish republican army ira marks and plinston persuaded mccann to smuggle hashish into ireland from kabul which the pair would then ferry over to

ability to seduce women and for his contacts with the ira the next year marks began exporting cannabis to the united states to the brotherhood of eternal love hiding the drugs in the music equipment of fictional british pop groups that were supposed to be touring the country he further expanded his operations with other smugglers and other methods of trafficking often using his oxford connections as mccann was in danger of being executed by the ira should mi tip them off about his involvement in drugs marks then gave up the smuggling operation at shannon airport following the littlejohn affair mi ceased their relationship with marks while his american operation came to an end after police opened a speaker full of cannabis and arrested gang member james gater leading to other arrests in

he began a relationship with judy lane the couple married in  and had three children together he had previously been in a fiveyear relationship with rosie lewis with whom he had a daughter marks then

drug would be exported to john f kennedy international airport in the guise of air conditioning equipment where don browns mob headed by carmine galante would then take possession of the drugs a kilo deal was set up and executed on  july  leaving marks a wealthy man other deals up to  kilos followed and marks continued to live under assumed names in the united kingdom in  he travelled to america and set up a kilo deal between combs and lebanese sam – making himself £ in the process he continued to regularly set up deals between his various american and far east connections in need of a new

mr nice autobiography the run had ended after the drug enforcement administration dea began intercepting the drugs and arresting mafia associates in new york in the late s the trafficante crime family under the leadership of santo trafficante jr were importing colombian cannabis into the us on freighter ships thus driving down the price of the drug on the streets in america in december  trafficante exported  tons of cannabis direct from colombia to marks and his contacts in the uk enough to supply the entire british market for the drug for almost a year in  marks was arrested by customs officers for his part in importing £ million of cannabis police had followed associates of the trafficante family to a large stash of cannabis when arrested he was in possession of numerous pieces of incriminating evidence as well as £ in cash defended by lord hutchinson marks pleaded not guilty concocting a story that he was an agent for mi concealing the fact that his relation with mi ended in  and the mexican secret service that had set up an identity as a drug smuggler in order to close the net on james mccann wanted in britain for his ira activities the jury found him innocent of drug smuggling but guilty of using false passports and marks was sentenced to two years imprisonment but was released after five days having already served most of this time before sentencing was passed hm customs then arrested him for his part of a  smuggling operation but following a plea bargain and time off for remission he served just three months of a threeyear sentence released in may  though with most of his employees still in prison for the crime marks was found innocent of he spent the next year running a legitimate wine importing business but he continued to spend more money than he was making and the savings he made from drug smuggling in the s began to dwindle in  mccann was still at large and his smuggling enterprise was flourishing he offered marks the chance to sell  kilos of cannabis and marks accepted dutch police confiscated the full shipment and arrested mickey williams a member of the london underworld who had agreed to help marks on the deal marks then travelled to the far east to set up cannabis deals with salim malik a pakistani hashish exporter who he had met through durrani durrani had since suffered a fatal heart attack and phil sparrowhawk an exporter from bangkok they would smuggle their product over to ernie combs in america he also arranged a kilo deal with mickey williams who had travelled to bangkok after his release from prison in amsterdam marks laundered his money through various fronts a travel agency a paper mill a wine importers a bulk water transportation company and a secretarial service in  he was approached to sell  worth of cannabis to a central intelligence agency cia agent looking to fund and arm the mujahideen in their war against the soviet occupation operation cyclone the agents contact on the apl ship suffered a heart attack and died on the journey to the us leaving the drugs in the hands of us officials the agent subsequently fled to brazil to avoid prosecution though under surveillance marks continued to expand his underworld operations and set up a massage parlour in a bangkok hotel with the help of phil sparrowhawk and lord moynihan in  he settled in majorca and continued to make vast sums smuggling salim maliks hashish into america the dea were meanwhile tapping markss phones and keeping him under surveillance and having arrested ernie combs they came close to busting a large shipment of cannabis when marks was tipped off the ship was redirected to mauritius and the operation aborted as he continued to avoid dea stings he continued to make millions and continued to add to his underworld contacts finding that he could use chinese triads to launder his drug money more effectively a philippinebrothelowning member of the house of lords moynihan was staying at the house of a spanish chief inspector of police rafael llofriu the lord was being watched by an american cia operative who was staying at the house of an english convicted sex offender jim hobbs the cia operative was sharing accommodation with an ira terrorist mccann the ira terrorist was discussing a moroccan hashish deal with a georgian pilot of colombias medellín cartel organising these scenarios was an exmi agent marks currently supervising the sale of thirty tons of thai weed in canada and at whose house could be found pakistans major supplier of hashish malik attempting to understand the scenarios was a solitary dea agent the stage was set for something — the deas efforts to apprehend marks were made extremely difficult thanks to the many wideranging contacts marks had in september  many of these contacts were with marks in palma when friends of his were busted by the royal canadian mounted police marks decided to retire from drug smuggling to concentrate on his legitimate businesses citing the fate of his friends and contacts who were either in jail informing the dea or smuggling heavier drugs in  dea agent craig lovato arrested both howard and judy marks and extradited the couple to the united states arrests of those involved in markss various criminal activities were made in britain spain the philippines thailand the netherlands pakistan switzerland the united states and canada this was the work of operation eclectic set up in  by both the dea and scotland yard and aided by numerous law enforcement organisations from around the world trial and imprisonmentedit marks was taken from palma to modelo prison in barcelona and then to alcalameco in madrid there he was handed a page document which detailed the allegations of his drug smuggling activities between  and  charging him with operating a racket as described in the rico act in his autobiography marks stated that although the charge against judy and some others were absurd the formal accusations against me in general terms were true the recently passed sentencing reform act meant that he was facing a minimum of ten years to a maximum life sentence without the possibility for parole the audiencia nacional ordered his extradition to florida after being shown the prosecution evidence against him marks attempted to construct the defence that his smuggling operations were directed to australia and that he never exported to the united states and therefore never broke us law he again cultivated the myth that he was a spy for mi and claimed that he was set up by the cia because he had discovered that cia agents were smuggling drugs into australia he and his lawyers spent hours reviewing the phone tapping evidence to make the coded conversations about smuggling into america seem to suggest that the drugs were actually being smuggled into australia research was done into weather patterns to prove tentative links between what was said by marks and his associates and what was happening at the time in australia marks and his wife were extradited in  and he was given the miranda rights on the flight from spain to the us in florida judy pleaded guilty to her small part in the racket and was released having already served some months in prison in spain the money marks made from his smuggling operations was spent on legal fees he refused to pleabargain or to inform on his associates gambling that he could again convince a jury that the authorities had got the wrong man as the trial began in july  peter lane his brotherinlaw and fellow smuggler wrote to marks to inform him that he was going to testify against marks in court to get a more lenient sentence himself marks still was confident of beating the dea in court but ernie combs also agreed to testify for the prosecution so as to secure the release of his wife and marks had little choice but to change his plea to guilty to racketeering charges he was sentenced to  years in jail and given a  fine though he had originally been sentenced to  years he was taken back into court after the judge realised he had misspoken and said that his  and year sentences were to run consecutively and not as he had originally stated concurrently he spent seven years imprisoned in the federal correctional complex terre haute indiana a rough prison he had originally been sentenced to butner but agent lovato insisted that he instead serve time at terre haute one of the six most secure prisons in the country terre haute had the worst reputation of the six for gang rape and violence despite this marks

vic amuso and frank frankie loc locascio gambino crime family anthony bruno indelicato bonanno crime family and joey testa lucchese crime family he also made friends with veronza bowers jr black

infection he developed a few weeks before the exams in  he began teacher training and married ilze kadegis a latvian student at st annes college oxford who was also training to become a teacher he gave up teacher training to continue his education at the university of london – grad inst p then back to balliol oxford – dip hph sc and then on to the university of sussex – to study philosophy of science drug empireedit though involved with drugs at university he sold cannabis only to his friends or acquaintances until  when he was persuaded to assist graham plinston who had been arrested in germany on drug trafficking charges through plinston he met mohammed durrani a pakistani hashish exporter who was a descendant of the durranis who had run afghanistan in the th century with plinston behind bars durrani offered marks the opportunity to sell the drug on a large scale in london and he agreed to the proposition he formed a fourway partnership with charlie radcliffe charlie weatherly and a dealer named jarvis durrani never contacted them and so the group acquired smaller quantities of hashish from various sources and began selling the drug on in oxford brighton and london after six months he returned to germany to help bail plinston out of jail marks was a useful means of transferring money as he did not have a criminal record now a free man plinston gave marks a job transporting hashish in frankfurt marks in turn hired a new zealand smuggler named lang as his driver after paying marks £ for his work in frankfurt plinston then sold hashish on to marks and his three friends radcliffe weatherly and jarvis in london in selling on  kilos within a week the four men made a profit of £ durrani then arranged for hashish to be smuggled in the furniture of pakistani diplomats who were moving to london marks would then intercept the furniture to find the drugs – this arrangement netted him a profit of £ marks expanded his enterprise employing two friends from wales mike bell and david thomas to stash the drugs and help with transportation the gang became unsatisfied with the way the profits were being split  of the money they made went to durrani and contacted james mccann a gunrunner for the provisional irish republican army ira marks and plinston persuaded mccann to smuggle hashish into ireland from kabul which the pair would then ferry over to wales and into england mccann would get the drugs into ireland through the freeport at shannon airport using his ira connections marks avoided the attention of hm revenue and customs by creating a paper trail that indicated he made his money from selling stamps and dresses by  he was making £ with each shipment by the end of the year he was approached by hamilton mcmillan of the secret intelligence service mi a friend from oxford university who recruited marks to work for mi because of his connections in the hashishproducing countries of lebanon pakistan and afghanistan for his ability to seduce women and for his contacts with the ira the next year marks began exporting cannabis to the united states to the brotherhood of eternal love hiding the drugs in the music equipment of fictional british pop groups that were supposed to be touring the country he further expanded his operations with other smugglers and other methods of trafficking often using his oxford connections as mccann was in danger of being executed by the ira should mi tip them off about his involvement in drugs marks then gave up the smuggling operation at shannon airport following the littlejohn affair mi ceased their relationship with marks while his american operation came to an end after police opened a speaker full of cannabis and arrested gang member james gater leading to other arrests in europe marks was arrested by dutch police in  but skipped bail in april  the british press then made him a nationally known figure reporting that he was feared abducted by the ira for his connections with mi with most of his fortune confiscated by the authorities he made his way to italy where he lived in a winnebago for three months before returning to england in secret in october  at this point he began a relationship with judy lane the couple married in  and had three children together he had previously been in a fiveyear relationship with rosie lewis with whom he had a daughter marks then connected ernie combs member of the brotherhood of eternal love with john denbigh a man with connections in the hashishproducing nation of nepal with the help of the yakuza large quantities of the drug would be exported to john f kennedy international airport in the guise of air conditioning equipment where don browns mob headed by carmine galante would then take possession of the drugs a kilo deal was set up and executed on  july  leaving marks a wealthy man other deals up to  kilos followed and marks continued to live under assumed names in the united kingdom in  he travelled to america and set up a kilo deal between combs and lebanese sam – making himself £ in the process he continued to regularly set up deals between his various american and far east connections in need of a new identity after his alias of anthony tunnicliffe was compromised in a police sting in  he bought donald nices passport between  and  twentyfour loads totalling  pounds of marijuana and hashish had been successfully imported through john f kennedy airport new york they had involved the mafia the yakuza the brotherhood of eternal love the thai army the palestine liberation organization the pakistani armed forces nepalese monks and other individuals from all walks of life the total profit made by all concerned was  theyd had a good run — marks concluding the jfk episode of drug trafficking in his mr nice autobiography the run had ended after the drug enforcement administration dea began intercepting the drugs and arresting mafia associates in new york in the late s the trafficante crime family under the leadership of santo trafficante jr were importing colombian cannabis into the us on freighter ships thus driving down the price of the drug on the streets in america in december  trafficante exported  tons of cannabis direct from colombia to marks and his contacts in the uk enough to supply the entire british market for the drug for almost a year in  marks was arrested by customs officers for his part in importing £ million of cannabis police had followed associates of the trafficante family to a large stash of cannabis when arrested he was in possession of numerous pieces of incriminating evidence as well as £ in cash defended by lord hutchinson marks pleaded not guilty concocting a story that he was an agent for mi concealing the fact that his relation with mi ended in  and the mexican secret service that had set up an identity as a drug smuggler in order to close the net on james mccann wanted in britain for his ira activities the jury found him innocent of drug smuggling but guilty of using false passports and marks was sentenced to two years imprisonment but was released after five days having already served most of this time before sentencing was passed hm customs then arrested him for his part of a  smuggling operation but following a plea bargain and time off for remission he served just three months of a threeyear sentence released in may  though with most of his employees still in prison for the crime marks was found innocent of he spent the next year running a legitimate wine importing business but he continued to spend more money than he was making and the savings he made from drug smuggling in the s began to dwindle in  mccann was still at large and his smuggling enterprise was flourishing he offered marks the chance to sell  kilos of cannabis and marks accepted dutch police confiscated the full shipment and arrested mickey williams a member of the london underworld who had agreed to help marks on the deal marks then travelled to the far east to set up cannabis deals with salim malik a pakistani hashish exporter who he had met through durrani durrani had since suffered a fatal heart attack and phil sparrowhawk an exporter from bangkok they would smuggle their product over to ernie combs in america he also arranged a kilo deal with mickey williams who had travelled to bangkok after his release from prison in amsterdam marks laundered his money through various fronts a travel agency a paper mill a wine importers a bulk water transportation company and a secretarial service in  he was approached to sell  worth of cannabis to a central intelligence agency cia agent looking to fund and arm the mujahideen in their war against the soviet occupation operation cyclone the agents contact on the apl ship suffered a heart attack and died on the journey to the us leaving the drugs in the hands of us officials the agent subsequently fled to brazil to avoid prosecution though under surveillance marks continued to expand his underworld operations and set up a massage parlour in a bangkok hotel with the help of phil sparrowhawk and lord moynihan in  he settled in majorca and continued to make vast sums smuggling salim maliks hashish into america the dea were meanwhile tapping markss phones and keeping him under surveillance and having arrested ernie combs they came close to busting a large shipment of cannabis when marks was tipped off the ship was redirected to mauritius and the operation aborted as he continued to avoid dea stings he continued to make millions and continued to add to his underworld contacts finding that he could use chinese triads to launder his drug money more effectively a philippinebrothelowning member of the house of lords moynihan was staying at the house of a spanish chief inspector of police rafael llofriu the lord was being watched by an american cia operative who was staying at the house of an english convicted sex offender jim hobbs the cia operative was sharing accommodation with an ira terrorist mccann the ira terrorist was discussing a moroccan hashish deal with a georgian pilot of colombias medellín cartel organising these scenarios was an exmi agent marks currently supervising the sale of thirty tons of thai weed in canada and at whose house could be found pakistans major supplier of hashish malik attempting to understand the scenarios was a solitary dea agent the stage was set for something — the deas efforts to apprehend marks were made extremely difficult thanks to the many wideranging contacts marks had in september  many of these contacts were with marks in palma when friends of his were busted by the royal canadian mounted police marks decided to retire from drug smuggling to concentrate on his legitimate businesses citing the fate of his friends and contacts who were either in jail informing the dea or smuggling heavier drugs in  dea agent craig lovato arrested both howard and judy marks and extradited the couple to the united states arrests of those involved in markss various criminal activities were made in britain spain the philippines thailand the netherlands pakistan switzerland the united states and canada this was the work of operation eclectic set up in  by both the dea and scotland yard and aided by numerous law enforcement organisations from around the world trial and imprisonmentedit marks was taken from palma to modelo prison in barcelona and then to alcalameco in madrid there he was handed a page document which detailed the allegations of his drug smuggling activities between  and  charging him with operating a racket as described in the rico act in his autobiography marks stated that although the charge against judy and some others were absurd the formal accusations against me in general terms were true the recently passed sentencing reform act meant that he was facing a minimum of ten years to a maximum life sentence without the possibility for parole the audiencia nacional ordered his extradition to florida after being shown the prosecution evidence against him marks attempted to construct the defence that his smuggling operations were directed to australia and that he never exported to the united states and therefore never broke us law he again cultivated the myth that he was a spy for mi and claimed that he was set up by the cia because he had discovered that cia agents were smuggling drugs into australia he and his lawyers spent hours reviewing the phone tapping evidence to make the coded conversations about smuggling into america seem to suggest that the drugs were actually being smuggled into australia research was done into weather patterns to prove tentative links between what was said by marks and his associates and what was happening at the time in australia marks and his wife were extradited in  and he was given the miranda rights on the flight from spain to the us in florida judy pleaded guilty to her small part in the racket and was released having already served some months in prison in spain the money marks made from his smuggling operations was spent on legal fees he refused to pleabargain or to inform on his associates gambling that he could again convince a jury that the authorities had got the wrong man as the trial began in july  peter lane his brotherinlaw and fellow smuggler wrote to marks to inform him that he was going to testify against marks in court to get a more lenient sentence himself marks still was confident of beating the dea in court but ernie combs also agreed to testify for the prosecution so as to secure the release of his wife and marks had little choice but to change his plea to guilty to racketeering charges he was sentenced to  years in jail and given a  fine though he had originally been sentenced to  years he was taken back into court after the judge realised he had misspoken and said that his  and year sentences were to run consecutively and not as he had originally stated concurrently he spent seven years imprisoned in the federal correctional complex terre haute indiana a rough prison he had originally been sentenced to butner but agent lovato insisted that he instead serve time at terre haute one of the six most secure prisons in the country terre haute had the worst reputation of the six for gang rape and violence despite this marks remained on good terms with the many violent inmates housed there as he was british and a famous nonrat and avoided conflict by being nice charming and eccentric during his time there he befriended many notorious criminals and members of four of the reputed five families including gennaro gerry lang langella colombo crime family james jimmy c coonan john johnny carnegs carneglia vittorio little vic amuso and frank frankie loc locascio gambino crime family anthony bruno indelicato bonanno crime family and joey testa lucchese crime family he also made friends with veronza bowers jr black panther party and big jim of the outlaw motorcycle club owing to his status as an oxford university graduate with alleged connections to the british secret intelligence service he was treated as a potential escapee and spent many weeks in solitary confinement though he never attempted to escape or threatened other prisoners or prison staff during his time in prison he found success as a jailhouse lawyer for the other inmates securing one overturned conviction he gave up cigarettes for the last three years of his sentence in january  marks was granted parole after a prison officer

optionspaint attempting to restain reface or complete replacement  of medium walnut raised panel kitchen cabinets that are in good condition otherwise there are problems with each option mentioned in kitchen rehab often horror stories on the net so i gave this product a try didnt have much to lose as the finish was deteriorating in various areas especially around the sink and cutlery drawer i used the restorer in combination with the  steel wool and finished with the howard polish my wife final judge said the cabinets look like they did years agoeven in areas where the poly varnish was flaking off i think the steel wool helps smooth these flaking areas the cabinets have an even color nonblotchy appearance exceeded my expectations that this was a glorified old english treatment relatively

memo is posted  lines in the sand   memo to oaktree clients from howard marks re lines in the sand latest memo from howard marks lines in the sand in my  yearend review which went only to clients i included a discussion of the use of subscription lines by closedend funds in areas such as private equity real estate distressed debt and private credit  it’s my impression that their use has become fairly pervasive in recent years and in response to clients’ requests and market trends oaktree has utilized subscription lines in some of its newer funds    that yearend note prompted some interesting and spirited discussion of lines and their merit and effect  thus i decided to write this memo on the topic for general circulation   how do subscription lines work as i wrote in the yearend review subscription lines are bank loans extended to funds that enable them to use borrowed money rather than lp capital to make early investments or pay fees and expenses  while there is no universal description i believe it’s safe to say in general that subscription lines   are limited as a percentage of the lps’ capital commitmentscommitments from the most creditworthy lps earn a  advance rate and commitments from lesser credits earn lower advance rates or in some cases zero are secured by the lps’ capital commitments and generally must be repaid in the early or middle part of the fund’s life unless extended although terms are beginning to lengthen   the key element is that a subscription line can substitute for lp capital but it can’t be used to allow the fund to invest more than its committed capital  that is a  million fund with a subscription line might be able to buy  million of assets without calling lp capital but it still can’t invest more than  million in total other than by recycling proceeds from liquidated investments  the bottom line is that essentially all subscription line financing does is defer the calling of lp capital   so the starting point for this discussion is the fact that these lines lever lp capital but do not lever funds in the sense of allowing funds to invest more than their committed capital  fundlevel debt that allows funds to invest more than their committed capital is different from subscription lines and not my subject here what are the effects since a subscription line doesn’t lever a fund its use doesn’t increase the total dollar profits that the fund will earn from investments over its lifetime assuming the gp makes the same investments that it would have made if the fund didn’t have a line   also the use of a subscription line – obviously – doesn’t alter the fund’s committed or invested capital  thus assuming all lp capital eventually is drawn the fund’s ratio of distributions to lp capital – either the multiple of committed capital mocc or the multiple of invested capital moc – isn’t improved by the use of a line   so much for what isn’t changed  the question then is “what is”  first the positives   the original purpose of subscription lines was a to enable gps to make investments and pay fund fees and expenses without frequent capital calls and b to prevent opportunistic funds that don’t sit on large amounts of cash from missing out on attractive investments requiring quick fundingmore recently however their use has grown for the additional reasons discussed below   with calls for lp capital postponed the reported internal rate of return or irr in the early years – the dollarweighted return on lp capital – will increase substantially assuming the early profits exceed the interest and expenses on the line   the use of borrowed money can reduce or even eliminate the deleterious impact on early returns of the socalled “jcurve”the jcurve results from a the fact that in a fund’s early years management fees are usually charged on total committed capital while a relatively small percentage of the capital has been put to work and b the tendency of private investments to take a while to show results   over the course of a fund’s life lp capital will typically be called for investments or to repay the borrowings under the subscription line this will cause the ratio of subscription line capital employed to lp capital to decline as a result the fund’s irr will retreat from its elevated early level and move down toward what it would have been if the fund hadn’t employed a subscription line however all other things being equal the fund’s lifetime irr will remain higher than it otherwise would have been since the impact of using the line will taper off but not reverse   finally any committed capital that hasn’t been called because of borrowing under the line will remain in the hands of the lpsthus any return the lps earn on the uncalled capital in excess of their share of the fund’s subscription line costs will be additive to their results   what about the negatives   if a fund finances investments by borrowing under a subscription line interest and expenses will be paid that wouldn’t have been paid if lp capital had been called insteadthe payment of these costs even with interest rates below libor is a permanent net negative for the fund since the fund isn’t becoming levered it won’t be offset by an increase in dollar profits see abovethus it eats into the fund’s dollar lifetime gains as well as its multiple of capital   some lps may actually want to have their capital called and earn their preferred return  that will jibe with their expectations and preserve the historic hurdle for incentive fees  the preferred return that must be earned before the gp receives incentive fees is calculated based on how much lp capital has been called and for how long it has remained outstanding  thus the use of a subscription line in lieu of lp capital shrinks the dollar preferred return hurdle  lowering the hurdle can increase the gp’s probability of collecting incentive fees and cause the payment of incentive fees to the gp to begin sooner although it will have no effect on the amount of incentive fees ultimately paid by a fund that would easily have cleared the percentage hurdle rate if it hadn’t used a line  at the same time however the interest and expenses paid on the line will reduce the fund’s lifetime net dollar gains and thus the eventual amount of incentive fees received by the gp  the interaction of these effects can be complex    less disciplined or less diligent gps may be induced to lower the standards to which they subject investments because a their effective cost of capital seems so low andor b they perceive an increased likelihood that the reported irr will exceed the preferred return hurdle and thus a greater potential to earn incentive fees   some lps seek to avoid socalled unrelated business taxable income “ubti”without getting into further details suffice it to say the use of subscription lines increases the risk of ubti to these lps   since each lp’s commitment to the fund is an essential part of the bank’s collateral the existence of a line could conceivably complicate the process of selling an lp interest in a secondary transaction in particular if the wouldbe buyer is less creditworthy   as the use of subscription lines increases many banks are requiring greater and more intrusive information on the financial wherewithal of fund lps to ensure the sufficiency of collateralsome lps are now starting to push back on providing this information while others are expressly demanding to be excluded from borrowings which can create an awkward dynamic among the lps and between the lps and gp   given the existence of so many pros and cons what factors have caused the use of subscription lines to become widespread  i believe they’re these   for lps the desire for high reported irrs better cash management including fewer drawdowns and the potential to use their capital more efficiently ie to use undrawn capital to make investments that may add to overall profits        for gps the expectation that higher irrs will enhance their reputations and enable them to raise more money the potential to lower the hurdle that must be cleared before incentive fees are received the ability to enhance reported results in a lowreturn world or mask otherwiselow investment returns and defensively a way to be competitive with other gps who raise irrs through the use of lines impact on fund performance metrics the most important question in assessing fund performance is clear  did the gp do a good job  it’s a simple question but answering it is anything but  in particular if a fund that used a subscription line shows a high irr does that confirm that the gp did a good job    since a fund’s total dollar profits and multiple of capital aren’t improved by the use of a subscription line the increase in irr while pleasant might be thought of as illusory  remember as i wrote in a  memo with the same title you can’t eat irr   my basic point in that memo was that what really matters is how much money an lp makes as a result of having committed to a fund  it’s that simple   but the deeper message was that while valuable neither irr nor mocc nor moc – nor any other single metric – is sufficient to tell us whether the gp did a good job  there are many elements that must be taken into account and if you hold all the others equal one metric might be sufficient to answer the question  but the others rarely are equal  for example   a high irr certainly is desirable but that’s what a fund can show if the gp makes only one investment with a small fraction of the fund’s committed capital and that investment produces a substantial profitfor example if a  million fund invests  million in something and sells it a month later for  million that doubling will annualize to an irr of roughly and if that’s the only investment the gp makes that’ll be the fund’s irr toobut it certainly doesn’t mean the gp did a good job – i doubt the lp who committed  million to the fund will be happy with  million back in the end   to understand what an irr really says about fund performance you have to know what percentage of the capital was called and how long the gp held onto it  in short lps want to see their committed capital become fully invested and remain invested at solid rates of return for a long time  that’s the formula for a big gain  a high return earned on a small amount of capital for a brief period doesn’t help in that regard  high annualized irrs on investments of less than a year can be especially misleading   a big multiple of invested capital is good toobut it also may be of limited significancelet’s say the gp of that  million fund invests  million keeps it invested for the fund’s entire tenyear life and earns an annual return of  on that investmentthat will result in proceeds of  million and thus an moc of xthat’s great for the lps    as far as it goesbut if that’s the only investment the gp makes the lps collectively will earn profits of only  million certainly not what they had in mind when they committed  million to the fundso again to know if the gp did a good job you have to know what percentage of the committed capital was invested and how long the investment was outstandingyou have to know what the gp did with the entire commitment not just the part that was invested   finally a big multiple of committed capital sounds almost perfectbut it too isn’t sufficientlet’s say all of the fund’s  million of committed capital is invested and  million comes back to lps for an mocc of xthat’s good isn’t itthat depends on how long the gp kept that  millionif it took six years to turn  million into  million the irr on the fund is but if it took ten years to generate the same proceeds and mocc the irr is just so it’s not enough to know how much capital was invested and how much was returnedwe have to know how long the process took   the answer is simple  in order to be able to assess fund performance we have to know   how much capital was committed how much capital was invested how long it was kept invested and how much was returned to lps   irr mocc and moc are all significant indicators but none of them takes all four of those parameters into consideration  thus no single metric is sufficient to tell us how good a job a gp did  we have to consider multiple metrics and sometimes they will give conflicting answers  fund a may look better on one of them and fund b on another  so this is really just one more way in which investing isn’t subject to easy answers  performance assessment requires consulting a variety of performance metrics considering other factors as well some of which are subjective  like how risky the portfolio was and making judgments regarding the results    one fund with a higher irr didn’t necessarily outperform another  and provocatively a fund that used a subscription line and came in with a high irr may not have done as good a job – or made its lps as much money – as one that didn’t use a line or used a line less extensively and reported a lower irr       let’s take that to its logical extreme  what if the typical race to the bottom happens at the banks making financing available on evereasier terms  what if we reach a point where gps are able to obtain lines equal in size to the vast majority of their lps’ commitments and keep the borrowings outstanding for most of the funds’ life  in that case there will be little need for a gp to draw lp capital and even low returns on investments could give rise to ultrahigh irrs at the fund level  the bottom line on all this is that the use of subscription lines sheds considerable doubt on the significance of irr  and when irr becomes suspect anyone wanting to evaluate fund results has no choice but to put greater emphasis on the multiple of capital bigger questions all the above discussion is essentially mechanical regarding matters of arithmetic  but there are other questions surrounding subscription lines that involve investment risk and some that have bigger consequences    even potentially systemic    investments are invariably viewed as safe when it is assumed that the things that should happen will happen  but i always hasten to point out that “should” isn’t the same as “will”   let’s consider the process that’s supposed to apply with subscription line borrowings   the gp organizes a fund and arranges for a subscription line lps commit capital the lps put in an actual or virtual lockbox the funds they’ll need when capital is called the gp uses borrowings under the subscription line to pay for investments in lieu of calling lp capital when the subscription line reaches its end lp capital is called and the line is repaid   that’s what’s supposed to happen  but there are ways in which actual events can deviate from that idealized progression  most of these would be the result of negative developments in the financial markets or the larger world   since the use of subscription lines results in there being fewer but larger capital calls the magnitude of potential defaults by lps is increased along with the potential consequences   suppose the fund makes  million of investments against an lp’s  million commitment – borrowing  million on the line – and there’s a financial crisis or the investments simply turn out to be big losers and those investments decline in value to  millionand suppose the line comes due the fund calls  million from the lp with which to repay it and the lp – perhaps receiving simultaneous capital calls from a number of similarly affected managers – concludes it’s in its best interest or its fiduciary duty to not put up  million to secure investments now worth  millioninstead it defaults on the capital call depriving the fund of capital potentially limiting the fund’s ability to repay the line andor make further investments and thereby possibly harming the remaining lpsplease note however that strategic defaults are an extreme hypothetical since they would expose lps to penalties lawsuits and the forfeiture of their assets in the fund in addition to the obvious reputational consequences   some funds although none of oaktree’s rely on subscription lines that are due on demand rather than at the end of a stated termwhat would be the effect if a large number of those lines were pulled simultaneously during a financial crisisor what if regulators required banks to call in their lines even those that aren’t callable or whose terms haven’t expired   there’s no question that the increasing use of subscription lines is altering the pattern of drawdowns and distributionsgoing years without seeing much capital called could convince an lp that calls have become less likelysuppose that in response rather than set aside capital equal to its commitments the lp puts it into other investmentsalthough subscription lines don’t result in funds becoming levered this kind of behavior can result in the lp becoming levered ie having total investments plus commitments that exceed its available capitalnow suppose a financial crisis brings large losses to fund investments in generalif the lp has made excess commitments it could a suffer levered losses and b be forced to liquidate marketable securities in a crisis to satisfy capital calls in connection with their commitments to closedend fundstaken to a hopefully unrealistic extreme could this cause lps to become insolvent and banks to experience a wave of defaults on these lines   market meltdowns and financial crises can increase the probability that banks will recall lines and decrease the probability that all lps will meet the calls  if an lp has taken advantage of subscription line financing to become more than  committed it might be more likely to default on the calls   if a fund has diversified commitment sources and just a couple of lps default the fund will probably manage just fine  but suppose many lps default  in that circumstance it’s easy to imagine a fund being forced to sell assets during a market downturn to pay off its line andor lacking the capital it thought it would have with which to take advantage of market opportunities  both outcomes could be very negative for funds and lps alike   the obligations of the lps in a fund with a subscription line are interrelated for example one lp’s default on its capital commitment requires the other lps to contribute more up to the amount of their commitment to repay the subscription line  could this mean that failures by some lps would increase the likelihood of failures by others  in the extreme if defaults on lines are widespread could lines become a source of significant risk to banks   in order to figure out the full impact of the use of subscription lines one would have to know what lps do with the uncalled capital during the period before it’s drawn by the funds  it does seem however that subscription lines may be adding to risk at a variety of levels   these hypothetical examples imagine financial crises asset meltdowns and – in some cases – lessthanconservative behavior on the part of lps  they’re all unlikely  but are they impossible  it’s mostly during crises that weaknesses are exposed things that are supposed to happen fail to do so and unanticipated consequences and linkages manifest themselves   as i mentioned at the outset some oaktree funds have made use of subscription lines in recognition of the advantages described above and because many of our lps – almost all of which are sophisticated institutional investors capable of understanding how lines work and their pros and cons – have indicated that they want us to do so  however i can report that the concerns discussed above have caused us to begin an internal process to develop guidelines intended to mitigate the risks of subscription lines while preserving their benefits    the key to financial security – individual or societal – doesn’t lie in counting on things to work in good times or on average  rather it consists of figuring out what can go wrong in bad times and of only doing things that will prove survivable even if they materialize  has anyone thought through all the implications of closedend funds’ increasing use of subscription lines  are they all tolerable for the individual parties and for the financial system  i haven’t read much on this subject but we should

easy way to refresh our kitchen and bathroom cabinets thought id try this product after looking for something that might do the job started in one of the bathrooms and was very pleased i tend to be a bit skeptical of things that seem too easy so ive done a bit more prep work than the directions call for after all our cabinets show every bit of their  years of age and use i used a verssiion of scotchbrite abrasive pads though with a finer abrasive level these can be found at some hardwarestores or on line after pulling the doors off the hinges and removed all hardware then carefull cleaned everything very well then went over the outer surfaces with an extra fine maroon pad paying particular attention to the corners and details etc wiped them down with a damp cloth and gave them another breif session with ultra fine beige pads then after cleaning the dust off again and giving them a good  minutes to dry used the beige pad to apply the howard product fairly liberaly and keeping the pad wet after letting it soak in for  minutes or so wiped them off with a clean rag old tshirt and after another  minutes repeated another coat of howards and wiped it off this time almost imeadiatly  i wanted to avoid darkening the cabinets too much after waiting overnite i put the cabinets back together and gave them a coat of paste wax  they look very good even the worst areas of the cabinets under the kitchen sink look good not quite like new but close to it great product i on using it on some interior doors and woodwork as well big improvment for not a lot of work and not a lot of money
