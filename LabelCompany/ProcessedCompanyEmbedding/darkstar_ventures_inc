consolidated financial statements unaudited   note   going concern   the company has not commenced planned principal operations the company had an accumulated deficit of  as of january   in addition the company continues to have negative cash flows from operations these factors raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   there can be no assurance that sufficient funds required during the next year or thereafter will be generated from operations or that funds will be available from external sources such as debt or equity financings or other potential sources the lack of additional capital resulting from the inability to generate cash flow from operations or to raise capital from external sources would force the company to substantially curtail or cease operations and would therefore have a material adverse effect on its business furthermore there can be no assurance that any such required funds if available will be available on attractive terms or that they will not have a significant dilutive effect on the company’s existing stockholders   the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability or classification of assetcarrying amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that may result should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   note   newly

or other comparable terminology these statements are only predictions and involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause our or our industry ’ s actual results levels of activity performance or achievements to be materially different from any future results levels of activity performance or achievements expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements   corporate background and business overview   we were incorporated on may   in the state of nevada we are a development stage company that was originally established to offer ecofriendly health and wellness products to the general public via the internet as we had previously disclosed on november   we entered into a binding letter of intent “loi” with real aesthetic inc a nevada corporation “real aesthetic” to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock in exchange for common stock of the company the closing of the transactions contemplated by the loi was subject to the completion of the due diligence investigation of both parties execution and delivery of documentation for the transaction consents from the respective boards of directors of both companies and any third parties and the delivery of audited financial statements by real aesthetic subsequently we decided not to pursue the contemplated transaction with real aesthetic the company has since abandoned its business plan    the registrant has recently determined through its recently established whollyowned new israeli subsidiary bengio urban renewals ltd to focus its limited resources in the area of real estate development particularly focusing on the urban renewal market in israel we believe based upon the current real estate market in israel that urban renewal projects present an opportunity for us to generate revenues and profits which we have never experienced since our inception  the basis for our belief is that in several major israeli cities there is virtually no more room to grow as a result several municipal governments have allowed older buildings to be renovated thereby giving their respective cities the opportunity to develop new apartments to be added to or replacing existing buildings    additionally municipalities have express their concern that many buildings constructed before  will be unable to withstand earthquakes in israel very few apartment buildings are owned by a single person or entity and since the majority of apartments within buildings are privately owned the burden to renovate buildings in order to render them safer in the event of a major earthquake primarily falls on the multiple owners of various apartment buildings and complexes    “tama ” is an israeli national zoning plan whereby a contractor assumes the responsibility of renovating an apartment building in exchange for covering all costs of renovations securing building permits and paying requisite taxes the contractor has is granted the right to build additional floors to the existing building and sell the apartments built on these floors    the apartment owners benefit by receiving a modernized building strengthened against earthquakes as well as the additional apartments added to their buildings in some cases balconies storage rooms parking spaces and elevators may be added as well further enhancing the building’s value   “pinuibinui” projects are defined as development where the residents of apartments are temporarily evacuated so that the buildings may be demolished and rebuilt  the tenants then return to new apartments in the newly finished and renovated building  the contractor pays all costs for demolition construction relocating apartment owners and renting their temporary homes during construction  in exchange the contractor adds new apartments in the building which are sold to generate profit             as with “tama ” the value of the apartments in the building is increased thereby benefitting the owners and the tenants return to a new often larger and safer apartment in a building often with more amenities   since february  the registrant’s board of directors authorized the establishment of a new  whollyowned israeli subsidiary bengio urban renewals ltd “bengio urban” to focus its limited resources in the area of real estate development particularly focusing on the urban renewal market in israel to that end the registrant raised  from the sale of restricted shares to investors to fund the new real estate development operations of bengio urban which has recently hired employees and has signed contracts with the current tenants of three buildings who have agreed to vacate the buildings so that they can be redeveloped into modern state of the art new residential buildings    on february   the board of directors of the company and the holder of a majority of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock of the company the majority consenting stockholder together executed a joint written consent to authorize and approve a certificate of amendment to the companys articles of incorporation to increase the authorized capital stock of the company from  shares the capital stock consisting of  shares of common stock par value  the common stock and  shares of preferred stock par value  the preferred stock to an authorized capital stock of the corporation of  shares consisting of  shares of common stock and five million  shares of preferred stock it was also decided that the board of directors shall have the authority to establish one or more series of preferred stock and fix relative rights and preferences of any series of preferred stock without any further action or approval of our stockholders      other than our current director and officer we have no employees january     transfer agent   we have engaged vstock transfer llc  spruce street suite  cedarhurst ny  as our stock transfer agent their telephone number is   and their fax number is   the transfer agent is responsible for all recordkeeping and administrative functions in connection with our issued and outstanding common stock    results of operations   results of operations for the six months ended january     the company did not generate any revenues from operations for the six months ended january     during the six months ended january   the operating expenses and the net loss was  and  respectively the operating expenses and net loss was primarily the result of professional fees legal auditing and other consulting fees associated with sec compliance and operating expenses in the subsidiary from its commencement of its business activities    we expect to continue to incur significant operating expenses as a result we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve profitability which may not occur even if we do achieve profitability we may be unable to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future    liquidity and capital resources   our cash balance as of january   was  the company is currently seeking to raise additional equity thru private placements to enable the continuation of its current tama  business plan
