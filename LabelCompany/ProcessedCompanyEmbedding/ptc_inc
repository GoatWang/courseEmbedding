computeraided design software helps with the creation modification analysis and documentation of product designs why cad software this technology makes product design more efficient by automating processes that were once manual such as traditional drafting with d cad designers can also do solid modeling creating threedimensional representations of their products but cad isnt just about convenience or bells and whistles broadly speaking cad software helps you explore concept design ideas create product designs carry out simulations and analyses and perform engineering calculations in other words cad software assists you with the experimentation exploration and iteration needed to make the most of your designs potential the overarching goal better products produced more efficiently and at less cost so that you get your products to market faster we’re proud of the fact that ptc invented and first launched parametric cad modeling software nearly  years ago today product development professionals worldwide use our flagship cad software suite creo   why creo creo is a suite of applications you can use to design products the way you want – not the way your cad tool requires with creo you can create analyze view and share designs downstream using d cad d cad parametric and direct modeling capabilities each creo application shares the same user interface and is interoperable meaning data can seamlessly transition from one to another what creo’s cad software can do for you d design its all here from the basics of part and assembly modeling to mechanisms to aesthetic surface design industrial design take advantage of technical surfacing capabilities advanced surfacing rendering and reverse engineering concept design explore innovative product development opportunities with the most powerful concept design tools on the market including freeform surfacing integrated parametric and direct modeling and more routed systems design easily create d schematic designs and documentation for piping cabling and harnesses and then use them to drive the associated d cad models simulation analyze and validate the performance of your d cad designs before you make

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
