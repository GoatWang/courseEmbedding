follymarket folly this is the th quarter  edition of our ongoing hedge fund portfolio tracking series before reading this update make sure you check out the hedge fund f filings prefacethis week turning the focus to global macro funds well be checking in on louis bacons moore capital management do note that global macro funds are typically not necessarily equity focused funds while they do indeed have equity exposure the majority of their holdings are in other markets so we mainly track them to check in on their sector exposure to see what types of global macro themes they may be investing in this is a switch from some of the more value oriented funds weve been covering like the tiger cub funds including stephen mandels lone pine capital lee ainslies maverick capital john griffins blue ridge capital and andreas halvorsens viking global global macro funds seek to find investments in whatever market they can gain an edge whether it be equities bonds currencies debt commodities and more but they are only required to disclose equity holdingslouis bacon comes from the group of offspring of the legendary commodities corporation moore emerged as a successful offspring along with fellow great macro traders bruce kovner caxton associates and paul tudor jones tudor investment corp moore named after bacons middle name is a  billion global macro set of hedge funds louis bacon is a famed trader and risk manager and interestingly enough bacon helped get his firm off the ground when paul tudor jones stopped accepting capital from investors and instead turned them to bacons firm returning  annually since inception in  bacon can be very proud of his flagship fund moore global investments but it doesnt stop there his returns have shown little correlation to the stock market and low volatility he is the definition of a risk manager for  their global investments fund finished  their global fixed income fund finished  and their emerging markets fund finished  as noted in our comprehensive list of hedge fund performance numbersbacon credits his risk management skills to the futures markets where he learned to be sensitive to market action and he learned such skills at an early age while getting his mba at columbia he used his student loan money to trade and he lost it all clearly he learned a lesson he would never forget such a lesson stuck with him as he worked various jobs in the financial industry before eventually starting his own firm and in his first year managing moore capital management he returned  bacon strives to identify long running macro trends while he has a longerterm macroeconomic view he wont let that stop him from making money by trading around the position in the mean time if you want to hear some insightful thoughts from louis bacon himself head over to our post on hedge fund manager interviewsmany successful members of moore have gone on to start their own funds for instance we track bret baraketts tremblant capital who learned his trade at moore also its worth pointing out that stanley shopkorn formerly of moore capital has started his own fund additionally we recently learned that christopher pia another moore alum will be starting his own fund but enough about those who have gone on to do their own thing lets check out what moore was up tothe following were their long equity note and
