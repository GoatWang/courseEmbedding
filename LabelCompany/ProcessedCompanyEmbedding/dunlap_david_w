guggenheim of groceriesby david w dunlap photowilliam n breger with a model of his helical supermarket of the scredit robert walkerthe new york times william n breger who designed what may be the oddest synagogue in new york has died at  the tribeca synagogue was not his wackiest idea however that would have been a circular automated guggenheimlike supermarket in  mr breger was commissioned by the daitchshopwell chain now food emporium to design a supermarket of the ’s — “where shopping will be fast and fun” shoppers would be whisked by elevator to the top of a sevenlevel helix and receive markers with code numbers a moving sidewalk would take them down the ramps past every item daitch had to offer they had merely to step off the sidewalk whenever they saw something they wanted and mark it with their code the marked items would be sent independently down conveyor belts at the bottom of the helix shoppers would pay through an automated device and get a receipt that could be exchanged for the goods at a pickup point in the parking lot fun maybe the first time fast maybe never daitchshopwell executives said any resemblance to frank lloyd wright’s newly opened guggenheim museum was

dark waters of a small pond here is where bird week and building blocks meet at the queens zoo aviary a geodesic dome constructed  years ago as the seat world’s fair pavilion transformed for the  fair into the churchill center and then moved a halfmile west to serve as a birdhouse for the zoo which opened in  bird week a weeklong celebration of avian life in new york city see all » bird forecast » apps and resources » there may not be as many twists to its story as there are facets on its semispherical aluminum frame but there are plenty enough the latest is the question of who gets credit for the dome one of the most resilient handsome and purposeful of the generally odd lot of world’s fair pavilions for years it has been attributed to r buckminster fuller the designer and inventor most closely associated with geodesic domes these lightweight structures composed of tubular struts arranged in triangles and polygons can be assembled quickly to span great volumes at relatively little expense it is fuller’s name that appears on a sign at the entrance to the aviary but a littleknown architect thomas c howard  of raleigh nc seems to have had a lot more to do with it he was the president of synergetics inc in raleigh which held the contract for the dome eggers  higgins of new york designed the rest of the building these firms proved to be life savers william whipple jr chief engineer of the fair said the budget for the pavilion which served as the fair’s assembly hall had originally been set at  million but when the first design was put out for bids in  none came in for less than  million “with opening day only a year away” mr whipple wrote in the june  issue of civil engineering magazine “all bids were rejected and an entirely new concept was sought that would fulfill the same requirements but cost not more than half as much after a rapid examination of various unorthodox alternatives it was decided to use as the roof a geodesic dome” the revised design cost  the pavilion was finished just in time on jan   between the fair’s two seasons sir winston churchill died revered in the united states as the british prime minister who stood up to nazi germany in the most hopeless hours of world war ii churchill seemed to be a natural subject for a new attraction photothe dome when it was part of the churchill pavilion at the  worlds faircredit bill cotter within the dome philip george designed an exhibit centered on a reproduction of the study at chartwell churchill’s country home paintings by churchill and his special passport as an honorary american citizen were among the displays the tribute was not without a marketing strategy the  season had not been nearly as popular or lucrative as officials had hoped so they scrambled to find ways to entice visitors who had avoided the fair before and to lure back those who had already seen it even before the fair reopened in  the dome was being envisioned as a prospective birdhouse the transformation including the addition of an elevated walkway at treetop level was designed by clarke  rapuano and andrews  clark the aviary an open enclosure under wire mesh was plagued by problems including malevolent visitors who grabbed birds or threw stones at them after being closed for many years it reopened in  renovated by mark k morrison landscape architecture katrina howard fairley is now lobbying to ensure that her father mr howard is recognized as the original designer in the long list of architects involved with the building those responsible for maintaining mr fuller’s legacy said her assertions may have merit the executive director of the buckminster fuller institute in brooklyn elizabeth thompson said mr fuller lectured globally about geodesic domes on which he held patents and sent business to companies like synergetics composed of his followers jaime l snyder mr fuller’s grandson and coexecutor of the estate of r buckminster fuller in santa barbara calif said “the synergetics inc story is important history which needs to be told” speaking of his famous grandfather mr snyder said “i know he thought very highly of mr howard’s skills — once commenting to me that he was one of the persons who best understood his geodesic design principles we simply have never been privy to any documentation about the world’s fair pavilion nor other synergetics inc designs that would shed any light on this matter” where the pavilion once stood — opposite the festival of gas — there is now the buzz vollmer playground named for arnold h vollmer an engineer and landscape architect the playground was designed by johansson  walcavage at least that’s what the sign says sept  and ground zero apr   apr   scholarly perspectives on inscription at the  memorial museumby david w dunlap photoan excerpt from the loeb classical library edition of aeneidcredit “no day shall erase you from the memory of time” says the inscription on the repository of unidentified remains at the national september  memorial museum which opens next month the line — “nulla dies umquam memori vos eximet aevo” — is taken from virgil’s “aeneid” in which “you” are not nameless numberless innocent citizens but two bloodthirsty young trojan soldiers the times asked a few classicists to share their thoughts about the appropriateness of this quotation here are three responses photohelen moralescredit spencer bruttig ucsb helen morales professor of classics university of california santa barbara one way of looking at it is this if we take into account its original context the quotation is more applicable to the aggressors in the  tragedy than to those honored by the memorial after all nisus and euryalus were on what became a suicide mission before their inevitable deaths they were high on killing the enemy virgil’s line memorializing them is ironic so my first reaction is that the quotation is shockingly inappropriate for the us victims of the  attack but my second reaction is that this may be a productive irony which is to say that the quotation makes us remember the suicidal killers of  as well as their victims remember with horror anger disbelief to be sure but remember them nonetheless and wonder as might virgil’s readers have wondered of nisus and euryalus what drives young men to commit such atrocities this may not be the intention of the designers of the memorial who quite probably have used virgil as a rentaquote latin author but monuments often exceed the expectations of their creators read more… buildings and landmarks aug   aug   a flashlight’s peek inside a sculptor’s masterpieceby david w dunlap video conserving a general and his horse the reporter david w dunlap visits the monument of gen william tecumseh sherman a decorated civil war hero at the southeast corner of central park by axel gerdau on publish date august   embed it is fifth avenue’s most exclusive space in one of its most public landmarks how exclusive no one has been inside since  and no one who has more than a inch waist can dream of getting inside that includes this reporter but the space is briefly open again for inspection allowing at least a peek inside with flashlights and mirrors “it looks like something from jules verne” said christopher j nolan the vice president for planning design and construction at the central park conservancy mr nolan is right the interior of the sherman monument at the southeast corner of central park — a sculptural masterpiece by augustus saintgaudens — really does look like something out of “ leagues under the sea” equal parts organic mechanical equine and steampunk the yearold monument at grand army plaza at fifth avenue and central park south is undergoing its first significant restoration since  this fall repaired and regilded it will be on view again a fourstory cocoon of scaffolding now surrounds the sculpture it affords a closeup view of gen william tecumseh sherman the union leader who marched through georgia believed war was hell and sat many hours for saintgaudens a winged victory whose horror suggests she knows at what price victories are won and a mount modeled on a highjumping show horse named ontario which the artist admired at madison square garden and on the horse of selene from the parthenon inside the cavity of the horse’s body under a flashlight’s glare one sees sinuous sections of cast bronze bolted together with such precision that the hairbreadth seams are almost invisible from the exterior without a flashlight pinpoints of daylight can be seen marking the location of weepholes — holes that were deliberately cut into the lower parts of the sculpture to allow rainwater and melted snow to drain out some holes have been blocked by iron pins that were used in the casting process but broke off over the years that was what matthew reiley was fishing for last week with a magnet attached to a slender telescoping rod mr reiley is the associate director of conservation at the central park conservancy which is responsible for maintaining all the park’s monuments statues and fountains as m c reiley he is also a sculptor in cast metal as he gingerly extracted a heavily rusted sixinchlong pin mr reiley said the sight of such detritus conjured the ghosts of the original fabricators “it’s a piece of junk” he said “but i’m in love as a foundryman it’s like we’re brothers” “the quality of this casting is unparalleled” mr reiley said a few feet away john harrigan a conservator for central park who is also a figurative sculptor in his own right was painstakingly welding and gently working the palm frond carried in victory’s left hand to strengthen the deteriorated junctures between leaves and stalk and then return the metal to its smooth slender profile “this is where art conservation and dentistry all meet” mr nolan said even the hatch into the interior invisible to any passerby has been molded to fit perfectly into the contours of the horse’s croup or rump ordinarily the hatch is covered by a bronze version of a crupper strap which runs from the saddle to a loop around the horse’s tail the crupper strap in the sherman monument can be unscrewed and pulled aside to allow the hatch door to be lifted off the artist’s attention to detail which bordered on the obsessive is everywhere evident the copyright notice on the left rear hoof is not just mcmiii but may mcmiii “he didn’t speak a lot about his art but he did say that because sculpture lasts so long it’s a crime to do anything but the very best” said henry j duffy the museum curator at the saintgaudens national historic site in cornish nh and an adviser to the conservancy on the sherman monument a bigger picture emerges from the sum of these details the sherman monument is surely one of the most glorious public sculptures in new york often overlooked because it is such a familiar sight lording it over the horsedrawn carriages pigeons tourists pigeons food vendors pigeons office workers and pigeons that crowd grand army plaza “saint gaudens thought it was the best work he ever did — and that’s saying a lot” mr duffy said that would place the sherman monument in the artist’s eyes ahead of such landmarks as the robert gould shaw memorial opposite the state house in boston and the adams memorial in the rock creek cemetery in washington “in that piece saintgaudens really brought the equestrian genre to another level” mr duffy said “the animal represents action the man represents intellect but then he adds allegory it brings us out of the ordinary and almost into the spiritual” building blocks jun   jun   landmarks in history of gay rights found and lostby david w dunlap photoa passerby read the new plaque at the church of the village

less money that they did back home running railroads driving trucks and repairing machinery mr catledge reported they had to cope with temperatures that ranged at least  degrees between desert floors and mountain passes they were isolated in their posts “and most onerous of all perhaps were the monotony and the lack of obvious connection with combat” mr catledge wrote mr sulzberger had been studying morale issues in the armed forces for two years he proposed a solution it turned out he said that camp lee in virginia possessed strong morale because its commanding officer a former newspaperman made it a priority to keep the troops informed “the enlisted personnel at camp lee understood they were in uniform because axis madmen had set out to overrun the world” meyer berger wrote

building blocks column he has worked at the times for  years stock brokerages had scarcely begun tossing ticker tape out of their windows at celebratory parades in lower manhattan when the practice came under withering criticism in the pages of the times a writer signed only as “an old native new yorker” complained  years ago that broadway had become “a dumping place” because of this “nuisance” bad enough that the trees in trinity churchyard were “decked with what looks like a collection of stringed rags” old native new yorker lamented mortal peril lurked too “it does not require much imagination to picture the possibility of a spirited horse being frightened by a bit of tape flashing unexpectedly across his eyes and a single plunge into the dense crowd usually pressing close to the edge of the sidewalk would be a pretty serious matter” despite this dire warning on may   tickertape parades survived real ticker tape however disappeared long ago leaving the ghost of an old native new yorker to rest soundly — we hope — during even the most clamorous parades looking back july    am july    am   here’s the pope where’s the paperdavid w dunlap david w dunlap is a metro reporter and writes the building blocks column he has worked at the times for  years it was a journalist’s dream for the first time in history the pope was coming to town it was a journalist’s nightmare the new york times wasn’t publishing on sept   editorial and clerical workers at the times belonging to the newspaper guild now called the newsguild went out on strike in a contract dispute over automation among other issues backed up by nine mechanical and production unions the guild effectively forced the newspaper’s management to suspend publication a m rosenthal known to all as abe was then metropolitan editor his deputy was arthur gelb as managers they reported to work during the strike spending day after day in the newsroom “staring out at a sea of empty desks” mr gelb wrote in his memoir “city room” and pope paul vi was due in new york on oct  to address the united nations — “the first time a pontiff would be setting foot in the new world” mr gelb added hoping that the strike might be settled in time mr rosenthal and mr gelb drew up an assignment list detailing who would cover what angle of this historic story but as oct  dawned the two sides in the labor dispute were far apart read more… looking back july    am july    am   life liberty and legibilitydavid w dunlap david w dunlap is a metro reporter and writes the building blocks column he has worked at the times for  years “he has plundered our seas ravaged our coasts burnt our towns and destroyed the lives of our people” the declaration of independence declares before concluding “a prince whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a tyrant is unfit to be the ruler of a free people” it’s thrilling language really and so i had made it my custom every fourth of july to take a few moments to read the declaration in its entirety on the back page of the a section in one of its finer traditions the times has set aside that valuable advertising space every year since  to display a facsimile of the founding document but in  i stumbled the challenge of discerning thcentury calligraphy had grown insurmountable or should i say “infurmountable” yes i was approaching my th birthday but it was more than my aging eyes i asked around the office no one could read the declaration photoa comparison of the  and  presentations of the declaration of independence show how a narrower page greatly diminished the size at which the facsimile could be reproducedcredit the chief culprit seemed to be the fact that the times is so much narrower now than it was in the s when it could truly be called a broadsheet at intervals over the years the width of newsprint rolls — what we used to mean when we said “web” — had shrunk and shrunk again the web equal in width to four pages side by side was once  inches it is now  inches each inch trimmed when multiplied over the millions of copies of the paper printed every year represented a tremendous saving of money for the company however while news columns advertising columns photos and headlines could be narrowed accordingly the declaration of independence held fast to its original aspect ratio roughly  that meant it was occupying an ever smaller portion of the ever narrower page i put it to arthur sulzberger and tom bodkin then the assistant managing editor in charge of design that if our purpose in reproducing the declaration was to indulge reflexively in the mania for patriotic décor on the fourth we were doing our job but if our mission was to broaden public appreciation of the document we were failing miserably and wasting a full page doing so in late  mr bodkin assigned an art director catherine gilmorebarnes to rethink the presentation a graduate of the school of visual arts ms gilmorebarnes joined the times in  and initially worked for the times magazine she is an accomplished sailor so one might impute to her an appreciation of historical artifacts that still function well ms gilmorebarnes proposed transcribing the declaration in the imperial typeface used for body copy by the newspaper to preserve tradition the type was to sit under a color reproduction of the declaration actually the william j stone facsimile of  the transcription followed the original capitalization punctuation and spelling photoa page proof of the first redesign by catherine gilmorebarnes which called for the facsimile to run above a transcribed version of the text the publisher and the executive editor worried that the transcription type was too smallcredit when jill abramson who was then the executive editor saw the mockup she worried that the new type might be too small for comfortable reading mr sulzberger agreed in an elegant solution ms gilmorebarnes increased the type size and tucked the facsimile into the transcription between two bold red rules photoin the final redesign ms gilmorebarnes increased the type size and tucked the facsimile into the textcredit as a happy dividend there was room enough on the redesigned page for a transcribed list of all the signers and the states they represented beginning of course with john hancock who is supposed to have said that he wrote boldly so that john bull — or king george iii in alternate tellings — could read his signature without need of spectacles our intent exactly photojohn trumbull’s  depiction of the presentation of the declaration by thomas jefferson to john hancock is stirring if not wholly accuratecredit the architect of the capitol the prototype presented to mr sulzberger carried the headline “the unanimous declaration of the thirteen united states of america” the publisher suggested identifying the document unequivocally ms gilmorebarnes added a skyline “the declaration of independence” that’s the page newspaper readers will see on july  now we have to figure out a mobile format so mr bull can read it on his iphone next year without spectacles looking back july    pm july    pm s
