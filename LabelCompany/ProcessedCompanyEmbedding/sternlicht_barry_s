commercial real estate finance by the mortgage observer sternlicht’s humanitarian efforts have garnered prestigious national honors such as jdrf’s man of the year jdrf’s living and giving award and jdrf’s chairman’s award sternlicht is a trustee of his alma mater brown university he is on the board of directors of the estée lauder companies the pension real estate association prea and the real estate roundtable additionally he is chairman emeritus of the board of the robin hood foundation he is a member of the world presidents organization and the urban land institute sternlicht received his ba magna cum laude with honors from brown university and earned an mba with distinction from harvard business school company brief starwood capital group starwoodcapitalcom is a private investment firm formed by barry sternlicht in  it is focused on global real estate hotel management oil and gas energy infrastructure and securities trading starwood capital’s funds have invested in approximately  multifamilycondo units 0 hotels 0 million square feet of office properties  million square feet of retail and  lots of land in residential subdivisions the firm currently manages more than  billion in assets on behalf of its highnetworth and institutional partners it employs approximately 0 employees plus 0 employees in its loanservicing business the firm maintains offices in greenwich headquarters atlanta san francisco washington dc los angeles chicago and miami and affiliated offices in london luxembourg paris frankfurt and sao paulo is this a time of opportunity or a time to waitandsee there is always something to do and it is always about risk and reward but the tail risk in the world is so much greater than it was before this past financial crisis we are investing now because our macro view is that there is a great deal of liquidity in the world there are also very few alternatives for investors so money is coming out of the bond and treasury markets and searching for yield across all the asset classes it’s late in the cycle now the drop in interest rates has been working for so many years that you’re seeing capitulation today from many capital providers they simply can’t take less than  percent yields on 0 percent of the world’s treasuries yet as investors become nervous that rates are going to rise they may pull back sharply because nobody wants to invest in a rising interest rate environment the consensus today which makes me nervous is that rates will remain low pretty much everywhere for a very long time there will be plenty of time to get out if the rates do rise people tend not to be clairvoyant we just closed our newest billion global opportunity fund we’ve seen how the flow of funds has changed how currencies are becoming increasingly volatile and how given the political global uncertainty investors are leaving unstable regimes to invest in more stable places like the us maybe they want to buy that office building in new york or that hotel in manhattan but a part of the equation may also be that they need to diversify out of their local currency and ride the us dollar which is likely to get stronger foreign capital needs to buy something that is not controversial so they will buy an office building a hotel or an apartment complex when we determine where to invest today we’re very focused on whether we can lose our money and about the likelihood of achieving our return target instead of having certainty that an investment will earn 0 percent per annum we now must create a “bell curve” for the expected returns and evaluate the possibility of earning 0 percent as well as the chances of losing your capital it isn’t about the static irr per se on the piece of paper it’s about the shape of the curve and the range of possible outcomes you have to make or to lose your capital based on that our asset class is very well positioned to benefit from a lowrate environment in a very significant way in the real estate world you can still achieve very good riskadjusted returns relative to other asset classes and you’ll enjoy some protection from inflation there is a hard asset and if inflation were to come back and get out of control this is a better place to hide capital than most of course it also depends on which individual asset and property type you choose in real estate are real estate and energy complementary or do you see them as two separate businesses they’re two separate businesses but we follow the same discipline investing in both we look at supply and demand yield on cost what we’re going to earn on the dollar and creating as secure of a longerterm income stream for the energy investment as possible if we’re buying a plant we look at replacement costs to ensure that we are not paying more than it cost to build the same discipline issue relates to all real estate like office buildings there is also the issue of obsolescence buildings that aren’t wired properly or don’t offer the systems you need make replacement cost irrelevant you have to ascertain if the technology is going to be obsolete and if that plant can be competitive especially in our early investments in the electrical grid we would get a longterm contract – essentially a lease from a power company – to take all of the power that runs through that cable we did that in long island and in new york city and they were very successful investments now we have branched out into wind solar and other transmission infrastructure as well as power plants where is innovation taking place today at starwood capital we’re innovative but we can be more so big data is going to have an impact on all of our businesses and we haven’t mastered that yet we don’t do our daily tasks much differently than we did 0 years ago so it’s going to be a new frontier for us to change how we do business our innovation is much like my tenure at starwood hotels – it has come more from the product side at starwood hotels it was about the w the heavenly bed the curved shower rod bringing aveda cosmetics to the room getting rid of the armoire in the hotel and doing duvet covers everything we did was heresy at the time but i didn’t care even if we lost our aaa mobile four star rating because i felt that consumers would be happier with the changes we made everyone followed us because it was about applying common sense we also had a willingness to break rules our only rule was to pay attention to the customers and let them lead us to the right answer other than ethics there are few things in business on which you can’t change your opinion all of our work to create a brand revolves around reinforcing the central theme of the brand for our new  hotels it is more than a brand – it’s a cause our cause is making the earth a little bit better a little bit at a time it’s why we call it  hotels – it’s one world and whatever we each do to the environment to protect it or to harm it impacts our neighbors with  hotels we wanted to make a difference in the world and if people copied us we’d be happy we knew we’d find our niche but it’s innovation that gets me up in the morning one of my greatest strengths is my awareness that you have to roll with the world and change all the time you have to be open to the feedback that the marketplace provides you in order to change what you’re doing when i entered the hotel business i did a survey on the 0 things guests cared about most in choosing a hotel nowhere on that list was the comfort of the bed just 0 years later when you survey the industry the comfort of the bed comes in at around number three great innovation is about making things you do every day better is it more about being an innovator or being a disruptor both good innovation is going to disrupt i come at it with a broader paintbrush today – if we help society we’ll be rewarded if that has an echo effect across the landscape it’s really great i also think the innovator “wins” the space the hotel industry in particular has been cursed and blessed by two things if you own a hotel in manhattan you don’t necessarily care what is happening at a hotel in tokyo so you have this insular mentality that you can continue to do what you have been doing and people will come but there can be someone you don’t know about who can put you out of business tomorrow we recently bought a large group of malls because the mall has been a place people visit to have access to a variety of stores today retail shops are going to have to up their game and figure out why people should get off their computers and make an inconvenient trip to a store stores have to innovate and they’re doing it they’re thinking about the channel shift and they’re mutually complimentary – the online guys are going into brickandmortar and the brickandmortar guys are going online people are using the internet to research and then coming to the store to make the purchase in some markets where retailers closed stores online sales fell precipitously perhaps that’s why mall occupancies are at record highs like any business everyone has to get better at their game to win the entrance of the baccarat hotel  residences  new york is it hard to communicate the purpose behind  it’s actually easier to build a brand today in the internet age it’s so easy for people to discover you the good and the bad if i’m going somewhere i might check the ratings of the hotel or look at what tripadvisor says you can’t hide anymore it’s all about affinity groups and that is what the web allows us to do better we come together around our group be it via social media like with instagram or another outlet it’s micromarketing and if we’re good at it we’re going to save ourselves a lot of money and we’re going to own our demographic and identify and understand what our customer likes today it’s much better than it was 0 years ago how big can the  brand become as big as our ambition as long as we deliver top returns and we’re still having fun it’s not just opening hotels but what we do after that i enjoy having people who care about the environment as my associates and leadership team we will grow at the pace we can handle and when people see what we’ve done with both baccarat hotels and  hotels they’re going to know this isn’t cookiecutter we’re going to have to get our construction costs in line so we can go into cities that don’t have the high rate profile of places like miami or new york we can go to london rome los angeles boston and san francisco and we expect to be in those markets over time what is the vision for baccarat for over 0 years baccarat has perfected their crystal if you go to the packaging line in the factory in baccarat france which has been standing for several hundred years there are all of these trolley carts with glasses and candlesticks when you pick them up and ask why they’re not in the packing line they’ll say it’s because they’re not perfect yet i can’t ever find the flaw for 0 years they never sacrificed quality that was our inspiration to bring perfect service into the hotel space you would be shocked at the number of problems people have at hotels in no other industry could you disappoint 0 percent of your customers and still have them come back because it’s no better elsewhere we can do this more easily at the high end than at the low end because we’re building an incredibly loyal base we want to be the homeawayfromhome for the people that can pay that price all over the world it empowers your employees to satisfy the customers and that makes the experience of working in a hotel that much better with your awareness of attention to detail are you ever satisfied it’s really annoying for those who work with me i need to celebrate our successes more still you have to always look ahead i feel responsible to my investors and partners i’m very proud of what i did at the baccarat in new york and i like to reflect on that we did sell the hotel for the highest price per room ever achieved in north america details are core to an exquisite brand do you get as much joy out of giving back as you do from the business success i love it the benefit of being successful is being able to give back this is the fruit of my labor i can uniquely give resources consulting and money it’s not the best use of my time and resources to stand in a soup kitchen but one day i will do that as well• click here to download a pdf of an interview with barry s sternlichtchairman and chief executive officer starwood

kingpin jw marriott jr has taken a keen interest in the threadcounts of cotton bed sheets sternlicht also explains why intercontinental hotels tapped back lot productions the retail consultants behind the hollywood video stores to design its new age boutique brand indigoduring his 0year reign as chairman of starwood hotels  resorts sternlicht transformed a real estate investment company worth less than 0 million into a  billion hotel empire his two biggest innovations–the w boutique hotel chain and westin heavenly bed–revived the hospitality industry by establishing the practice of branding amenities that were once considered mundanein stark contrast to major airlines today’s hotels address consumer lifestyles and are no longer stuck padding margins with the cheapest mattress furniture and food money can buy“when people go on the road they want to be productive they want a good night’s sleep and they want to eat well there wasn’t any hotel product that was delivering that” said eric sieb president the sieb organization a hospitality consulting firm based in phoenix “barry has made being on the road bearable”to say nothing of profitable operating income from starwood’s north american hotels jumped  to  million last year with a  increase in revenue per available room among samestore units versus the  industry average if its forecast for 0 growth is correct annual net income in 00 will increase  to  millionsternlicht  left the company in may to focus on running his real estate investment firm starwood capital and declined to be interviewed for this story more on that later his recognition as one of brandweek’s marketers of the year it should be noted does not come from being first choice hotels installed serta quality sleepers four years before westin heavenly bed’s  debut but failed to promote the product with distinct branding ian schrager had been creating hotels around nightclubs for years with chic meeting places like morgans in new york and mondrian in los angelesyet no other hotelier in recent memory has managed to create the same “wow” factor for new products and services far from cringing at the fake bathroom countertops or laughing at the immovable art above the bed consumers are ordering w furniture from catalogs and purchasing the heavenly bed at nordstromeven industry rivals tip their hats to sternlicht’s accomplishments“you really have to give starwood their due with what they’ve done with heavenly bed” said mark snyder svpbrand management at holiday inn hotels and resorts “remembering when that was coming out the category thought they were nuts we thought they were nuts but they’ve taken the basics of a hotel stay and done them very dramatically”now the industry is playing catchup marriott’s new bed part of a 0 million upgrade won’t be completed until next year the category leader also is contemplating a boutique brand radisson launched a recent ad blitz touting its new sleep number beds crowne plaza rolled its sleep advantage program complete with hotel quiet zones guaranteed wakeup calls lavender spray and relaxation cd hilton hotels is installing hilton suite dreams bedding into its full family of brands midtier lodger choice hotels meanwhile entered the “lifestyle” boutique sector with cambria suites and hyatt intends to convert amerisuites into the stylish hyatt placethat sternlicht triggered a movement in hotel branding is especially impressive given that he is not a formally trained marketer after earning his mb a at harvard business school with a liberal arts degree from brown university he began closing real estate deals for jmb chicago in  he founded starwood capital group greenwich conn and in  formed starwood hotels white plains ny after acquiring control of hotel investors trust a nearly bankrupt company three years later he outbid hilton to buy itt sheraton for  billion later in  he acquired westin hotels for  billionearly on sternlicht discovered loopholes in the tax code that enabled starwood to own and manage hotels and distribute shareholder dividends without paying taxes that practice ended when competitors alerted the clinton administration and congress passed the irs restructuring bill which limited the benefits of a pairshared real estate investment trust reit starwood hotels converted to a corporate taxpaying c corporation in before buying a conversion property hotel companies typically look at factors such as room sizes and available space for conferences sternlicht tossed those requirements aside and bought hotels including the dumpy doral inn in midtown manhattan based on whether its lexington avenue location would make it profitablewhile young and gifted–he was chairman of one of the world’s top hotel companies at age –sternlicht was also impetuous and lacked operating experience critics argued that he overpaid for sheraton and westin analysts said he was in over his head they appeared to be right when starwood’s stock took a dive in  while it wrestled with an  billion debtnine senior executives left the company during  and  and the assimilation of former competitors westin and sheraton was looking like an operations nightmare sternlicht’s image didn’t fare any better stories questioned whether an executive preoccupied with paint schemes and carpet patterns was ceo material in demoting former ceo and college pal richard nanula–whom journalists cast as starwood’s guiding and stable leader–sternlicht was dubbed petty“there was a lot of turnover and barry is always the grassisgreener type of guy” said david van kalspeek vpsales for mgm grand a sheraton and starwood vet “there were a lot of times when he would throw an idea out there and not understand the impact it had on a company this size he might be having cocktails with somebody and then on monday morning you get a note saying we should be doing this or that did he intend for a note to throw the whole organization into a tizzy no but those kinds of things from the chairman do some people liked it some people dealt with it and some didn’t”managers knew where their ideas stood with sternlicht because he was very direct even gruff said a former starwood executive who wished to remain anonymous while his detailoriented style sometimes bordered on interference the exec said ultimately his intent was to arrive at the best possible answerstarwood is now being led by cocacola veteran steven heyer who declined to allow company executives to be interviewed for this story sternlicht had recruited heyer to be ceo and according to one former manager there are “sensibilities” between the twothat could mean feud sternlicht and heyer squared off during a press conference in september 00 vying to answer questions first and contradicting each other on the surface perhaps heyer who last year was passed over for the top job at cocacola doesn’t want his predecessor’s accomplishments to overshadow his own visionor possibly sternlicht has learned to be a better ceo said former starwood cmo keith ferrazzi founder of the los angeles based consultancy ferrazzi greenlight “people have got to give barry credit for growing as a leader of that company” ferrazzi said “maybe he’s being sensitive enough to steve saying ‘hey this is your ship and i don’t want to steal the limelight’ barry would be thrilled that this story is being written but he wouldn’t want to embrace it in a way that would subjugate steve not doing so shows a lot of maturity in his leadership style”the stories of “barry’s bravado”–which many say killed his bid to acquire wyndham hotels and rubbed subordinates the wrong way–are repeated more often than the accounts of barry the family man barry the diabetes fundraiser and barry the practitioner of selfdeprecating humor“confidence in some cases can be mistaken for arrogance” opined consultant sieb “because people are envious about what he had been able to do”in the mid ’0s as consumers were stuffing their homes with viking stoves and affordable luxuries from bed bath  beyond sternlicht saw a void in the hotel business travelers were sacrificing their sophisticated lifestyle upon stepping inside a hotel room the glitzy four seasons ritzcarlton and st regis were exceptions but those brands were too stuffy for a younger generation of wellheeled travelers and too pricey for road warriors’ te reportsaround the time of the westin deal sternlicht was working with architect david rockwell on the first w hotel in new york the project was racking up enormous costs however and sternlicht decided that using a highpriced architect wasn’t the way to goinstead he sought out hilary billings during a business trip to los angeles billings then vpproduct development at pottery barn had built the retailer’s catalog business with contemporary and casual merchandise like coir rugs made of coconut husks and curtains with iron rods that dressed the home like a private retreatas a buyer billings had done her share of traveling sleeping on 00 cotton sheets down comforters and luxury bedding in european hotels she was all too disappointed with the us lodging experience of a foam pillow polyester sheets and a terrible mattress though initially she was not interested in jumping to the hotel category her interest and sternlicht’s vision came together during that first meeting“what he was looking for was very clear” said billings starwood’s svpbrand development and design until  when she left for the dotcorn gift company redenvelope she’s now a parttime brand consultant “we had a different emphasis his was a sort of hip experience for the hotel customer mine was more focused on the business traveler because i saw that was where the biggest gap was”at the time boutique hotels delivered high design to leisure travelers but lacked the conference rooms internet access and quality business centers that road warriors found at the westins sheratons hihons hyatts and marriotts sternlicht wanted to bring back the algonquin days of the hotel as a meeting place and update it with hip restaurants and clubs so that locals too had a place to hang their hatsbillings and her creative team of  employees worked in san francisco insulated from the corporate culture clash in white plains between the risk takers of starwood and the more conservative sheraton and westin hotel veterans some carried an asset management approach but sternlicht pushed marketing to the forefront of the organization and plucked product development from the operations domain to exist as a marketing function he tore down geographic divisions of management and assigned responsibilities by brands ferrazzi arrived in  and hired scott williams to lead the creative services unit that served as starwood’s inhouse marketing agencyin hindsight it seems incredible that w was launched with little market analysis or brand position research rather w was simply put in front of the consumer so they could respond to it some starwood honchos labeled the project as a “crazy barry idea” but there was no mistaking their boss’ passion for it“barry said to me  of the time a guest spends in the hotel room is on the bed” recalled billings “i figured if we can make that experience great just think about what it would do for the hotel rather than thinking about the cost he was thinking about the experience”still the new brand had to compete on cost with westin and sheraton billings’ team removed the armoire and invested in a luxury bed a longer mahogany desk with a sleek tv chaise lounges and shelving for the closet in her biggest stroke of genius she recommended replacing the seemingly bulletproof floralcolored bed spread with a linencolored duvet cotton sheets and down pillowsoperations staff fought against bedding that had to be cleaned frequently but sternlicht loved the idea he increased the number and load capacity of hotel laundry machines so the w bed could be rolled out to all hotels billings started retrofitting westin beds the following year and the allwhite heavenly bed quickly became the symbol of the brandsternlicht’s wife mimi came up with the enigmatic name w which was meant to signify witty warm and wonderful billings said she loved w because it had a builtin logo the first w opened to oohs and aahs in new york in december far from fading the  w hotels continue to be seen as sophisticated and relevant the power of minimalist furnishings and a hot nightclub can last only so long but w is enduring thanks to promotional events such as w happenings which inject the brand into the local scene with art previews celebrity book readings film screenings dj classes and concerts by moby and the wallflowers signature products such as “whatever whenever”–the hour room laundry and concierge service–are perfect for guests who want style without sacrificing service partnering with bliss has made its spa services topnotch“it turned out to be a great product for him not only for w itself but it also had spillover effect onto the luster of starwood” said van kalspeekthe buzz spread with minimal traditional marketing print ads by ddb chicago focused on amenities followed by a campaign from gwhiz entertainment new york to position w as an experience with the mantra “there are hotels you stay in and one that stays in you” a guerrilla stunt featured models in a mock boxersversusbriefs boxing match atop a w in chicago to promote specially designed joe boxer underwear for w guests rda new york is w’s current agency deutsch new york handles westin and sheratonas its guest satisfaction ratings soared w soon migrated to the rest of the portfolio thousands of beds and signature sheets and pillows were sold to consumers westin had a little fun with its “who’s the best in bed” print campaign yet the newly minted brand pushed its way to the upscaleluxury tier above the pritzker familyowned hyatt which had invested little in modernization until last yearin 00 westin introduced the heavenly shower featuring dual showerheads curved rod oversized cotton towels and kimono terry robes sternlicht and westin svp sue

loyalty club points or moneyback satisfaction guarantees lounging pillows and fluffy duvets also have made their way into the midscale four points by sheraton brand with the four points bed“starwood may not be the first hotel with a great bed a spa or even with an experience but it is the first to articulate it to a growing travel market” said tom thomas founder of tom thomas  co a branding consultancy in new york “sternlicht may not have the imprimatur of a great hotelier but he is great at being certain that the discipline and the seamlessness of his vision are executed”sternlicht’s investment firm recently acquired le meridien’s assets to be managed by starwood hotels  resorts heyer’s team will spin some of the new properties into lifestyle brands using dynamics such as branded
