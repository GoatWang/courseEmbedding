work for johnson  johnson jj fresh out of college in  assumed leadership of the international healthcare giant in april  weldon became only the sixth chairman in the companys year history and took on the daunting challenge of leading one of americas most consistently successful companies into the st century in weldons first full year as chairman and chief executive william c weldon  najlah feannycorbis  officer jj posted a profit of nearly  billion on worldwide sales of just under  billion this represented an increase of roughly  percent in net income and a  percent increase in total revenue in leading jj to yet another sales increase weldon honored a long tradition of the company which had not seen a revenue decline in more than  years although weldon spent his entire working life with jj he first attracted widespread attention in the spring of  when as vice chairman and head of the companys pharmaceu ticals group he engineered the takeover of alza corporation in what was then jj biggest acquisition ever alza which became a member of the jj family but continued to operate under its own name specializes in the development of drugdelivery systems primarily transdermal patches analysts viewed the alza deal favorably jerry i treppel an analyst with bank of america securities told carey krause of chemical market reporter that jjs acquisition of alzas concerta ditropan xl and doxil pharmaceuticals would provide highmargin highgrowth new pharmaceutical revenues equally positive in his assessment of the deal was david lothson an analyst with ubs warburg who told krause the acquisition makes terrific sense for jj and is being done at a price that is attractive for both sets of shareholders april   jj best known for bandaids and tylenol johnson  johnson headquartered in new brunswick new jersey is perhaps best known to consumers as the company behind such everyday healthcare standbys as bandaid bandages tylenol and johnsons baby powder but jj is in fact a family of more than two hundred operating companies in countries around the globe its workforce numbers more than  about half of whom work in the united states founded by robert wood johnson in  the company was familyowned until  when its stock was first offered on the new york stock exchange although the company is immediately recognizable to the public for its popular overthecounter healthcare products it also developed and markets such topselling prescription drugs as procrit marketed as eprex in europe for anemia remicade for rheumatoid arthritis risperdal for schizophrenia and topamax for epilepsy the son of a broadway stagehand and a costume seamstress who both worked in the new york theater weldon was born in brooklyn new york on november   the family later moved to nearby northern new jersey where young weldon attended ridgewood high school a student of no particular distinction during his highschool years weldon excelled at athletics and played on the basketball and football teams after graduating from high school in  weldon enrolled at quinnipiac university in hamden connecticut to study biology midway through college he married barbara dearborn whom he met while in high school after which he told businessweek  he grew more serious about his studies after earning his bachelors degree in  weldon interviewed for a job as sales representative with jjs mcneil pharmaceutical unit which is now known as orthomcneil pharmaceutical he was interviewed by howard klick who three decades later told businessweek that as part of the process he challenged weldon to give him a sales pitch on a ballpoint pen he was hungry recalled klick he had fire in the belly may   klick said the young college graduate outdid himself in selling the pen to his interviewer taking it apart to demonstrate how it worked and extolling its writing properties klick hired him on the spot moves quickly up the ladder at mcneil after a couple of years as a sales representative weldon began climbing the ladder at mcneil taking on a series of marketing management positions of increasing responsibility in  he was named manager of jjs icom regional development center in southeast asia a post he held until  when he was named executive vice president and managing director of korea mcneil two years later weldon was named executive vice president and managing director of orthocilag pharmaceutical in the united kingdom in  he returned to the united states as vice president for sales and marketing of jjs janssen pharmaceutica in  weldon was appointed president of ethicon endosurgery ees a newly created jj company specializing in the development and marketing of surgical instruments and related medical devices used in both minimally invasive and traditional surgery this was a change for weldon whose previous jj experience had been in the pharmaceutical end of the business but he adapted quickly jj had big plans for ees and decided that weldon was the man to help lead the fledgling company into a leadership position in the field of endoscopic surgery an area of medical therapy with a vast potential for growth as jj infused the new company with millions to get it off the ground weldon worked doggedly to make ees a major force in the medicalinstruments market to develop new products weldon brought in a large number of engineers and equipped them with cuttingedge computeraided design cad systems he also called on expert counsel from the harvard business school to help ees put in place a multifunctional teambased environment that was able to sharply reduce the time it took to develop new products to market its rapidly growing product line the company hired a worldwide force of two hundred sales representatives in a little over a decade the size of the ees sales team roughly tripled weldon grows ees market share weldon spearheaded eess drive for market share traveling extensively to discuss the companys products with surgeons and hospital administrators according to businessweek  he delayed a flight from san diego back to eess cincinnati headquarters so that he could further press his companys case with a potential customer who was having second thoughts about committing to ees products during his years with ees weldon earned a reputation for setting even higher goals for the company than the top managers back at jj headquarters in new brunswick as nick valeriani vice president of sales and marketing for ees told businessweek  wed have a great year and bill would say nice job why couldnt it have been  percent higher may   weldons hard work paid off under his direction by  ees had propelled itself into the market leadership position in both endoscopic and traditional surgical instruments surpassing united states surgical corporation the previous market leader although weldon was a hard taskmaster at ees he also ensured that his bestperforming employees at the jj subsidiary were amply rewarded and thus better able to resist the temptation of offers to go elsewhere not everyone flourished under weldons style of leadership those who failed to adequately convince him of their willingness to be team players according to businessweek  felt alienated by weldon of his former boss at ees one former executive told the magazine that weldon was an intimidator and a dominator may   in  three years after he joined the newly founded ees as its president weldon was named a jj company group chairman and the worldwide franchise chairman of ees three years later he returned to the pharmaceutical side of the company as worldwide chairman of jjs pharmaceuticals group and a member of the companys executive committee jj pharmaceuticals business lags in the late s jjs pharmaceuticals business badly needed a shot in the arm in  five promising drugs on which the pharmaceuticals group was pinning much of its hopes for the future were shot down in the late stages of development according to a report by robert langreth in forbes  new jj medications for the treatment of stroke and diabetes failed in largescale human trials while drugs designed to combat multiple sclerosis and premature labor were rejected by federal regulators to make matters even worse jj lost in a battle over the rights to a new formulation of procrit its bestselling anemia medication impressed by what weldon had done at ees ralph larsen then chairman and ceo of jj hoped the brooklyn native could find a way to reinvigorate the giant companys pharmaceuticals business weldon moved quickly to get the pharmaceuticals business moving again by the end of  he had helped engineer jjs purchase of centocor a malvern pennsylvania biotechnology company that had within its product line three drugs of particular interest to jj heading the list was remicade which was already being marketed for the treatment of crohns disease and was expected to soon receive approval for treating rheumatoid arthritis the other two drugs were reopro an anticlotting medication and retavase a form of tissue plasminogen activator tpa used in the early treatment of heart attacks jj was also attracted by centocors position as the worlds leading producer of monoclonal antibodies technology that could be used as a platform for a wide variety of potential applications the centocor deal was valued at roughly  billion in february  jjs board of directors elected weldon and james t lenehan worldwide chairman of jjs medical devices  diagnostics group vice chairmen of the corporation under terms of their new appointments weldon and lenehan joined jjs chairman and ceo larsen and senior vice chairman robert n wilson in the office of the chairman jjs top management group in his new position weldon continued to be responsible for the pharmaceuticals group and the consumer pharmaceuticals  nutritional products group but was given the additional tasks of overseeing corporatebusiness development and the corporate office of science  technology engineers jjs acquisition of alza less than two months after taking over as a corporate vice chairman weldon announced an agreement to acquire alza corporation headquartered in mountain view california ernest mario alzas chairman and ceo told paul jacobs of the san jose mercury news that he and weldon had begun talks only a month earlier about putting the two businesses together to reach more patients with our products march   under the terms of the acquisition agreement alza was to continue operations under its own name from its california base weldon said he expected that the merger would create for alza more markets for its pharmaceutical products as well as new applications within the larger jj family for the companys drugdelivery systems the latter segment of alzas product line included transdermal patches which deliver measured dosages of medication through the skin implants and timerelease capsules on january   seven months to the day after jj finalized its acquisition of alza larsen announced that after  years at the helm of jj he was stepping down and would be succeeded as chairman and ceo by weldon effective april   larsen stayed on for a few months after passing the torch to weldon but left the company completely on july   at the same time weldon was named to succeed larsen the company announced that jim lenehan weldons fellow vice chairman would become jjs president succeeding robert wilson in assessing the task that lay ahead of him weldon told lewis krauskopf of the bergen record that the challenges are going to be to build on the outstanding record that ralph larsen has built going forward january   weldon singled out the regulatory environment as one of the more daunting challenges facing not only jj but the healthcare industry as a whole he pointed to the insistence by federal officials on broader studies with greater numbers of subjects before giving the green light to new drugs a clue to jjs future although weldon said that jjs widely diversified product base would serve it well in the future many outside observers speculated that the selection of the head of its pharmaceuticals group to lead the company offered a clue to the direction in which the company was moving at least in the short term analysts observed that weldons selection made sense in view of the large investments jj had made in its acquisitions of both centocor and alza industry observers agreed however that weldons biggest challenge would be maintaining healthy earnings growth at jj a task made progressively more daunting as the companys revenue base continued to expand the companys performance in  twothirds of which occurred on weldons watch was reassuring for jj stockholders the company posted net income of nearly  billion on sales of roughly  billion diluted earnings per share in  came in at  compared with  a year earlier this represented an increase in earnings per share of about  percent continuing jjs lengthy string of doubledigit annual earnings gains under weldons direction jj continued to grow through acquisition by far the biggest purchase during weldons first  months as ceo came with the news in february  that jj had outbid two other major pharmaceutical companies for scios a major force in the biotechnology industry headquartered in sunnyvale california although the ceo of scios richard b brewer declined to reveal the names of the other suitors to the san jose mercury news  he made it clear that jjs allcash offer of  billion was too good to turn down the deal represented further expansion into the biotechnology field by jj and brought into the companys growing family of lifesaving drugs natrecor a genetically engineered medication developed by scios for the treatment of patients with congestive heart failure under the terms of the acquisition scios would continue to operate under its own name in sunnyvale smaller acquisitions made although they were dwarfed by the scios deal jj made two smaller acquisitions before the end of  in november  the company announced its plan to purchase orapharma a small drug company in warminster pennsylvania orapharma developed arestin a timerelease antibiotic used in the treatment of gum disease two months later jj announced that it was acquiring dimensional pharmaceuticals which had developed technologies that jj researchers felt could be used to enhance the larger companys drugresearch capabilities in early  weldon announced jj net income of  billion on sales of  billion for  diluted earnings per share for the year were  in  up  percent from the previous year particularly impressive was the companys performance in the final quarter of  when earnings jumped  percent to ¢ per share from ¢ in the comparable period a year earlier of the companys impressive showing weldon told the associated press that each of our business segments made important contributions to the overall growth while continuing to invest in building our businesses for the future  ap online  january   weldon and his wife barbara lived in somerset county new jersey not far from jjs headquarters
