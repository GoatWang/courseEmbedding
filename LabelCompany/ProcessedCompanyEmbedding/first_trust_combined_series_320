semiannual distribution plan was  per annum on october   and  under the monthly distribution plan estimated longterm return to unit holders under the semi annual distribution plan was  per annum on october   and  under the monthly distribution plan estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which take into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of all of the bonds in the trust and  takes into account a compounding factor and the expenses and sales charge associated with each unit of the trust since the market values and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of the trust will change there is no assurance that the present estimated current return and estimated longterm return indicated above will be realized in the future estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of the estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while the estimated current return calculations include only net annual interest income and public offering price the above figures are

bond issuer the underwriters the sponsor or others for preinsured bonds and a monthly premium is paid by each insured trust for the insurance obtained by such trust except for bonds in such trust which are insured by the bond issuer the underwriters the sponsor or others in which case no premiums for insurance are paid by such trust upon the sale of a bond insured under the insurance policy obtained by an insured trust the trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance from financial guaranty andor ambac indemnity with respect to such bond upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond accordingly any bond in an insured trust of the fund is eligible to be sold on an insured basis standard  poors and moodys investors service inc have rated the claimspaying ability of financial guaranty and ambac indemnity aaa and aaa respectively see why and how are the insured trusts insured in selecting bonds the following facts among others were considered i the standard  poors rating or fitch investors service incs rating of the bonds was in no case less than bbb in the case of an insured trust or an arkansas kansas or maine advantage trust and a in the case of other advantage trusts or the moodys investors service inc rating of the bonds was in no case less than baa in the case of an insured trust or an arkansas kansas or maine advantage trust and a in the case of other advantage trusts including provisional or conditional ratings respectively or if not rated the bonds had in the opinion of the sponsor credit characteristics sufficiently similar to the credit characteristics of interestbearing taxexempt obligations that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by the fund see description of bond ratings ii the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity iii with respect to the insured trusts the availability and cost of insurance of the principal and interest on the bonds and iv the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer subsequent to the initial date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the initial date of deposit neither event requires elimination of such bond from the portfolio but may be considered in the sponsors determination as to whether or not to direct the trustee to dispose of the bond see rights of unit holders how may bonds be removed from the fund the portfolio appearing in part one contains bond ratings when available for the bonds listed at the date shown certain of the bonds in the trusts may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the trust were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type the market discount of previously issued bonds will increase when interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase and decrease when such interest rates fall other things being equal a discount bond held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and less in the form of taxexempt interest income than a comparable bond newly issued at current market rates see what is the federal tax status of unit holders appearing in part three for each trust certain of the bonds in the trusts may be original issue discount bonds under current law the original issue discount which is the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue price of the bonds is deemed to accrue on a daily basis and the accrued portion is treated as taxexempt interest income for federal income tax purposes on sale or redemption any gain realized that is in excess of the earned portion of original issue discount will be taxable as capital gain unless the gain is attributable to market discount in which case the accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income see what is the federal tax status of unit holders appearing in part three for each trust the current value of an original discount bond reflects the present value of its stated redemption price at maturity the market value tends to increase in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity certain of the original issue discount bonds may be zero coupon bonds including bonds known as multiplier bonds money multiplier bonds page  capital appreciation bonds capital accumulator bonds compound interest bonds and money discount maturity payment bonds zero coupon bonds do not provide for the payment of any current interest and generally provide for payment at maturity at face value unless sooner sold or redeemed zero coupon bond features include  not paying interest on a semiannual basis and  providing for the reinvestment of the bonds semiannual earnings at the bonds stated yield to maturity while zero coupon bonds are frequently marketed on the basis that their fixed rate of return minimizes reinvestment risk this benefit can be negated in large part by weak call protection certain of the bonds in the trusts may have been acquired at a market premium from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the premium bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the trusts were higher than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type the current returns of bonds trading at a market premium are initially higher than the current returns of comparable bonds of a similar type issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes payable because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at maturity but through current income payments early redemption of a premium bond at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a reduction in yield redemptions are more likely to occur at times when the bonds have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original issue discount bonds a premium over the accreted value to the extent that the bonds were deposited in the fund at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed this will represent a loss of capital when compared to the original public offering price of the units because premium bonds generally pay a higher rate of interest than bonds priced at or below par the effect of the redemption of premium bonds would be to reduce estimated net annual unit income by a greater percentage than the par amount of such bonds bears to the total par amount of bonds in the trust although the actual impact of any such redemptions that may occur will depend upon the specific bonds that are redeemed it can be anticipated that the estimated net annual unit income will be significantly reduced after the dates on which such bonds are eligible for redemption the trust may be required to sell zero coupon bonds prior to maturity at their current market price which is likely to be less than their par value in order to pay expenses of the trust or in case the trust is terminated see rights of unit holdershow may bonds be removed from the fund and other informationhow may the indenture be amended or terminated certain of the bonds in the trusts may be general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity all other bonds in the trusts are revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are secured by the issuers pledge of its faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds on the other hand are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific revenue source there are of course variations in the security of the different bonds in the fund both within a particular classification and between classifications depending on numerous factors certain of the bonds in the trusts may be healthcare revenue bonds healthcare revenue bonds are obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from services provided by hospitals or other healthcare facilities including nursing homes a healthcare issuers ability to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent on various factors including occupancy levels of the facility demand government regulations wages of employees overhead expenses competition from other similar providers malpractice insurance costs and the degree of governmental competition from other similar providers malpractice insurance costs and the degree of governmental financial assistance including medicare and medicaid and other similar third party payer programs certain of the bonds in the trusts may be housing revenue bonds housing revenue bonds are obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from mortgage loans on single family residences or housing projects for low to moderate income families housing revenue bonds are generally payable at any time and therefore their average life will ordinarily be less than their stated maturities the ability of such issuers to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent on various factors including occupancy levels rental income mortgage default rates taxes operating expenses governmental regulations and the appropriation of subsidies page  certain of the bonds in the trusts may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water andor sewerage services water and sewerage bonds are generally payable from user fees problems faced by such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs and the impact of nogrowth zoning ordinances certain of the bonds in the trusts may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from the sale of electric energy utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility commissions which among other things establish the rates which may be charged and the appropriate rate of return the problems faced by such issuers include the difficulty in obtaining approval for timely and adequate rate increases from the governing public utility commission the difficulty in financing large construction programs increased federal state and municipal government regulations the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations increased competition recent reductions in estimates of future demand for electricity in certain areas of the country the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation certain of the bonds in the trusts may be lease obligations issued primarily by governmental authorities that have no taxing power or other means of directly raising revenues rather the governmental authorities are financing vehicles created solely for the construction of buildings ie schools administrative offices convention centers and prisons or the purchase of equipment ie police cars and computer systems that will be used by a state or local government the lessee these obligations are subject to the ability and willingness of the lessee government to meet its lease rental payments which include debt service on the obligations lease obligations are subject in almost all cases to annual appropriation risk ie the lessee government is not legally obligated to budget and appropriate for the rental payments beyond the current fiscal year or construction and abatement riskrental obligations cease in the event that delays in building damage destruction or condemnation of the project prevents its use by the lessee certain of the bonds in the trusts may be industrial revenue bonds irbs taxexempt securities issued by states municipalities public authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring constructing or improving various industrial projects debt service payments on irbs are dependent on various factors including the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project and if applicable corporate guarantor revenues generated from the project and if applicable corporate guarantor revenues generated from the project and regulatory and environmental restrictions certain of the bonds in the trusts may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports bridges turnpikes port authorities convention centers and arenas the ability of issuers to make debt service payments on airport obligations is dependent on the capability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors many airlines may have difficulty meeting their obligations under these use agreements similarly payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects such as user fees from ports tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings therefore payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance decreased use of a facility lower cost of alternative modes of transportation scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents certain of the bonds in the trusts may be obligations of issuers which govern the operation of schools colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes general problems relating to college and university obligations would include the prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and new government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers certain of the bonds in the trusts may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities resource recovery facilities are designed to page  process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity resource recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain circumstances including but not limited to destruction or condemnation of a project contracts relating to a project becoming void unenforceable or impossible to perform changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of a project administrative or judicial actions which render contracts relating to the projects void unenforceable or impossible to perform or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities certain trusts may contain bonds of issuers located in the commonwealth of puerto rico or issuers which will be affected by general economic conditions of puerto rico puerto ricos unemployment rate remains significantly higher than the us unemployment rate furthermore the economy is largely dependent for its development upon us policies and programs that are being reviewed and may be eliminated the economy of puerto rico is closely integrated with that of the mainland united states during fiscal  approximately  of puerto ricos exports were to the us mainland which was also the source of approximately  of puerto ricos imports the economy of puerto rico is dominated by the manufacturing and service sectors the manufacturing sector has experienced fundamental changes over the years as a result of increased emphasis on higher wage high technology industries such as pharmaceuticals electronics computers microprocessors professional and scientific instruments and certain high technology machinery and equipment the service sector including finance insurance and real estate also plays a major role in the economy it ranks second only to manufacturing in contribution to the gross domestic product and leads all sectors in providing employment in recent years the service sector has experienced significant growth in response to the expansion of the manufacturing sector the puerto rican economy is affected by a number of commonwealth and federal investment incentive programs aid for puerto ricos economy has traditionally depended heavily on federal programs and current federal budgetary policies suggest that an expansion of aid to puerto rico is unlikely an adverse effect on the puerto rican economy could result from other us policies including further reduction in transfer payment programs such as food stamps curtailment of military spending and policies which could lead to a stronger dollar one of the factors assisting the development of the puerto rican economy has been the tax incentives offered by the federal and puerto rico governments puerto ricos future will be determined by the leadership and initiatives of both the private and public sector to compensate for the loss of the federal tax credit under section  of the us tax code this important credit which enabled companies to repatriate profits at a  reduction in federal taxes was terminated as of july  existing us companies operating in puerto rico were given a ten year grace period but new us manufacturing companies coming to puerto rico will have to pay us deferral taxes when repatriating their profits to the mainland the foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the financial difficulties which may impact certain issuers of bonds and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of the bonds are subject additionally many factors including national economic social and environmental policies and conditions which are not within the control of the issuers of bonds could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition of puerto rico and various agencies and political subdivisions located in puerto rico the sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other factors may affect the issuers of bonds the market value or marketability of the bonds or the ability of the respective issuers of the bonds acquired by the trusts to pay interest on or principal of the bonds interest on certain of the bonds in certain arkansas idaho kansas maine mississippi and nebraska trusts will be an item of tax preference for purposes of the alternative minimum tax amt the investment by nonamt individual taxpayers in amt municipal bonds generally results in a higher yield to such bondholders than nonamt municipal bonds since a portion of the interest from certain arkansas idaho kansas maine mississippi and nebraska trusts is an amt preference item certain arkansas idaho kansas maine mississippi and nebraska trusts may be more appropriate for investors who are not subject to amt investors should be aware that many of the bonds in the trusts are subject to continuing requirements such as the actual use of bond page  proceeds or manner of operation of the project financed from bond proceeds that may affect the exemption of interest on such bonds from federal income taxation although at the time of issuance of each of the bonds in the trusts an opinion of bond counsel was rendered as to the exemption of interest on such obligations from federal income taxation there can be no assurance that the respective issuers or other obligors on such obligations will fulfill the various continuing requirements established upon issuance of the bonds a failure to comply with such requirements may cause a determination that interest on such obligations is subject to federal income taxation perhaps even retroactively from the date of issuance of such bonds thereby reducing the value of the bonds and subjecting unit holders to unanticipated tax liabilities because certain of the bonds may from time to time under certain circumstances be sold or redeemed or will mature in accordance with their terms and because the proceeds from such events will be distributed to unit holders and will not be reinvested no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of time its present size and composition neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any bond certain of the bonds contained in the trusts may be subject to being called or redeemed in whole or in part prior to their stated maturities pursuant to optional redemption provisions sinking fund provisions special or extraordinary redemption provisions or otherwise a bond subject to optional call is one which is subject to redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer a bond subject to sinking fund redemption is one which is subject to partial call from time to time at par or in the case of a zero coupon bond at the accreted value from a fund accumulated for the scheduled retirement of a portion of an issue prior to maturity special or extraordinary redemption provisions may provide for redemption at par or for original issue discount bonds at issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus if applicable some premium of all or a portion of an issue upon the occurrence of certain circumstances the exercise of redemption or call provisions will except to the extent the proceeds of the called bonds are used to pay for unit redemptions result in the distribution of principal and may result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest distributions it may also affect the longterm return and the current return on units of each trust redemption pursuant to call provisions is more likely to occur and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur when the bonds have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original issue discount bonds a premium over the accreted value unit holders may recognize capital gain or loss upon any redemption or call like other investment companies financial and business organizations and individuals around the world the fund could be adversely affected if the computer systems used by the sponsor evaluator portfolio supervisor or trustee or other service providers to the fund do not properly process and calculate daterelated information and data involving dates of january   and thereafter this is commonly known as the year  problem the sponsor evaluator portfolio supervisor and trustee are taking steps that they believe are reasonably designed to address the year  problem with respect to computer systems that they use and to obtain reasonable assurances that comparable steps are being taken by the funds other service providers at this time however there can be no assurance that these steps will be sufficient to avoid any adverse impact to the fund the sponsor is unable to predict what impact if any the year  problem will have on issuers of the bonds contained in the fund to the best knowledge of the sponsor there is no litigation pending as of the date hereof in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect upon the trusts at any time after the date hereof litigation may be initiated on a variety of grounds with respect to bonds in a trust such litigation as for example suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds under recentlyenacted environmental protection statutes may affect the validity of such bonds or the taxfree nature of the interest thereon while the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be entirely predicted the fund has received opinions of bond counsel to the issuing authority of each bond on the date of issuance to the effect that such bonds have been validly issued and that the interest thereon is exempt from federal income taxes and state and local taxes in addition other factors may arise from time to time which potentially may impair the ability of issuers to meet obligations undertaken with respect to the bonds page  what are estimated longterm return and estimated current return at the date of this prospectus the estimated current return and the estimated longterm return under the monthly quarterly if applicable and semiannual if applicable distribution plans are as set forth in part one attached hereto for each trust estimated current return is computed by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price any change in either amount will result in a change in the estimated current return for each trust the public offering price will vary in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the underlying bonds and the net annual interest income per unit will change as bonds are redeemed paid sold or exchanged in certain refundings or as the expenses of each trust change therefore there is no assurance that the estimated current return indicated in part one for each trust will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which take into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of all of the bonds in the trust and  takes into account a compounding factor the expenses and sales charge associated with each unit of a trust since the market values and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of the trust will change there is no assurance that the estimated longterm return indicated in part one for each trust will be realized in the future estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while estimated current return calculations include only net annual interest income and public offering price neither rate reflects the true return to unit holders which is lower because neither includes the effect of certain delays in distributions to unit holders a comparison of taxfree and equivalent taxable estimated current returns and estimated longterm returns with the returns on various taxable investments is one element to consider in making an investment decision the sponsor may from time to time in its advertising and sales materials compare the then current estimated returns on the trust and returns over specified periods on other similar trusts sponsored by nike securities lp with returns on taxable investments such as corporate or us government bonds bank cds and money market accounts or money market funds each of which has investment characteristics that may differ from those of the trust how are purchased interest and accrued interest treated purchased interest for the first trust combined series  each trust contains an amount of purchased interest purchased interest is a portion of the unpaid interest that has accrued on the bonds from the later of the last payment date on the bonds or the date of issuance thereof through the first settlement date and is included in the calculation of the public offering price purchased interest will be distributed to unit holders as units are redeemed or securities are sold mature or are called see summary of essential information appearing in part one for each trust for the amount of purchased interest per unit for each trust purchased interest is an element of the determination of the price unit holders will receive in connection with the sale or redemption of units prior to the termination of the trust accrued interest accrued interest is the accumulation of unpaid interest on a bond from the last day on which interest thereon was paid interest on bonds generally is paid semiannually although each trust accrues such interest daily because of this a trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason with respect to sales settling subsequent to the first settlement date the public offering price of units will have added to it the proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement unit holders will receive on the next distribution date of the trust the amount if any of accrued interest paid on their units for the first trust combined series  except through an advancement of its own funds the trustee has no cash for distribution to unit holders until it receives interest payments on the bonds in a trust the trustee will recover its advancements without interest or other costs to such trust from interest received on the bonds in the trust when these advancements have been recovered regular distributions of interest to unit holders will commence see rights of unit holdershow are interest and principal distributed interest account balances are established with generally positive cash balances so that it will not be necessary on a regular basis for the trustee to advance its own funds in connection with interest distributions page  for the first trust combined series  in an effort to reduce the amount of purchased interest which would otherwise have to be paid by unit holders the trustee may advance a portion of the accrued interest to the sponsor as the unit holder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the amount of accrued interest to be added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement other than the purchased interest already included therein less any distributions from the interest account subsequent to the first settlement date see rights of unit holdershow are interest and principal distributed for the first trust combined series  and subsequent series in an effort to reduce the amount of accrued interest which would otherwise have to be paid in addition to the public offering price in the sale of units to the public the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest as of the first settlement date and the same will be distributed to the sponsor as the unit holder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the amount of accrued interest to be added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement less any distributions from the interest account subsequent to the first settlement date see rights of unit holdershow are interest and principal distributed because of the varying interest payment dates of the bonds accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by a trust and distributed to unit holders if a unit holder sells or redeems all or a portion of his units he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the purchased interest if any and accrued interest from the purchaser of his units since the trustee has the use of the funds including purchased interest if any held in the interest account for distributions to unit holders and since such account is noninterestbearing to unit holders the trustee benefits thereby why and how are the insured trusts insured the following discussion is applicable only to the insured trusts the bonds in the portfolio of an advantage trust are not insured by insurance obtained by the fund all bonds in the portfolio of an insured trust are insured as to the scheduled payment of interest and principal by policies obtained by each insured trust from

policy is unable to meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the claims paying ability of such insurer deteriorates financial guaranty andor ambac indemnity has no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above described events a monthly premium is paid by each insured trust for the insurance obtained by such trust which is payable from

an insured trust the trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance upon the payment of an insurance premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond except as indicated below insurance obtained by an insured trust has no effect on the price or redemption value of units it is the present intention of the evaluator to attribute a value to such insurance obtained by an insured trust including the right to obtain permanent insurance for the purpose of computing the price or redemption value of units only if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment of principal or interest or in the sponsors opinion in significant risk of such default the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of a bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premium attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of such bonds not covered by permanent insurance see public offeringhow is the public offering price determined herein for a more complete description of

of the insurance companies referred to above standard  poors has assigned to units of each insured trust its aaa investment rating this is the highest rating assigned to securities by standard  poors see description of bond ratings the obtaining of this rating by each insured trust should not be construed as an approval of the offering of the units by standard  poors or as a guarantee of the market value of each insured trust or the units of such trust standard  poors has indicated that this rating is not a recommendation to buy hold or sell units nor does it take into account the extent to which expenses of each trust or sales by each trust of bonds for less than the purchase price paid by such trust will reduce payment to unit holders of the interest and principal required to be paid on such bonds such rating will be in effect for a period of thirteen months from the initial date of deposit of an insured trust and will unless renewed terminate at the end of such period there is no guarantee that the aaa investment rating with respect to the units of an insured trust will be maintained an objective of portfolio insurance obtained by such insured trust is to obtain a higher yield on the bonds in the portfolio of such trust than page  would be available if all the bonds in such portfolio had the standard  poors aaa andor moodys investors service inc aaa ratings and at the same time to have the protection of insurance of scheduled payment of interest and principal on the bonds there is of course no certainty that this result will be achieved bonds in a trust for which insurance has been obtained by the bond issuer the underwriters the sponsor or others all of which were rated aaa by standard  poors andor aaa by moodys investors service inc may or may not have a higher yield than uninsured bonds rated aaa by standard  poors or aaa by moodys investors service inc in selecting bonds for the portfolio of each insured trust the sponsor has applied the criteria herein before described what is the federal tax status of unit holders see part three for each trust for information with respect to exemption from state or other local taxes see part three for each trust what are the expenses and charges with the exception of bookkeeping and other administrative services provided to the trusts for which the sponsor will be reimbursed in amounts as set forth under special trust information in each part one of this prospectus the sponsor will not receive any fee in connection with its activities relating to the trusts for series  and all subsequent series first trust advisors lp an affiliate of the sponsor will receive an annual supervisory fee which is not to exceed the amount set forth in part one for each trust for providing portfolio supervisory services for the trust such fee is based on the number of units outstanding in each trust on january  of each year except for trusts which were established subsequent to the last january  in which case the fee will be based on the number of units outstanding in such trusts as of the respective initial dates of deposit for each valuation of the bonds in a trust the evaluator will receive a fee as indicated in part one of this prospectus the trustee pays certain expenses of each trust for which it is reimbursed by such trust the trustee will receive for its ordinary recurring services to a trust an annual fee computed as indicated in part one of this prospectus for a discussion of the services performed by the trustee pursuant to its obligations under the indenture reference is made to the material set forth under rights of unit holders the trustees and evaluators fees are payable monthly on or before each distribution date from the interest account of each trust to the extent funds are available and then from the principal account of such trust since the trustee has the use of the funds being held in the principal and interest accounts for future distributions payment of expenses and redemptions and since such accounts are noninterestbearing to unit holders the trustee benefits thereby part of the trustees compensation for its services to the fund is expected to result from the use of these funds however the trustee may bear from its own resources certain expenses relating to a trust each of the above mentioned fees may be increased without approval of the unit holders by amounts not exceeding proportionate increases under the category all services less rent of shelter in the consumer price index published by the united states department of labor in addition with respect to the fees payable to the sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor for providing bookkeeping and other administrative services and supervisory services such individual fees may exceed the actual costs of providing such services for a trust but at no time will the total amount received for such services rendered to all unit investment trusts of which nike securities lp is the sponsor in any calendar year exceed the actual cost to the sponsor or its affiliate of supplying such services in such year the annualized cost of the portfolio insurance obtained by the fund for each insured trust is indicated in part one for each trust in a series of the fund the portfolio insurance continues so long as such trust retains the bonds thus insured premiums are payable monthly in advance by the trustee on behalf of such trust as bonds in the portfolio are redeemed by their respective issuers or are sold by the trustee the amount of premium will be reduced in respect of those bonds no longer owned by and held in the trust which were insured by insurance obtained by such trust preinsured bonds for which insurance has been obtained page  from financial guaranty andor ambac indemnity or beginning with series  and all subsequent series other insurers are not insured by such trust the premium payable for permanent insurance will be paid solely from the proceeds of the sale of such bond in the event the trustee exercises the right to obtain permanent insurance on a bond the premiums for such permanent insurance with respect to each bond will decline over the life of the bond an advantage trust is not insured accordingly there are no premiums for insurance payable by such trust the following additional charges are or may be incurred by a trust all expenses including legal and annual auditing expenses of the trustee incurred in connection with its responsibilities under the indenture except in the event of negligence bad faith or willful misconduct on its part the expenses and costs of any action undertaken by the trustee to protect the trust and the rights and interests of the unit holders fees of the trustee for any extraordinary services performed under the indenture indemnification of the trustee for any loss liability or expense incurred by it without negligence bad faith or willful misconduct on its part arising out of or in connection with its acceptance or administration of the trust indemnification of the sponsor for any loss liability or expense incurred without gross negligence bad faith or willful misconduct in acting as depositor of the trust all taxes and other government charges imposed upon the bonds or any part of the trust no such taxes or charges are being levied or made or to the knowledge of the sponsor are contemplated and expenditures incurred in contacting unit holders upon termination of the trust the above expenses and the trustees annual fee when paid or owing to the trustee are secured by a lien on the trust in addition the trustee is empowered to sell bonds of a trust in order to make funds available to pay all these amounts if funds are not otherwise available in the interest and principal accounts of the trust unless the sponsor determines that such an audit is not required the indenture requires the accounts of each trust to be audited on an annual basis at the expense of the trust by independent auditors selected by the sponsor so long as the sponsor is making a secondary market for units the sponsor shall bear the cost of such annual audits to the extent such cost exceeds  per unit unit holders of a trust covered by an audit may obtain a copy of the audited financial statements from the trustee upon request public offering how is the public offering price determined although it is not obligated to do so the sponsor intends to maintain a market for the units and continuously to offer to purchase units at prices subject to change at any time based upon the aggregate bid price of the bonds in the portfolio of each trust plus the amount of purchased interest of a trust if any and interest accrued to the date of settlement all expenses incurred in maintaining a market other than the fees of the evaluator and the costs of the trustee in transferring and recording the ownership of units will be borne by the sponsor if the supply of units exceeds demand or for some other business reason the sponsor may discontinue purchases of units at such prices if a unit holder wishes to dispose of his units he should inquire of the sponsor as to current market prices prior to making a tender for redemption to the trustee prospectuses relating to certain other bond funds indicate an intention subject to change on the part of the respective sponsors of such funds to repurchase units of those funds on the basis of a price higher than the bid prices of the securities in the funds consequently depending upon the prices actually paid the repurchase price of other sponsors for units of their funds may be computed on a somewhat more favorable basis than the repurchase price offered by the sponsor for units of a trust in secondary market transactions as in the first trust combined series the purchase price per unit of such bond funds will depend primarily on the value of the securities in the portfolio of the applicable trust the public offering price of units of a trust will be determined by adding to the evaluators determination of the aggregate bid price of the bonds in a trust plus the amount of purchased interest of a trust if any and the appropriate sales charge determined in accordance with the schedule set forth below based upon the number of years remaining to the maturity of each bond in the portfolio of the trust adjusting the total to reflect the amount of any cash held in or advanced to the principal account of the trust and dividing the result by the number of units of such trust then outstanding the minimum sales charge on units page  will be  of the public offering price equivalent to  of the net amount invested for purposes of computation bonds will be deemed to mature on their expressed maturity dates unless a the bonds have been called for redemption or funds or securities have been placed in escrow to redeem them on an earlier call date in which case such call date will be deemed to be the date upon which they mature or b such bonds are subject to a mandatory tender in which case such mandatory tender will be deemed to be the date upon which they mature the offering price of bonds in the trust may be expected to be greater than the bid price of such bonds by approximately  of the aggregate principal amount of such bonds the effect of this method of sales charge computation will be that different sales charge rates will be applied to each of the various bonds in the trusts based upon the maturities of such bonds in accordance with the following schedule download table secondary offering period sales charge percentage percentage of public of net offering amount years to maturity price invested     months to  year    but less than     but less than     but less than     but less than     but less than     but less than     but less than     but less than     but less than     or more   there will be no reduction of the sales charges for volume purchases a dealer will receive from the sponsor a dealer concession of  of the total sales charges for units sold by such dealer and dealers will not be eligible for additional concessions for units sold pursuant to the above schedule an investor may aggregate purchases of units of two or more consecutive series of a particular state national discount intermediate long intermediate or short intermediate trust for purposes of calculating the discount for volume purchases listed above additionally with respect to the employees officers and directors including their immediate family members defined as spouses children grandchildren parents grandparents mothersinlaw fathersinlaw sonsinlaw and daughters inlaw and trustees custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such person of the sponsor and brokerdealers and their subsidiaries and vendors providing services to the sponsor may purchase units of the trusts during the secondary market at the public offering price less the concession the sponsor typically allows brokerdealers any such reduced sales charge shall be the responsibility of the selling brokerdealer the reduced sales charge structure will apply on all purchases of units in a trust by the same person on any one day from the sponsor or any one brokerdealer and for purposes of calculating the applicable sales charge purchases of units in the fund will be aggregated with concurrent purchases by the same person from the sponsor or such brokerdealer of units in any series of taxexempt unit investment trusts sponsored by nike securities lp additionally units purchased in the name of the spouse of a purchaser or in the name of a child of such purchaser will be deemed for the purpose of calculating the applicable sales charge to be additional purchases by the purchaser the reduced sales charges will also be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing securities for a single trust estate or single fiduciary account from time to time the sponsor may implement programs under which brokerdealers and other selling agents of the fund may receive nominal awards from the sponsor for each of their registered representatives who have sold a minimum number of uit units during a specified time period in addition at various times the sponsor may implement other programs under which the sales force of brokerdealers and other selling agents may be eligible to win other nominal awards for certain sales efforts or under which the sponsor will reallow to any such brokerdealer or other selling agent that sponsors sales contests or recognition programs conforming to criteria established by the sponsor or participates in page  sales programs sponsored by the sponsor an amount not exceeding the total applicable sales charges on the sales generated by such person at the public offering price during such programs also the sponsor in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective criteria established by the sponsor pay fees to qualifying brokerdealers and other selling agents for certain services or activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of units of the trusts such payments are made by the sponsor out of its own assets and not out of the assets of the trusts these programs will not change the price unit holders pay for their units or the amount that the trusts will receive from the units sold a comparison of taxfree and equivalent taxable estimated current returns and estimated longterm returns with the returns on various taxable investments is one element to consider in making an investment decision the sponsor may from time to time in its advertising and sales materials compare the then current estimated returns on the trust and returns over specified periods on other similar trusts sponsored by nike securities lp with returns on taxable investments such as corporate or us government bonds bank cds and money market accounts or money market funds each of which has investment characteristics that may differ from those of the trust us government bonds for example are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government and bank cds and money market accounts are insured by an agency of the federal government money market accounts and money market funds provide stability of principal but pay interest at rates that vary with the condition of the shortterm debt market the investment characteristics of the trust are described more fully elsewhere in this prospectus the aggregate price of the bonds in each trust is determined by the evaluator the evaluator on the basis of bid prices  on the basis of current market prices for the bonds obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by the trust  if such prices are not available for any of the bonds on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds  by determining the value of the bonds by appraisal or  by any combination of the above unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in the sponsors opinion in significant risk of such default the evaluator will not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by an insured trust on the other hand the value of insurance obtained by the issuer of bonds in a trust is reflected and included in the market value of such bonds the evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default in payment of principal or interest or in the sponsors opinion in significant risk of such default the defaulted bonds and which are covered by insurance obtained by an insured trust the value of the insurance guaranteeing interest and principal payments the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of defaulted bonds assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premium attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of such defaulted bonds not covered by permanent insurance in addition the evaluator will consider the ability of financial guaranty andor ambac indemnity to meet its commitments under an insured trusts insurance policy including the commitments to issue permanent insurance it is the position of the sponsor that this is a fair method of valuing the bonds and the insurance obtained by an insured trust and reflects a proper valuation method in accordance with the provisions of the investment company act of  the evaluator will be requested to make a determination of the aggregate price of the bonds in each trust on a bid price basis as of the close of trading on the new york stock exchange on each day on which it is open effective for all sales purchases or redemptions made subsequent to the last preceding determination although payment is normally made three business days following the order for purchase payment may be made prior thereto a person will become owner of the units on the date of settlement provided payment has

of the sales charge paid by these customers is retained by or remitted to the banks in the amounts indicated in the amounts indicated above under the glasssteagall act banks are prohibited from

a current assessment of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation this assessment may take into consideration obligors such as guarantors insurers or lessees the bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold a security inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor the ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or obtained by standard  poors from other sources it considers reliable standard  poors does not perform an audit in connection with any rating and may on occasion rely on unaudited financial information the ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or for other circumstances the ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations l likelihood of defaultcapacity and willingness of the obligor as to the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation ll nature of and provisions of the obligation lll protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangements under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights aaabonds rated aaa have the highest rating assigned by standard  poors to a debt obligation capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong aabonds rated aa have a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal and differ from the highest rated issues only in small degree abonds rated a have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than bonds in higher rated categories bbbbonds rated bbb are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay interest and repay principal whereas they normally exhibit adequate protection parameters adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for bonds in this category than for bonds in higher rated categories plus  or minus  the ratings from aa to bbb may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories provisional ratings the letter p indicates that the rating is provisional a provisional rating assumes the successful completion of the project being financed by the bonds being rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the project this rating however while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the project makes no comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default upon failure of such completion the investor should exercise hisher own judgment with respect to such likelihood and risk credit watch credit watch highlights potential changes in ratings of bonds and other fixed income securities it focuses on events and trends which place companies and government units under special surveillance by sps member analytical staff these may include mergers voter referendums actions by regulatory authorities or developments gleaned from analytical reviews unless otherwise noted a rating decision will be made within  days issues appear on credit watch where an event situation or deviation from trends occurred and needs to be evaluated as to its impact on credit ratings a listing however does not mean a rating change is inevitable since sp continuously monitors all of its ratings credit watch is not intended to include all issues under review thus rating changes will occur without issues appearing on credit watch  as

investors service inc rating symbols and their meanings follow aaabonds which are rated aaa are judged to be of the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as gilt edge interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues their safety is so absolute that with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances characteristically their market value is affected solely by money market fluctuations aabonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the long term risks appear somewhat large than in aaa securities their market value is virtually immune to all but money market influences with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances abonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future the market value of arated bonds may be influenced to some degree by economic performance during a sustained period of depressed business conditions but during periods of normalcy arated bonds frequently move in parallel with aaa and aa obligations with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances a  and baa bonds which are rated a  and baa  offer the maximum in security within their quality group can be bought for possible upgrading in quality and additionally afford the investor an opportunity to gauge more precisely the relative attractiveness of offerings in the market place baabonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well the market value of baarated bonds is more sensitive to changes in economic circumstances and aside from occasional speculative factors applying to some bonds of this class baa market valuations will move in parallel with aaa aa and a obligations during periods of economic normalcy except in instances of oversupply moodys bond rating symbols may contain numerical modifiers of a generic rating classification the modifier  indicates that the bond ranks at the high end of its category the modifier  indicates a midrange ranking and the modifier  indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating category conbonds for which the security depends upon the completion of some act or the fulfillment of some condition are rated conditionally these are bonds secured by a earnings of projects under construction b earnings of projects unseasoned in operation experience c rentals which begin when facilities are completed or d payments to which some other limiting condition attaches parenthetical rating denotes probable credit stature upon completion of construction or elimination of basis of condition fitch investors service inc a brief description of the applicable fitch investors service inc rating symbols and their meanings follow aaabonds considered to be investment grade and of the highest credit quality the obligor has an exceptionally strong ability to pay interest and repay principal which is unlikely to be affected by reasonably foreseeable events aabonds considered to be investment grade and of very

validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from federal gross income were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities in addition with respect to state trusts where applicable bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption of interest on such bonds when held by residents of the state in which the issuers of such bonds are located from state income taxes and certain state or local intangibles and local income taxes neither the sponsor chapman and cutler nor any of the special counsel to the fund for state tax matters have made any special review for the fund of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds or of the bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith if the interest on a bond should be determined to be taxable the bond would generally have to be sold at a substantial discount in addition investors could be required to pay income tax on interest received prior to the date on which interest is determined to be taxable gain realized on the sale or redemption of the bonds by the trustee or of a unit by a unit holder is includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes and may be includable in gross income for state tax purposes such gain does not include any amounts received in respect of accrued interest or accrued original issue discount if any if a bond is acquired with accrued interest that portion of the price paid for the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the bond when this accrued interest is received it is treated as a return of capital and reduces the tax basis of the bond if a bond is purchased for a premium the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of the bond bond premium is amortized over the remaining term of the bond and the tax basis of the bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of the premium amortized in that tax year for purposes of the following opinions it is assumed that each asset of the trust is debt the interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes at the time of the closing for each trust chapman and cutler counsel for the sponsor rendered an opinion under then existing law substantially to the effect that  the trusts are not associations taxable as corporations for federal income tax purposes and interest and accrued original issue discount on bonds which is excludable from gross income under the internal revenue code of  the code will retain its status for federal income tax purposes when received by the trusts and distributed to a unit holder however such interest may be taken into account in computing the alternative minimum tax and the additional tax on branches of foreign corporations and the environmental tax the superfund tax as noted below see certain tax matters applicable to corporate unit holders all parts of the prospectus should be retained for future reference these securities have not been approved or disapproved by the securities and exchange commission nor has the commission passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this prospectus any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense page   each unit holder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of each asset of the respective trust under subpart e subchapter j of chapter  of the code and will have a taxable event when the trust disposes of a bond or when the unit holder redeems or sells his units if the unit holder disposes of a unit he is deemed thereby to have disposed of his entire pro rata interest in all assets of the trust involved including his pro rata portion of all the bonds represented by the unit the taxpayer relief act of  the  act includes provisions that treat certain transactions designed to reduce or eliminate risk of loss and opportunities for gain eg short sales offsetting notional principal contracts futures or forward contracts or similar transactions as constructive sales for purposes of recognition of gain but not loss and for purposes of determining the holding period unit holders should consult their own tax advisors with regard to any such constructive sale rules unit holders must reduce the tax basis of their units for their share of accrued interest received by the respective trust if any on bonds before the date the trust acquired ownership of the bonds and the amount of this reduction may exceed the amount of accrued interest paid to the seller and consequently such unit holders may have an increase in taxable gain or reduction in capital loss upon the disposition of such units gain or loss upon the sale or redemption of units is measured by comparing the proceeds of such sale or redemption with the adjusted basis of the units if the trustee disposes of bonds whether by sale payment on maturity redemption or otherwise gain or loss is recognized to the unit holder subject to various nonrecognition provisions of the code the amount of any such gain or loss is measured by comparing the unit holders pro rata share of the total proceeds from such disposition with the unit holders basis for his or her fractional interest in the asset disposed of in the case of a unit holder who purchases units such basis before adjustment for accrued original issue discount and amortized bond premium if any is determined by apportioning the cost of the units among each of the trust assets ratably according to value as of the valuation date nearest the date of acquisition of the units unit holders should consult their own tax advisers with regard to the calculation of basis the tax basis reduction requirements of the code relating to amortization of bond premium may under some circumstances result in the unit holder realizing a taxable gain when his units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than his original cost and  any insurance proceeds paid under individual policies obtained by issuers of bonds which represent maturing interest on defaulted bonds held by the trustee will be excludable from federal gross income if and to the same extent as such interest would have been so excludable if paid in the normal course by the issuer of the defaulted bonds provided that at the time such policies are purchased the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the bonds rather than the insurer will pay debt service on the bonds sections  and  of the code provide a complex set of rules governing the accrual of original issue discount these rules provide that original issue discount accrues either on the basis of a constant compound interest rate or ratably over the term of the bond depending on the date the bond was issued in addition special rules apply if the purchase price of a bond exceeds the original issue price plus the amount of original issue discount which would have previously accrued based upon its issue price its adjusted issue price to prior owners if a bond is acquired with accrued interest that portion of the price paid for the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the bond when this accrued interest is received it is treated as a return of capital and reduces the tax basis of the bond if a bond is purchased for a premium the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of the bond bond premium is amortized over the remaining term of the bond and the tax basis of the bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of the premium amortized in that tax year the application of these rules will also vary depending on the value of the bond on the date a unit holder acquires his unit and the price the unit holder pays for his unit unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these rules and their application see portfolio appearing in part one for each trust for information relating to bonds if any issued at an original issue discount the revenue reconciliation act of  the tax act subjects tax exempt bonds to the market discount rules of the code effective for bonds purchased after april   in general market discount is the amount if any by which the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds an investors purchase price except to the extent that such difference page  if any is attributable to original issue discount not yet accrued subject to statutory de minimis rule market discount can arise based on the price a trust pays for bonds or the price a unit holder pays for his or her units under the tax act accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income under prior law the accretion had been treated as capital gain market discount that accretes while a trust holds a bond would be recognized as ordinary income by the unit holders when principal payments are received on the bond upon sale or at redemption including early redemption or upon the sale or redemption of his or her units unless a unit holder elects to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues the market discount rules are complex and unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these rules and their application counsel for the sponsor has also advised that under section  of the code interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry units of a trust is not deductible for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue service has taken the position that such indebtedness need not be directly traceable to the purchase or carrying of units however these rules generally do not apply to interest paid on indebtedness incurred to purchase or improve a personal residence also under section  of the code certain financial institutions that acquire units generally would not be able to deduct any of the interest expense attributable to ownership of units legislative proposals have been made that would extend the financial institution rules to certain other corporations including securities dealers and other financial intermediaries investors with questions regarding these issues should consult with their tax advisers in the case of certain of the bonds in a trust the opinions of bond counsel indicate that interest on such bonds received by a substantial user of the facilities being financed with the proceeds of these bonds or persons related thereto for periods while such bonds are held by such a user or related person will not be excludable from federal gross income although interest on such bonds received by others would be excludable from federal gross income substantial user and related person are defined under the code and us treasury regulations any person who believes he or she may be a substantial user or related person as so defined should contact his tax adviser all statements of law in the prospectus concerning

bodies the agencies andor by other entities located within the state including the city of new york the city some of the more significant events and conditions relating to the financial situation in new york are summarized below this section provides only a brief summary of the complex factors affecting the financial situation in new york and is derived from sources that are generally available to investors and is believed to be accurate it is based in part on official statements and prospectuses issued by and on other information reported by the state the city and the agencies in connection with the issuance of their respective securities there can be no assurance that current or future statewide or regional economic difficulties and the resulting impact on state or local government finances generally will not adversely affect the market value of new york municipal obligations held in the portfolios of the trusts or the ability of particular obligors to make timely payments of debt service on or relating to those obligations page   the state the state has historically been one of the wealthiest states in the nation for decades however the state economy has grown more slowly than that of the nation as a whole gradually eroding the states relative economic affluence statewide urban centers have experienced significant changes involving migration of the more affluent to the suburbs and an influx of generally less affluent residents regionally the older northeast cities have suffered because of the relative success that the south and the west have had in attracting people and business the city has also had to face greater competition as other major cities have developed financial and business capabilities which make them less dependent on the specialized services traditionally available almost exclusively in the city the state has for many years had a very high state and local tax burden relative to other states the burden of state and local taxation in combination with the many other causes of regional economic dislocation has contributed to the decisions of some businesses and individuals to relocate outside or not locate within the state however the states  budget reflected significant actions to reduce the burden of state taxation including adoption of a year  reduction in the states personal income tax during  new york led the nation in tax cuts at  bringing the total value of tax reductions in effect for the  year to over  billion annual savings are intended to grow to  billion by  when measured as a percentage of personal income stateimposed taxes in new york should be below the national median in  the budget for fiscal year  proposes an additional  million in tax reductions slowdown of regional economy a national recession commenced in mid  economic recovery started considerably later in the state than in the nation as a whole due in part to the significant retrenchment in the banking and financial services industries downsizing by several major corporations cutbacks in defense spending and an oversupply of office buildings in the last few years new york has shown signs of economic resurgence new york has gone from last in the nation in percentage of private sector employment growth to a level that is on par with the national average gaining  private sector jobs since december  overall employment growth was close to  for  national employment growth in  was estimated at  the new york economy in  is expected to grow at about the same rate as in  many uncertainties exist in forecasts of both the national and state economies and there can be no assurance that the state economy will perform at a level sufficient to meet the states projections of receipts and disbursements personal income is expected to increase  in  and  in   fiscal year the  general fund financial plan continues to be balanced with a projected surplus of  billion this will be the third consecutive budget surplus generated by the governors administration of this amount  million is being used to finance onetime costs related to an extra th payroll and rd medicaid cycle  million due to the cyclical timing of these payments and to provide harddollar financing for capital projects of the community enhancement facilities assistance program which were previously anticipated to be supported with bond proceeds proposed tax cut accelerations account for the use of another  million of the surplus of the remainder  million is being used to finance  executive budget recommendations and  million is being deposited into the tax stabilization reserve fund the states rainy day fund as provided by the constitution this is the third consecutive extraordinary deposit in the rainy day fund and increases the size of that fund to  million by the end of  the highest balance ever achieved the surplus results primarily from growth in projected receipts as compared to the enacted budget revenues increased by  billion while disbursements increased by only  million these changes from midyear financial plan projections reflect actual results through december  as well as modified economic and caseload projections for the balance of the fiscal year the general fund is projected to be balanced on a cash basis for the  fiscal year total receipts and transfers from other funds are projected to be  billion an increase of  billion from total receipts in the prior fiscal year total general fund disbursements and transfers to other funds are projected to be  billion an increase of  billion from the total amount disbursed in the prior fiscal year the general fund closing balance is expected to be  million at the end of  of this amount  million will be on deposit in the tax stabilization reserve fund tsrf while another  million will be page  on deposit in the contingency reserve fund crf after a  million deposit in  the tsrf had an opening balance of  million to be supplemented by a required payment of  million and an extraordinary maximum deposit of  million from surplus  monies in recent years state actions affecting the level of receipts and disbursements as well as the relative strength of the state and regional economy actions of the federal government and other factors have created structural gaps for the state these gaps resulted from a significant disparity between recurring revenues and the costs of maintaining or increasing the level of support for state programs as noted the  enacted budget combines significant tax and program reductions which will in the current and future years lower both the recurring receipts base before the effect of any economic stimulus from such tax reductions and the historical annual growth in state program spending notwithstanding these changes the state can expect to continue to confront structural deficits in future years one major uncertainty to the  state financial plan continues to be risks related to the economy and tax collections which could produce either favorable or unfavorable variances during the balance of the year it is possible that recent changes could produce slower economic growth and a deterioration in state receipts an additional risk to the  state financial plan arises from the potential impact of certain litigation now pending against the state which could produce adverse effects on the states projections of receipts and disbursements  fiscal year general fund receipts in  will reflect the initial phases of the star property tax reduction program as well as the continuing impact of other  and earlier tax reduction accomplishments in addition the  budget reflects several tax reduction proposals that will reduce receipts available to the general fund by about  million during the fiscal year recurring growth in the state general fund tax base is projected to be nearly  during   that growth rate is lower than that achieved in  or currently estimated for  and roughly equivalent to the rate experienced in  total general fund receipts for  are projected at  billion an increase of more than  billion from the revised  estimate the largest source of receipts is the sales and use tax which accounts for nearly  of projected receipts total general fund spending in the  executive budget is projected to increase  billion of  from the current year the average annual increase since  is  this rate is below the rate of inflation and much lower than the average annual increase of  prior to  educations recommended share of general fund spending is  in  and criminal justice spending is  medicaid and welfare spending growth has been reduced reflecting medicaid and welfare reforms implemented since  the  financial plan includes approximately  million in non recurring resources the lowest projected level ever recorded in fiscal year  through  the average annual level of onetimers was approximately  million the projected  closing fund balance of  million in the general fund is composed of monies available in the tsrf and the crf an additional deposit of  million will supplement the  million balance in the crf increasing that amount available for possible litigation risks to  million in  on november   the court of appeals the states highest court affirmed the decision of a lower court in three actions which declared unconstitutional state actuarial funding methods for determining state and local contributions to the state employee retirement system following the decision the state comptroller developed a plan to phase in a constitutional funding method and to restore prior funding levels of the retirement systems over a fouryear period the plan is not expected to require the state to make additional contributions with respect to the  fiscal year nor to materially and adversely affect the states financial condition thereafter through fiscal year  the state expects to contribute  million more to the retirement plans than would have been required under the prior funding method future fiscal years there can be no assurance that the state will not face substantial potential budget gaps in the future resulting from a significant disparity between tax revenues projected from a lower recurring receipts base and the spending required to maintain state programs at current levels to address any potential budgetary imbalance the state may need to take significant actions to align recurring receipts and disbursements indebtedness as of march   the total amount of longterm state general obligation debt authorized but unissued stood at  billion page  as of the same date the state had approximately  billion in outstanding general obligation debt including  million of bond anticipation notes bans outstanding as of march    billion of bonds issued in

for capital purposes during the states  fiscal year will consist of  million in general obligation bonds and bans and  million in general obligation commercial paper the legislature has also authorized the issuance of  million in certificates of participation including costs of issuance reserve funds and other costs during the states  fiscal year for equipment purchases the projection of the state regarding its borrowings for the  fiscal year may change if actual receipts fall short of state projections or if other circumstances require in june  legislation was enacted creating the new york local government assistance corporation lgac a public benefit corporation empowered to issue longterm obligations to fund certain payments to local governments traditionally funded through the states annual seasonal borrowing as of june  lgac had issued bonds and notes to provide net proceeds of  billion and has been authorized to issue its bonds to provide net proceeds of up to

corporation mac the city accounts for approximately  of the states population and personal income and the citys financial health affects the state in numerous ways in response to the citys fiscal crisis in  the state took a number of steps to assist the city in returning to fiscal stability among other actions the state legislature i created mac to assist with long term financing for the citys shortterm debt and other cash requirements and ii created the state financial control board the control board to review and approve the citys budgets and city four year financial plans the financial plans also apply to certain city related public agencies the covered organizations from  to  the rate of economic growth in the city slowed substantially the citys economic improvement significantly accelerated in fiscal year  resulting in an unusually high acrosstheboard increase in tax receipts much of the increase can be traced to the performance of the securities industry but the citys economy has produced gains in retail trade tourism and in business services in  the city experienced the largest private sector job growth in the last  years pursuant to state law the city prepares a fouryear annual financial plan which is reviewed and revised on a quarterly basis and which includes the citys capital revenue and expense projections the city is required to submit its financial plans to review bodies including the control board if the city were to experience certain adverse financial circumstances including the occurrence or the substantial likelihood and imminence of the occurrence of an annual operating deficit of more than  million or the loss of access to the public credit markets to satisfy the citys capital and seasonal financial requirements the control board would be required by state law to exercise certain powers including prior approval of city financial plans proposed borrowings and certain contracts the city depends on the state for state aid both to enable the city to balance its budget and to meet its cash requirements if the state experiences revenue shortfalls or spending increases beyond its projections during its  fiscal year or subsequent years such developments could result in reductions in projected state aid to the city in addition there can be no assurance that state budgets in future fiscal years will be adopted by the april  statutory deadline page  and that there will not be adverse effects on the citys cash flow and additional city expenditures as a result of such delays the mayor is responsible for preparing the citys fouryear financial plan including the citys current financial plan the city projections set forth in its financial plan are based on various assumptions and contingencies which are uncertain and which may not materialize changes in major assumptions could significantly affect the citys ability to balance its budget as required by state law and to meet its annual cash flow and financing requirements such assumptions and contingencies include the condition of the regional and local economies the absence of wage increases in excess of the increases assumed in its financial plan employment growth provision of state and federal aid and mandate relief state legislative approval of future state budgets levels of education expenditures as may be required by state law adoption of future city budgets by the new york city council and approval by the governor or the state legislature and the cooperation of mac with respect to various other actions proposed in such financial plan attaining a balanced budget is also dependent upon the citys ability to market its securities successfully in the public credit markets the citys financing program for fiscal years  through  contemplates the issuance of  billion of general obligation bonds primarily to reconstruct and rehabilitate the citys infrastructure and physical assets and to make capital investments in addition the city issues revenue and tax anticipation notes to finance its seasonal working capital requirements the terms and success of projected public sales of city general obligation bonds and notes will be subject to prevailing market conditions at the time of the sale and no assurance can be given that the credit markets will absorb the projected amounts of public bond and note sales future developments concerning the city and public discussion of such developments the citys future financial needs and other issues may affect the market for outstanding city general obligation bonds and notes if the city were unable to sell its general obligation bonds and notes it would be prevented from meeting its planned operating and capital expenditures  financial plan on july   the city submitted to the control board the  financial plan which relates to the city the board of education and the city university of new york the  financial plan is based on the citys expense and capital budgets for the citys  fiscal year which were adopted on june   and sets forth proposed actions by the city for the  fiscal year to close substantial projected budget gaps resulting from lower than projected tax receipts and other revenues and greater than projected expenditures in addition to substantial proposed agency expenditure reductions and productivity efficiency and labor initiatives negotiated with the citys labor unions the  financial plan reflects a strategy to substantially reduce spending for entitlements for the  and subsequent fiscal years  financial plan in january  the new york city mayor announced the citys financial plan for fiscal years  for the second year in a row the new york city fouryear financial plan contains a record surplus of more than  billion since the adoption of the fiscal year  budget the city is now forecasting additional resources of  billion approximately  will be used to reduce the outyear gaps  will fund targeted educational public safety and other initiatives and  will be used to reduce taxes further to reduce the outyear gaps the city has imposed fiscal discipline on the rate of growth of city spending which has over the last four years been held below the rate of inflation for fiscal year  the proposed cityfunded spending increase will be held to  the budget stabilization account established for the first time in  will be maintained in fiscal year  at  million with an additional  million created for fiscal year  as a result of this fiscal planning the outyear gaps have been cut in half compared to six years ago fiscal year  was  billion and fiscal year  is  billion according to recent staff reports while economic recovery in new york city has been slower than in other regions of the country a surge in wall street profitability resulted in increased tax revenues and generated a substantial surplus for the city in city fiscal year   although several sectors of the citys economy have expanded recently especially tourism and business and professional services city tax revenues remain heavily dependent on the continued profitability of the securities industry and the course of the national economy these reports have also indicated that recent city budgets have been balanced in part through the use of nonrecurring resources that the citys financial plan tends to rely on actions outside its direct page  control that the city has not yet brought its longterm expenditure growth in line with recurring revenue growth and that the city is therefore likely to continue to face substantial gaps between forecast revenues and expenditures in future years that must be closed with reduced expenditures andor increased revenues given the foregoing factors there can be no assurance that the city will continue to maintain a balanced budget or that it can maintain a balanced budget without additional tax or other revenue increases or reductions in city services which could adversely affect the citys economic base litigation the city is a defendant in a significant number of lawsuits such litigation includes but is not limited to actions commenced and claims asserted against the city arising out of alleged constitutional violations torts breaches of contracts and other violations of law and condemnation proceedings while the ultimate outcome and fiscal impact if any on the proceedings and claims are not currently predictable adverse determinations in certain of them might have a material adverse effect upon the citys ability to carry out its financial plan the  financial plan includes

agencies certain agencies of the state have faced substantial financial difficulties which could adversely affect the ability of such agencies to make payments of interest on and principal amounts of their respective bonds the difficulties have in certain instances caused the state under socalled moral obligation provisions which are nonbinding statutory provisions for state appropriations to maintain various debt service reserve funds to appropriate funds on behalf of the agencies moreover it is expected that the problems faced by these agencies will continue and will require increasing amounts of state assistance in future years failure of the state to appropriate necessary amounts or to take other action to permit those agencies having financial difficulties to meet their obligations could result in a default by one or more of the agencies such default if it were to occur would be likely to have a significant adverse effect on investor confidence in and therefore the market price of obligations of the defaulting agencies in addition any default in payment on any general obligation of any agency whose bonds contain a moral obligation provision could constitute a failure of certain conditions that must be satisfied in connection with federal guarantees of city and mac obligations and could thus jeopardize the citys long term financing plans  state litigation the state is a defendant in numerous legal proceedings pertaining to matters incidental to the performance of routine governmental operations such litigation includes but is not limited to claims asserted against the state arising from alleged torts alleged breaches of contracts condemnation proceedings and other alleged violations of state and federal laws included in the states outstanding litigation are a number of cases challenging the constitutionality or the adequacy and effectiveness of a variety of significant social welfare programs primarily involving the states mental hygiene programs adverse judgments in these matters generally could result in injunctive relief coupled with prospective changes in page  patient care which could require substantial increased financing of the litigated programs in the future the state is also engaged in a variety of claims wherein significant monetary damages are sought in  a civil rights claim alleging intentional school segregation in yonkers has resulted in a  million judgment for plaintiffs that the state must pay adverse developments in the foregoing proceedings or new proceedings could adversely affect the financial condition of the state in the future  other municipalities certain localities in addition to new york city could have financial problems leading to requests for additional state assistance and the need to reduce their spending or increase their revenues the potential impact on the state of such actions by localities is not included in projections of state receipts and expenditures in the states  fiscal year fiscal difficulties experienced by the city of yonkers yonkers resulted in the reestablishment of the financial control board for the city of yonkers the yonkers board by the state in  the yonkers board is charged with oversight of the fiscal affairs of yonkers future actions taken by the governor or the state legislature to assist yonkers could result in increased state expenditures for extraordinary local assistance beginning in  the city of troy experienced a series of budgetary deficits that resulted in the establishment of a supervisory board for the city of troy in  the supervisory boards powers were increased in  when troy mac was created to help troy avoid default on certain obligations the legislation creating troy mac prohibits the city of troy from seeking federal bankruptcy protection while troy mac bonds are outstanding troy mac has issued bonds to effect a restructuring of the city of troys obligations eighteen municipalities received extraordinary assistance during the  legislative session through  million in special appropriations targeted for distressed cities aid that was largely continued in  twentyeight municipalities are scheduled to share the more than  million in targeted unrestricted aid allocated in the  budget an additional  million will be dispersed among all cities towns and villages a  increase in general purpose state aid municipalities and school districts have engaged in substantial short term and longterm borrowings in  the total indebtedness of all localities in the state other than new york city was approximately  billion approximately  million of that indebtedness represented borrowing to finance budgetary deficits and was issued pursuant to state enabling legislation state law requires the comptroller to review and make recommendations concerning the budgets of those local government units other than new york city authorized by state law to issue debt to finance deficits during the period that such deficit financing is outstanding eighteen localities had outstanding indebtedness for deficit financing at the close of their fiscal year ending in  from time to time federal expenditure reductions could reduce or in some cases eliminate federal funding of some local programs and accordingly might impose substantial increased expenditure requirements on affected localities if the state new york city or any of the agencies were to suffer serious financial difficulties jeopardizing their respective access to the public credit markets the marketability of notes and bonds issued by localities within the state including notes or bonds in the new york trust could be adversely affected localities also face anticipated and potential problems resulting from certain pending litigation judicial decisions and longrange economic trends the longrange potential problems of declining urban population increasing expenditures and other economic trends could adversely affect localities and require increasing state assistance in the future  other issuers of new york municipal obligations there are a number of other agencies instrumentalities and political subdivisions of the state that issue municipal obligations some of which may be conduit revenue obligations payable from payments from private borrowers these entities are subject to various economic risks and uncertainties and the credit quality of the securities issued by them may vary considerably from the credit quality of obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the state the foregoing

conditions to which the issuers of bonds held by the new york trusts are subject additionally many factors including national economic social and environmental policies and conditions which are not
