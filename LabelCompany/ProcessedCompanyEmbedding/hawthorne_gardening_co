fortune  giants quietly snuck into the cannabis industry in its quest to invest a halfbillion dollars in the marijuanacentric hydroponics space gardening giant scotts is one of the first corporate behemoths to gamble on americas burgeoning legal cannabis industry sharessharetweetredditwhatsappmailprintgoogletumblrpinterestlinkedinpocketdiggstumbleupon published sep    am • updated sep    am by alicia wallace the cannabist staff scotts miraclegro built a multibillion dollar business by being a market leader across several categories of the lawnandgarden industry the problem those categories weren’t growing all that fast to augment sales scotts took a page out of big beer’s playbook and crafted a wholly owned subsidiary called the hawthorne gardening co to create and capture portions of the booming urban gardening and hydroponics market — an industry bolstered by homegrowers of cannabis scotts’ ceo jim hagedorn and his son chris who heads hawthorne both have put it bluntly they’re betting big on legal marijuana and believe that with a couple of strategic investments they can quickly build  billion in new revenue chris hagedorn general manager of hawthorne spoke with the cannabist about scotts’ plays in hydroponics — moves that analysts say could set the stage for other large companies to invest in the legal marijuana market “i think there’s a bigger market out there” chris hagedorn said “it’s a phenomenal growing technique you can grow plants bigger faster in a more controlled manner … right now we’re squarely focused on what’s made this business successful highvalue crops” dipping toes in the water it all started in boulder colo in early  boulderbased aerogrow international a maker of indoor gardens was continuing to claw its way out of a rough patch that included a shift in business model low liquidity layoffs and a going concern qualification from its auditors indicating that the company may not be financially viable in the future at that time the younger hagedorn was cutting his teeth at scotts by working regional sales and marketing out of the company’s port washington ny office the experience there was worthwhile but hagedorn saw greater opportunity beyond the core lawnandgarden business he approached his father and volleyed up the idea of urban gardening beyond aerogrow urban gardening had a dearth of products and major players at that time chris hagedorn said and scotts’ line of offerings were not designed for the urban gardener’s needs space considerations and storage capabilities that’s when scotts took a closer gander at aerogrow “we saw a business that was in a tough position” chris hagedorn said adding that scotts decided to “place a small bet and see how it went” scotts miraclegro cannabis connections big buyouts

t’s hats hoodies at cannabist shop scotts’ smg growing media subsidiary invested  million to secure a roughly  percent stake in aerogrow the foray was fruitful for both entities said hagedorn and j michael wolfe aerogrow’s president and chief executive officer the  million infusion and scotts’ support allowed aerogrow to retire some debt inject life into new product development and gain access to broad retail channels wolfe wrote via email since scotts acquired the equity stake in april  aerogrow nearly tripled its sales to  million in its  fiscal year from  million in  wolfe said the company’s growth has been accelerating with a  percent sales increase in the business’ justcompleted first quarter of fiscal year  he added scotts’ smg subsidiary which now has a  percent stake in aerogrow disclosed earlier this year that it may elect to increase its stake in the boulder company to  percent via a warrant exercise according to documents filed with the us securities and exchange commission enter hawthorne in  with the initial results out of aerogrow trending positive scotts upped its game in hydroponics by creating a subsidiary called the hawthorne gardening co to manage some unique scotts brands such as black magic potting soil and wrap in natural and organic offerings as well as hydroponics supplies the company forged a small team and envisioned operating this indoor gardening group separate from scotts as a whole — much like how multinational beer giants approach their craft beerfocused brands to an outsider it’s not obvious that scotts owns hawthorne it appears as if it’s a smaller and completely different firm said analyst joseph altobello who covers scotts miraclegro for investment company raymond james hagedorn and crew traveled to chicago to meet with millercoors brass to learn more about the tenth and blake beer co the division responsible for brands such as blue moon crispin and killian’s hagedorn said he was intrigued at how operators of the tenth and blake division steered aspects such as creativity and marketing while the backofthehouse tasks would be passed along to the big guns upstairs “that was the concept … allow us to focus on the fun stuff that really matters allow the mothership to really worry about the other stuff” hagedorn said hawthorne gardening company’s general manager chris hagedorn visits the aerogrow international facility in boulder on aug   aerogrow manufactures indoor garden systems joe amon the denver post another parallel to the beer industry can be drawn in scotts’ acquisition strategy much like how anheuserbusch inbev has been trotting around the united states buying wellestablished regional craft brewers hawthorne gardening co has dropped large sums of cash to wrap in the sector leaders across the hydroponics industry first came the  million buyout of californiabased general hydroponics a maker of nutrients and hydroponics systems “when we first started doing the general hydroponics deal we thought we were ahead of the game” he said then hagedorn started to notice other suitors sniffing around hydroponics companies on the scotts and hawthorne wish lists so hawthorne picked up the pace and accelerated its plans snapping up lighting company gavita and nutrients firm botanicare he said the acquirees were all successful on their own and hagedorn said he was well aware of potential integration troubles — and cautious too about the “well intentioned but potentially harmful” influence of scotts “we were really worried about the cultural impact within general hydroponics” he said “without intending to are we going to shove too much corporate bullshit down their throats” hawthorne now is about twothirds of its way to a goal of investing  million in the hydroponics space and expects to pull back from additional major transactions in the sector officials told investors in early august the subsidiary has recorded a sales spike of  percent from last year and is on pace to surpass  million in revenue general hydroponics’ sales growth has ran at a consistent  percent tick and has seen revenue upswings each time a new state legalizes marijuana in some capacity he said “i’m not going to lie the lion’s share of general hydroponics business in north america is cannabis growers” he said “i’m not going to pretend otherwise” if aerogrow were to start catering to growers of the “highvalue crop” of marijuana it would take some tweaks of the aerogarden’s technology hagedorn said aerogrow’s wolfe when addressing this topic said that his company is developing larger aerogardens that can produce bigger harvests “our mission is to make the world’s best smart indoor gardens” wolfe wrote “we’re in development of several new products designed to grow bigger crops and harvests than ever we’ll leave it to our customers what they might want to grow with this new generation of aerogardens” in a longterm view hagedorn said he’s excited about the potential that these hydroponic systems could have in providing sustenance in places where the local food supply is unreliable or the land isn’t suitable for growing food big money big influence it makes sense that scotts would want to augment its growth by expanding into other areas such as organics and hydroponics said raymond james’ altobello the cannabis industry’s role in the latter may generate some snickers on wall street but legalization is happening across the country he said “i think it’s a matter of time before you see more states legalize it” he said “and scotts wants to be able to supply that industry

met with skepticism from scotts’ board of directors said harrison phillips an analyst with viridian capital advisors a new yorkbased financial advisory firm in the cannabis industry ultimately though money talks “they’re hunting for growth and their investors are looking for growth” he said if the efforts prove to be financially successful they may ultimately lower the risk tolerance not only for scotts but also for other large firms that are sitting on the sidelines for now said scott greiper viridian’s president greiper said that “other than scotts there have been no substantially large” companies making a move into the market todate “the emergence of the largescale very wellcapitalized acquirer is critical to bring more institutional private equity more professional investors in this space” an additional factor noted by greiper is the “emergence of the exit” — a means such as an acquisition or a public offering which would allow investors to capitalize on their financial ventures the obvious entrants and potential acquirers in the cannabis industry greiper said include pharmaceutical companies traditional commodity growers such as tobacco agrochemical firms such as monsanto liquor companies interested in buying infused products brands and then software companies across all aspects of the industry earlier this year microsoft corp entered into a partnership with kind financial a seedtosale services provider in the industry most large companies are holding back as marijuana remains federally illegal but also because the industry is just over  billion in sales he said noting the former greiper said that scotts’ board has been reticent about jim hagedorn’s ideas related to genetically modified cannabis as that would move the company beyond just an ancillary capacity competitive concerns the emergence of scotts let alone the potential other companies in greiper’s list above has caused some queasiness in the industry said michael bologna founder and ceo of green lion partners a denverbased company that works closely with startups in cannabis the firm founded natural order supply a distributor of supplychain products such as hvacs recurring consumables and nutrient lines various message boards dedicated to hydroponics include threads about the fears and potential consequences of moves made by scotts a firm that partners with monsanto co “the pushback is the reputational risk that scotts brings to the table with its relationship with monsanto and scotts’ history of selling chemicalbased environmentally damaging products” bologna said marijuana matures at the medicine man dispensary and grow operation in northeast denver in december  ed andrieski associated press file not all garden companies are concerned about the emergence of a deeppocketed competitor johnpaul maxfield founder of denverbased waste farmers has positioned his b corporation as the “whole foods to the cargills and monsantos” of the agriculture industry with an eye on having a positive influence on the community and environment waste farmers’ natural and organic batch line of soils are marketed to who maxfield views as the “new breed of farmer” the legal professional cannabis grower “they don’t know this farmer and acquisitions aren’t going to help them know it” maxfield said of scotts “there’s no concern on that end” maxfield’s optimism is boosted by the  percent annual sales growth his company has recorded and the initial traction gained by the organic cannabis association an organization he cofounded the oca’s mission is to develop organic standards for the production of legal marijuana he said maxfield noting scotts’ partnership with monsanto argues that hawthorne gardening has a financial disincentive to push an organic and sustainable system like waste farmers is promoting “there always needs to be a david and goliath” he said “for jim hagedorn and his generation that line of thinking makes sense i think it’s a reflection of being out of touch with where the market is going from a competitive perspective i’m thrilled that they’re of that mindset because it means they’re going to lose in the end from a practical perspective i think that disruption happens at the fringes” chris hagedorn is well aware of the rebuke scotts and hawthorne have received the negative reaction “bums me out” hagedorn said “i get it i totally get it” he said “at hawthorne we really do try to think of ourselves and we feel like a small business but i know we’re a subsidiary of scotts … we’re not going to pull the wool over their eyes” hagedorn said he hopes that the opposition within the industry will warm up to hawthorne in the years to come and closely watch how the company behaves within the industry “i hope they’ve seen that we aren’t the bogeyman that they thought we were” he said topics cannabis cultivation chris hagedorn commercial marijuana growing hawthorne gardening co home growing indoors investing jim
