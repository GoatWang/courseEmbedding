of the lower house approve a host of central banks including the fed ecb boe and boc showed signs of reducing monetary accommodation that has been heavily prescribed since the financial crisis with economic growth on sound footing federal reserve officials raised the policy rate above  – the third increase in six months – and officially provided some details on how the fed will shrink its  trillion balance sheet the fed plans to gradually end reinvestments from maturing treasuries and mortgagebacked securities starting sometime this year while frontend treasury yields drifted higher this was quickly overshadowed by rate moves in europe where markets took ecb president draghi’s comments on a strengthening recovery as hints that the ecb may soon trim its bondbuying program the comments came amid sturdier eurozone manufacturing and multiyear highs in business and consumer confidence in the uk yearoveryear inflation of  prompted boe governor mark carney and three voting members to suggest rate hikes may soon be appropriate the pound jumped and rates moved sharply higher the hawkish shift in tone from central banks drove interest rates higher and yield curves flatter while oil prices slumped into a bear market though the year us treasury yield touched  during the month – the lowest level since november  – the shift in tone from key central bankers sparked a latemonth selloff in bonds that quickly spread across the globe while frontend yields rose across developed markets dm a tepid nearterm outlook for inflation kept a lid on longerdated rates oil prices tumbled as lingering fears of oversupply underscored skepticism of the opec deal to stabilize prices and the us dollar slipped for the fourth month in a row against a basket of dm currencies despite rising dm rates and falling commodity prices emerging markets em were broadly stable and both local currency debt and equities gained on the month chinese markets were in the spotlight as global index provider msci elected to include local aclass shares in its benchmark emerging market equity indices for the first time a milestone symbolizing the integration of china’s equities with the global markets opportunistic tightening the fed raised interest rates for the third time since december  and announced plans to start unwinding its balance sheet later this year yet financial conditions have actually eased since the start of the year owing in part to lower treasury yields higher equity prices and a weaker us dollar while that may seem counterintuitive the fed’s current hiking cycle has more to do with getting away from the dreaded zerobound than it does with a traditional “tightening” of conditions to slow an overheating economy thus the fed is taking the opportunity to gain room to maneuver without upsetting solid if lackluster growth in the markets emerging markets’ resilience driven by export linkages emerging market em bonds and commodity prices – particularly crude oil – have historically exhibited a high correlation with one another however returns have decoupled quite dramatically thus far in  em local bonds have gained  while brent crude oil prices are nearly  per barrel or about  lower the breakdown in the traditional relationship between em and oil prices has a few potential explanations first oil price softness has been driven by a supply overhang while global demand has remained robust second the drop in oil prices has coincided with a weaker us dollar and stronger local currencies attracting capital flows into em last em fundamentals appear encouraging and diminished inflationary pressures are allowing em central banks to ease policies and stimulate growth equities developed market stocks returned  as the technology sector’s momentum subsided and value outperformed growth for the first time this year in the us investors took the federal reserve’s rate hike in stride and equities returned  in europe markets interpreted comments by european central bank ecb president mario draghi as hawkish causing stocks to fall  japanese equities rose  on a weaker yen and relatively strong growth fundamentals in emerging markets stocks benefitted from relatively stable global market conditions and a strong technical backdrop returning  in brazil stocks rose  even as president michel temer was formally charged for his alleged involvement in an ongoing graft scandal which potentially threatened future reform in the country chinese equities returned  after msci announced the inclusion of mainland ashares in the msci emerging markets index indian equities fell  as markets assessed the potential impact of the country’s new goods and services tax scheduled to be introduced in july while russian stocks rose  developed market debt the year us treasury yield touched  during the month – the lowest level since november  – as most developed market dm rates rallied early in the month amid more political surprises including the outcome of the uk snap election however an apparent hawkish shift in tone from central banks late in the month sparked a global bond selloff and dm rates ended the month higher in the us the fed raised rates for the fourth time in this cycle and announced detailed plans to reduce its balance sheet by tapering reinvestments a shift in tone was also apparent from the ecb and the bank of england

supported by a further decline in unemployment high consumer confidence and expectations of personal income tax cuts in  we forecast core inflation to hover sideways this year at – owing to some softer trends of late with policy normalization underway we expect the fed to embark on reducing its balance sheet by gradually tapering its reinvestments in a predictable and transparent manner for the eurozone we expect growth will be in a range of ‒ in  revised higher from our forecast in march to reflect the stronger momentum this year while political uncertainty remains ahead of elections in germany and potentially italy the likelihood of disruptive populist outcomes has diminished in addition both fiscal and monetary policy are expansionary and the recovery in global trade growth supports exports and investment we anticipate core inflation remaining well short of the european central bank’s ecb “below but close to ” objective but the solid growth momentum will likely allow the ecb to taper and eventually end its purchases from early next year in the uk we expect growth to be in the range of – despite brexit reflecting robust momentum higher government spending and a

public sector credit bubble and private sector capital outflows will likely remain under control and we expect growth in a ‒ range in  as policymakers prioritize financial stability over economic stimulus ahead of the th national party congress in the fourth quarter any trade war with the us will likely involve words rather than action and we expect the yuan to depreciate gradually against the

expect mexico’s growth to be  with the potential for banxico to adopt an easier policy stance if inflationary pressures abate in sight the great unwind on  june the fed released the muchanticipated details for “normalizing” its trillion balance sheet later this year the fed plans to start reducing its holdings of treasuries and mortgagebacked securities mbs in a “gradual and predictable manner” with preannounced caps or limits on the dollar amounts it will allow to run off each month the fed does not intend to sell any assets but rather reinvest less and less of the maturing proceeds initially the caps will be set at  billion and  billion per month for treasuries and mbs respectively increasing every three months until they reach  billion and  billion these caps will remain in place to ensure a measured decline to its estimated optimal balance sheet size of around  trillion while the fed’s balancesheet expansion helped lower treasury and mbs yields shrinking the balance sheet may have a milder reverse effect the fed’s transparent approach is designed to avoid disrupting the bond markets in addition relatively attractive mbs valuations – as well as favorable technicals including higher demand from foreign investors and banks – may help mitigate any volatility that occurs appendix roadmap in the world a recap of world events including an update on global
