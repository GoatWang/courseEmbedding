interestonly class reflects exchangeable class ratings rationale the certificates are collateralized by  fixedrate loans secured by  properties the ratings are based on the collateral and the structure of the transaction moodys cmbs ratings methodology combines both commercial real estate and structured finance analysis based on commercial real estate analysis moodys determines the credit quality of each mortgage loan and calculates an expected loss on a loan specific basis under structured finance the credit enhancement for each certificate typically depends on the expected frequency severity and timing of future losses moodys also considers a range of qualitative issues as well as the transactions structural and legal aspects the credit risk of loans is determined primarily by two factors  moodys assessment of the probability of default which is largely driven by each loans dscr and  moodys assessment of the severity of loss upon a default which is largely driven by each loans ltv ratio the moodys actual dscr of x is slightly higher than the  conduitfusion transaction average of x the moodys stressed dscr of x is greater than the  conduitfusion transaction average of x moodys trust ltv ratio of  is lower than the  conduitfusion transaction average of  but higher than most pools securitized during  the dispersion of underlying credit is also worse than what was observed during  as five loans  of the pool balance have a moodys ltv ratio above  moodys also considers both loan level diversity and property level diversity when selecting a ratings approach with respect to loan level diversity the pools loan level includes cross collateralized and cross defaulted loans herfindahl index is  the transactions loan level diversity is at the lower end of the band of herfindahl scores found in most multiborrower transactions issued since  with respect to property level diversity the pools property level herfindahl index is  the pool contains twelve loans  of the pool balance that are secured by multiple properties loans secured by multiple properties benefit from lower cash flow volatility given that excess cash flow from one property can be used to augment anothers cash flow to meet debt service requirements these loans also benefit from the pooling of equity from each underlying property moodys also grades properties on a scale of  to  best to worst and considers those grades when assessing the likelihood of debt payment the factors considered include property age quality of construction location market and tenancy the pools weighted average property quality grade is very strong at  this deal has a supersenior aaa class with  credit enhancement although the additional enhancement offered to the senior most certificate holders provides additional protection against pool loss the supersenior structure is credit negative for the certificate that supports the supersenior class if the support certificate were to take a loss the loss would have the potential to be quite large on a percentage basis thin tranches need more subordination to reduce the probability of default in recognition that their lossgiven default is higher this adjustment helps keep expected loss in balance and consistent across deals the transaction was structured with additional subordination at class am to mitigate the potential increased severity to class am the principal methodology used in this rating was moodys approach to rating us cmbs conduit transactions published in september  please see the credit policy page on wwwmoodyscom for a copy of this methodology moodys analysis employs the excelbased cmbs conduit model v which derives credit enhancement levels based on an aggregation of adjusted loan level proceeds derived from moodys loan level dscr and ltv ratios major adjustments to determining proceeds include loan structure property type sponsorship and diversity moodys analysis also uses the cmbs io calculator version  which references the following inputs to calculate the proposed io rating based on the published methodology original and current bond ratings and credit estimates original and current bond balances grossed up for losses for all bonds the ios references within the transaction and io type corresponding to an io type as defined in the published methodology moodys parameter sensitivities if moodys value of the collateral used in determining the initial rating were decreased by   and  the modelindicated rating for the currently rated junior aaa class would be aa aa aa respectively parameter sensitivities are not intended to measure how the rating of the security might migrate over time rather they are designed to provide a quantitative calculation of how the initial rating might change if key input parameters used in the initial rating process differed the analysis assumes that the deal has not aged parameter sensitivities only reflect the ratings impact of each scenario from a quantitativemodelindicated standpoint qualitative factors are also taken into consideration in the ratings process so the actual ratings that would be assigned in each case could vary from the information presented in the parameter sensitivity analysis these ratings a are based solely on information in the public domain andor information communicated to moodys by the issuer at the date it was prepared and such information has not been independently verified by moodys b must be construed solely as a statement of opinion and not a statement of fact or an offer invitation inducement or recommendation to purchase sell or hold any securities or otherwise act in relation to the issuer or any other entity or in connection with any other matter moodys does not guarantee or make any representation or warranty as to the correctness of any information rating or communication relating to the issuer moodys shall not be liable in contract tort statutory duty or otherwise to the issuer or any other third party for any loss injury or cost caused to the issuer or any other third party in whole or in part including by any negligence but excluding fraud dishonesty andor willful misconduct or any other type of liability that by law cannot be excluded on the part of or any contingency beyond the control of moodys or any of its employees or agents including any losses arising from or in connection with the procurement compilation analysis interpretation communication dissemination or delivery of any information or rating relating to the issuer factors that would lead to an upgrade or downgrade of the rating the performance expectations for a given variable indicate moodys forwardlooking view of the likely range of performance over the medium term performance that falls outside the given range may indicate that the collaterals credit quality is stronger or weaker than moodys had previously anticipated factors that may cause an upgrade of the ratings include significant loan paydowns or amortization an increase in the pools share of defeasance or overall improved pool performance factors that may cause a downgrade of the ratings include a decline in the overall performance of the pool loan concentration increased expected losses from specially serviced and troubled loans or interest shortfalls regulatory disclosures for further specification of moodys key rating assumptions and sensitivity analysis see the sections methodology assumptions and sensitivity to assumptions of the disclosure form moodys received and took into account one or more thirdparty assessments on the due diligence performed regarding the underlying assets or financial instruments in this transaction and the assessments had a neutral impact on the credit rating further information on the representations and warranties and enforcement mechanisms available to investors are available on httpwwwmoodyscomviewresearchdocaspxdocidpbssf the analysis includes an assessment of collateral characteristics and performance to determine the expected collateral loss or a range of expected collateral losses or cash flows to the rated instruments as a second step moodys estimates expected collateral losses or cash flows using a quantitative tool that takes into account credit enhancement loss allocation and other structural features to derive the expected loss for each rated instrument as the section on loss and cash flow analysis describes moodys quantitative analysis entails an evaluation of scenarios that stress factors contributing to sensitivity of ratings and take into account the likelihood of severe collateral losses or impaired cash flows moodys weights the impact on the rated instruments based on its assumptions of the likelihood of the events in
