economic policy institute commentary  apple comparing the pay of apple’s top executives to the pay of the workers making its products commentary • by isaac shapiro • april   press release this analysis compares the compensation of apple’s top executives to the compensation received by the chinese workers of apple’s supplier foxconn the most complete data are for  in that year apple’s nineperson executive leadership team received total compensation of  million this was equivalent to the estimated compensation of  foxconn factory workers assembling apple products enough information is now available to make a reasoned comparison for  and the findings are similar the executive team is on track to receive compensation of at least  million this conservative estimate is equivalent to the compensation of  of the chinese factory workers making apple products these calculations are explained in full below compensation at apple’s supplier foxconn the difficult working conditions experienced by chinese workers employed at foxconn who assemble apple products have received widespread attention this year  in march  at apple’s behest the fair labor association completed an investigation of these conditions which included a survey of the foxconn workers among the findings were that “ percent of workers thought that their salary was not sufficient to cover their basic needs” even though they worked under difficult circumstances and for an average of  hours per week the fla survey found that over the previous three months the average monthly salary for nonsupervisory workers was  rmb this is equivalent to  per month or  per year this includes wages from the substantial number of overtime hours these workers put in frequently in violation of china’s legal maximum and apple’s own labor policies this analysis’ calculation of the annual number assumes that salaries over the three months covered by the survey reflect those received throughout the year  this approach may overstate wages for  since wages may have risen since then and may understate wages for  since wages may rise further executive compensation at apple table  below provides a detailed description of the total of  million received in compensation by the nine executives making up apple’s leadership team in  the team as defined by apple consists of its chief executive officer

forstall and johnson come directly from apples proxy statement for  annual meeting of shareholders jan   page  information for mansfield schiller sewell and williams is not explicitly provided by the proxy but language on page  suggests equivalence in payments among members of the executive team thus their compensation is assumed to be the same as oppenheimers share on facebook tweet this chart embedcopy the code below to embed this chart on your website download image the table is largely drawn directly from page  of apple’s definitive proxy statement submitted to the sec on jan   for use at apple’s annual meeting estimates of some relatively minor compensation were added to this table to make it complete the vast majority of this compensation came in the form of stock awards issued to apple’s new ceo timothy cook  million and to eduardo cue  million upon his elevation to senior vice president the somewhat complicated nature of apple’s stock awards is described in a separate section below table  below provides an estimate of the total compensation to be received by apple’s top executive team in  nearly all of the estimated  million consists of alreadyissued stock awards for seven senior vice presidents the estimated value of these awards also discussed below is  million  the  million figure is conservative both because of the potential of other bonuses and because information for one of the team’s members is not available table estimated compensation of apple’s leadership team    salary stock awards to date nonequity incentive plan compensation   other   total timothy d

this chart embedcopy the code below to embed this chart on your website download image the data are for apple’s  and  fiscal years which do not correspond precisely to the calendar years apple’s fiscal year ends on the last saturday of september compensation figures from a recent study by the aflcio provide some context the study examined  compensation for ceos of sp  companies information was available for  such companies the study found that apple’s cook had by far the highest compensation of any ceo his pay was nearly five times that of the secondranking ceo the average pay among the ceos was  million a hefty amount to be sure but this is less than onequarter of the estimated  million in compensation to be received by six of apple’s senior vice presidents in  the comparisons as noted the key findings are the total compensation of the top nine apple executives in  is the same as the total compensation of  chinese factory workers making apple products the figure for the number of chinese workers is calculated by dividing  million the total pay of the apple executives by  the estimated average annual pay of the factory workers the total estimated compensation of apple’s executive team in  is the same as the total estimated compensation of  chinese factory workers making apple products apple’s stock awards the vast majority of the compensation of apple’s leadership team in  and  takes the form of restricted stock awards these awards are intermittent in nature and somewhat difficult to value features that merit discussion the  million award given to cook in  when he succeeded the late steve jobs as ceo consists of one million restricted stock shares valued at the closing price of apple stock on the date they were issued  on aug   this valuation approach is dictated by sec rules the shares are “vested” over time cook does not actually receive the shares until they are vested contingent upon continued employment with apple half the shares vest in five years the other half in  years  this award should not be considered a standard part of his annual salary but it is unclear whether cook will receive other stock awards before  the  million in stock awards given to cue in  consists primarily of a  million award vesting over four years which he received when he was promoted to senior vice president he also received a  million stock award earlier in the fiscal year when he was not a senior vice president suggesting that generous stock awards may be extended to top apple employees even when they are not part of the executive team on nov   which falls into apple’s fiscal year  the company issued what it considers to be the regular stock awards it makes to its executive team every two years these shares are vested over approximately four years apple issued  shares to six of its senior vice presidents and  shares to cue his level was lower because of his fiscal year  award information for one senior vice president is not available altogether the fiscal year  stock awards already total one million shares it is possible other awards will be granted following sec practice apple will value these awards at  million in its  proxy statement as the closing price of apple stock was  on nov  apple’s traditional pattern of issuing stock awards indicates that the total compensation of its executive team may be significantly lower in  than in  when its biannual regular stock awards for senior vice presidents were granted or  when the large award was given to cook when he became ceo on the other hand given the rise in the value of apple stock in one important respect the above figures may well understate the compensation of apple’s executives as noted following sec convention the value of the stock awards is based on apple’s share price on the date issued but the prices have risen sharply since then on april  apple stock closed at  this represents a rise of threefifths from its value when cook received his one million restricted shares and of half since the senior vice presidents received their restricted shares this means that cook’s shares valued at  million in this analysis would be worth  million if they could be sold today the actual value of these shares will not be determined until they vest but as of now it appears that value will be far above the  million value used here it also bears noting that while on the one hand the compensation figures here capture in part what is in effect future pay on the other hand the figures ignore current streams of income to apple executives that reflect past pay that is the compensation figures ignore the large amounts of income these executives are receiving from cashing in on stock awards granted in previous years in the first seven months of apple’s fiscal year  the executives examined here have already received roughly  million from selling stock they were awarded previously but which became vested one implication the enormous pay levels of apple’s executive team relative to the meager pay levels of the factory workers in china that produce its products has at least one significant implication the fla report as well as numerous independent investigations that preceded it make clear that these foxconn workers not only receive extraordinarily low wages but also endure extraordinarily difficult working conditions  the compensation apple provides to its executives is one indication of the overwhelming resources apple can draw on to improve the situation apple’s world class products and head of the class pay to its executives can and should be matched by ensuring reasonable working conditions and pay for the factory workers that make its products see related work on apple  unions and labor standards see more work by isaac shapiro
