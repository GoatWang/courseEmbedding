workconsthe company is sadly losing what has made it great as sales have dropped off due to market saturation they have thrown an incomprehensible amount of money trying to transform the sales process

created is irreparableadvice to managementseek advice from your employees so many decisions over the past two years were made without consulting those who they would effect most its so disappointing
