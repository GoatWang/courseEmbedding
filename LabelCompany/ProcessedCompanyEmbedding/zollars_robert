zollars – purveyors of fraud  obsolete defective products skip to main content vocera  robert zollars – purveyors of fraud  obsolete defective products highlights vcra chairman zollars was ceo or chairman of  companies previously accused of fraud  of which settled for a total of  million the rd fraud is a possible  million vcra securities fraud we allege in this report that zollars led his th fraud while at vcra  witnesses support our allegation “we continually missed our forecasts quarter after quarter…and proactively chose to use the backlog to “smooth” vocera’s quarterly numbers” insiders including silicon valley venture capitalists and strategic partners have sold more than  million of vcra stock since ipo motorola was initially an investor but sold its vcra shares and is now a notable and better capitalized competitor than vcra vcra has one product last major product launch in  despite fact that  of  competitors we profiled most of which are better capitalized had major product launches in last  months vcra’s product appears to be inferior as made clear by nearly every measure considered ie no touchscreen yet it appears to be the most expensive product and has the highest apparent installation costs of any product we profiled we found a plethora of users suggesting the vcra device is terrible and that they are unsatisfied with its performance customer churn which vcra does not disclose regularly appears to be approximately  or about  in  customers calculated in the aggregate since vcra’s inception vcra uses sales to uninformed customers to pump vcra’s stock we spoke with franciscan alliance – vcra’s top new customer vcra cto has admitted  defects in vcra’s sole product vcra aggregate losses total  million  cagr  vcra has reported profits in  quarterly periods out of  total quarterly periods – however we allege an accounting fraud was underway during those  quarters market’s movement towards appbased solutions could force vcra to finance customer installations or offer steep discounts in order to compete price target  short term cash  downside long term target  april     vocera overview   in our view long term investors will generally become excited by a company’s prospects based on  the management team’s prowess  technology that is innovative or provides some form of significant competitive advantage that benefits the company or  an enormous market opportunity that the company has some particular advantage in as compared against its competitors   in this report we will explain the following   mr zollars the chairman of the board of directors of vocera inc vcra is directly associated with previous settled frauds for alleged accounting and securities laws violations totaling  million ie neoforma m diamond foods m mr zollars and vcra’s current ceo mr brent lang – both of whom were accused of fraud appear ready to settle another securities fraud for an additional  million – which would bring the total “settled fraud bill” for companies affiliated with them to approximately  million as if this was not enough we have calculated that of the  public companies mr zollars has been ceo of namely neoforma and vcra those two companies have lost a combined  million for their shareholders as of today – this figure does not include the  million in fraud settlements which may have been paid by insurers if a long term investor can find a reason to support someone with mr zollars’ track record we welcome the argument vcra management routinely touts their technology however vcras ► technology is approximately  years old ► hardware and software can not compete with  other competitors who have technology that was significantly updated in the last  months ► device does not have a touch screen ► device is incapable of keeping a “call history” for its users ► device drops voice calls routinely ► device appears to have a large base of users who despise it ► device is the costliest device of  devices we profiled ► installation costs for a new client is apparently the costliest install fee of the  systems we profiled   the market opportunity for vcra is much more limited than vcra’s management will have you believe vcra suggests there are  hospitals in the us that could use their system vcra does not consider that of those hospitals only about  hospitals can afford vcra’s installation costs – according to a former vcra executive whom an affiliate of ours interviewed in march  further vcra seems to completely ignore the fact that their competitors exist and generally have long term contracts with their customers – the same hospitals vcra suggests are readily available for vcra to sign up ultimately the market opportunity for vcra is at best in the “hundreds of hospitals” at any given time in our opinion rather than  this misrepresentation of vcra’s market opportunity should be quite alarming to a vcra long term investor furthermore the current environment in which hospitals operate in is hardly rosy hospitals are under severe pressure nowadays to cut costs this trend is not expected to reverse any time soon the hospital market opportunity is not large desirable or even expanding it is contracting vcra suggests that its products can improve operating efficiency and save costs based on what we know of vcras product we find this claim highly questionable additionally we have identified  of vcras competitors that we believe offer a better solution for hospitals than vcra i    robert zollars’ associations with fraud   robert zollars is the chairman of the board of directors of vcra and was formerly vcra’s ceo   figure    according to his biography mr zollars has been associated with the companies outlined in the chart below  all of which have been accused of fraud have settled a claim of fraud andor have a fraud claim settlement pending including vcra   we are unaware of any other report which brings to light a possible accounting fraud at vcra we are also unaware of any other documents or reports which tie the alleged accounting fraud at vcra to zollars’ prior business ventures   below is a summary of mr zollars’s association with alleged frauds   figure    sources see appendix a for detailed references including neoforma inc ipo et al v neoformacom inc et al cv no    ii    zollars influence felt at vcra we allege vcra accounting fraud   two class action lawsuits were filed against vcra in  the class actions were subsequently joined into one lawsuit the “class action” mr zollars and mr brent lang vcra’s current ceo were also accused in connection with the class action class action lawsuits are not unusual with public companies however the class action is unusual for two reasons   the class action which alleged false and misleading statements made by vcra’s management appears as though it will be settled for  million we have reviewed the court documents associated with the class action in detail the allegations of wrongdoing by management namely mr zollars and mr lang appear to have merit as outlined in detail in the complaint and supporting documents provided by the plaintiff’s counsel the reputable law firm of labaton sucharow llp the class action investigation uncovered additional instances of wrongdoing by management many of which can be described as accounting fraud we have reviewed the court documents associated with the class action and obtained copies of statements made by four  key witnesses that depict an apparent organized and aggressive accounting fraud at vcra we do not believe the specific information presented in this report about accounting fraud at vcra has previously been made publicly available in one document the allegations and evidence outlined within the class action provided an overview of daily operations at vcra we have provided actual excerpts of the class action documents in appendix b and f to this report   upon our review of the court documents and other evidence we obtained about mr zollars’ past we are left with the following questions   ► in light of vcra’s history of fraud allegations and mr zollars’ association with alleged and settled securities and accounting frauds should current optimistic statements and projections made by vcra be given any credence ► if mr zollars and mr lang successfully executed not only securities fraud but also accounting fraud and they have profited from such actions what reason would mr zollars and mr lang have to end their apparent fraudulent activity at vcra   below is the key evidence we have obtained about the potential vcra accounting fraud   corroborated evidential statements by four  witnesses support claim of vcra accounting fraud a firsthand depiction of apparent accounting fraud at vcra was provided by four  confidential witnesses the “cws” one of whom was previously vcra’s senior director of internal audit and compliance these individuals outlined actions taken by mr zollars and mr lang among others in and open and aggressive manner on a daily basis in management meetings attended by a group of approximately  high ranking individuals in vcra’s conference room to apparently fraudulently misrepresent vcra’s top and bottom line results to the public the cws corroborated each other’s statements unless these four individuals who do not stand to gain financially by their statements have coordinated their stories and lied to the court these court documents lead us inexorably to conclude that the depictions of accounting fraud by the cws actually happened and current management including mr zollars and mr lang led the accounting fraud effort   the following quotes from the class action were of interest to us   •    premeditated effort to misrepresent   “cw stated that prior to q vocera missed its forecasts in each quarters in  by  consistent with cw’s account cw stated ‘we continually missed our forecasts quarter after quarter but bill zerella was insistent on growth and took from backlog to make up the shortfalls’   note cw is referenced within the court documents as vcra’s former senior director of internal audit  compliance   •    massaging revenues   “cw further advised that about  of the company’s quarterly revenue during the class period came from vocera’s pulling of revenue out of backlog into an earlier quarter”   •    further toying with sales   “in order to make quarterly guidance and continue the façade that vocera remained a ‘growth story’ defendants scoured vocera’s backlog and pushed hospitals to accelerate the acceptance of shipments of vocera products to an earlier quarter allowing vocera to recognize revenue sooner and meet guidance”   •    lack of disclosure   “defendants were essentially robbing revenue from future quarters to allow the company to meet guidance in the current quarter – all without telling the market that new bookings were declining and backlog was dropping”   •    pursuing the wrong goals   “this smoothing of revenue also created the appearance that defendants were able to deliver consistent ontarget guidance and results”   •    deliberate actions   “cw recalled sitting in the revenue meetings which were attended by the individual defendants and listening to the executives discuss how they were going to need to utilize the backlog to achieve revenue targets”   •    obsessive attention to fraud   “according to cw mike hutchinson vp of finance spent the majority of his time trying to figure out how to utilize the backlog to generate current revenue by accelerating shipments or pulling backlog forward to compensate for the company’s shortfall in sales each quarter”   “according to cw at the end of the quarter defendents decided what to ship and book as revenue cw stated” ‘zerella and every highranking executive was at these meetings…as i was – i never saw a group that was so intent to know every number and involved in all of those decisions”   source see appendix b for excerpts from court documents brado v vocera communications inc et al cv no  brado v vocera communications inc et al cv no    actual financial results reported by vcra support claim of vcra accounting fraud we believe the claim of accounting fraud at vcra is supported by actual results reported by vcra as seen in our review of the financials below during the time period outlined by the cws ie qq  vcra reported profits of  million  million and  million respectively aside from those three quarterly reporting periods identified below where we have a detailed firsthand outline of potential accounting fraud vcra’s sec filings have never shown a profit   figure    source various public filings by vcra at wwwsecgov   we are unable to conclude that accounting fraud is no longer occurring at vcra further we believe it is important to note that although the depiction of accounting fraud was corroborated by the cws and the overall evidence of accounting fraud is substantial in our opinion we don’t believe the purpose of the class action was to make the claim of accounting fraud the class action was meant to substantiate securities fraud only as can be viewed in the court filings since the securities fraud appears likely to be settled shortly it is possible that litigation involving the potential accounting fraud could be filed shortly after the securities fraud is settled although this cannot be known for sure   we also noted that vcra did not restate its financials for the quarterly reporting periods in which the accounting fraud claim exists we believe vcra’s auditors the reputable deloitte  touche llp were previously unaware of the accounting fraud claim we believe this because of our direct experience working for and with “big ” and other smaller auditing firms over the past decade or so the review of court documents associated with active settled or terminated litigations are not reviewed by auditors as a standard audit practice  in our experience on or around the date of this report the san jose california and national ie new york offices of deloitte  touche llp have been informed of this report   iii    insiders appear to have sold over  worth of vcra stock since ipo   silicon valley investors and strategic partners have sold out of most of their vcra shares we calculated sales of approximately m shares by silicon valley venture capitalists and former vcra strategic investors we estimate these shares were sold for an average of approximately  per share resulting in estimated proceeds for these investors of m     figure    source this analysis assumes investors who did not report holding any shares as of december   did not own any shares of vcra we reviewed all form  and form  filings for these individuals at wwwsecgov for the period from march   through march   and httpswwwsecgovarchivesedgardatad   additional related notes       we noted motorola solutions inc was previously a significant shareholder and strategic partner of vcra but is now a competitor – and appears to have sold out all of their vcra shares       we noted that several investors including venrock and ggv were represented on vcra’s board of directors and were personally sued in connection with the class action venrock and ggv have been aggressive sellers of vcra stock in the past few years we presume that these investors had insider information about the class action claims and potential accounting fraud vcra did not make the public aware of the accounting fraud claim we have not seen it discussed in any sec filing by vcra we are left to surmise therefore that venrock and ggv traded on the basis of their insider nonpublic information   insider sales over last  months show aggressive consistent selling we reviewed all insider transactions in the shares of vcra from march   through april   there has not been one open market purchase of any shares of vcra by an insider during that time period however during that time period the insiders listed below sold  of their holdings in vcra the chief medical officer is selling the most aggressively in a vacuum without even considering any other facts presented in this report this constant and significant sale of vcra shares by insiders should give all vcra investors concern we calculated sales of  shares were sold by insiders in this time period – at the same time quarter after quarter mr lang presents optimistic growth for the foreseeable future we estimate these shares were sold for an average of approximately  per share resulting in estimated proceeds for these investors of m   figure    source various sec filings including form  form k form  etc   majority shareholder is silicon valley and advanced technology outsider in our opinion it is a matter of substantial concern for the future of a company where that company bills itself as having worldclass technology but is majorityowned by an investor with limited if any expertise in high technology we noted this in our last report on conformis  vcra’s majority shareholder is a baltimorebased money manager that appears to be a fine institution  however brown capital does not appear to have even one employee who has any experience in high technology in or outside silicon valley to the best of what we can discern everything else in this report considered we would be hesitant to take brown capital’s lead in investing in vcra one wonders if brown capital knows something we don’t know – or for that matter motorola cisco venrock ggv vanguard ventures rre ventures or thomas weisel don’t know     figure    source httpswwwsecgovarchivesedgardatafp   iv    vcra product doesn’t stack up against competition   all discussions about vocera’s sole product have been developed from direct conversations with an expert in the telecommunications and wireless space the “telecom expert” the telecom expert’s biography is provided in appendix c to this report   vcra was founded in  vcra offers its customers primarily hospitals with a communication platform that relies on a network of vcrainstalled wireless hotspots “wifi” within each hospital the communication challenges within each hospital are individual and particular to each institution due to the differences in the structural layout of each hospital and inherent limitations of wifibased communications the b device the “b” as shown below was launched in  and is provided by vcra along with a network management software solution to purportedly provide communication between nurses physicians and others within a hospital   figure    source httpwwwvoceracomproductvoceracommunicationbadge   summary   ► vcra’s sole product is the oldest wireless device ie  being offered by the top  competitors “top ” we profiled in this report ► vcra device is the only device out of  we profiled that does not have a touch screen ► vcra’s device is the most expensive device offered by the top  ie  ► vcra’s platform is apparently the most expensive to install of the top  ie  on average ►  of  competitors profiled have devices with unlimited range due to their ability to operate on lte cellular wifi and perhaps other communication platforms vcra’s sole product has the shortest range ie  ft ► vcra’s device has the smallest screen size closest competitor’s screen is approx x yet vcra’s device is the costliest device by x   despite the fast pace of technology and cellular device product rollouts vcra has not had a major product launch since  vcra is already in last place in the telecom expert’s view the various charts below were developed to visualize the current competitive landscape     figure    sources see appendix d   the major system attributes for each competitor are outlined below the telecom expert sees vcra in last place in nearly every category   figure    sources see appendix d   the telecom expert stated   vcra has the most expensive device on the market yet vcra’s device is the least sophisticated product  among all of its other limitations perhaps most alarming is that vcra has the only device of the six devices we profiled that does not offer a touch screen the phrase “we now live in a touch world” was once novel but now it’s just common sense vcra is obsolete by every measure we considered     figure    sources see appendix d   in  prior to the entrance of all of  of the competitors we profiled in this report the market depended on motorola spectralink ascom and vocera for device software device hardware network software and network hardware now much like the pc industry the cellphone industry and many others this industry has undergone just recently ie in december  and january  a defragmentation where strong competition is arising to focus on a specific section of the value chain ie apps device software device hardware network software or network hardware vcra appears to be moving slowly to determine what section of the value chain they want to participate in it is quite clear to us that they will not win if they continue to try to be “all things wireless communications in healthcare” however we don’t see an area of the value chain where they are a leader or could be a leader this is one of the primary reasons we see vcra as a zero we don’t envision vcra succeeding in any one section of the value chain outlined below     figure    sources see appendix d   v    vcra product issues  user complaints are plentiful   the telecom expert spoke with the former executive who was previously involved with over a dozen installations on behalf of vcra when asked of the nurses and doctors perception of vcra the executive was quite blunt   “doctors hate these things”   vcra appears to be operating in an environment where the men and women who lead the daily operations of each of vcra’s potential customers are harboring a growing antipathy towards vcra’s sole product a study by charlotte tang and sheelagh carpendale both of whom are professors at the university of calgary further highlighted the negative and sometimes hostile view users have of vcra’s b       figure    source httpwwwcharlottetangcapmwikiuploadsmainacmchipdf   we will not discuss the voice recognition software and hands free capabilities offered by vcra in this report other than to say the following       we believe it is clear vcra is not a leader in voice recognition software or wearable device design we believe the  known defects also spell out just how unworkable the voice recognition system appears to be     as professor tang outlines in her analysis – we don’t see hands free communications as being entirely appropriate in a hospital setting due to privacy concerns   when considering the apparent technical immaturity of vcra’s devices and the pervasive issue of patient privacy in the hospitals vcra serves we can’t begin to fathom how users will ever feel comfortable using vcra’s b device   nurses have filed numerous complaints about vcra’s product a few examples of these complaints are provided below                  figure  collectively   source httpallnursescomgsearchphpcxpartnerpubavaz   vi    vcra does not regularly discuss customer churn  or any other negative issues   mr zollars and mr lang as recently as february  have routinely used “nonnumerical statements” to describe the business prospects of vcra given the allegations of securities fraud and detailed descriptions of accounting fraud that have been corroborated by several former employees we don’t believe any “nonnumerical” statements made by mr zollars or mr lang should be considered credible if the statements are not backed up by figures or other forms of analysis then it appears likely the statements are being made with a deceptive or promotional motive in mind   the class action spelled out this issue vcra has a history of using “nonnumerical statements” to support its story     figure    source brado v vocera communications inc et al cv no    vcra commentary to investors seems as though it is always  positive whereas the negative aspects of the business seem to always be hidden from the public when considering that and mr zollars or mr lang’s history we don’t see how a long term investor can become comfortable with vcra   the best example of this is below as far as we have seen vcra has never fully explained its “customer churn” ie the number of customers that vcra adds and loses each reporting period this is a sign that there is some negativity in this respect otherwise we believe vcra would discuss this topic openly   figure    source httpswwwsecgovarchivesedgardatavcra   vcra explains that its product had been selected by more than  facilities we presume this means that in the aggregate since its inception vcra has had a total of  customers vcra also touted that it had over  customers as of december     simple math suggests that approximately  customers or  ie  have spent the considerable capital needed to install vcra’s sole product only to then dispose of it once they began using it   if the average installation cost for these  customers is  which is on the low end of the average installation range further below we note evidence that it was  in  and  in  then that means that vcra’s former customers have decided they do not want to continue using vcra’s product but they also “threw away” approximately  collectively when they switched to competitors’ products that is quite telling in our opinion in other words if medical facilities are willing to part collectively with  for the pleasure of not having to use vcra’s dinosaur product this says more about the product itself than any ink we could possibly spill given the enormous costs to switch providers we can only surmise as to the number of hospital customers who have not switched from vcra but who would given a chance at a doover certainly many of the individuals responsible for selecting vcra are essentially forced to support the continued use of vcra in their hospital for fear of being held responsible for possibly being one of vcra’s customers who has wasted  on an inferior outdated product if this is accurate perhaps the true portion of the  customers vcra has worked with that do not wish to continue using vcra’s product is significantly higher than    vii    vcra sells to uninformed customers franciscan alliance provides false sense of hope   on january   vcra issued a press release announcing a new sale the sale was to a new customer the franciscan alliance mr dick roskam md chief medical information officer of franciscan alliance was quoted in the press release   on march   an affiliate of skytides spoke with mr roskam   mr roskam made the following statement   “we looked around… they obviously have a patent on voice technology…texting has unfortunately become quite common in healthcare and a lot of it is done through apps that are not secure…the big players are voalte and vocera”   mr roskam made the following statement in response to a question asking if he spoke with mototorola or ascom – whom we have previously identified as leading incumbents in vcra’s sector   “no we didn’t talk to them”   analysis   first mr roskam confirmed that he did not speak with motorola and ascom – two of the leaders in this industry second he suggested vcra has a patent on voice technology – they do not vcra licenses the voice technology from nuance communications along with anyone else willing to pay nuance a royalty fee third mr roskam seems to believe vcra is the only company capable of secure text messaging on march   we checked apple’s itunes store and found  apps that provide secure text messaging further we searched for “best apps for secure text messaging” at wwwgooglecom and came across a list of the top  secure mobile messaging apps not surprisingly vcra is not listed here it is no secret that secure text messaging is a key attribute of any wireless device or platform provided to users in a hospital setting vcra is not alone in offering secure texting and in our view is clearly not a leader in this specific space   in summary it appears to us that mr roskam was grossly misinformed as to the strengths and limitations of vcra’s product  perhaps kudos are due to vcra’s marketing and sales staff or perhaps the franciscan alliance is the latest in a string of customers sold an objectively and calculably inferior product   perhaps vcra benefits from being able to sell to the creamy market of physicians and nurses who are demographically inexperienced in the competitive telecom marketplace we question if vcra has ever sold its sole product to a knowledgeable it manager who was aware of the  other competitors we have profiled in this report and actually considered how vcra’s product compares   during a conversation with the telecom expert the former executive confirmed that most of vcra’s sales were to nurses who we presume have severely limited experience in it matters   viii    vcra’s international opportunity is all hype   since  vcra has been promoting its opportunity for international expansion however vcra’s international sales have actually been declining each year   figure    sources httpswwwsecgovarchivesedgardatavcra httpswwwsecgovarchivesedgardatavcra   however since  and as recently as february  vcra management have repeatedly promoted the theme that international growth would drive vcra’s business in the future the following are excerpts from the class action court documents and a recent earnings call on february   the “earnings call” respectively   january   mr zollars     figure    source brado v vocera communications inc et al cv no    february   mr lang     figure    source httpfinanceyahoocomnewseditedtranscriptvcraearningsconference   lastly we thought possibly some historical or trendidentifying financial ratios would support mr lang’s ongoing repetitive and yet unfulfilled claim that international growth is going to be a big factor for vcra we considered the following financial analysis   figure    source httpswwwsecgovarchivesedgardatavcra   we found two interesting outcomes from our analysis of the financials included in vcra’s  annual report       mr lang in promoting the opportunity for growth in international markets apparently dismisses the fact that international sales have been declining since vcra first suggested  years ago that international growth would be a key opportunity for vcra       revenues per customer for the international customer base are less than us revenues per customer by a wide margin us is  which is  almost twice as profitable of international revenues per customer of    mr lang should explain to the public why he continues to believe international growth is a major opportunity and why he expects international growth “at a faster rate than our domestic business”  hopefully he considers an argument that does not involve just nonnumerical useless commentary   the research notes included comments that relate to this topic as seen below the telecom expert provided his view thereafter     the product does not work in europe and asia   we are wondering how vcra plans to compete in the international markets when the product does not work in europe and asia those are two very large markets – especially for wireless technology   ix    mr zollars influence looms large mr lang’s questionable claim of increased deal size   mr lang as recently as february   during the vcra earnings call stated   “the average deal size is definitely going up”   we thought we would check and see if this statement was true the class action stated that the average deal size was  back in  as seen below     figure    source brado v vocera communications inc et al cv no       however according to an analyst report from craig hallum dated march   the average deal size “a couple years back” was  we presume craig hallum obtained their data from vcra   figure    source craig hallum march   analyst report   so someone appears wrong here either the numerous learned attorneys who brought the class action are wrong or mr lang is wrong it should suffice to say that to our knowledge none of those attorneys have given us any cause to doubt their veracity mr lang on the other hand – well we’re not sure what truth means to him   x    vcra product issues – cto outlines  known defects   on december   vocera published release notes for its product the “release notes” according to the telecom expert   as the reader is possibly aware “release notes” are common within the tech industry and generally provide the latest information about defects the company has discovered addressed and fixed either through internal sources or user comments   however vcra is different from almost all other similarly situated tech companies the telecom expert reviewed the release notes and focused on the “known issues” and “known limitations” sections of the release notes the following is the table of contents for vcra’s release notes     figure    source httpwwwvoceracomtsupdatesrnotesreleasenotesvshtml   the telecom expert’s summary of the “known issues” and “known limitations” content is as follows   these release notes constitute a sharp departure from the industry standard vcra has acknowledged in the release notes that the product has numerous significant defects and that vcra has not fixed these defects these do not appear to be new defects many of the defects we noted appear to have existed for quite some time – at least since  vcra’s product should not have been available in the marketplace   the telecom expert has reviewed the release notes and has labeled these  items outlined below as “defects” rather than “known limitations” and “known issues” his complete detailed analysis of each of the  defects is provided in appendix e to this report each of the defects is provided in a separate screenshot from voceras website the telecom expert’s comments are bolded and underlined and presented below the screenshot for each defect   product defect      product defect this is a technically sophisticated way of saying that the vocera system does not allow devices being used on the system to “roam” from one wifi hotspot to another without dropping its connection to the system  you cannot have a commercially viable wireless product that does not allow you to go wherever you need to go throughout a hospital without dropping calls etc this is a mobile product that restricts mobility the point of wireless is mobility   product defect      product defect this is similar to a frozen screen on a laptop however this is a lot more dangerous in this instance the device is used to help professionals provide urgent care in life and death situations   product defect      product defect the product simply doesn’t work seamlessly when you walk from one building to another by the company’s own description the performance drops while the device searches for an open channel in the normal course of using a modern wireless device no manual intervention should be necessary to create a connection software should scan for open channels automatically   product defect      product defect device and network fail to accurately capture and identify the voice of the subscriber there isn’t a failsafe way to verify that someone is who they say they are this opens up a long list of questions related to patient privacy compliance laws especially hipaa there are no safeguards against misidentification of the proper user the vcra voiceprint technology is inconsistent in an environment where privacy is a regulatory requirement   product defect      product defect call history has been around for  years it is incomprehensible why call history is not supported by vcra   source see appendix e for a complete review of  known product defects   xi     combined annual growth rate    vcra is the epitome of a stalled stagnant business that is ripe for a challenge by well capitalized competitors in our opinion vcra insiders know what is truly happening at vcra – and they are not buying shares in the open market to the contrary they are selling and in our opinion  some of them are selling as fast as they can   below are high level financials for each quarterly reporting period from january   through december       figure    source various form q and form k filings at wwwsecgov   we noted that the only profitable quarters reported by vcra were in  this time period happens to coincide with the potential accounting fraud depicted by several former vcra employees including the former senior director of internal audit and compliance   xii    summary and valuation discussion   vcra has one product and one supplier for that one product in the event market conditions change – and they are obviously changing right now in our opinion – vcra may not be able to adapt to the market’s demands efficiently and quickly competitors with robust product portfolios and diversified supply chains have a significant advantage over vcra right now if vcra encounters declining sales of its sole product for whatever the reason or reasons may be vcra will have no other revenue stream to support the decline in sales for its current product   despite indepth review and due diligence we see no value in vcras technology product portfolio or other assets with the exception of cash and cash equivalents for the reasons outlined in this report on february   vcra announced its cash and cash equivalents as of december   totaled  million as of march   vcra had  shares of common stock outstanding we believe vcras common stock is currently worth  per share ie  rounded to the nearest half dollar  long term and possibly within  we expect one of two outcomes for vcra       vcra will encounter an unrecoverable sharp decline in business for the various reasons outlined in this report we believe the most significant impact in  will be from the proliferation of new competitors who are attempting to replace vcra in hospitals by offering welltailored apps on smartphones if these apps begin to take more marketshare  we note in our competitive review that they already have signed several high quality customers  then current customers and potential new customers could either just select these other competitors rather than vcra or perhaps even worse new customers may demand vcra provide the installation of its system for free or at a discount considering that there is potentially no or minimal install cost for app competitors who make use of cellular connections or existing wifi connections vcra may have no choice but to offer installations at heavy discounts or even for free that would be a very costly development – and vcra may not have a choice but to accept the fact that is has to offer a free or heavily discounted installation negative cashflow will begin to threaten vcra’s continued existence if this begins to occur       vcra will attempt a sizable capital raise diluting shareholders by at least  in our view in order to execute an aggressive turnaround plan that will include  a segregation and gradual disposal of its current year old “patchworked” wifionly platform and  the design and commercialization of a modern ltewifi system agnostic platform to replace vcra’s current platform   vcra’s cash burn increase due to reasons mentioned in this report include but are not limited to competitive pressures in the event of either of the two outcomes listed above actually occurring vcra investors could suffer significant loses either as a result of the stock price declining upon disappointing financial results or through dilution   appendix a – robert zollars   robert j zollars served on our board from may  until the company was acquired in june  by affiliates of madison dearborn partners llc he

that most of the products are new and the management team has turned over details details any particular reason why you chose to focus on the b badge and not the newer bn badge the new product settles most of your criticisms also many of your defect criticisms refer to use of the smartphone app implementation not the badge which is misleading as you present it in fact your competitive comparison chart lists the same issue no cellular network support for the badge several times simply restating it in different words probably to make the list of “problems” longer and why should we rely on the opinions of a “telecom expert” to assess the quality of a wifibased hospital product frankly i’m confused by that one can you give us the international growth in constant currency that was probably a big headwind in  but then again why go into the details when you can present charts that look incriminating most of your yearsold accounting fraud criticisms sound more like business as usual in enterprise software as opposed fraud isn’t backlog intended to smooth results that’s why investors pay premium multiples for software companies like vocera i think many companies pull in business late in the quarter no either you’re a poor writer or you felt the need to type accounting fraud  times in each sentence you can say it repeatedly but your text gives no actual evidence where’s the fraud in  listing yearsold cumulative net operating losses is not a valid current short thesis that’s the old news welcome to the new cash flow positive reality you say that doctors hate the product but last i checked nurses are the buyers and users also most of your critiques are from  and  old product old news today they support smart phones and have a new badge which you failed to disclose secure texting is not what they sell saying there are lots of secure texting apps on the apple store is irrelevant secure texting is a feature within their communications platform that integrates with the entire badgesmartphone ecosystem and produces a full audit trail that is not the same as a secure texting app really can’t you do better analysis than that yikes your criticism of the franciscan win is that they didn’t vet products that you think they should have how do we get from that claim to “they use sales to uninformed customers to pump the stock” motorola is no longer an investor because the relevant business was sold to zebra…which is now one of vcra’s best partners google it vc’s have sold a lot of stock since the ipo…of course they have that’s what vc’s do after an ipo it’s kind of the point of an ipo so nice hatchet job classy of you to flood the market with put buys the last few days then release a scarysounding article using outdated information and spurious claims informed readers will dig deeper editor fri    kris thank you for your comments here is our response  which products are new exactly what new capabilities do these products have we don’t believe vcra has launched a significant new product or added significant functionality to its product since  go ahead and show us otherwise we’re happy to continue the discussion  we rely on a telecommunications expert in our report because wifi is a form of telecommunications is it not  vcra has had no international growth in recent years if currency was truly the reason why this has been the case then the management team should have explained such we don’t see this argument holding any water however currency declines have been significant but we don’t believe they have been significant enough to justify your “guess” as to why there has been no international growth ultimately management promised and promoted international growth to investors – and they didn’t deliver if you can prove this is untrue please do  are you really suggesting accounting fraud is ok just because of the sector vcra operates in please elaborate on your position here if we do not see any scenario where accounting fraud is “ok” and “business as usual”  are you suggesting investors pay a premium multiple as a result of accounting fraud what  you don’t consider corroborating statements by  former employees one of whom was the senior director of internal audit and compliance to be substantial evidence what  are you suggesting fraudulent acts are ok as long as they aren’t detected shortly thereafter  you are right we did provide some evidence about nurses hating vcra’s product that was a bit outdated please see our new report we corrected this issue and provided more recent evidence of hatred of the product  you did some great analysis of vcra’s “secure texting” features the point here is if vcra is the only company that provides this we are doubtful that is the case  selling products to an uninformed customer then releasing a press release about it being a big win is a pump – in our view perhaps you disagree we welcome your further thoughts on this  motorola’s sale to zebra was a business decision motorola’s sale of vcra was an investment decision we don’t see the direct simple connection between the two that you suggest  we do not believe vc’s sell their stock in every company they invest in once an ipo occurs we believe investors whether vc or others sell their stock when they believe the time is right and an ipo is not necessarily the right time to sell we welcome any data you have to suggest our view is off base  we believe the only information that could be reasonably viewed as outdated were the nurse complaints we provided previously our new recent report has more current evidence of hatred of vcra’s product we wish you the best however we suggest you sell your vcra shares there is no hope for this company given the competition it now faces and the obsolete defective product it offers max fri    vocera has an app for communication   vocera communication suite   that works on ios android web browser and apple watch york research is flawed and misleading please post a correction thank you editor fri    yes correct we acknowledge vcra has an app for communication that works on ios and android see figure  how is our research flawed and misleading we welcome a discussion add new comment your name comment  contact skytides   terms of service microsoft personalized ad preferences to opt out of personalized ads in this browser your
