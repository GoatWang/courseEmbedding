will the proposed overtime pay rule impact your business august   douglas paul solomon obama’s proposal to change overtime will create a dramatic impact on employees and their finances but what it will really affect is local businesses the president is seeking a change in current overtime pay rules which will allow workers to receive more overtime pay if the proposed rule is approved if you are not familiar with this rule then it is important you familiarize yourself with it – and decide how it will affect your business what is the current rule the current rule states that employees who earn over  per week or an equivalent of  per year are exempt from all overtime rules listed in the fair labor standards act the newly proposed rule will change the overtime threshold to those who earn  per week or equivalent of  per year starting in  this proposed rule is estimated to affect more than five million workers in the united states which is about  percent of the country’s salaried staffers this is estimated to raise worker pay by  billion – if it is approved where is the rule change now it is important for business owners to note that this rule change is only a proposal therefore it is not yet official business owners do not have to start paying their employees the overtime as of yet the next step in changing this rule is having the proposed rule change published officially in the federal register this is overseen by the department of labor dol which gives local businesses citizens workers and lawmakers the change to voice their opinions about the change for the next  days during these  days all concerns requests and so on will be taken into consideration once the  days are up the dol will consider everything they have heard and possibly make changes to the rule based on what has been stated by the public the final rule will only be adopted after this process is complete why the new rule spells disaster for businesses there are plenty of businesses around the country that are opposed to this proposed rule – and for good reason according to the united states chamber of commerce the new rule will especially harm small businesses it has already been estimated by the obama administration that if the new rule goes into effect it will cost local businesses as much as  million each year in overtime costs however the national retail federation believes it will cost much more – estimating employers will pay  million how the rule will affect your employees if the rule does go into action businesses will need to reexamine how their employees are scheduled – and most businesses will try to find ways to limit overtime that they traditionally allowed if an employee makes less than the  threshold and still works more than  hours per week then they must be paid overtime this accounts for more than  percent of workers in the country if however the employees make mostly executive decisions or play an executive role then they are exempt from the overtime rule for your business you may want to speak with an attorney regarding employee contracts and how these changes will affect your future staffing needs an attorney can help you ensure you remain in compliance with the new changes – and especially with unauthorized overtime contact attorney douglas paul solomon today if your business is struggling or you have concerns about your contracts and

from the person operating it as long as they prove that they are separate if however you comingle your finances between professional and personal then the courts may not consider your private assets separate from your business after all that means if someone sues you and the court enters a judgement against you you may have to pay that judgement despite the fact you have business licenses separating your legal liability also read   legal issues to work out before starting your business separating gives tax advantages too there are numerous tax advantages to separating the finances as well it doesn’t matter if your business is run out of your home or an official office separate bank accounts offer you tax benefits a separate account helps you avoid any unnecessary hassles for example when it comes time to file your taxes doing so will be easier when your finances are separate that is because you need to file your taxes between professional and personal expenses separately – and it can be hard to distinguish the difference when you share a single bank account the process of separating the two can be timeconsuming and cumbersome and if you accidentally miss a potential tax deduction you would have to go through the process of an amended return later on – which is more hassle than it is worth keeping a separate account is just the smart thing to do it makes for easier record keeping and if you ever end up using a professional accountant you do not have to worry about sharing your private finances with that accountant instead you give them access to your professional account and nothing more also the internal revenue service has strict rules about homebased businesses and what can be deducted as a “business expense” it will be easier to prove that it is a legitimate business expense when you use a business account rather than your personal checking account for the purchase – even if the personal checking account purchased a legitimate business

new business makes – but shouldn’t july   douglas paul solomon starting a new business venture is exciting – but it can be so exciting that new business owners may forget the law there are some legal basic steps every new business needs to take to ensure they are getting their business off to the right start if you are starting a new business there are five critical legal errors you should make sure to avoid with your new company legal error  not incorporating early enough there are numerous reasons to incorporate early on – and most businesses use it as the first official step into creating their successful business other entrepreneurs do not see the value in incorporating – and often try to start their business as a sole proprietor if you are not incorporated you need to realize that there is no separation between your professional and personal life that means that if your new business venture fails or you have liabilities you could be held personally liable for those debts or liabilities if someone were to sue your sole proprietorship you may have to pay the judgment in that suit with personal assets this is the biggest advantage to incorporating – not to mention the tax benefits legal error  not getting a business license it is against the law to not have a business license no matter what type of business you are running it needs the proper permitting and licensing through your state and city you may even need a federal license – depending on the type of business you are starting homebased businesses are the biggest offenders because homebased entrepreneurs assume that they don’t need a license if they are working from home the truth is they usually need a license and often a special homeuse permit to operate their business even out of their house business licenses are cheap – generally less than  therefore there is no reason not to get one if you don’t you could pay thousands in fines legal error  not using contracts even if you work on your own you will have a client or a vendor that you eventually need to do business with while you may feel confident about what is agreed to verbally you should still get everything in writing to protect your business a written contract can protect your business if you have proprietary information do not forget to have employees clients or vendors sign a nondisclosure to protect that information legal error  not protecting your logo when you establish a logo it helps establish your brand if you do not trademark that logo the value of that logo can easily go out the door a competitor can quickly scoop it up to use it as their own – and sue you for illegally using it legal error  not getting an employer identification number when you establish a business you need to obtain an employer identification number from the internal revenue service this ein works like your business’s social security number it is what you see to file taxes apply for credit and even open accounts eins are also required once you start hiring employees and need to file their wage and tax information most states direct you to the irs website to obtain an ein when you open your license online but if not

consider the three most important involve permits wages and benefits if you are starting a new business you want to have the best start possible which means discussing these three potential legal issues with an attorney first permits you need a business license to operate legally in your state as well as within your city not having a license could result in a business closure fines fees and additional penalties for operating without a license also you may have applicable permits your business needs – especially if you are serving alcohol or if you are working out of your home your attorney can help you identify which permits are applicable to your business and even assist you with applying for those permits wage and compensation laws the federal minimum wage is currently  per hour if you are not paying your employees the minimum wage requirement then you are in violation of department of labor regulations – and could face serious fines you will also want to consult your attorney about special state requirements as federal and state requirementswill often conflict under the law you are required to pick which regulation best benefits the employee which can be difficult to determine healthcare and benefits if you are not familiar with the federal insurance requirements for your employees now is the time to learn ask your attorney if they apply to your business or if you have other special healthcare requirements that do apply to your business you will have several options for offering healthcare under the new law which include offering healthcare through a private marketplace offering healthcare through the exchange system opting to not offer healthcare and then paying the penalty for doing so offering healthcare is still a business owner’s choice and if your business has  or less employees that are not full time you can use any of the three above options confused about legal issues contact attorney douglas paul solomon if you are not sure how to address these three legal issues contact a fort lauderdale business law attorney douglas paul solomon for assistance with your company decisions we can meet with you over a no obligation consultation discuss your business and help you decide the best way to approach these issues call now to get started real estate attorney top  potential legal issues for landlords july   douglas paul solomon the landlordtenant relationship has never been one that is shone in a positive light but it is important to realize that most issues that arise between the two parties are easily preventable if landlords take the time to learn their rights and take the proper steps to protect themselves and their property then these relationships could go a lot smoother if you are a landlord you may have potential legal issues lurking in the dark—waiting to pounce when you least expect it but by being prepared and correcting these issues you may just have one of those remarkable tenantlandlord relationships that most wish they could have potential legal issues you need to correct these five potential legal pitfalls put your real estate business at risk but the good news is you can correct them before they become a true issue  using old standardized lease forms – you know that you need to have everything in writing but if you use a standard application or even a standard lease agreement you are already putting yourself at risk those basic forms are just that basic they don’t have the complexity you need for your specific property nor do they address any unique aspects of your rental property  failing to return security deposits – a security deposit comes with a deadline after a tenant has moved out you are required by law to return that security deposit failing to do so could wind you up in small claims court  asking illegal questions – when screening your tenants do you know about what you can and cannot ask landlords need to be careful about they ask—either in person or on a rental application you are limited by law as to what you can request and asking the wrong thing could put you into hot water some things you should never ask are about disabilities marital status familial status race etc  you make promises you can’t deliver – if you tell a tenant you will do something and you make those statements to make the property more enticing or safer then you better see those promises through all perks and promises should also be clearly stated in your lease agreement – so that there is no confusion later on  you’ve created outrageous late fees – you have the right to charge a late fee but it has to be within reason if you are charging  per day for every day the tenant is late and the rent totals  a month then this might be beyond reason while coming up with a figure is difficult you do not want to look like you are trying to scheme lastly you should hire a real estate attorney to help you create your contracts and even screen tenants an attorney knows what to write in a lease agreement and can customize it to your property ensuring you protect your assets contact paul solomon today if you have a real estate property contact the fort lauderdale real estate attorney at douglas paul solomon today for a consultation by calling   or visiting our office in fort lauderdale we can discuss your real estate transaction or even assist you with your business litigation issues business litigation employment contracts the most easily avoidable errors that cost businesses may   douglas paul solomon you already know the importance of an employment contract but how much time and effort have you put into drafting these complex legally binding documents unfortunately too many employment contracts fail to do what the business intended simply because they don’t take the time to learn the common mistakes—and avoid them these mistakes can cost your business hundreds if not thousands of dollars depending on the facts listed in your employment contract you could end up in breach – even when the employee was the one that breached the contract while it is always best to hire a business attorney that specializes in contracts you should familiarize yourself with the most common errors and avoid them at all costs lack of consideration while drafting if the agreement is not supported by “consideration” the employee may be able to justify their breach of contract this often occurs when an employee is already working for an employer at the time with no agreement then an agreement is drafted if no “fresh consideration” takes place during this draft of a contract the courts may agree with the fact that the past none consideration is present in the existing contract incorrectly using fixedterms and fixedtask assignments in employment contracts there are a variety of precedents that can be structured as fixedterm a fixedterm or fixedtask employment contract is appropriate when an employer has a logical reason to limit the terms of employment such as the employee is a maternity employee replacement which is a temporary position the hire was for a specific job task or project and when that task ends the employment will end too the project is grantbased with a definitive completion date there are timesensitive limitations to the project therefore if a date isn’t met the project will not continue when terms are used inappropriately however it can affect the impact of the employment contract therefore employers need to understand how to properly use fixedterm contracts and also when a fixedterm contract doesn’t apply sloppy termination clauses an employment contract can be terminated as long as it is within what is written in the termination clauses but if your termination clauses aren’t well written you may not legally fire an employee even if you feel you have grounds your termination clauses are the only way out of the agreement without being accused of breach of contract just saying that an employee will get a certain number of days or notice for their termination is not enough instead you must be specific as to what constitutes grounds for termination how much notice must be given and under what circumstancesthe employee will receive severance pay or any pay at the time of termination just some of the benefits that must be addressed in a termination clause include but are not limited to bonuses commissions that have been earned but not paid out base salary retirementbenefits sick pay or vacation pay that has been earned reimbursement for fees or professional purchases as part of the employment contract terms short or longterm disability coverages health insurance coverage not having a written contract while you may have an employment contract if that employment contract is not written you may have difficulty enforcing it later on all employment contracts must be drafted in writing and signed by both parties notarized preferably without any type of written offer it is up to the judge to determine what was really decided in the agreement and just some of the things the judge will have to decide if you don’t have a written contract include whether or not changes in the terms  and conditions is allowed whether an employer can change the benefits of the oral contract what details must be present for a termination if a termination is valid compensation for a breach of contract using a onesizefitsall approach the employment contract you create for one employee should never be recycled and reused on another every employee deserves a unique contract that discusses his or her particular employment situation using the same contract for everyone could mean you limit special provisions that would have applied to a particular employee and could mean you leave out important clauses that applied only to that employee’s position for example using the same contract on a temporary worker versus a fulltime permanent worker these are two very different positions with different employment expectations tightening the scope too much if you have noncompete clauses in your employment contract then you must be careful how they are worded and how tight you restrict your employees you must be within reason under the law – such as not restricting the employee from working for a competitor within the entire country but perhaps just the same city or state confusing contracts with employee policies employee contracts are where you sign on an employee to retain their skills and in return they receive something if you are confusing that with employee policy enforcement then you may have difficulty when you encounter a breach of contract employee policies should be written and enforced separately from employment contracts at all times failure to review and update contracts you should regularly review your employment contracts and update them when their term expires by regularly updating them you can make sure that you have accurate information in each employee’s contract and that you are still in compliance with the latest labor laws never just renew an employee’s contract instead always review it for any inaccuracies clause changes or update it to reflect the employee’s latest benefits or even their new position not hiring a business attorney a business attorney should be the individual responsible for drafting and completing all employment contracts within your business if you are drafting contracts on your own you are most likely leaving out imperative information – and you could even be writing contracts that will not hold up in court hire the business attorneys at the law offices of douglas paul solomon today if you want to protect your business with employment contracts contact the fort lauderdale

your appointment today real estate attorney closing on your home avoid these  mishaps may   douglas paul solomon in a perfect world purchasing a new home would mean falling in love with the house negotiating and paying the cost to the seller and moving right in unfortunately this isn’t how buying a home works if finding your dream home at a price you can afford is the first important step the final—and possibly most important—step is making it through the closing process a qualified real estate attorney can walk you through each step of the closing process but you can start preparing yourself ahead of time by checking out three of the most common problems that go down at the closing table  failure to complete a “walk through” generally homebuyers do a “walk through” before completing the closing this means they walk through the home to make sure no damage occurred between the time they decided to purchase the home and the closing date however some homebuyers forgo this option or ask that the sellers provide money for any necessary repairs typically the sellers aren’t going to do this and if damages have occurred you’re stuck with damaged property—or no property at all  changes in the buyer’s financial situation as the homebuyer your financial situation might change between the time you fall in love with the home and the time you sit down at the closing table examples of financial changes can include excessively using one or more of your credit cards taking out an auto loan for a new vehicle opening a new credit account such financial changes can delay or cancel your mortgage—both of which present serious problems at the time of closing fortunately a real estate attorney with experience in home closings can help make sure you don’t make any of these mistakes leading up to the time to close on your new home  waiting until the end of the month understand that things can go wrong when you close on a home which means you might need a few extra days to get back on track because additional fees can accrue if you enter into a new month waiting until the end of one month to close—and running into problems on that day—can cost you for example usually prepaid interest due at the time of closing accumulates during the month if you enter into a new month new interest accumulates whenever possible try to schedule your closing several days or even a couple of weeks before the end of the month doing so will give you time to get your problems sorted out and get you back at the closing table before another month—and possibly additional fees—arrive
