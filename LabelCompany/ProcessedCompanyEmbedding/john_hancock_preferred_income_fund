you should know the fund’s market price is the last sale price as of the close of the regular market trading session the fund’s market price as of and after july   reflects the last sale price in the broad market market price prior to july   reflects the last sale price on the new york stock exchange the shares of closedend management investment companies frequently trade at a discount from their nav the fund’s cash available for distribution will vary over time and there is no guarantee prior distribution levels will be maintained if for any calendar year the total distributions made exceed the amount of the fund’s earnings and profits as computed for federal tax purposes the excess generally will be treated as a return of capital to holders of common shares up to the amount of each shareholder’s basis in those shares and thereafter as gain from the sale of common shares such return of capital reduces the shareholder’s adjusted basis for common shares thereby increasing the potential gain or reducing the potential loss of a subsequent sale distributions in any year may include a substantial returnofcapital component an investment in the fund’s common shares is subject to investment and market risk including the possible loss of the entire principal amount invested an investment in common shares represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the fund which are generally traded on a securities exchange or in the overthecounter markets these securities will fluctuate in value and an investor in the fund may lose some or all of his or her investment even after accounting for any reinvestment of dividends and distributions fixedincome investments are subject to interestrate risk their value will normally decline as interest rates rise an issuer of securities held by the fund may default have its credit rating downgraded or otherwise perform poorly the fund uses a credit facility agreement cfa to increase its assets available for investment shareholders bear the fees associated with this leverage and may be disadvantaged from the use of leverage it is important to recognize that use of leverage increases the advisor’s fee leverage creates risks that may adversely affect the return for the holders of common shares including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares the risk that the cost of using the cfa will increase with rising interest rates the risk of increased operating costs that can lower fund returns the risk of a decline in the value of an investment acquired through leverage while the fund’s obligations under such leverage remain fixed the risk that the fund will have to sell securities in a volatile market in order to meet asset coverage or other debt compliance requirements fund returns will be lower if the cost of the leverage exceeds the income or capital appreciation derived from securities purchased with leverage if the fund is unable to obtain replacement financing in the event the cfa is terminated the fund would be required to sell securities at a potentially inopportune time incurring tax consequences and its ability to generate income would be adversely affected the fund’s monthly distributions may be from net investment income capital gains or return of capital the distribution rate and income amounts reflect past amounts distributed and may not be indicative of future rates or income amounts distribution rates and income amounts can change at any time closedend fund shares are not redeemable but instead are traded in the secondary market on an exchange such as the new york stock exchange or the nasdaq they frequently trade at a discount to net asset value specialized funds may carry additional risks getting
