cheaper option to the hard cover the information inside was identical and i was able to complete the assignments and follow along in class i find paperback books easier to carry to and from class so this was a great option for me the pictures are in color and the print is more than large enough to read the paper quality is nice and it is not too thin or brittle i used this book for approximately  weeks during the summer semester of  and it did not wear and tear it was also easy to put postits with notes inside and highlighter did not smear across the page this is a very well written book and contains a great deal of relevant information about marketing it is a good high level view for someone who has not been exposed to the field before the index is separated into different sections including name company brand and organization i found this especially helpful when i was writing essays assigned by my professor there is also a very comprehensive glossary and easily searchable table of contents and includes a brief contents and contents section that provided either a quick view of the pages or something more in depth depending on what you needed i would recommend this to anyone
