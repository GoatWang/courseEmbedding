that  motors is much more than just a car company  motors is involved in all aspects of automobile technology including advanced batteries high efficiency and alternate fuel engines hybrid vehicles production of graphene and composite materials mr hu also states that the company has continued to make progress on all its projects however delays have occurred in china with our partner jiangsu aoxin new energy automobile co ltd for the production of the all carbon fiber electric automobiles the reason for these delays at the aoxin manufacturing plant have been clearly stated in two bloomberg articles issued on august  and   the first article titled “ of chinas electric vehicle startups face wipeout” httpwwwbloombergcomnewsarticlesmostofchinaselectriccarstartupsfacewipeoutbynewrules explains that china will only issue a very limited number of production permits to electric vehicle manufacturing companies which will probably eliminate  of the existing electric vehicle companies in china the second article titled “wastetruck maker sportscar startup said near china ev permits” httpwwwbloombergcomnewsarticlesgarbagetruckmakersportscarstartupsaidnearchinaevpermits clearly indicates that aoxin is a primary candidate to receive one of these very limited and valuable production permits the article states “aoxin which produces electricpowered garbage trucks and postal vehicles is owned by the investment arm of yancheng a small city in eastern jiangsu province the mayor had pledged to help the company obtain the ev manufacturing permit as part of the provincial push to promote the development of the newenergy vehicle industry” mr hu further comments the china government reviewers the national development and reform commission ndrc issue approvals at their own pace although the new aoxin manufacturing plant has passed all previous inspections by this agency complications have occurred due to the fact that no other company in china has ever built full carbon fiber electric vehicles before aoxin continues to cooperate with the ndrc for the licensepermit to be issued  motors is anxiously awaiting the arrival of the first assembly line shipment of the new all carbon fiber ego automobiles to the united states to schedule crash testing according to us dot standards this will happen as soon as the new aoxin ego manufacturing plant receives its permit to produce vehicles it should be noted that the ego has already passed preliminary crash testing at the

motors has been negotiating with the city of las vegas to establish its carbon fiber electric automobile assembly plant and we believe the negotiations are very close to culmination the city of las vegas and the state of nevada have multifaceted incentive programs to help  motors bring high paying jobs to the city nevada’s incentive programs include training of the workforce multiyear reduced taxes various financial assistance packages nonprofit programs and a catalyst fund among other programs” furthermore  motors executives have also been negotiating with the las vegas global economic alliance lvgeahttpswwwlvgeaorg which has agreed to work closely with our company in setting up a foreign trade zone lvgea is a c membership organization that since  has helped attract retain and expand companies including levi strauss  co bank of america zappos and solarcity to the las vegas area lvgea has offered assistance to  motors to establish a foreign trade zone for the assembly facility which will be a great advantage for the company’s automobile assembly business plan lvgea is the grantee for foreign trade zone  a program that allows firms to bring foreign goods or raw materials for manufacturing andor assembling into the united states without formal customs entry or payment of customs duties and government excise taxes until products leave the zone furthermore this type of zoning has many facets that can reduce the cost of assembling our electric vehicles in the united states in fact these collective savings can pay for the majority of the labor required to assemble these vehicles in the united states we anticipate that in the near future we will finalize the agreement for building our las vegas facility with the city of las vegas and move forward on this valuable program this will allow the creation of many high paying jobs and bring to the united states an advanced technology that enables  motors to assemble carbon fiber vehicles at very low cost the carbon fiber parts are manufactured in china and shipped to the united states the carbon fiber advanced process developed by italian and chinese engineers makes auto body parts stronger lighter and less expensive to produce carbon fiber is five times stronger than steel and one third the weight of steel this makes  motors’ electric vehicles well over one thousand pounds lighter than

nevada june   globe newswire  today michael hu president of  motors inc us otcqb etfm stated that joseph lastella pece ret a senior engineering consultant for  motors was interviewed on the the big biz show mr lastella presented some interesting and independent views on the future of not only electric cars but the entire automobile industry the interview was conducted on tuesday june   and the show was not only humorous but mr lastella brought with him to the studio many carbon fiber pieces for presentation including the entire front end of the ego car the exhibition also included two youtube videos that demonstrate the indestructability of the ego carbon fiber material the first video shows a frontal crash test of the ego at  mph into a concrete wall with very little indication of damage the second video shows  caliber bullets bouncing off a carbon fiber plate of the same thickness of the ego body the plate was presented at the interview to review firsthand the minimal damage done by the bullets it’s also interesting to note that later on the same day of the interview a major article was published in the wall street journal titled “how auto companies are making their cars lighter” httpwwwwsjcomarticleshowautocompaniesaremakingtheircarslighter which covered specifically many of the items illustrated in the lastella interview and confirming many of his statements this article clearly represents the future of the automobile industry wherein it is experiencing a paradigm shift to ultralowweight vehicles such as aluminum alloy and carbon fiber carbon fiber is five times stronger than steel and one third the weight of steel which makes it the ideal material for future automobiles  motors electric vehicles make use of these types of materials including extruded aluminum alloy frames and the first complete carbon fiber bodies available at consumer prices today it took five years for italian and chinese engineers to develop a low cost process to make this vehicle possible because of these breakthrough technologies no other company can offer a carbon fiber vehicle at reasonable consumer prices other than  motors inc this in depth interview clearly demonstrated the competitive edge that  motors has engineered into its all electric carbon fiber vehicles the success of the big biz interview has sparked the interest of other talk media radio and tv

carbon fiber electric auto las vegas nevada marketwired april   – today michael hu president of  motors inc otcqb etfm announced the successful completion of the marketing program of its all carbon fiber electric vehicle called the ego the test program required prospective customers to place a  deposit check to hold an early delivery position to purchase the ultralightweight carbon fiber electric vehicle the marketing was only available for a two week period ending march   the target test area was limited to las vegas and the surrounding areas were only a limited amount of advertising was done as previously announced the first  vehicles received deposits in the first hour of the sales program the program included many free options for these initial customers please see httpwwwmotorscompreorderpreorderformhtml for details mr hu stated “the company is proud to announce that in order to reward these initial buyers  motors will not deposit any of the  escrow checks and that all these checks will be returned to the customers however all participants will receive all the free options offered in this program and will retain their ordering position for the future delivery of the ego electrics” michael hu continued “if the results of this marketing study are extrapolated to just an area across the southern portion of the united states  motors would have had enough deposits to sell almost all of its first year projected production for the ego in just a two week period of course extrapolation forecasts are not always predictable but then this marketing test program was only conducted for two weeks with limited advertising in only one city las vegas” marketing data and customer participation in a regional preorder launch program such as the one  motors embarked upon is a very valuable tool which other companies can use to evaluate their future marketing strategy therefore  motors will not release the final results of this initial regional offer since we will be using this data to format our much larger nationwide campaign to sell our carbon fiber vehicles later this year michael hu also stated “we have a tremendous amount of gratitude to the people who stepped up and placed their  deposits to ensure that they will be first on the list to receive these vehicles we hope these initial buyers will be happy with all of the free options that are going to be given to them under this program all participants will be contacted about their privilege buying position and free options within the next two weeks” please note that the ego has already undergone extensive computer simulations road tests and actual crash testing in china the ego has successfully passed preliminary crash testing at the world renowned catarc china automotive technology  research center institute httpwwwcatarcaccnacindexhtml it is also noteworthy that tesla motors inc httpswwwteslamotorscom is now accepting  deposits on its new commuter vehicle called the model  which will be a direct competitor for the carbon fiber ego many people have suggested some unusual methods for comparing these two vehicles although  motors does not endorse any of these comparisons it is interesting just to review them to see how electric vehicle buying customers might compare the two companies and the two programs as follows  the estimate for the tesla model  vehicle to be produced is approximately two years in the future whereas the electric ego plant is already completed and ready to start up production of vehicles in a few weeks see video of completed electric ego automobile plant httpyoutubewihxxznga  whereas the tesla  deposit program is worldwide the  motors program was isolated to the las vegas area and was only available for a two week market test period  although manufacturer specifications are not available yet people are estimating the lightweight carbon fiber ego will be approximately  lbs lighter in weight than the model  this will make the ego a much more efficient vehicle especially in urban driving conditions   motors has virtually no liabilities whereas tesla automobile company has liabilities debts in the order of approximately three billion dollars in conclusion there are many other unusual types of comparisons that can be formulated between the two companies some negative and some positive however it is interesting to review peoples thoughts on this new emerging automobile industry we congratulate tesla for their model  unveiling however the superlightweight highlyefficient ego with its all carbon fiber body which is five times stronger than steel and one third the weight of steel built on a high grade extruded aluminum alloy frame is ready to take on any competitor including the tesla model  commuter car and the new electric chevy bolt its not  motors intention to competitively out sell the ego against the model  from tesla or the chevy bolt because of their already existing name recognition however its also true that  motors does not need to sell a significant number of vehicles for the company to become profitable large automobile companies have to recapture hundreds of millions of dollars that they have invested in the creation of their vehicle and they also have to cope with huge overheads this is not true for  motors we have virtually zero liabilities and even if we capture a very small percentage of the marketplace we can turn significant profits even from the initial sales of our vehicles no automobile company has been able to produce an electric carbon fiber vehicle in the  to  price range to compete with the  motors’ electric ego msrp  that after the federal tax rebate will be   motors inc carbon fiber electric auto marketing campaign indicates a

would become available in late  although analysts from barclays and morgan stanley say mid to late  would be more realistic the car has long been viewed as the defining product for tesla — a turning point that will prove whether the company can design engineer manufacture and sell a massmarket comparably affordable electric vehicle” michael hu commented “ motors cannot allow tesla to corner the commuter market in the same way they cornered the highend market four years ago four years ago tesla had no competition and very few other automobile companies were interested in investing in such a small segment of the consumer market however they are now entering into a commuter market where it will receive significant competition “the ego manufacturing plant is complete and ready to begin production and we believe we can compete not only with the tesla model  but also with any of the other affordable electric commuter vehicles competing in the us market  motors will take initial preorder deposits from march th at midnight through march st the company will offer significant incentives for those who preorder the ego including receiving the opportunity to be awarded free ego automobiles this is especially true for those who place deposits on the first  ego vehicles they will have the right to trade in their ego for the ibis four door carbon fiber luxury sedan if and when it becomes available to the us market and receive the full purchase price of the ego against the price of the ibis” interested buyers can fill out a form online at httpwwwmotorscompreorderpreorderformhtml and have  days to fulfill the deposit after march st other details for making the  deposit are on our website people who are interested in this opportunity should read the preorder terms carefully and be ready to fill out the online form starting on midnight march th mr hu concluded “ motors has maintained a very low profile during the six years of development of the all carbon fiber bodied electric vehicles – the ego and the ibis – until they were unveiled on february th at a grand opening in las vegas which received much media attention “its not  motors intention to competitively out sell the ego against the model  from tesla or the chevy bolt because of their already existing name recognition however its also true that  motors does not need to sell a significant number of vehicles for the company to become profitable large automobile companies have to recapture hundreds of millions of dollars that they have invested in the creation of their vehicle and they also have to cope with huge overheads this is not true for  motors we have virtually zero liabilities and even if we capture a very small percentage of the marketplace we can turn significant profits even from the initial sales of our vehicles” the las vegas review journal article titled “a second electric car company is planning to build a manufacturing plant in southern nevada” httpwwwreviewjournalcombusinesssecondelectriccarcompanyplansmanufacturingplantsouthernnevada correctly stated that  motors has completed all the milestones required by an automobile company to begin sales in the marketplace including the ability to produce their vehicles on a mass scale the only item left for the ego is to pass us crash testing standards however the ego has already passed crash test safety requirements according to european japanese and chinese standards  motors inc plans to start taking deposits on carbon fiber autos and extends showcasing event las vegas nevada

day and chinese new year weekend the automotive industry political representatives and news media received the event with great enthusiasm the public had its first look at  motors two car models friday and saturday nights at the news media and special invited guests catered receptions the two models the compact ego and luxury sedan ibis are still on display and the company is inviting the public to see the cars the las vegas reviewjournal carried a major  word article describing the advanced automobiles and the event reporter richard n velotta in the article stated “a second electric car company is planning to build a manufacturing plant in southern nevada and its further along in development than faraday future — it has two car models it is showing off in las vegas this week” mr velotta continued “the  motors vehicles are the first electric vehicles manufactured with carbon fiber materials that makes them lighter and stronger than conventional vehicles giving them added range company officials say their cars will have a range of more than  miles on a charge “joe lastella s senior engineering consultant said the company has worked to keep itself under the radar until it completed five milestones designing a car with carbon fiber building a production plant developing a supply chain creating a distribution network for sales and passing us department of transportation crash test standards “lastella said the company has completed the first four milestones and felt it was close enough on the fifth to show off the car as a celebration of the chinese new year “ carbon fiber is five times stronger than steel at onethird of the weight and thats what makes this car different from anything else on the market lastella said” the las vegas reviewjournal article also explained“the las vegas company officials say the ego which seats four passengers would sell for  after federal energy efficiency tax credits the fivepassenger ibis which is  pounds lighter than the tesla model s sedan would sell for  after tax credits which is less than the cost of a tesla “ motors may seek state tax incentives just as faraday did  motors has been negotiating for well over a year with municipalities to finalize plans for job creation both state governments and municipalities are offering considerable incentives for job creation the company said in a january press release “the company believes job creation is a key issue in the  presidential election and recently added a section to its website calling attention to the prospect of adding  jobs” the entire las vegas reviewjournal article posted on february  is available at httpwwwreviewjournalcombusinesssecondelectriccarcompanyplansmanufacturingplantsouthernnevada mr hu whose picture is featured in the article alongside the ego commuter model vehicle went on to say “we all thought that the ibis – the egos big brother which is a four door carbon fiber body luxury electric sedan – would be the feature of the show however the red ego stole the show and received even much more attention than the ibis “some of the most memorable comments from viewers include that the ibis looked either like a maserati or a rolls royce before they were told that it was a new carbon fiber electric automobile “the credit for the creation of these two future design carbon fiber automobiles and their advanced carbon fiber production technology must be given to aoxin automobile engineers and specially the coordinated effort by the italian engineering firm bensur and more particularly to pasguale bentivoglio paki who holds many of the patents that are incorporated in both of the ego and ibis luxury sedan” the showcasing event was a great success and was well attended in fact  motors decided to extend the showcase beyond february  until february  and considers extending the show even further the display is open from  am to  pm seven days a week at the world famous william carr gallery httpwilliamcarrgallerycom

passes frontal crash test with impressive results las vegas nevada prweb february   – michael hu president of  motors inc otcqb etfm announced today that the first all carbon fiber electric vehicle the ego ev has commenced crash testing in china and has successfully passed the frontal crash test with amazing results the crash tests are being conducted according to european japanese and chinese crash test standards a gif file of the actual moving sequence of an ego car in a frontal crash test at  miles per hour in slow motion reveals that the vehicle substantially returned to its original shape after the test a photograph of the front of the vehicle shows minimal damage after the test the amazing sequence can be viewed at httpwwwmotorscomcarshtml a more complete report on the crash tests will be announced in a separate press release mr hu commented on the results “this means that the carbon fiber body absorbed the full force of the collision and returned to its original shape i believe that no other automobile for the consumer market has ever displayed such a frontal crash resilience and shock absorbance of energy” mr hu further stated “in  the ego was reengineered through extensive stateoftheart computer crash test analysis then  demo ego vehicles were delivered to the chinese government for months of testing to obtain the production and export permits for the yancheng automobile plant” later this year  motors will proceed with the us dot department of transportation crash test program for the ego before it can be sold in the united states  motors will initially sell and distribute the ego built from the yancheng plant in china and then later start assembly of the ego in las vegas nevada the construction plans for the  motors assembly facility in the united states have been progressing for many months and will create numerous high paying jobs please see the press release dated january   titled “ motors inc announces launch of new corporate website

today michael hu president of  motors inc otcqb etfm announced that on january   the company unveiled its new corporate website the internet site motorscom combines many new features to make browsing flow smoother and be a more informative experience for potential customers and investors the press release and investor relations sections feature postings of the companys published press releases automated posting of sec filings and detailed annual and quarterly financial statements the website also contains a new section dedicated to “job creation” one of the most important aspects of the  presidential election centers on the need for american companies to create jobs in this respect  motors has been negotiating for well over a year with municipalities to finalize plans for job creation both state governments and municipalities are offering considerable incentives for job creation this section addresses  motors phase i and ii corporate expansion plans that may create over  jobs in the next few years the new site also points to a recent article published by composites world featuring  motors see link httpcwepubxpcomijan  stating the advantages and the future of carbon fiber vehicles in the automobile industry the article specifically mentions  motors all carbon fiber composite electric ego and ibis its interesting to note that in a different article by composites manufacturing titled “composites on display at  detroit auto show” january   stated “the  north american international auto show naias in detroit featured a number of innovative vehicles that utilize composites including the  honda ridgeline audi’s  htron quattro and the  lexus lc ” this article depicts how important it is for cars of the future to rely on lightweight composite materials to reduce their weight and increase their efficiency and mileage its also important to note that none of the cars featured in the article had a complete carbon fiber body they only replaced certain parts of the cars such as roofs and doors with a variety of lightweight materials its clear that no one except aoxin motors can offer production line all carbon fiber bodies including carbon fiber interior panels at reasonable prices for the general public  motors electric ego and ibis fivepassenger luxury sedan are poised to take advantage of their carbon fiber bodyaluminum chassis architecture to enter this advanced innovative emerging market the website also features many new pictures of  motors ibis all carbon fiber electric automobile at a media photo shoot recently in las vegas see january   press release titled “ motors inc ibis versus the tesla model s sedan” you are invited to receive timely information and press releases on  motors when you sign up for our email news service at httpwwwmotorscom  motors inc ibis versus the tesla model s sedan las vegas nevada prweb january   – today michael hu president of  motors inc otcqb etfm announced that last week the new ibis allcarbon fiber electric sedan arrived in the united states the ibis created a great deal of attention from spectators during its media photo shoot see ibis photo shoot pictures and degree video walkaround at the new  motors website httpwwwmotorscomphotoshoothtml mr hu stated that i would like to clarify some of the internet comments depicting the ibis as an imitation of the tesla model s uninformed people have stated that the ibis emblem is a knockoff of the tesla emblem its really unfortunate that the two emblems are similar but that is where the resemblance ends the following factors i think are more important the ibis body is built totally out of carbon fiber which is five times stronger than steel and one third the weight the tesla body is fabricated from punched out aluminum sheeting even though the tesla body is made of aluminum the ibis is at least  lbs lighter which everyone knows will produce better mileage especially in urban driving conditions the next important point is that the ibis carbon fiber body sits on a high strength extruded aluminum frame not on a sheet metal punched out aluminum frame as the tesla a recent article published by brian murphy on january  titled  motors is going to beat tesla motors to the all important middle market contains comparative pictures of both the ibis frame and the tesla frame readers should compare these pictures and decide for themselves which one looks tougher and more durable see frame pictures here httpwwwmotorscomphotoshoothtml mr hu continued another point is that both vehicles carry impressive battery packs the ibis at  kwh and the tesla at  kwh and  kwh the lighter weight of the ibis will certainly compensate for the slightly lower energy capacity of its battery pack therefore both vehicles will have a similar driving range the next item is cost most tesla model s are priced over  after federal rebates the ibis after federal rebates will be  a cost that is significantly different and not something to sneeze at both cars have a variety of gadgetry based on customers desires however the tesla was the first to demonstrate to the world that an electric car can compete in every aspect with regular gasolinepowered vehicles we acknowledge tesla for this accomplishment however building an electric car that can accelerate from zero to  mph faster than a ferrari although impressive is not what electric cars are all about they are about the environment incidentally the ibis acceleration is comparable to most gasoline operated vehicles on the road today finally lets remember that high powered electric motors used to accomplish hair raising acceleration also consume battery energy at phenomenal rates and are as unnecessary as gas powered muscle cars for the general public electric cars are being developed to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and reduce all emissions including the ones causing climate change we believe the ibis will capture a portion of the highend middle market which offers all of the hightech gadgets at an affordable price and the ego will capture a portion of the lowerend middle market – both due to their carbon fiber bodies and space age aluminum frames which no other manufacturer offers the brian murphy article also states the ibis as well as the ego are poised to move into that sweet spot of affordability and style and could soon become the premier name in the us electric vehicles market  motors inc announces arrival of carbon fiber electric vehicle in usacompany’s ego electric vehicle to be showcased in las vegas electric luxury sedan to follow las

 corporate history  motors is associated under exclusive contract through aoxin automobile with international corporations that have already spent many years and tens of millions of dollars in developing the car that  motors intends to sell these companies include the dongfeng motor automobile group which is one of the largest automobile and truck manufacturers in china its subsidiary aoxin

carbonfiber electriccar manufacturing plant chinas first electric car aluminum chassis robotic welding production line chinas first hightemperature highpressure vacuumassisted carbonfiber molding production line the automobile industry dramatically needs to improve the miles per gallon ratio mileage because of federal standards set in place for years to come experts in the field agree that the automobile industry has made significant advances into increasing the efficiency of automobiles ie aerodynamics engines tires lubricants etc the only way that is now left to substantially increase the efficiency of current vehicles is to make them either smaller or use lightweight carbon fiber to reduce their weight  motors management  motors management team includes phds and industry executives with significant experience in the automobile energy and business sectors in the united states and the international arena their experience includes offers a wide range including the following       the  motors team includes personnel that set many worlds records for electric automobiles between  and  assembled and sold electric vehicles to the us market and achieved the first crash test of an electric vehicle in the united states in        the  motors team has provided significant technology transfers from  motors to its international partner aoxin automobile       the  motors team has extensive experience in building and producing composite and electric automobiles       the  motors team understands the electric vehicle and hybrid market in the united states from direct sales experience  motors is a fully integrated company ready to accept the most advanced automobile ever built into the united states market and we already have customers ready to purchase the vehicle once it is approved for sales in the us market and passes us safety crash test standards and dot equipment approved standards  motors management team has already been successful acquiring united states environmental protection agencys us epa approval and department of transportations us dot approval to import the first three ego ev demonstration vehicles into the united states in summary  motors has extensive business plans projections business strategies marketing programs and complete market profiles to compete with existing automobile companies however there are two important market strategies that we would like to review in this executive summary  unlike other electric automobile companies including tesla motors who required millions or billions as initial capitalization to design and create their cars to produce prototypes and build automobile manufacturing facilities  motors has virtually no liabilities and very minor components of overhead this is true because all the money for the design of the ego ev as previously stated was done by other companies the ego ev manufacturing plant in china which is stateoftheart was also funded by our chinese partners  motors is entering the marketplace with a clean financial statement that has no debt service to address to any extent and can sell vehicles at a very low cost with significant profits even at low sales volumes phase i which encompasses selling automobiles to the american market totally manufactured in china is a stand alone project and will produce significant income for further information please see phase i business plan available upon request   motors intends to assemble the ego ev in the united states with us labor in the near future this is very possible because the capital investment to build the stateoftheart aluminum frame and carbon fiber parts of ego ev already exist in china for this phase ii of assembly of vehicles in the usa we do not need in the united states the capital intensive equipment to build the carbon fiber parts nor do we need to spend significant funds to build a robotic welding line for the space age aluminum frame under the ego ev by concentrating our business on purchasing the parts from our partners in china then  motors can focus on the high quality simple assembly of the ego ev in the usa without expending significant capital reserves for manufacturing equipment its also possible to integrate usa made parts and components the assembly line is relatively simple and straight forward since electric automobiles have fewer parts in them compared to internal combustion vehicles batteries electric motor controller brakes and other minor components furthermore the assembly of the vehicle will be under the supervision and management of us quality assurance personnel who will ensure that we built an automobile with the quality that is accustomed by us consumer market phase ii assembly business plan is also available upon request phase ii is a conservative projection in sales and can be accelerated in time and production to meet customer demand in conclusion  motors enjoys the enormous advantages of being able to assemble the most advanced mass consumer market production automobile in the world  motors has the exclusive license to sell assemble and manufacture the ego ev in the united states without having the enormous burden that other automobile companies must carry we estimate that even limited sales of the ego ev can provide good profits for  motors to illustrate this important factor the forum for growth and innovation a harvard business school think tank published a couple of articles in april and may of  stating “why tesla wont be able to scale” and “teslas not as disruptive as you might think” which clearly state that electric automobile companies that have a significant amount of overhead like tesla motors who have concentrated on the ultra luxury automobile market will find it very difficult to expand their sales into the lower end consumer market where profit margins are much less than what they are accustomed because of its ability to offer the american consumer an advanced lowpriced carbon fiber vehicle

among its extraordinary properties graphene is much lighter than steel and it has two hundred times the strength of steel its the strongest material ever examined stronger than carbon fiber titanium or diamonds graphene has a record thermal conductivity  times higher than copper and is electrically efficient and almost transparent it can be currently applied in the semiconductor electronics battery and composite materials industries new uses for graphene are being proposed or invented every day for example water purification super conductors super computers etc  if we combine technologies graphene cathodeanode and other proprietary electrolytes we can produce the best lithium battery for electric vehicles and power grids an electric car would be driven for  miles without charge and the battery pack can last more than  cycles  locating this highly visible manufacturing facility would attract national and international attention and provide the cornerstone for an advanced nanotechnology industrial park nip because of the timely presence of futuristic graphene the park would attract attention of other high tech companies to montana in a similar setting as california silicon valley  under consideration currently is a tentative plan to build the graphene manufacturing facilities in north las vegas however we believe  motors would consider building this facility in an appropriate montana location also oops this site has expired if you are the site owner please renew your premium subscription or contact support  motors  cars automotive technology for

media photo shoot in las vegas nevada   motors ibis comparison with the tesla model s the ibis body is built totally out of carbon fiber which is five times stronger than steel and one third the weight the tesla body is fabricated from punched out aluminum sheeting even though the tesla body is made of aluminum the ibis is at least  lbs lighter which everyone knows will produce better mileage especially in urban driving conditions the next important point is that the ibis carbon fiber body sits on a high strength extruded aluminum frame not on a sheet metal punched out aluminum frame as the teslamost tesla model s are priced over  after federal rebates the ibis after federal rebates will be  a cost that is significantly different and not something to sneeze atboth cars have a variety of gadgetry based on customers desires however the tesla was the first to demonstrate to the world that an electric car can compete in every aspect with regular gasolinepowered vehicles we acknowledge tesla for this accomplishment however building an electric car that can accelerate from zero to  mph faster than a ferrari although impressive is not what electric cars are all about they are about the environment incidentally the ibis acceleration is comparable to most gasoline operated vehicles on the road today finally lets remember that high powered electric motors used to accomplish hair raising acceleration also consume battery energy at phenomenal rates and are as unnecessary as gas powered muscle cars for the general publicelectric cars are being developed to reduce our dependence on foreign oil and reduce all emissions including the ones causing climate change we believe the ibis will capture a portion of the highend middle market which offers all of the hightech gadgets at an

motors inc to start taking deposits on its carbon fiber electric autos in marchmarketwiredmarch  reblogsharetweetsharelas vegas nvmarketwired  march    michael hu president of  motors inc etfm announced today that  motors will be accepting deposits on their all carbon fiber body electric automobile called the ego on march th st patricks day starting at midnightmichael hu stated the superlightweight efficient ego with its all carbon fiber body built on a high grade extruded aluminum alloy frame is ready to take on any competitor including the tesla model  commuter car and the new electric chevy bolt which are both scheduled to make their market entry in  according to wall street the electric commuter market is developing to be a major potential target which is being addressed by several automobile companiesdue to the egos advanced lightweight materials and design the ego is at least  lbs lighter than any of its competitors presently no one can match the egos efficiency especially under urban driving conditionsin an article in usa today by nathan bomey titled elon musk tesla to accept orders on new model  carhttpwwwusatodaycomstorymoneycarselonmuskteslamotors the author states tesla is expected to preview the model  in an event march  although its not clear whether the company will reveal the entire vehicle anyone who preorders must place a  deposit musk said on twitterthe usa today article further states the company tesla motors has said the car would become available in late  although analysts from barclays and morgan stanley say mid to late  would be more realistic the car has long been viewed as the defining product for tesla  a turning point that will prove whether the company can design engineer manufacture and sell a massmarket comparably affordable electric vehiclemichael hu commented  motors cannot allow tesla to corner the commuter market in the same way they cornered the highend market four years ago four years ago tesla had no competition and very few other automobile companies were interested in investing in such a small segment of the consumer market however they are now entering into a commuter market where it will receive significant competitionthe ego manufacturing plant is complete and ready to begin production and we believe we can compete not only with the tesla model  but also with any of the other affordable electric commuter vehicles competing in the us market  motors will take initial preorder deposits from march th at midnight through march st the company will offer significant incentives for those who preorder the ego including receiving the opportunity to be awarded free ego automobiles this is especially true for those who place deposits on the first  ego vehicles they will have the right to trade in their ego for the ibis four door carbon fiber luxury sedan if and when it becomes available to the us market and receive the full purchase price of the ego against the price of the ibis interested buyers can fill out a form online at httpwwwmotorscompreorderpreorderformhtml and have  days to fulfill the deposit after march st other details for making the  deposit are on our website people who are interested in this opportunity should read the preorder terms carefully and be ready to fill out the online form starting on midnight march thmr hu concluded  motors has maintained a very low profile during the six years of development of the all carbon fiber bodied electric vehicles  the ego and the ibis  until they were unveiled on february th at a grand opening in las vegas which received much media attentionits not  motors intention to competitively out sell the ego against the model  from tesla or the chevy bolt because of their already existing name recognition however its also true that  motors does not need to sell a significant number of vehicles for the company to become profitable large automobile companies have to recapture hundreds of millions of dollars that they have invested in the creation of their vehicle and they also have to cope with huge overheads this is not true for  motors we have virtually zero liabilities and even if we capture a very small percentage of the marketplace we can turn significant profits even from the initial sales of our vehiclesread morethe las vegas review journal article titled a second electric car company is planning to build a manufacturing plant in southern nevada httpwwwreviewjournalcombusinesssecondelectriccarcompanyplansmanufacturingplantsouthernnevada correctly stated that  motors has completed all the milestones required by an automobile company to begin sales in the marketplace including the ability to produce their vehicles on a mass scale the only item left for the ego is to
