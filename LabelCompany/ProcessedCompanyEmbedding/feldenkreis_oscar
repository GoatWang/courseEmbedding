the sec joining us today for this call from perry ellis are george feldenkreis executive chairman of the company oscar feldenkreis chief executive officer and president and david rattner chief financial officer i would now like to turn the call over to george feldenkreis george feldenkreis good morning were glad to report another good quarter for perry ellis international while numerous macroeconomic issues are affecting the apparel industry in the united states and worldwide we are pleased to report that this was a quarter where we were able to improve analyst estimates and build the guidance for perry we are fully focused on growing our core global brands through our excellent inventory management coupled with our strong product performance we delivered an adjusted gross margin of  a full  basis point ahead of last year we will continue focusing on our growth to drive our gross margin to  over the next few years we managed sga very well despite of rising cost and overhead and trends allowing us to report an adjusted ebitda margin of  for the quarter compared to  at the end of fiscal year with this backdrop were confident to project an increase in revenues for this year to a range of  million to  million in revenue we are confirming our earning guidance for the year in the range of adjusted earnings per share of  to  this represents an increase over adjusted eps last year despite that consumer behavior is changing so much so rapidly which approached great question as to the future of the apparel business we feel that we have been building the right infrastructure to be successful in this new environment were concentrated with a focus approach to various growth global core brand and businesses which are perry ellis original penguin golf lifestyle savane cubavera on the women brands as well as farah in europe oscar will inform you about the performance of each of those brands were very proud that through the years we have developed a veryvery diversified and balanced customer base that can achieve solid results despite the fact that some of our business partners are experiencing sales decline we all know that the department store brickandmortar business has been heavily impacted by the growth of ecommerce especially on the womens side by the advent of the vertical european retailers like zara hm primark and japanese uniqlo the department store business represents approximately  of our business we think that retailers have taken the right step to reduce their store base and close underperforming store as they diminish in size the lower inventory niche will allow them to increase their cash flow and increase the cash availability which will help them improve the performance in the years ahead were also applauding the changes that retailers are making to receive flows ensuring that goods are hitting selling floor and customers are shopping thereby driving faster turns or reduced markdowns for them and for us this will provide a more level flow for our quarterly reporting as well as on our quarter by quarter basis generally speaking we believe that the new reduce retail space in america is a very positive development in the long run it provides retailer with more flexibility to maneuver the tremendous demographic implication of generation d and y versus generation x and baby boomers the generational moves are creating a new paradigm which brands and retailers better learn to navigate if they want to succeed from a working capital perspective were able to reduce our inventory to  million compared to  million at the end of last quarter this is our lowest inventory in many years the strategic reduction in inventory allows to drive more profitable top line and allows your company to enter the new fiscal year in a very healthy condition needless to say were extremely proud of the progress we continue to make towards our near and longterm objectives on the international side we continue to be very bullish in the united kingdom and europe as well as mexico and canada business in the uk is already improving considerably while at the same time we continue to increase our business in the continent the first quarter was a good indication that our business is strengthening in the continent and the uk the consumer will always expect in the higher prices consequence of the evaluation of the costs weve seen that by the second half of the year our foreign exchange losses which have reduced our earnings for the last eight quarters will improve considerably as a matter fact were reviewing the possibilities of establishing on operation in the netherland to be able to better serve the continental cost we continue to execute against our strategic initiative to grow our international business in the first quarter international revenues grew  and accounted for  of total revenue up from last year  for the fullyear we expect international growth would to grow nearly to  million  of our yearoveryear to generate  of our revenue up from last year  we remain quite bullish about our business in europe our launch of nike swim across europe is exceeding expectations our latest farah brand continues its strong growth  yearoveryear and is expanding to nonuk business into european market behind urban outfitter asos zalando and specialty accounts are opted due to business in the continent grew over  this year as we expand this reduction in germany and open new markets such as greece israel and soon south africa and callaway which is today the best and most popular golf line in the world is increasing its footprint and penetration in profitable big box or in goods and golf specialty retailer to compliment our core green grass and independent accounts we are managing now six brands in europe original penguin farah vintage farah classic callaway ben hogan and most recently nike swim this gives us a lot of leverage to open totally different channel of this reduction which are critical for the future of our growth ideas and projections for europe we expect that our business in canada will grow over  yearoveryear led by strong perry ellis performance indiscernible accounts in canada then europe and mexico we benefit from our diverse portfolio brands excluding nike and other fashion in swim brand and golf led by callaway and pga tour finally mexico despite currently another challenge we continue to record double digit growth as we optimize our direct nike swim and others swim business with marty liverpool and other important accounts for the quarter international grew by  versus last year on the retail and directtoconsumer front we experienced sales decline more notably in our full price stores and shoe outlets launching  stores for last year cost us  million in revenues and this quarter costs us above another  million however our retail sales were much more profitable this quarter than we have had in the number of years the store that we were depriving this year will reduce sales by about  million but again we will have improved our revenues per share by the end of the year we project to have  stores in the united states we will continue opening store book with a more selective approach and in areas where rental in line with the potential revenue that these stores could generate in such sense on the licensing front during this quarter we terminated the relationship with the major licensee and gave that product license to our current licensee that will now have better opportunities to self product that relate with other was a onetime hit as we called out in november quarteroverquarter comparisons are distorted by some extraordinary transition in any one year and while our licensing partners are not immune from retail another challenge we continue to see organic growth which complements our expansion in new categories and market we have been especially encouraged by growth in perry ellis luggage and footwear with revenue increasing  over prior year our successful launch of our original penguin home fashion with few partners such as deluxe and bed bath and beyond by our triple digit success and leverage in the brand equity and momentum of farah in europe as well as our traction we got another brands in your portfolio to ultimately generate meaningful licensee income we expect four no agreements in this quarter three of which are in international market and we have a robust pipeline of new licensees we expect to conclude over the next several quarter we remain on track to achieve our targets of  to  no agreement to  to  no agreement across our portfolio brands were projecting approximately  licenses by year end we continue to focus shopper in the digital world we have always been forward thinking on technology and weve seen throughout the years how different disruptions have influenced to date market in the united state the original disruptors were really the offprice challenge plus and lower price share this brought commoditization of product that helps their growth as prices kept declining our department stores unfortunately did not see that coming furthermore vertical foreign companies with superior speed to market innovation and fast delivery like zara hm primark and uniqlo strong affected the womens side of the business again striking many brickandmortar retails very hard ecommerce was a major disruptor everybody knew that ecommerce was going to grow but some retailers did not see that way and came in with very late amazon successfully operated a nonprofitable organization which allowed to build an amazing tech company and now it controlled  of searches and keep growing worldwide the next disruptor in the years ahead and a very well be artificial intelligence ai which will continue to disrupt the all retail models and on top of all that the increase in real estate values brought super high rents which many retailers could not effort to pay all of the above five have contributed to the presence state of the first in the retail business so the question is what are we going to do at perry ellis we indentified many of these trends early and because of this we have been able to transition our company to our successful model for the present and for the future were always concerned of our longterm profitability even if it has shortened profit we see the changes in demographic increase in sales via smartphone apps making it easier and easier to shop on your phone this will continue to have a big influence in sales and apparel and almost every other category we have adopted and implemented several digital initiatives using new stateoftheart software in order to lower our cost of design and production were working to reduce our distribution cost by the end of the year we have also acquired data mining software and joined our software partners to help us grow substantially our onsite sales as well as our retail customer digital sales fit to market is an extremely important initiative its obvious in the fact that adidas has through their ability to replenish sold their products in just  days nike has also announced that they plan to double their supply and change speed the investment in the last two years in new plants and equipment in asia to be able to make apparel better faster and cheaper are really mindboggling you have to go to asia and visit some of these super modern factories to realize how much money has been invested in the future our strategy has worked very well and it has allowed us to establish a strong foothold in different channels in different geographies and in different areas perry ellis and product lines were very proud that our financial condition is the strongest in  years for this quarter the company performance and working capital discipline has resulted in a lower net debt to capitalization of  we have a very strong balance sheet ready for growth in both the united states as well as international your company is in great shape thank you i will now turn over the call to oscar oscar feldenkreis thank you george and good morning everyone im pleased to be speaking to you today on our first quarter call the quarter marked a solid start to the year as we delivered sales and earnings above our guidance as expected sales rose in our core global brand with earlier shipments of spring merchandize driving the outperformance versus guidance in total revenues declined as a planned versus the prior year as we remain laser focused on positioning our brands and the higher productive doors while reducing inventory to improve churns and margins importantly the execution of this strategy is elevating our powerful core brand with consumers through the continuous introduction of innovative fabrics and our trend apparel and accessories through the expansions of our marketing to intensify our digital reach and through our actions to make it even easier to shop our brands whenever and wherever consumers choose shop on mobile online and in store during the quarter we also continued to make progress on our speed to market initiative which are expected to reduce lead times so that we bring product to stores faster and meet the demands of the retailers today which are as you know are looking for product closer to the needs of selling and we maintained our relentless discipline on expenses and inventory management all of this served us well and positions our company to achieve our core sales and growth for the year across our divisions golf nike rafealla contributed to our better than expected sales and earnings performance as expected laundry sales declined as we work on the relaunch of the brand as we mentioned during our third quarter call last year we welcome back veronica davis to laundry veronica led the laundry teams since we acquired it in  and was instrumental in driving the brands growth which more than doubled under our leadership we have no doubt that she will be equally successful and will ensure that the da of the brand matches its customers profile with product execution and marketing turning to reviewing our business beginning with golf we are very pleased about our positive performance in golf which demonstrated our continuous dominance in the golf apparel business during the quarter we saw strength in bottoms as we introduce new pants and shorts with a comfort waistband which have exceeded sales expectations we also add new fabrics with new motion technology in the manufacturing of the garments this has lead to a fantastic beginning of the golf seasons for us across all distribution channel and brands in the united states canada and europe as we move into the most important quarters for golf we are very optimistic that these new products will continue to outperform the importance of stretch is gaining momentum across retailers we are pleased to be one of the early movers in offering stretch product and expect to capitalize on our proven expertise in this area the retailers seek us out for with all these new products in our golf brands which incorporated performance fabrics and stretch offerings we are ahead of the competition looking ahead we are very excited about our new fabrics that we will be introducing as well as our pipeline of new initiatives in golf that will continue to drive our performance we are also very excited about the jack nicklaus launch into a large mass retailer with an introduction to  doors we are very excited about the new opportunities with this relationship as it sets the stage for a multitier brand approach our golf callaway golf business also had a strong quarter with a notable strength in the uk which i saw as  increase in sales were looking to capitalize on the continued success of callaways brand performance as recently announced on the earnings call we renewed our callaway license agreement through  which has opened the doors for us to pursue new opportunities for growth across the authentic green grass channel our offcourse specialty and better department store channels we introduced map pricing in callaway which has resulted in a positive response from the authentic channel during the quarter we expand the callaway into golf galaxy pga tour superstore academy and golfhound in canada just to name a few we continue to expect golf to continue to grow in high singledigits this year the first quarter is a largest shipping quarter for the year for nike swim and we are pleased with its performance of retail across mens and womens and young athletes and swim gear our nike business continues to perform extremely well in the us and weve seen significant opportunities ahead to expand international in fact we expect to be shipping product into about  countries by year end giving our expanded relationships as it relates to the product the expansion of hydroguard uv protection swim tops continues to perform well and we expect to build upon the positive momentum with the upcoming deliveries the introduction of extended sizes in men and womens also has been a success across retail which is leading to additional growth as additional retailers add this category going forward entering to q we believe that we are well prepared to meet the needs of our customers as well as our ecommerce accounts which are benefitting from a year around demand online receptive to the new  nike spring season product the preview has been very strong and were very excited about the introduction into new geography overall we expect to maintain our dominance in the swim market where were taking share domestically with the expectations of transferring this success on a global scale perry ellis continues to perform well while the quarter started slow as noted across retail generally early spring product sold well with particularly strength in linen sportswear were very excited about the continuing expansions of perry ellis  at leisure functional sportswear product we plan to expand the  collection further within the specialty accounts in the second half of the year pants under perry ellis portfolio performed extremely strong with positive sell through rates across all customers driven by the introduction of the performance fabrics and new models on the ecom side ecommerce continues to do well both internally and thirdparty were focused on ensuring the experience with the consumer with product in store to online as the same and we will continue investing on ensuring that we’re positioned for strong growth in ecommerce digital going forward we will continue to manage inventories very tightly to maintain a strong sellthrough and fast return we feel good about the perry ellis prospects q given strong early reads on the newness we delivered ahead of fathers day were also excited to announce that we have retained a new pr an ad agency that will help us get our messaging across to the end consumer with an increased emphasis on digital and were also looking forward to the august launch of our new perry ellis fragrance as we mentioned in our q call we named the new president for the original penguin brands and are pleased with the early results while we saw a fine revenue reduction in original penguin as we took a concentrated effort to reduce unproductive retail stores and channels and reduce use this effort enable us to drive quality sales of full price selling and expand our penetration in productive stores as a result we experienced higher internal margins and increase products sellthrough at higher aurs across most of our classification with less promotional activities early spring leads on swim and tees have been the strong product performance categories we will continue to apply this strategy while driving top line growth as well as original penguin as a full collection in tops and bottoms there by guarding our penetration and adding higher productive stores at the same time were focusing our marketing on digital and feel that this effort will enable us to align with the original penguin consumer that spends an increasing amount of time connected to this end turning to the womens and beginning with laundry during the quarter we consciously lowered our instore inventory to give us a fast return this along with our customer focus on fashion newness versus price and a shift to online assisted us to improve margins we just completed our fall  market and were very excited about the plans weve received from our core retail partners and have a confidence that the new managements we have in laundry is on track for growth in the second half of the year rafaella performed above our expectation mainly driven by the early timing of shipments reflecting retailer supporting the new product initiatives at retail we saw a sales trend in the april driven by our new initiatives including the introduction of weekend getaway collection products a traditional company product for rafaella consumer in fact all of rafaella department stores supported this initiative with the weekend getaway launch into  stores at belk bonton dillards boscov and lord  taylor we will begin delivering monthly capitals of the weekend getaway going forward giving customers something new to browse and buy each time sheshops overall we expect the retail environment to remain challenging with the possibility of additional store closures and retail bankruptcies expected in the usa even with this backdrop we remain confident in our ability to deliver core sales growth as we have aligned our brand and our businesses with higher productive door and the expansion internationally and t direct to consumer it is also important to note that we have a diversified brand portfolio diversified channel and we offer niche lifestyle to service the mass change stores department stores and special markets as a company we are very disciplined and focused on managing inventory tightly and delivering product closer to the time of the need while providing a continuous flow of new innovative products to market to deliver our growth and profitability goals with that i would now like to turn the call over to david to review our financial guidance david rattner good morning everyone in the first quarter as we noted in our press release we recorded revenues and earnings per share that exceeded our guidance consolidated revenues for the quarter totaled  million which was ahead of our guidance reflecting strength in our core businesses with the earlier shipment of spring merchandize oscar just spoke about as compared to the prior year revenues declined driven by retailers preference to receive products closer to need to increase their churn which we spoke about on our q call in march as well as negative foreign exchange and the reduction in owned stores which benefited profitability by segment revenue in our mens sportswear and swim segment totaled  million as compared to  million in prior year increases were noted in our core golf apparel nike swim and other brands revenue in our womens sportswear segment totaled  million as compared to  million in the year ago period increases in our rafaella business were offset by planned reductions in laundry as discussed by oscar directtoconsumer revenue totaled  million as compared to  million in the prior year mostly due to the closing of  stores last year that resulted in a much more profitable store base store comp was down  in the quarter but comp traffic was down  for the quarter as we focused on the customer experience by door also our store comp margins were up nearly  for the quarter reflecting the strong consumer response to our product assortment total dtc comp sales were down  yet comp margin dollars were flat reflecting higher aur based on a twofold approach one being internal pricing strategy and two moving away from highly promotional events overall we were very pleased with our performance in a tough environment licensing revenues totaled  million as compared to  million in the prior year as discussed last year we transitioned from two of our license partners one brought inhouse and one a new partnership as george has commented this was part of our strategy to elevate our brands globally as we expected this transition reduce revenues in this segment of our business versus last year moving on to total company results beginning with gross margin we continue to be very pleased with our gross margin expansion as margins expanded by  basis points versus prior years adjusted basis continued solid performance in our mens collection golf apparel and nike swim businesses were additionally assisted by improved margins in our directtoconsumer business we also continue to benefit from efficiencies in our supplychain infrastructure sga totaled  million for the quarter as compared to an adjusted amount of approximately  million in the prior year sga in our current fiscal quarter included  million of anticipated cost that are not expected to continue excluding this sga was in line with prior year we are pleased with our cost discipline to effectively manage increases in wages and other inflationary cost that are closer to  to  per year turning to the balance sheet inventories continue to be managed extremely tight and believe our in great shape to support our forward sales forecast our inventory discipline enabled us to pose a net debt to total capitalization of  as compared to  in the yearago period this places us in a very comfortable position to support the expansion of our businesses looking to quarter two we expect revenues in the range of  million to  million compared to  million in the yearago period we expect revenue growth in our mens collection and golf apparel businesses and also expect to benefit from the continued roll out of nike swim in europe and latin america and further expansion in global golf brands we see gross margin approximately  for the quarter which reflects higher margin shipments in q due to customer risk sga is expected to be relatively consistent with adjusted prior year levels reflecting our ability to offset inflationary cost pressures due to the plans shift our pretax earnings are tax rate is expected to be higher in q versus last year which is expected to negatively impact the quarter by  to  per share compared to prior year for the above reasons we expect earnings per share to be approximately  to  for the second quarter as compared to an adjusted  in the prior year as we look at the remainder of the year we see continued headwinds from lack of consumer traffic and macroeconomic issues we feel that we are positioned well in terms of our product focus and our execution and performance accordingly we are maintaining are guidance for revenues of  million to  million and adjusted earnings per share for the year of  to  this continues to reflect the gross margin rate between  to  despite the challenges in the global market we continue to focus on controlling those items within our control elevating our brand and improving our profitability with that i will turn the call over to the operator for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions well go first to ronald bookbinder with coker  palmer ronald bookbinder looking now at the environment you talked a lot about the shift to ecom but is that really picking up all the merchandize or do you think industrywide there is just too much product out there also not just too many stores but just too much product oscar feldenkreis i think it’s a blend of both i think that definitely ecommerce is growing i think the challenge that we’re seeing and the improvement that were seeing as we experience with some other channels and distributions that were actually seeing a shift of one the product is actually being delivered which in retailers are starting to operate on less inventory in the store and focusing more on the turn and delivering product quicker which is similar to what some of the vertical retailers have been successful doing offering more deliveries more frequently ronald bookbinder and you guys talked a lot about europe and your focus on building up the infrastructure there but do you think the channel shift that we’re seeing in us to ecommerce do you see the hitting europe sometime in the next year or two george feldenkreis thank you ron for your comments we don’t see that happening that quickly number one there are really no major department store europe outside of indiscernible spain and im taking about continental europe in the uk of course there are large department stores on which very similar business with the us or in europe its only spain and to some degree germany not as important as in united states so its harder to substitute the small time indiscernible prevalent in all of europe when it comes to amazon et cetera et cetera so we don’t  we see the same  there is no question that the european ecommerce as a matter of fact in many cases and some countries has a higher percentage of the market than in the united states but it’s a different situation brands are still more important in europe than in the united states although other total they represented total smaller percent of the total market and there is no question that we have some brands that have a lot of appeal to the europeans like callaway nike and even penguin and perry is a good brand there from before so we see europe as a very fertile market for us to grow and when i mean europe i mean all the countries in europe including the middle east et cetera et cetera ronald bookbinder and on the jack nicklaus to that mass merchant how much of a revenue benefit do you think that will be for q opening up over  stores oscar feldenkreis well its already included in our numbers revenue numbers for this year and we hope that that will perform well early performance has been very strong and hopefully that will continue that momentum will continue and hopefully for next year and possibly q as we start again the spring season well be able to gain further market share so were very excited with the jack nicklaus launch and well have more updates in q in terms of what other additional opportunities that we see with the golf segment ronald bookbinder okay and lastly i think you had some notes that recallable in april how are you guys looking at that given how strong your balance sheet is with cash being generated george feldenkreis were not  at this moment we dont have plans to call it frankly we are waiting for  hopefully one day well have a change in the tax situation and we have funds in europe that through our european corporation that there we can use for growth in europe so depending on how we see our  the needs of our growth in europe initiatives we can bring in enough money to pay down the debt so that is  that is really what were waiting for were waiting for a few months this stage of the market we feel its more prudent to be on a very strong cash position for anything that might happen for good or bad there are going to be big opportunities on ma i feel because many of the players we talk about the smaller wholesale business general were talking about the number of companies that are not going to make it theyre going to be looking to be acquired so there should be some up on that at prices that we have not seen in years operator and well go next to eric beder with wunderlich eric beder you guys have done a great job of being very innovative with the product when you look out how do you keep that competitive edge in having just being like kind of the leader with these active brands and some of these brands here in terms of product offerings oscar feldenkreis well eric thats a very good question we have a strong organization overseas we have a strong merchandizing team and we also have a development team in asia that is very focused on helping us create innovative product and we constantly our merchandizing team oversea is constantly reviewing what all new possibilities are out there to incorporate within our sportswear brands and our where best selling product today as ive mentioned in just alone in golf and some of the introduction in performance fabrics into even perry ellis which we just introduced a fourway stretch pant under perry ellis performing extremely well and that for us has you know ive always believed product is king you have product consumers will buy regardless eric beder great and when you look at amazon and your own online ecommerce how is that going and where do you think it should go over going longerterm george feldenkreis well ecommerce of us has been very strong ecommerce even if you look at just this first quarter alone thirdparty ecommerce was up plus  and just alone in golf alone ecommerce was plus  this quarter so were very excited with the opportunities as you know we mentioned last year that we invested heavily into photography studio inhouse as well as now we are going to be adding videography which will allows us to create more videos for our thirdparty and as well as our online ecommerce sites which will allow us to have more  the consumers have more knowledge about the product and as well as well as we are upping our game when it comes to social marketing and market digital marketing as well but we feel that there still a lot of run room for us to begin to open up additional ecommerce sites of our own within our portfolio of brands we are planning on launching a laundry ecommerce side in the second half of the year which we are very excited as you know was a dress market today almost  of the dress market is done online and we feel that this could be a great opportunity for us and we are in the process now of looking at other golf brands that we launch online as well we feel that dtc online definitely has a potential to be a  million business for us over the next three to five years eric beder question for david in terms of inventories youve done an outstanding job in terms of reducing inventories around how much more can you go david rattner well as george mentioned our inventories are in excellent shape right now we ended at a  million for the current quarter compared to running  million prior quarter we our turns  our approaching are right at four times at this point and given where we are at were comfortable with our inventory levels throughout the remainder of the year and we see inventories ending flat yearoveryear from  million to  million eric beder okay and different kind of question you talked about  we obviously know theres a lot of disruption right now in the retail environment how aggressively and what are you guys doing to make sure that you are paid and that you have a deal with some of this retail bankruptcies or these companies loosing financial ability to pay debt david rattner we on the accounting  on the ar side we whatever  i would say were pretty well funded with either a factoring or an insurance or were carrying our own paper but i would feel that our account receivables outstanding are in a pretty good shape oscar feldenkreis our receivables are  were very current right now we are in really excellent state with our receivables and we do monitor some of the riskier accounts very closely making sure that we are not over extending ourselves from a credit perspective so we have a very diligent eye on receivables and certain customers operator we will go next to greg pendy with sidoti greg pendy my question i guess as you guys were early to see the downturn in the store base and took the pain awhile ago but now on the call you mentioned the possibility of opening of new stores where they make economic sense can you just give us a sense of how you see in this environment what is economic sense in the new store opening do you look on cash on cash returns or how are you viewing a potential new store and what are the hurdles youre thinking about oscar feldenkreis were opening up more  were looking at doors very very cautiously based upon the analysis that were doing they have to profitable i would within the first year were looking pop ups versus signing longterm leases there is more pop opportunities we just opened up a pop up in aspen colorado which were very excited its about a six month opportunity and if were successful we will stay in that location its small its a  square foot store so its substantially smaller than the  or  square feet that weve had before so were looking up pop ups were making sure that were in the right location as we know in real estate location location is very important and that’s the approach were taking we’re not going to be crazy opening up stores weve opened up some new stores in the airport here in miami with original penguin and its been extremely successful generating over a  a square foot and we see that airport stores as a great opportunity as you know more there is more and more travelers today than ever before and we feel that could be a good opportunity for us in the long run operator operator instructions we will go next to ed yruma with keybanc capital markets unidentified analyst this is mac on ed obviously department stores have been challenged were wondering how youre feeling about orders moving forward specifically are you seeing your partners become even more conservative or is it more so just status quo and similarly for sporting goods lot of consolidation and disruption in this channel how do you feel about your product there what’s working and whats not and finally can you give us an update on your swim business in the channel thank you oscar feldenkreis okay we will take question number one regarding department stores department stores have been planned flat they started  we plan the business since last year almost six to seven months in advance and were planning our business with them in certain categories flat in other areas up but of course that goes by geography weve seen sales in the south east south west let say united states continuing to do well so that’s where the emphasis is going versus the mid tier of the  the mid zone of the states geographically have been probably most challenged by because of weather et cetera that many have reported but we’re planning our business flat to a slight increase but its all depends on the brand and the actual retailer when it comes to the sporting goods channel golf is growing as i mentioned and we continue to see opportunities in the sporting good side the retailers that have exited or gone out of business in the sporting good side we were never selling them much except sports authority and nike swimwear where a lot of that market share has been picked up by the other retailers that are strong out there today either via ecommerce or via brick and mortar so we feel positive about the consolidation and less stores nike is an extreme is very extreme powerful brand and i would say that we are the leader when it comes to swimwear for all genders within the sporting goods channel and our business is up and were trending up were having a great season weve introduced a lot of innovative products like stretch and swimwear which has been brand new and that’s been very disruptive from the nonstretch product that has been out there and were seeing basically its all about innovation and servicing the customer both from a mobile digital perspective to brickandmortar our swim business has been excellent as i mentioned first quarter was very strong we delivered a lot more swimwear in q and q this year and last year which has were fueling the sales of our growth both from sporting goods to the traditional department stores to chain stores to ecommerce sites our swim business continues to be extremely strong and very dominant and the same applies to our international business our partners like with asos and in mexico canada our business with nike swimwear has been veryvery strong unidentified analyst thank you and so for the mens business are you seeing any new trends i know you said linen was strong but i believe that was also the case last year is there anything new youre seeing this year fashion wise oscar feldenkreis well i think the disruption this year in the newness and mens wear has really been print both the knits and wovens as well as stretch and bottoms has caused the consumer to go out there and replenish their bottoms wardrobe once they try a pair of stretch comfortable pant maybe a pant or a short thats what creating the replenishment needs for a consumer to go out there and buy something that they dont have in their wardrobe today so our bottoms business as i mentioned both in golf and perry ellis are extremely strong and we see that momentum very positive going forward and were applying the same technology by the way to our womens rafaella bottoms business which has been very strong because we adapted some of the technology in our mens side to our rafaella bottoms side operator and with no further questions in the queue id like to turn the conference back over to george feldenkreis for any additional or closing remarks george feldenkreis thank you i would like to

welcome to perry ellis internationals fiscal year  fourth quarter and year end earnings results conference as a reminder todays conference is being recorded before we begin i would like to remind you that some of the comments made on the call either as part of the prepared remarks or in response to your questions may contain forwardlooking statements that are made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  such information is subject to risks and uncertainties as described in the press release and in documents that we have filed with the sec joining us today for this call from perry ellis are george feldenkreis executive chairman of the company oscar feldenkreis chief executive officer and president and david brettner chief financial officer and anita britt who is assisting with the transition of the cfo office and is an additional resource to answer any questions it is my pleasure to now turn the call over to mr george feldenkreis please go ahead sir george feldenkreis good morning weve got to report on a good year for perry ellis international we completed the rationalization of our brand portfolio and we are now fully focused on our core global branch with numerous microeconomic issues affecting the apparel industry in the united states and worldwide we are pleased to report that our core wholesale business increased by  or  on a constant currency basis through our management of payment coupled with a strong product performance we delivered an adjusted growth margin of  a  basis points ahead of last year we will continue focusing on our goal to drive our gross margin to  over the next few years weve managed sga very well despite rising cost and overhead and trends allowing us to report on adjusted ebitda margin of  for the fiscal year and  for our fourth quarter with this back drop we are confident to project an increase in revenues for fiscal  to a range of  million to  million in revenues we are projecting our revenue guidance for the year in the range of adjusted earnings per share of  to  which represent an increase over adjusted last year eps it is why we think this is very achievable we are concentrated we focus approach to our various global core brand and businesses which are perry ellis original penguin indiscernible and the women brand oscar will inform you about the performance future of those businesses we have developed a very diversified customer base that can achieve solid results despite the fact that some of our business partners have experienced their decline we all know that the department store business have been challenged while department store business represent approach in nearly  of our business we think that the tailored have taken the right step to rationalize their store base and clothes on the performing door we are also upholding the changes that the tailored are making to receive flaws ensuring that goods are in the selling floor when customers are shopping  thereby driving fast returns and reduced markdowns this will provide a more level flow for our quarterly reporting as well on a quarterbyquarter basis at the same time we are intensifying our distribution through other third party ecommerce partners specially the distribution as well as through our international network which remains very underdeveloped generally speaking we believe that the new reduced retail space in america is a positive development in the long run especially in light of the way which retail is moving these days and the demographic implication of generation z generation y versus generation x this alphabets of generations are really creating a noparadigm which manufactures indiscernible have to learn to navigate if they want to succeed from a working capital perspective we were able to reduce our inventory to  million compared to  million on the end of last year this is our lowest inventory in the last six years strategic reduction on inventory allows to drive more profitable top line and allow your company to enter the new fiscal year in a very healthy condition needless to say were extremely proud of the progress we continue to make toward our near and long term objective the national business will continue to be very bullish in the united kingdom as well as in europe mexico and canada we feel that once we get a better idea of how brexit will develop business in the uk will increase considerably while at the same time will continue to increase our business in the continent as strategic decreases of our multibrand distribution in the europe and the uk is paying out we are now managing six brands which gives us a lot of runway to grow brands are original penguin farah vintage farah classic callaway ben hogan and most recently nike swim nike swim has had a very strong sales through in the few channels where we delivered this year we expect this to be a great growth opportunity for the company in the future we feel that in the next few years our nike swim will be  millionbusiness and have the potential to grow further as nike corporation extends our distribution territories on the retail of directtoconsumer front which bidding ph sales declined more notably in our full price stores and some market youll recall two years ago we announced that we will be closing stores that are no longer profitable much of that profitability was lost because of rent increases by small operators were happy to report that last year we closed  stores six penguin stores and four perry outlets these closed stores have revenue of  million last year of that store contribution was a minus  million we are now planning on closing five additional store that had revenues of  million last year and lost  after this five closing we have  stores remaining that generate a negative furor ph of those will be closed in the next two years and consequently will return our retail businesses strong profitability if not before then by the end of the year we project to have  stores in the united states and we intend to continue opening stores with a more selective approach in an area where rents are commensurate with the potential revenue that these stores could generate in such sense on the licensing front weve completed another successful year adding  new licensees to our seven of our branch organic revenue increased by  and is steadily growing licensing continues to make a strong contribution to our operating performance our licensing team remains focused on new markets and categories for our programs as well as targeted opportunities for our licenseonly brand in addition to the strong pipeline of new project we fully expect that the strategic growth of our direct business international will generate a national expansion of lives in business as we leverage the brand equity of our portfolio of brands we will continue to focus on what we do best among other things global sourcing we have great overseas organization that we just initiated in the production to engineering project or erp this project will allow us to reduce considerably time from product conception to store delivery process also involved working together with our business partners to achieve those results retailored are realizing of the currencies indiscernible in advance is no longer working and design will be done much closer to the delivery dates very good competitor like zara hm et cetera have succeeded in this strategy of realstint to market american retailer most adapt such methodology or it will be impossible for them to compete with worthy competitors were investing in a new warehouse management system and reengineering and distribution centered to drive better efficiencies and to reduce our sgia well also continue to lower our sourcing cost by consolidating some of our overseas offices we believe that we are a very strong company unfortunately some brand and some players in the industry have experienced major difficulties some of it the consequence of overpaying for brands have product equity group overpaying for business in the last few years while not having the proper management in place by  it is estimated that generation y those born in the s or early s will represent  of the retail business we continue to look at the future with confidence while we continue to build our brand that resonate with the younger generation of consumers such as original penguin cubavera gione ph and especially nike at the same time through our increased marketing activity we keep our current followings happy while we work to bring in new customers our strategies have worked very well in the last couple of years and it has allowed us to establish a strong foothold in different channel different geographies and different products were very proud of our financial condition it is strongest in  years for fiscal  the company performance and working capital discipline generated  million in operating cash flow or  per share resulting in a historical low net debt to capitalization of  we have a very strong balance sheet ready for future growth in both the united states as well as international your company is in great shape i will now turn the call over to oscar oscar feldenkreis thanks george good morning to all in joining us on the call first id like to welcome david rattner to the management team he comes with a wealth of consumer product experience spending over  years at elizabeth arden i look forward to his contribution to the company the fourth quarter marks our th quarter executed under our point growth in profitability plan we have made solid progress towards the objectives of focusing on our core lifestyle brands which generated solid expansions in growth margin ebitda margins for the quarter and full year as it relates to revenues our core brands performed well in total our revenues for the quarter trailed the prior year has increased conversions on our retail stores was offset by traffic declines driven by softness in the overall environment and we had a  millionshift in shipments to week of fiscal  due to retailers request we completed the exit of over  brands and  million in revenues over the last three years positioning us well to focus on our core global brands in the years ahead we continue to focus on the international expansion which is a  on a constant currency basis representing  of the total revenues our balance sheet ended the year in a very solid position with the strongest credit metrics we have seen in the companys history fiscal  capped the year of outstanding inventory management with levels turning just about x per year and down  over prior year end this will continue to be a key focal point for us for the years ahead the year included solid progress towards implementing initiatives that we believe positioned us possibly for the dynamic shifts in how consumers are shopping today focus on differentiated brand with a strong heritage and innovative qualities and accelerating their shift online on both fronts we believe we are set up to win we have positioned ourselves very well for the increase in focus on digital and ecommerce growth while making the right investments over the last three years we now serviced direct in third party ecommerce from design through fulfillment internally and have grown to represent  of our total revenue base investments in cutting edge marketing technology platforms such as dynamic personalization crm driven segmentations and omnichannel attribution equips us to better drive our direct as well as our customer ecommerce business using crm to build new prospecting segments throughout our digital marketing activities coupled with our customerbased loyalty programs have driven increased results across indiscernible in our target audience another critical factor to our success has been an unwavering focus on evolving new products to meet the lifestyle needs of the consumer today we have combined this focus with a steadfast discipline in our supply chain we continue to make inroads in forwarding our rd capabilities into product coupled with providing a faster process and turn to that we can be proactive in design innovations and convert to the onfloor product we are implementing new technologies in d design which will produce our process time as well as sampling cost with that said we are operating in a global world where change is constant consumers are demanding brands and product excellence

our business initiatives perry ellis we have heard from many of our retail partners that mens apparel was one of the top performing areas for the quarter our third party ecommerce continue to be the star of all distribution zones we implement a new marketing initiative with many of our partners to increase the focus and investments around digital this will ensure that we drive brand awareness through social media outlets which we believe will broaden the appeal from a product perspective the units we delivered performed well driven by innovative technical fabrics with performance enhancing stretch wicking ph properties as well as stain resistance in easycare features we also continue to benefit from our increase in wearing our fabrications which our consumers are looking for as we move through fiscal  we see performance attributes being a strong theme from a washable suit to our performance pants we are not only maintaining our strong innovation flow but also ensuring our enhancements our top of mind with consumers through marketing campaigns and point of sale communications and our expectations from the positive performance in mens to continue our support by a positive initial response to our transitional spring deliveries most impactful is the consumers buying new units that he can wear immediately this is driving a shift in our flow of goods to customers ranging up to three weeks later to target the selling through our versus last year were excited by the change as we will provide a more even flow of shipments by quarters making q and q more impactful we also believe this will result in faster turn over on lower mark downs as our good reside on the selling floor for less time original penguin our fourth quarter for original penguin was solid our retail despite a lower shipments overall given our focus on reducing access inventory to alleviate the prominence of the brand the strategy continues to be a successful one as evidenced by original penguin driving the largest percentage of our licensing gain for the year with five new agreements across the us europe canada and south africa we believe this brand is one of the largest opportunities for the future growth our priorities for opg in fiscal  are to increase specialties to our distribution as well as ecommerce and as we look to partner with retailers that we believe enhances the cool factor of the original penguin brand we are energized by the strength of the brands direction and positioning our leadership position in golf apparel continues to be driven by product innovation and technology during the quarter end year this led to a solid increase in our core golf brands at wholesale and retail our technologyinfused product assortments help ensure our customers be wellprepared to handle the temperature ranges in q from cold to warm this new innovative product led to strong performances in our lightweight layering programs elements and weather series as well as in our optitherm series which has a thermal insulation stretch water and wind resistance warm weather climatic zones benefited from our motion flow  stretch mitts coupled with new expandable wait band bottoms and lightweight water repelling shorts which also drove solid sales in fiscal  our core golf business will continue to expand in distribution with key specialty retailers the callaway brand has taken on a more focused approach to grow our revenues and market share within the authentic golf channel we will expand our growth to include golf galaxy pga tour super stores academy and golfhound just to name a few as well as other fine golf courses as we see europe as a continued growth opportunity for the callaway brand today we service all of europe in more than  to  doors in the authentic channel were also excited about our jack nicklaus brand launch with target set for second quarter we feel that this is an excellent opportunity for target to showcase a worldclass brand with topnotch lifestyle products we plan to launch in  doors as well as an online for the summer of  as you know fourth quarter is a key period for the swim season our nike swim business return to a solid performance we were very pleased not only with north america but the initial early reads in our new markets of latter america and europe we are pleased with our international expansion and see more growth to come in fact at year end approximately  of our business was represented outside of the usa as we look to spring we believe we are positioned well as early indicators across all genders have been positive both online and instore encouraging trend shows solid interest in womens which is a major growth category to complement our mens business our product initiatives and stretch swim fronts uv protection and tops dry fit and hydro tees are off to a strong start for the season equally exciting is our launch into key retailers in europe including asos next el corte inglés jd sports as well as swim specialty stores turning to womens sportswear while womens sportswear was a very challenging zone in the fourth quarter we believe the rafaella performed better than most branded businesses newness in our new fashion deliveries coupled with our new denim which benefits launch in the third quarter were key drivers performance attributes including stretch and textured fabrication resonated well as we are transitioning into spring products we are pleased with our initial selling which incorporates collections that bridge consumers needs for the career into casual and were also taking advantage of the undeserved plus size consumers which expanded our product offering laundry saw success in the fourth quarter driven by holiday occasion dressings as we look to fiscal  we are expanding doors with key upscale retailers which is critical to the success of the brand we are equally pleased by the strengthening of laundry online

internationally and to further drive profitability gains we have a more focused business pattern we have solid momentum in many of our core brands and businesses at the start of the year and are particularly excited about the core strength of our mens wear business the new roll outs within nike international and the golf lifestyle expansions into target with a highly talented team strong lifestyle brands and initiatives in place to generate domestic and international sales growth at increased margins rate we feel we are very wellpositioned to achieve our guidance and move towards our longer term profitability goals id like to turn over the call to david rattner david rattner thank you oscar good morning everyone id like to begin by thanking anita for the strong leadership she has provided to this organization the company have benefited from her expertise and she has inspired people all across the organization with our passion for the business i am truly excited to join the perry ellis team in the six weeks i have been with the company i have met with the majority of our operating area and im delighted to be working with the company that not only has powerful brands but also a strong infrastructure and an abundance of great talent across the organization i am keenly focused on adding value in guiding the business from a finance perspective but also keeping a very diligent eye on infrastructure discipline as well as a very healthy balance sheet in support of our future growth plans turning to the quarter as outlined in the release we discussed the challenges that we saw in the quarter which hindered our fourth quarter top line growth certainly the team has been prevalent across the industry in the consumer space with that said we did perform very well on our core businesses as evidence by our healthy gross margin and tight inventory levels i believe its important to point out that for the year we realized a solid  increase or  in constant currency in our core mens businesses detracting from this growth were our planned exits in reductions in the challenging traffic at retail during the second half of december and january which we could not control while we solidly converted more customers once they were in our stores the traffic delta of midsingle digit declines in the first few quarters of the year to a  decline in q was a huge obstacle to overcome the traffic trends also impacted our flow at year end with retailers once again looking to receipt later in their warehouse than the original plan with that shift we ended up shipping  million of goods in the first week of february from the original plan of january let me run you through our segments for the year revenue in our mens sportswear and swim segment totaled  million as compared to  million in prior year increases were noted in our perry ellis golf lifestyle apparel and nike swim businesses this growth was offset by business exit and the negative impact of foreign currency translation revenue in our womens sportswear segment totaled  million as compared to  million in the year ago period solid shipment growth within the department store channel was offset by reduction in special markets in indiscernible shipment driven by a higher level of available goods in the marketplace directtoconsumer revenue totaled  million as compared to  million in the prior year comparable sales decreased by  for the year and  for the fourth quarter bump traffic was down  for the year and  for the fourth quarter on a positive note we converted stronger  basis points for the year and  basis points for the fourth quarter by managing a sharper assortment in store we kept comp margin through the year at plus  and down  for the fourth quarter licensing revenues total  million up  million as compared to  million in the prior year this area of our business benefited from new agreements with the remainder driven by the strength of our core licenses for perry ellis and original penguin moving on to total company results beginning with the adjusted gross margin gross margin exceeded expectations as outlined in our release with fourth quarter gross margin expanding  basis points and full year  gross margin expanding  basis points the critical drivers for the quarter and for the year had been diligent inventory management coupled with strong product focus which has driven stronger merchandising margins and solid retail performance somewhat offsetting this expansion foreign exchange negatively impacted gross margin by  basis points for the year and  basis points for the quarter we have countered by taking strategic price increases where appropriate we have also seen currencies moderate against the dollar and expect to see less pressure on gross margin from currency in the second half of fiscal  adjusted sga totaled  million for the quarter as compared to  million in the prior year period full year sga totaled  million as compared to  million in fiscal  during the year we realized  million in sga savings driven by reductions across our corporate structure and well as in more strategic sample productivity in numerous other areas turning to the balance sheet inventories ended the year inline with our guidance of  million down  from  million reported in prior year not only our inventory very tight but aged goods are the lowest they have been as the percentage of inventory in five years turns expanded to just under four times for the year as well our operating performance coupled with inventory discipline enabled us to generate  million in operating cash flow for the year and continue to improve our coverage ratios our strong balance sheet puts us in great position to continue our global expansion in our key businesses turning to fiscal  the landscape continues to evolve retailers are becoming more focused on driving profitable sales in closing for core performing real estate as seen during the recent holiday season consumer focus on digital is gaining serious traction with not only the millennials but with other generations including the baby boomers price is important to most consumers but must be accompanied by quality and great fashion our company is positioned exceptionally well to address these changing dynamics we are leaders with our retail partners maximizing productivity of our ongoing stores by focusing on product merchandise assortment and investing in digital asset as fiscal year  is under way we are excited about the future year we entered the year with our retail partners having very clean stock levels we have completed the heavy lifting of our brand and business exits executed over the last three years and our core businesses are performing well our forward revenue guidance for the year of  million to  million incorporates the carryover of  million in retailer shipments from q and core growth of almost  or  million our revenue guidance also incorporates a  million negative impact from foreign exchange principally in first half of the year as we anniversary the brexit impact to the pound in july we are planning directtoconsumer even for the year as store exits are expected to offset healthy growth in ecommerce driving our  million revenue growth expectation are the new introduction of jack nicolas golf apparel into target nike golf introductions into europe and latin america as well as new introductions in canada for original penguin golf and perry ellis while we expect to see further growth we believe it is prudent to remain curious with our guidance given the back drop of stored closures that continued to be announced gross margins are expected to expand to approximate  to  we continue to expect the same drivers of inventory management and product performance to position us to achieve this improvement while not factored into our guidance we do see opportunity for gross margin expansion in our international business in europe as we take price increases beginning in fall  to offset currency sga is expected to decrease to  to  of revenue from  of revenue in fiscal  we expect ebitda margin to increase in the range of  to  depreciation and amortization should range  million to  million and interest ranging from  million to  million interest assumes the fed will step in another two to three times before year end our tax rate is expected to approximate  and shares are expected to increase slightly to a range of  million to  million we see earnings per share ranging from  to  for the year finally operating cash flow is expected to approximate  per share with capital expenditures approximating  million to  million as we look at the quarterly flow oscar has mentioned the reflow of goods by our retail partners to rebalance q q and q we see approximately a threeweek reflow which will decrease q revenues by  million but increase q by  million q by  million and q by  million therefore we expect q revenues to range from  million to  million we expect q eps in a range of  to  per share obviously with the reflow to the remaining quarters we expect to see most quarters expanding in revenues and eps in closing while im new to the company my goal over the next  days is to enhance our strategy with a focus on growth optimal resource allocation expense management and value creation there is a lot of energy in the teams under george and oscar and i am focused on identifying and implementing initiatives to make it even more efficient in the near future with that i will turn the call over to the operator for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and well take our first question from eric beder from wunderlich please go ahead eric beder good morning congratulations on a great end of the year david rattner thank you oscar feldenkreis thank you eric eric beder when you look at some of the new issues here for target what products are you offering there in terms of categories and is this your first time significant in target oscar feldenkreis we tested with them in q  some product that was this small golf collection under the nicklaus brand and it was very very successful and going into the q well be shipping them a full collection that will include shorts and tops its our first entry into the store side we have been doing swim wear with them  ladies swimwear online only for the last couple of years and this is a new introduction in being able to develop a branded business with target stores both in stores and online but were very excited about the opportunities going forward eric beder in terms of the debt you have that  million high yield piece of paper i believe after april you can call that at par what are you assuming in your projections with that and what should longer term the debt levels be for you david rattner ill take that one this is david as you know weve done a solid job of generating strong operating cash flow approximately  million over the last three years approximately  million was redeployed into capital including brand shops that have driven stronger gross margins across our businesses we expect to generate another  per share in operating cash flow this year our immediate focus is to invest in our international businesses as well as our core menswear brands we have also been opportunistic with share repurchases and have  million remaining under the authorized plan we will continue to evaluate and purchase where appropriate last and very important we have spoken about calling the remainder of our  million senior notes which mature in april  we are taking a hard look at this which seems like an easy decision but with much uncertainty around global economic and political decisions coming down the road we want to be prudent and well make the determination after the first half of fiscal  so stay tuned on this one eric beder i get that your answer is youre not assuming anything in the estimates being changed in the capital structure david rattner its not in the guidance eric beder okay all right guys congrats and good luck on  year oscar feldenkreis thank you eric thank you for everything operator and well go next to ronald bookbinder from coker  palmer please go ahead ronald bookbinder ah good morning and congratulations also on a very nice quarter oscar feldenkreis thanks ron ronald bookbinder on target you guys entered walmart a number of years ago with the ben hogan brand what kind of revenues were you doing with walmart in golf beforehand and what kind of revenues does ben hogan do today such that we can sort of see the opportunity with target oscar feldenkreis walmart is currently today worldwide about a  million business ronald bookbinder and it was basically a zero beforehand oscar feldenkreis it was zero when we opened the brand basically we built it up with them and its canada europe and the united states and its a full collection of product ronald bookbinder and on golf you guys have done a terrific job of building out your golf business its primarily shirts though and historically your company has a very strong mens bottoms business is there an opportunity to build out a golf pant business not just shorts but a golf pant business with the new fabric technologies that are out there oscar feldenkreis yes just to clarify paying golf we do mens and ladies and  of our business today is ups to bottoms ratio so  to  tops to  to  bottoms that includes shorts and pants as well and we also do wind wear and fleece so its a full lifestyle collection that is available  months out of the year and theres a lot of excitement going on in bottoms today because the bottoms business has been reengineered with expandable waist bands new technologies also stretch has played such an important role for the consumer to go out and replenish their wardrobe by buying stretch in their garments ronald bookbinder on the stores you were going to close more stores than you have you sort of reset that after the landlords became more realistic do you regret now as we look at these comp figures from q and the traffic trends are some of those stores that ended up being able to renegotiate the leases do you somewhat regret having those stores or how should we think about the store growth going forward george feldenkreis we identified the necessity to close stores before a lot of much bigger people announced it last year in that sense whatever would be negotiated it was on the basis that the stores will be profitable but we closed  stores last year and theres already one that we closed the year before thats a big number when youre thinking that sale of  of our store were going to be closing the onethird  decided when we close this year we have another group and this has expired in  and  and those were big stores too if they dont improve obviously the traffic improved on our retail knowledge of the business improved were using all kind of system et cetera et cetera to try to build traffic also in the marketing side but in the final analysis depending on what is the traffic in the center as some of the centers also are closing the big anchored tenant it will act like everybody in that center we have to be very careful now in omitting in retail especially with some of the  the trend is now that ab super centers are going to be open and the cmds are not if you happen to be in a center thats not ab you have a very large percentage of probability that you will not be making money and if youre in ab the more developers are trying to balance their loss of income by increasing their rents on the ab thats why so many specialty store business are going out of business ronald bookbinder okay the inventory is so tight right now and a nice indiscernible doing great but how should we think about yearend inventory for fiscal  david rattner yes this is david ill take that one our discipline on inventory management will be driven and focus throughout this year our inventory should be even at  million to  million range at year end so it will be relatively stable yearonyear ronald bookbinder okay great thank you very much and good luck in the new year david rattner thank you oscar feldenkreis thank you rob operator and well go next to greg pendy from sidoti please go ahead greg pendy hey guys thanks for taking my call and congratulations on a good quarter just wanted to touch on the top line guidance and just how do you guys were thinking about coming up with that number and just given the fact that a lot of your competitors have a much larger store flick print how theyve pulled back on what theyre shipping into that channel and whether that could create any wide space opportunities for you oscar feldenkreis can you repeat your question please greg pendy yes just going into your guidance on the top line revenue for the year and just whether youve been seeing any pockets where a lot of the competitors have pulled back what theyre shipping into that channel and whether that could create any opportunities oscar feldenkreis were always looking for opportunities in wide space and the great thing is that were very focused today in our brand portfolio but there is opportunity still today out there of course instore and online our authoritative position within our brands portfolios today with original penguin perry ellis and our golf business allows us to take market share as other brands either change their channel distribution or reduce their channel distribution and the great thing is that we have a very diversified portfolio of customer base as you heard from george department stores are only a segment of our retail and then we also do business with the midtiers where they change stores and mass as well as authentic golf channel so we feel that there is definitely still white space opportunity and remember that we also have the growth of many of the new initiatives as we discussed on the call greg pendy okay thanks thats helpful and then i guess just thinking about inventory turns you said products moving  i guess is hitting the shelves faster at retail just what your thoughts are about as the landscape for retail now were starting to see closures have you guys experienced any of those slowermoving store closures out there in the environment also aiding inventory turns at all or is it too early to tell oscar feldenkreis well we over the years  retailers have been saying that their main focus is to make sure that they have the right assortment in their ab doors and as well as the increase of online business has allowed us to ensure that the ab doors are the doors that have the right assortment and the right level of inventory because other than the stores really that turn inventory much more quicker than a cd et cetera level so were constantly analyzing our inventory in the actual stores and our weeks of supply to ensure that were very fluid and be able to turn and reduce markdowns in the stores  which at the end of the day the higher your returns the higher your sellthroughs the less dilutions you have and the more productivity you can create in the stores greg pendy okay thanks thats helpful george feldenkreis i also wanted to add oscar that the retail that our closing store are closing the worse stores and many of our products are not in those stores even when they are those are the store that sell slowly the product and take big markdowns in a way it might hit us in a  or  less sales makes a penny or something like that in reality the markdowns probably will be less than what we lose on the revenue side greg pendy got it thanks operator and lastly well go to ed yruma from keybanc capital markets ed yruma hi good morning thanks for squeezing me in anita if youre listening best of luck going forward just a couple of quick things i think first on this revenue shift i guess what disability do you have particularly to the back half revenue do you have orders in hand or i guess what percent of the book at this state is complete to give us confidence that this revenue will actually just shift towards to disappear oscar feldenkreis were in the process i would say that the first half of the year has already been booked and were in the process now of finalizing q so we have definitely confidence that this would materialize and we also planned our revenue numbers for this year based on the expectations that the holiday season again will be dismal as it has been for the last couple of years has been the track record if we have the ability to do better we will have the inventory available to be able to do more but its  were very conservative were very cautious and as interest rates go up retail is a very concern and also making sure that their inventories are part to when the actual trends are needed ed yruma got it and george you mentioned kind of agility and speed of supply chain i know you decided obviously the successes that some of the vertically oriented retailers are enjoying i guess as you think about kind of speeding up the supply chain in the way you go to market could you contextualize kind of how many days or weeks you could take out of the existing supply chain and how you can be maybe more responsive to this rapidly shifting order patterns thank you george feldenkreis look the partner stores especially and some of the other retailers and system having sample of products before they play therefore they  you see what amazon is doing by not showing a sample of anything they sell the consumer is now getting more and more used but on a digital way we have now introduced totally new software that you can look at the garment and see how it moves around the body under  degree so that will avoid the necessity in many many cases especially in the mens business of fits and making sure that it fits etcetera because you see it on the screen the designer sees it on the screen but they can make adjustment on the screen this is number one number two is if the buyers would be able to buy from the digital presentation we had a number of our class win such a presentation with one of our major customers and it was a trivially successful buyers come by from digital whereas im asking for sample you can cut the production process by  to  months because in that sense other than the product that we make for our own stores etcetera etcetera not lies where we take the  but we are actually taking the risk of the product other than that when we do a business with  i mean actually majority of our business its all done by showing example before if you got that process you will be able to cut a  to  months of deliveries so you will be able to  for example normally on the swim business you study march designing and show samples in july indiscernible then the buyers ask you  they come to a shore in july and then they ask you to place orders in september september to be delivered in decemberjanuary now if you can design in june you will actually know what sold this year in december so when youre this time for next year you will have a much better idea that you have in the month of march before this year season even happens so those things are really delaying the process of making product in a fast way and making it to the consumers in a fast way ed yruma great thanks so much operator with no further questions in the queue i would like to turn the call back over to mr george feldenkreis for any additional comments or closing remarks george feldenkreis thank you first of all i want to take this opportunity to thank and interpret ph for a very important contribution to the growth and stability of this company we are indebted to you anita  im sorry for the great job you have done and we should be very best in your now future activities i would like to thank all of our stockholders and annual shareholder and look forward to updating you on our start to fiscal  after

and chief operating officer of perry ellis international is on a mission that extends far beyond continuing to increase company profits that is almost a fait accompli for this talented entrepreneur with a strong vision a creative edge and a passion for his work since joining his father george feldenkreis founder of this leading company in men’s apparel oscar has taken the company to new heights expanding product categories acquiring trademarks growing the customer base and in  taking the company public soaring profits to an unprecedented level heritage oscar feldenkreis ceo of perry ellis international contributes to a number of jewish causesshare for your average joe that would be quite a feat but feldenkreis is not average by any means nor is he one to rest on his laurels instead he works tirelessly to give back to the jewish community the state of israel and various medical institutions committed to research after all that is his family’s heritage fleeing communist cuba when the young oscar was only  year old his parents found refuge and later fortune on the shores of miami beach fla his father became very active in the latin division of the area’s jewish federation and soon became its president holding meetings at the family home today the younger feldenkreis sitting in his house overlooking biscayne bay in miami recounts listening to his father at the meetings and participating in the federation dinners as a young boy he now holds a cabinet position at the greater miami jewish federation and each year he tries to donate more money than the year before “being successful you have to be able to share and our family is very big on that — on being able to give back as much as possible” feldenkreis said “we’re very much involved in jewish causes where i would say we give a big percentage of our donations” each year feldenkreis donates tens of thousands of dollars to miami’s jewish federation he also purchases vast amounts of israel bonds to help bolster israel’s economy and he is contributing to the funding of the expansion of temple menorah in miami beach his nonjewish philanthropic efforts include donations to the university of miamijackson memorial hospital feldenkreis contributes to these organizations as a private individual and not on behalf of perry ellis though he is driven to expand the business not so much for his own personal benefit but rather to increase his ability to give with his philanthropic goals in mind failure has never been an option for feldenkreis in fact it’s failure that he fears “i think that businessmen that have that type of fear will always be successful because they are going to try as hard as possible to make sure that they do not fail” feldenkreis said perry ellis international achieved a great measure of success and expansion under his leadership when feldenkreis joined his father’s apparel business in  he started a pants line that he called feldini an italian spinoff of his last name and he started developing what he calls “the bottom business” with the same levelheaded practicality that he exuded during our interview feldenkreis recognized that the average american consumer did not want to pay  to  for pants made in italy he then realized that there was an opportunity to develop pants manufactured in korea that made of  wool or woolen blends would sell for only  to  it was this move that put the company in a relationship with federated department stores which in its day comprised the large department stores that dominated the apparel industry the momentum grew from there feldenkreis was responsible for the company’s tremendous growth spurt during the s with profits rising to  million in  from  million only a year earlier he and his father decided to take the company public on the nasdaq exchange turning the company’s fortunes then  million to an astonishing  million in one year’s time “we started to grow almost  every single year” feldenkreis said in  the company acquired its first true brands and today it boasts a composite of such familiar labels as perry ellis manhattan john henry mundo del marco axis and treaco st rafael to name a few perry ellis international is also the licensee for pga tour golf and holds the license for all categories of nike swimwear feldenkreis is always on the move seeking out new opportunities for his miamiheadquartered company with multiple offices in asia and on both american coasts “our culture is very entrepreneurial we’re about growth” he said no one can say that feldenkreis is all work and no play to the contrary he can be spotted each hanukkah in aspen colo with his wife of  years and their three daughters ranging in age from  to  “we light hanukkah candles in aspen” he said the five family members also enjoy boating and they travel to europe together during the summers when at home they enjoy traditional sabbath dinners and keep kosher feldenkreis said with pride having attended hebrew academy of miami beach feldenkreis is a strong believer in passing down jewish values to his children who attended jewish day schools in fact he begins each day by donning tefillin feldenkreis is very active at temple menorah a large wellestablished conservative synagogue in miami beach as a board member he serves on a committee charged with building an updated synagogue and a new social hall “for the last  years i have been doing the israel bonds campaign drive at temple menorah” he said feldenkreis recently ascended the podium as the honored guest of the  israel bonds dinner where he spoke about the complex issues facing israel today and in the future “it’s a very troublesome situation” feldenkreis said describing the challenges that israel faces and the breadth of israel’s enemies which he said reach far beyond the palestinians his commitment to israel is well evidenced from  through  feldenkreis served as chairman of miami’s israelamerica chamber of commerce helping businesspeople look for opportunities to import and export products between the united states and israel “i think the biggest issue we have within the israelamerica chamber of commerce is that we need more people involved” he said “the local israelis that have been very successful here should be much more involved” one of his personal goals is to take a more active role in federation activities “i believe as an american jew that i have to give a big percentage of our commitments to the jewish federation and support for the state of israel” feldenkreis explained he urges others to do the same “the us will continue to support the state of israel… as long as it sees a strong zionistamerican movement for the support of israel on a philanthropic basis i think that there is a lot of need for american jews that are not involved and have the power and the wherewithal to be able to give back to the state of israel” he asserted “i believe that that’s something that we need to work on” the

maryland perry ellis chairman considers selling his clothing company perry ellis settles explosive lawsuit alleging racism homophobia a new lawsuit claims the ​coo of perry ellis ​international ​is a racist homophobe who told underlings to make sure there are “no blacks in my ads” or “anyone who looked too gay​” oscar feldenkreis the son of perry ellis international ​founder ​george feldenkreis allegedly ​made the hateful remarks to a gay senior executive joseph cook  who filed the lawsuit in manhattan federal court wednesday “mr cook has been forced to endure highly offensive homophobic racial and ethnic slurs by mr feldenkreis” the suit ​claims adding that feldenkreis is slated to succeed his father as ceo next year despite his blatently discriminatory beliefs “these include but are not limited to admonishing mr cook and his team to make sure there are ‘no blacks in my ads’ or ‘anyone who looked too gay’ and telling mr cook he could easily avoid jury service by ‘telling them you hate n—–s and f–s’” ​​cooks also says in the suit that the racism came up when he was working to approve a lord  taylor print ad with an underling comparing a model’s skin tone to a black crayola crayon according to the suit cook claims that when he complained about the discrimination the company retaliated against him with a campaign designed to isolate and exclude him ​​“i am deeply saddened as a gay man and someone who has always been proud of who i am no matter my color or sexual orientation that a company executive could be so intolerant of others” cook said in a statement provided by his lawyer douglas wigdor “i hope this lawsuit will change the views of leadership at perry ellis and bring them into the st century” ​​the suit names both feldenkreis and perry ellis ​international ​as defendants and seeks unspecified damages ​perry ellis denied cook’s claims in a statement “perry ellis is a company that promotes equal opportunity and a positive working environment the company is proud of the fact that it is probably one of the most diverse companies in the apparel business following its multicultural roots stemming from puerto rico and cuba” the statement read “perry ellis
