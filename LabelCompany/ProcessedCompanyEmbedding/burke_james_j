wharton school of the university of pennsylvania the article below was originally published at knowledgewhartonupennedu james burke received the presidential medal of freedom in  and was named one of history’s  greatest ceos by fortune magazine in  but it was for his handling of the tylenol tragedy back in  that burke ceo of johnson  johnson from  to  will be remembered most burke died last week at age  in  seven people died after taking cyanidelaced extrastrength tylenol capsules sold in five chicago stores before that happened tylenol sold by jj’s mcneil consumer products division had  of the  billion analgesic market after the deaths jj’s market share dropped to  under burke’s leadership the company spent  million to recall  million bottles of tylenol and relaunched the product two months later in tamperproof packaging burke’s actions have become a legendary example of good crisis management serving as the basis for case studies in numerous business schools and management books more why the falling us birth rates are so troublesome burke not only saved the reputation of the company but he also saved the brand as well by mid tylenol’s share of the analgesic market had climbed to  reaching  by the end of the year in a  wharton school publishing book titled lasting leadership what you can learn from the top  business people of our times burke emphasized the value of the jj credo dating back to the company’s founding in  which stated that the company is responsible first to its customers then to its employees the community and the stockholders in that order “the credo is all about the consumer” burke said when those seven deaths occurred “the credo made it very clear at that point exactly what we were all about it gave me the ammunition i needed to persuade shareholders and others to spend the  million on the recall the credo helped sell it” in his interview for lasting leadership burke also spoke about trust “trust has been an operative word in my life it embodies almost everything you can strive for that will help you to succeed you tell me any human relationship that works without trust whether it is a marriage or a friendship or a social interaction in the long run the same thing is true about business” ironically johnson  johnson has recently experienced a number of setbacks that “have caused many to question whether the firm has lost sight of that credo” according to a knowledgewharton article earlier this year the company’s problems with plants in fort washington pa lancaster pa and puerto rico — the sites associated with recalls of overthecounter products like benadryl and children’s tylenol – “dragged on for years” the article notes two hip devices were recalled in  for postsurgical complications and the company agreed to pay  million to the state of texas to settle claims it improperly marketed the antipsychotic drug risperdal to some patients other suits surrounding the marketing of this drug are ongoing recalls of surgical sutures and contact lenses have been announced as well more  questions for ty burrell years earlier as lasting leadership noted other companies had demonstrated what came to be seen as poor judgment in the way they handled defective product incidents for example cocacola had mismanaged the “contaminated can” incident in europe in  intel had initially failed to respond quickly to the calculation errors embedded in its pentium chip in  and firestone had initially refused to accept responsibility for suv rollovers caused by poorly manufactured tires in  burke’s actions were the opposite according to media reports at the time the tylenol crisis led the news every night on every station for six weeks burke however met the challenge head on contacting the chief of each network’s news divisions in order to keep them informed he also met with the directors of the fbi and the fda “there were many people in the company who felt there was no possible way to save the brand that it was the end of tylenol” burke said “but the fact is i had confidence in jj and its reputation and also confidence in the public to respond to what was right it helped turn tylenol into a billiondollar business” the person who placed the cyanide in the tylenol capsules was never found subscribepopular among subscribers japans booming sex niche elder porn young kids old bodies

prominence but he is perhaps best known for his crisis management in  when it was found that tylenol capsules had been poisoned with cyanide according to a fortune article burkes defining moment actually came six years earlier when he challenged his fellow executives to either recommit to the company credo or tear it off the wall penned by jj scion and legendary chairman general robert wood johnson ii in the s the credo proclaimed that jjs first responsibility was to its customers and then to employees management communities and stockholdersin that order by the mids however burke was troubled by a sense that the credo had lost its influence in the organization when i asked people what they thought of it i got vague answers he says but during a series of challenge meetings he arranged executives debated the credo in the context of the companys history and mission it became clear that our value system had been vital to our ability to outperform the competition for nearly one hundred years burke recalls whenever we cared for the customer in a profoundand spiritualway profits were never a problem the tylenol crisis could have been a death blow to the brand and potentially the company itself continues burke innocent people were killed industry analysts and advertising experts told us that tylenol was finished as several hbs case studies point out tylenol was the countrys bestselling overthecounter pain reliever at the time of the poisonings with  percent of the marketmore than the next three brands combined yet within a year of the crisis thanks to

well my workers compensation case began in  my first attempt at finding a lawyer to represent me did not go well within months it became apparent he didnt know what he was doing and even more so when he withdrew his counsel  years later the opposing lawyers loved this and began calling my house taunting me telling me to just give up and it was a very difficult case i knew this and so i began to think maybe it was hopeless but thanks to the anger i felt from their phone calls and my moms encouragement  i pursued the case i knew i was right and so i started to look for a better lawyerthats when i found lannon lannon  barr in the beginning they were unsure of the outcome and they told me it would be a very difficult case they didnt give up on me though and before i knew it the case was building and moving forward suddenly everything started to look like maybe i actually had a chance i knew very quickly that i had found a very good lawyerwe won the case after losing two more appeals the insurance company finally gave up firing the lawyers who had originally harassed me and admitting defeat i cant even express in words how excited i am with the outcome i sincerely recommend this law firm to everyone and anyone who needs a good workers compensation attorney they wont give up on you they know exactly what they are doing and they work hard for you call thembudin law officesb

recent refund i received from his corporate office it all started with a recent  bump up on my honda insurance i called agent toms office who took the time to review my policies to make sure everything was up to date after i had let him know i no longer drove my honda to work he advised me that would lower the premium i had already sent my payment in but recently i received a refund check for about the same amount it had increased in reviewing my condo policy he discovered i no longer needed the large coverage which i had plus he also bumped up my deductible which resulted in me

you knowinsurance basicsto mitigate the risk of loss people purchase insurance policies from a company when buying a policy the person agrees to pay a premium which is small regular payment based on the losses that may occur if the insurance provider determines there is a greater chance of risk as compared to the average policy the premium is usually higher premiums are often paid monthly and can add up over time up to be greater than the expense of replacing the insured itemmany types of insurance only cover a certain amount of risk on an item the amount the policyholder must pay before an insurance policy begins covering an expense is called the deductible in the event of damage or loss to whatever the policy covers the policyholder is responsible for the deductible no matter what if the cost of damage or loss is less than the deductible amount the insurance company does not pay anything if the cost is greater than the deductible the policyholder only pays the deductible while the insurance pays the rest generally the deductible amount is related to your premium with a higher deductible usually requiring a lower premium and viceversainsurance agents selecting the right insurance involves careful research and evaluating many different options for coverage this is why many people use an insurance agent to assist with making the right choice depending on their needs and financial situation agents often interview potential or current clients to get an idea of which insurance policies would benefit them the most based on their needs and individual risk agents can often give potential customers a quote which serves as a cost estimate for a specific policy this is only a rough idea of what the policy will cost because evaluating the risk associated with a given customer can take time insurance companies often compile an insurance score to quantify the risk an individual poses and calculate premiums accordingly credit scores play a major role in insurance scores but past insuranceclaim history is also taken into accountwhile agents often specialize in a particular category of insurance some sell several different types of insurance agents can work for a larger insurance company or operate independently selling policies from several different insurersinsurance productsalmost anything of value can be insured to protect against loss due to a variety of circumstances insurance policies are very specific in the items they protect and in what event the policy holders will be reimbursed some of the most common insurance policies cover things we all useautomotive insurance millions of americans drive a car to get from place to place each day so it makes sense that auto insurance is one of the most commonly used types in most states the law requires drivers to maintain an active insurance policy on any car up to a certain amount most car owners are required at minimum to purchase liability insurance which protects against damage for which the policyholder is at fault liability insurance covers damage to property as well as any injuries sustained in an accident its important to note liability insurance only covers damage or injuries of others not the policyholder themselves in addition to liability insurance car owners can also purchase coverage for their own vehicle and medical expenses in the event of an accident for this purpose liability vehicle and medical coverage are often packaged together in a single policyinsurance can also be purchased for other vehicles like motorcycles atvs boats or rvs and generally functions similarly to car insurance policies for alternative vehicles may have higher premiums if they are considered more dangerous or might include other coverage options specific to the vehicle many companies that provide auto insurance will also offer coverage for motorcycles atvs boats and rvshomeowners insurance your home condo or apartment is probably the most valuable thing you own or otherwise pay for so it makes sense to get it insured homeowners insurance is important not just for the security of the house itself but for its ability to cover possessions inside the home as well many mortgage lenders also require an active home insurance policylike auto insurance homeowners insurance is typically bundled together with policies covering many different items or categories of items the primary coverage type is for the dwelling insuring the house itself and all structures attached to it policies may also cover property within the home with premiums varying depending on the value of all assets personal liability may also be included for damage or injuries sustained on your property that you are responsible for much like auto insuranceproperty insurance also may cover certain major events outside of your control these are known as perils and may include fire flooding natural disasters and other catastrophic events you may want to purchase insurance against one or more of these perils if you live in a highrisk area flood insurance is an exception however and can be purchased through the governmentsponsored national flood insurance program your lender may require this if you live in a floodprone areahealth insurance to help pay for medical expenses many people rely on their health insurance with the passing of the affordable care act almost every american is required to enroll in a health care plan or they face a penalty health insurance works similarly to other forms of insurance although it is probably used to cover expenses more often since car accidents and home damage are relatively rare compared to doctor visits and the need for medicine health insurance also operates on a premiumdeductible model and policyholders can choose what level of coverage works best for their lifestyle for example if you visit doctors very infrequently you may consider a plan with a low premium and a higher deductible on the other hand people who require regular medical care may wish to pay a higher premium in exchange for more coverage from their deductible dental and vision care are sold as separate plans and are not required by lawlife insurance when someone dies unexpectedly or is injured severely enough to be unable to work it can be a financial disaster for their family or loved ones many people choose to purchase a life insurance policy to support their family in the event their regular income is suddenly lost life insurance comes in two basic types term and universal with a term life insurance plan you pay a premium for a predetermined amount of time usually  years or more if you die at any point in that timeframe your family receives a death benefit if youre still around when the term is over the coverage is canceled and you receive nothing universal life covers your entire life and usually delivers a minimum benefit at deathtravel insurance travel insurance is available for individuals who want to protect against unexpected setbacks in the course of travel whether its losing luggage or medical treatment abroad travel insurance may prove particularly useful for people who travel a lot for work or often visit remote locations travel insurance can take the form of either specific or blanket coverage specific coverage is useful for covering only certain risks like medical emergencies or unexpected trip cancelation blanket coverage may cover some or all of your expenses for your entire trippet insurance pet insurance is a relatively new product that may help cover the costs of medical care for a dog cat or other domestic animal medical care for animals can be very costly particularly because insurance for them is rare by paying into a premium you can help offset the cost of unexpected emergencies as well as routine checkups and medication while virtually unheard of a few years ago pet insurance has become more popular as the cost of veterinarian care has continued to riseumbrella insurance umbrella insurance is extra coverage from liability for other insurance policies usually home or auto insurance consumers may choose to purchase an umbrella policy if their home or car is more expensive than a typical policy would be able to cover for example most car insurance liability policies cover at least  per person or  per accident but if the accident involves a very valuable car or the victim is willing to pursue legal action insurance may not even begin to cover the full cost you may want to hedge your risk by purchasing umbrella insurance to add extra protection to your existing policyinsurance claims basicsto receive a payout for an insurance policy the policyholder must file a claim with the insurance company the basics of the process are straightforward but can vary depending on the type of insuranceclaims adjusters and examiners a claims adjuster or claims examiner is an employee of an insurance company and the person responsible for evaluating claims and determining if the company will reimburse the policyholder at the amount provided an adjuster inspects claims related to property damage as in the case of auto or home insurance policies claims examiners are typically involved in health and life insurance and review medical records to determine the proper payout for major medical procedureshow to make a claim filing an insurance claim can be stressful and confusing but you need to begin the process as soon as possible to make certain you can recover your losses its important to note that in the case of emergencies you should always call  first the safety and health of yourself and others takes precedent over insuranceauto insurance claim if youre involved in an accident you need to call the police right away and have them document the situation you can file a claim upon obtaining the police report its also a good idea if possible to take your own notes at the scene the most important things to record are what happened before the accident the date and time traffic signs in the area and road conditions also be sure to get the other drivers name address license plate number and insurance information even photos taken with a cell phone camera can help the claims process once you have this documentation call your insurance company right away homeowners insurance claim in the case of damage take pictures of the affected area as soon as any safety or health emergencies are resolved take note of what happened and all the relevant circumstances and report to your insurer as soon as possible if any of your possessions were damaged use an inventory of your important assets and make note of this in the claim once an adjuster has made their own report review it for accuracy life insurance claim send your insurer a claim form for each beneficiary in the plan as well as a certified copy of the policyholders death certificate with the proper information life insurance claims are generally straightforward problems may arise if the policyholder has died within two years of opening the policy in this case an attorney may be needed to settle the claimfinding discounts on insuranceinsurance is a wise investment but it can make a dent in your monthly budget thankfully there are a variety of ways to trim the fat off your premiums and make certain you are paying only as much as you needshop and compare perhaps the best way to save on any insurance policy is to take the time to compare prices between as many companies and plans as possible even after youve chosen a plan and started paying into it consider looking around again when it comes time to renew the policy consider using an independent agent when searching for a new insurance policy while traditional agents can still find a good deal independent agents can choose from a variety of providers and tailor your coverage to your specific needs the internet has also made comparison shopping easier than ever before potential customers can often get free quotes online very quicklybuy only what you need insurance agents will often try to upsell on various extra products that may be useful for certain people but are generally excessive for the average consumer stick with basic plans that cover as much as you need without any additional costs for example if the annual cost of your auto insurance is  percent or more of the total value of your car drop all but the most essential coverage this is especially applicable if the car you drive is older and could be replaced with savings otherwise you are paying for insurance that will never actually benefit you in the event of a serious crash it can help to create a budget and know exactly how much income you have to work with before making a decision on a new policytake advantage of discounts insurance providers offer a wide variety of discounts for all kinds of special customers or circumstances in one of the most basic discounts many companies will offer lower rates for customers who purchase home auto and life insurance policies from the same provider car owners may get a rebate from taking a safe driving course for those with teenagers on their plan good grades can earn a small discount as well insuring multiple cars with the same provider may also lower premiums some providers will offer lower rates for military personnel federal employees
