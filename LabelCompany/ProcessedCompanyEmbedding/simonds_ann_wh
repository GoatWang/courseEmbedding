competition by mike hughlett star tribune november   — am leila navidi star tribune ann simonds chief marketing officer for general mills at its world headquarters in golden valley text size comment share tweet email print more share on share on linkedin share on google share on pinterest copy shortlink purchase order reprint the formula for success in packaged food used to be pretty straightforward kick out a few innovations here and there and maintain stalwart brands — cheerios green giant betty crocker — through heavy tv advertising barriers to entry were high and packaged food companies like general mills were seen as stable profitable investments then came the internet and thousands of people were voicing millions of opinions on food how was it grown who made it and so on customers got more skeptical of big food companies and young food firms figured they could spread their message digitally tv wasn’t a necessity the established packaged food industry watched its sales stagnate welcome to ann simonds’ working world she’s the chief marketing officer of golden valleybased general mills maker of everything from soup to yogurt simonds has been at general mills for  years serving as head of the company’s baking division from  to  when she took on the cmo role q it seems like consumers these days are more skeptical about the packaged food industry when did that start and why how do you deal with it in marketing a i think it was sometime over the last  years and for sure in the last five we’ve had to earn our consumers’ trust in a different way and i think at the heart of that is a growing mistrust in general of large institutions public companies and other trusted authorities today consumers seek real food and wellness more than sciencedriven health q so real food and wellness is more associated with small while science is seen as big and complicated a i think real food manifests itself in fresh and healthful ingredients it’s less processed most likely you learned about it from a trusted friend the endorsement of someone you trust — someone you know personally and who has tried or engaged in a brand or product — was and always will be the most powerful form of marketing and what’s exciting about this era is that social networks give us the opportunity as marketers to be part of that conversation q it seems like there’s a lot of opportunity in the digital world and a lot of risk ann simonds hometown denver education smith college ba harvard mba career five years at johnson and johnson  years at general mills where she is now chief marketing officer family she and husband ken have five children a the core art of marketing hasn’t fundamentally changed you want insight that you can twist into an idea and communicate in a compelling way but today we have an audience fragmenting into smaller and smaller groups of consumers so you take advantage of new media for example people who love cinnamon toast crunch love the milk after they eat the cereal because it has this wonderful cinnamon flavor — that’s an idea worth marketing and in fact we did launching a really fun pop music video piece of content that was on youtube it was extremely well received and got millions of views we did another music video with biz markie for lucky charms that also did very well q how about the risk a the emergence of new media has been relentless and we are very careful to invest our marketing dollars wisely but it takes time and a lot of experimentation to really determine where there is a return on our investment also since we are building marketing plans that are meeting multiple audiences we have to make sure that one approach isn’t going to bump up against another and alienate one of our audiences q “big food” is a name of derision and general mills is part of big food how can you get past that tag a i absolutely can because i have been the direct participant in and beneficiary of how a big food company can be a source and force for good our scale can do remarkable things to advance everything from technology to safety and quality annie’s is an example general mills bought the organic mac and cheese maker last year for  million it’s been fantastic to work with the annie’s team and to appreciate all they know about how to nurture an emerging brand with our supply chain excellence we can take what they do and make it available to a larger part of the world q there are so many small food companies out there now what effect does that have a it’s been exciting humbling and at times frustrating but ultimately a great thing for the food business a lot of investment has come into our industry and in a digital world barriers to entry have been reduced for entrepreneurs we’ve learned a tremendous amount from them much of what we are trying to do today is to take the best of what they represent which really is getting back to the basics of really understanding your consumer q last month general mills’ new glutenfree cheerios took a hit when  million boxes were recalled because they might have accidentally contained gluten how has that affected marketing of the product a marketing plans that were previously about driving broad product awareness were appropriately and respectfully rethought we understood we had a new job to do which was to reearn people’s trust q part of that was an immediate apology on general mills’ blog and facebook page right a yes and of course we’ve reached out to all of our critical partners in the development of that product the celiac community consumers themselves loyal fans of cheerios view comments read our comment standards startribunecom welcomes and encourages readers to comment and engage in substantive mutually respectful exchanges over news

balance in animals for almost  years   developed by researcher and equine behavioral ecologist mary ann simonds our stress management and performance support products gently assist both wild and domestic animals with the stress of living in domestic environments our products including magnetic therapy and vibrational flowermineral essences are based on years of research conducted on thousands of wild and domestic horses mary ann presented and published her research at the th proceedings of the association of equine sports medicine national meeting september  rutgers university on “emotional and mental stress management using nondrug remedies for the performance horse” growing up on the west coast showing jumpers mary ann observed many horses with ulcers poor feet cribbing and other stress induced problems resulting from confinement lack of social bonds separation anxiety and other domestic factors mary ann’s concern became her lifelong passion and she researched and developed a line of nondrug vibrational remedies in 5 to treat the most common causes of mental and emotional stress in horses mary ann originally brought her natural vibrations equine stress management remedies to market with toklat originals in the early s relax  focus quickly sold out as a popular horse show remedy for horse and rider while separation  travel helped horses “let go” and feel safe when getting sold weaned or moving to a new barn training is still a popular addition to most compassionate and knowledgeable trainers who want to help their horses understand better while confidence  courage assists all horses in feeling safe see all our blends pioneering the field of equine aromatherapy mary ann also conducted studies on the importance of smell in social recognition and survival for horses while doing her undergraduate research at the university of wyoming  on wild horse ecology after applying and adding more research with a year study on stallions and mares she developed balance oil or should we say the horses developed balance oil  applied topically both the smell and the essences have subtle effects to help balance the thoughts and emotions of horse and human our number  seller balance oil has also been used successfully with a number of autistic children in helping them cope and take control of overstimulation much as it does with horses we believe education is the key to help horse owners understand how to prevent mental stress in horses which then leads to so many physical issues horses are emotional and energetic social beings and respond similarly to other social mammals we have a number of educational media available on herbs aromatherapy behavior magnetic fields flower essencesvibrational remedies body language and horsehuman communication please contact us for more information if people really understood the natural social lives of horses at least as much as we know in the canine dog field more people would apply it to their care and management of horses this would result in far fewer physical and behavioral problems mary ann’s new “edutainment” dvd  “wild horses understanding the natural lives of horses” produced with wildlife photographers barbara and marty wheeler gives insights into the complex and diverse personalities family relationships and equine cultures of wild horses you can also
