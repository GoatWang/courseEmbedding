genes and the normal functions of the proteins they encode the longterm goal of this work is to lay the foundation for the development of new anticancer therapies based on the functions of specific tumor suppressor proteins for example it may be possible to develop a drug that mimics the behavior of a certain tumor suppressor protein or to design strategies for killing only those cells in which a particular tumor suppressor protein has been inactivated thus sparing normal cellswe are currently concentrating on the von hippellindau tumor suppressor protein pvhl the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein prb and the plike protein p pvhl inactivation is common in several cancers including clear cell renal carcinoma our laboratory established that when oxygen is available pvhl targets for destruction another protein called hypoxiainducible factor hif cells lacking pvhl or starved of oxygen accumulate hif which activates a cadre of genes that facilitate adaptation to hypoxia we showed that downregulation of hif is both necessary and sufficient for pvhl to suppress the growth of renal carcinomas in experimental models this work motivated clinical trials of agents that inhibit hifresponsive growth factors such as vascular endothelial growth factor vegf at least one vegf inhibitor will likely be approved for the treatment of renal carcinoma in earlier work by our group showed that the binding of pvhl to hif requires that hif be hydroxylated on one of two proline residues preclinical data suggest that preventing this modification pharmacologically might be useful for the treatment of diseases characterized by impaired oxygen delivery including myocardial infarctions and strokes in other research we are studying tuberous sclerosis a hereditary cancer syndrome caused by mutations of either the tsc or tsc genes we recently discovered that tsc and tsc like pvhl regulate hif we also found that another protein redd plays an important role in adaptation to chronic hypoxia by modulating the function of tsc and tsc the best understood function of the prb protein is its ability to inhibit the ef transcription factor we discovered that prb interacts with another protein rbp which also has features of a transcription factor importantly we showed that inhibition of rbp in cells lacking prb induces some of the same changes observed following restoration of prb function including the induction of differentiation we are now studying the biochemistry of rbp in greater detail traineesbriggs kimberly phd chakraborty abhishek phd frosch hyejin phd gao

studies of rare forms of cancer have uncovered molecular pathways that are important in kidney cancer and have been targeted in several clinical trials kaelin majored in math and chemistry at duke university and then stayed at duke for medical training but his first stint in a lab was horrible so i thought i was making the right decision to become a practicing physician he says after an internship and residencies at johns hopkins hospital kaelin moved to the danafarber cancer institute to train in clinical oncology for the first year he treated patients then he embarked on  years in a research laboratory to fulfill his board certification requirements and to give himself one last taste of laboratory life but the lab closed down  months after he moved in i was getting sign after sign that laboratory research was not for me he says by a stroke of luck he landed in the lab of david livingston who was working on the molecular basis of retinoblastoma the most common pediatric eye cancer having just spent a year on the front line taking care of patients with cancer it was pretty clear that the only real hope for these people was to eventually have a more precise molecular understanding of cancer and to try to translate that knowledge into more effective therapeutics he says in livingstons lab kaelin isolated a dnabinding protein ef that promotes cell proliferation ef is normally kept in check by retinoblastoma tumor suppressor protein prb which tightly regulates cell division but when mutations prevent prb from performing this function cells divide unrestrainedly triggering retinoblastoma throughout his career kaelin has maintained this interest in the regulation of cell division but the field is relatively mature now so we try to contribute where we can rather than getting sucked into just doing the next obvious experiment he says in  kaelin set up his own lab down the hall from livingston looking for a project he read about the identification of the gene for von hippellindau vhl disease patients with this hereditary cancer may develop tumors in the kidneys adrenal glands or pancreas and they often acquire tumors in the central nervous system that look like nests of blood vessels whenever kaelin had encountered this rare condition he had wondered if it involves an abnormal response to normal oxygen levels as well as growing lots of blood vessels the tumors sometimes produce erythropoietin which stimulates red cell production thus they behave like tissue that is short of oxygen kaelin discovered that when oxygen levels are normal the vhl protein helps mark another cellular protein called hif for destruction when oxygen levels fall hif is allowed to persist so it can restore a healthy supply of oxygen by promoting blood vessel growth and stimulating erythropoietin production but how does vhl know that oxygen is scarce and it should leave hif alone for many years scientists had been trying to understand how cells sense and adapt to changing oxygen levels kaelins group discovered that when oxygen is present hif acquires a hydroxyl group oh when there isnt enough oxygen to provide the oxygen atom in this group hif is not hydroxylated moreover oxygen availability determines the efficiency of the hydroxylating enzyme so hif remains unadorned when oxygen is scarce escapes being tagged by vhl because the hydroxyl group serves as the binding signal and survives to initiate blood vessel growth this discovery was surprising because hydroxylation had never been identified as a cellular signaling mechanism but since kaelins finding was published in the journal science in  national cancer institute investigators have identified several genes in the human genome that are predicted to encode protein hydroxylases a major thrust of our laboratory now is to understand their functions and what their targets are kaelin says in  one of kaelins postdocs noted that another hereditary syndrome tuberous sclerosis complex which produces widespread but benign tumors shared some features with vhl disease for example he had observed that rodents with a mutated tuberous sclerosis gene are more like humans with vhl disease than are rodents with vhl mutations the postdoc determined that mutations in the tuberous sclerosis gene such as those that occur in the human disease cause too much hif to be made for various reasons that was a satisfying molecular explanation for the phenotypic overlap kaelin says kaelins work is already being translated into clinical medicine his group determined that kidney cancer often involves nonhereditary vhl mutations that have the same effect as hereditary vhl mutations overproduction of vegf vascular endothelial growth factor which both promotes blood vessel growth and stimulates erythropoietin production recently the fda approved the use of two vegf inhibitors for treating kidney cancer the work on tuberous sclerosis led the group to demonstrate that when kidney tumors lose functional vhl they overproduce hif one solution was to inhibit a protein called mtor mammalian target of rapamycin which regulates hif synthesis now treatments for kidney cancer are combining mtor inhibitors with inhibitors of vegf and of hif synthesis so i think we are starting to make a little dent in kidney cancer kaelin says kaelins group hopes to identify genes that complement or cooperate with vhl mutations to promote kidney cancer they are also looking for genes that become essential when vhl function is lost because inactivating the products of such genes would be another therapeutic strategy im hopeful that by having an even more complete molecular understanding of kidney cancer we can help guide the next generation of clinical trials which almost certainly will involve combinations of drugs that affect different molecular pathways that are important in kidney cancer kaelin says show more articles  newswilliam kaelin receives lasker basic
