belvoir virginia united states john simmons born in fort belvoir virginia is an american actor comedian founder gross national product comedy and washington dcs scandal tours gross national product comedy is a comedy production company whose troupes have appeared on tv and radio in their own pbs comedy specials and stage shows in new york and los angeles and have been called washington dcs comic monument and the capitals resident satirical gangcitation needed john simmons son of a national security agency nsa employee supposedly grew up amid the spy community in washington dc during the cold war it was life as normal as far as he knew to live at remote electronic listening posts to pop in and out of washington every once in a while to attend a different school and make new friends every two years that didnt bother him at all it was fun and it helped me prepare for this wacky life stylecitation needed he attended the university of north carolina and then spent a year abroad at the university of kent in canterbury he studied theatre and history not theatre history he emphasizes then ended up dropping the theatre and graduating in history and journalism i like history more than anything i think that may be why i make fun of the news the kind of stupidity thats going on now has just been repeated through the centuries its nothing newcitation needed the idea of becoming involved in comedy goes bock to simmons very early years he never really wanted to do anything else i wanted to have a comedy group but it didnt seem right it didnt seem like it was attainable for some reason theres no career path for comedy is there you dont go to slapstick university comedy was a real fringe area when i was growing up standup comedy wasnt especially popular then and improv comedy today is still considered a stepchild to standup in  following the year abroad he got a job as a reporter for cch commerce clearing house a really boring law publications company and formed gross national product under another name for excitement and fun i lived this kind of clark kent existence but it was a really great cover i could go in look at the wire service and if nothing was going on id just go home and go to bed it did give me access to press conferences at the white house and lots of government agencies but to translate what really goes on at that bureaucratic level is impossible its so inside the beltway that you cant really make fun of it so you go after whats in the news gnp was one of the first comedy groups in washington dc there was no venue for comedy then we played in rock clubs they did a lot of revues performed in all the clubs in dc and baltimore md and developed a loyal following in  while continuing in dc they started performing in clubs all over new york city then simmons put gnp on hiatus for a twoyear interval – when he came to los angeles to check it out his stay in los angeles included engagements at the cast theatre the comedy store and as understudy to john roarke in the odyssey theatres rap master ronnie the satirical and political theme of his comedy continued regardless of location upon returning to washington dc he revived gnp with a new cast and their popularity resumed the original seat space eventually proved to be too small and in  they moved to a larger seat venue at the bayou the largest night club in washington dc also in  gnp inaugurated their scandal tours an irreverent bus tour of the notorious scandal spots in dc what might explain the transition from a patriotic nsaoriented young boy to someone who looks at the political and social world with such a cynical eye washingtonians are pretty cynical people its the political people and the people who work for them who are usually serious im the product of a very cynical age when i was in high school the watergate scandal was happening the people that i associated with were the sons and daughters of reporters and that ilk so we had a good time during watergate when you live in washington and see this parade of outoftowners every four years you make fun of them some of them are real dorks many of them are there because of politicalfavor appointments and they always roll in with this sense of greatness people in washington are up on whats happening and they want to make fun so we started to make fun of congress and the executive branch just as simmons grew up with watergate gnp grew up with president ronald reagan their favorite target for several years but we make fun of liberals too it depends on whos in power the ability to adapt to a constantly changing world keeps gnps revues up to the minute in content for example the la situation cannot be ignored right now right here the entire focus of a political debate has shifted were in the center at whats going on its a tragedy just like the contra thing but somehow its government with their pants down and they look foolish gnp alumniedit over the years gnp has involved the talents of robin
