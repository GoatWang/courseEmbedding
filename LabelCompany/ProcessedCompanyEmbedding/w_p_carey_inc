article new york june   prnewswire  w p carey inc nyse wpc an internallymanaged net lease real estate investment trust announced today that its board of directors has approved a plan to exit all nontraded retail fundraising activities in keeping with its longterm strategy of focusing exclusively on net lease investing for the companys balance sheet w p careys management and board of directors believes this approach will create longterm value for shareholders by optimizing the companys cost of capital and enhancing its ability to grow adjusted funds from operations affo through a combination of singleasset investments and portfolio acquisitions in conjunction with this decision the company will cease all nontraded retail fundraising activities carried out by its whollyowned brokerdealer subsidiary carey financial llc effective june   all existing managed programs will continue to be managed by the company through to the end of their natural lifecycles by taking these actions and executing on its longterm strategy the company anticipates the following benefits elimination of costs associated with its retail fundraising platform while preserving recurring stable income streams from the existing managed programs through to the end of their natural lifecycles increasingly stable and more predictable earnings as the contribution from variable structuring revenue further declines and earnings are ultimately derived entirely from longterm recurring lease revenues generated by a highquality diversified portfolio of net lease assets new net lease acquisition opportunities become exclusively available for the companys balance sheet simplified disclosure and communication with the investment community and remains wellpositioned to potentially acquire the net lease assets currently owned by the cpa® reits which it has acquired and managed on their behalf management commentary mark j decesaris w p careys chief executive officer said the board and management team continually evaluate the companys business strategy to maximize longterm value for our shareholders we looked closely at the potential structures for new products such as cpa® – global including the types of investments that would satisfy their liquidity and leverage needs and the time and scale required for them to reach profitability our conclusion was that our shareholders would be better served by focusing on our core net lease investment expertise since our founding by bill carey more than  years ago we have focused on delivering increasing income and sustainable longterm value to our investors over that time our corporate structure revenue composition and capital sources have changed significantly the decision we are announcing today is an affirmation of the net lease business bill began in  and another step in our evolution our entire team is committed to delivering value to w p careys shareholders and all of the investors in the funds we manage affo guidance the company does not expect this decision to impact its  guidance range and in conjunction with this announcement is affirming that for the full year it expects to report affo of between  and  per diluted

would never recommend a reit as a buy especially a strong buy and then suggest that i would be happy with a dividend cutrecommending a reit based solely on valuation could result in underperformancenobody likes unpredictability and that’s why i decided to focus my article today on a dividend stalwartquite simply there’s nothing scary about wp careyone of the most important reasons that i own shares in net lease reits is because of their predictable sources of dividend income in a recent forbes article i explained that it’s a lot easier to enjoy the benefits of predictable income and growth without the headaches of the  t’s and by owning shares in reits with single tenant net lease properties as a bond replacement strategy you will be able to “sleep well at night” as we found out earlier this week net lease reits can experience volatility even if the underlying sources of income appear stable as i explained in a recent article spirit realty src was hammered last week as the company reported several credit issues that forced it to amend guidance from the  per share range to  – a  pullback i immediately decided to hit the sell button and the market responded with a substantial pullback… then on monday src’s ceo was fired leaving the company with a modest bench and just a handful of employees who have been with the company for more than a few years one writer jussi askola went to an immediate strong buy when the earnings flop was announced he wrote …the underlying value of the properties has not changed nearly that much… the portfolio is of high quality…the setback is only temporary… this comment was the headscratcher i would actually be happy if the reit cut its dividend he recommends a strong buy and then suggests that he would “be happy if the reit cut its dividend” he added the market is reacting to the news as if the reit was at risk of going under let me be clear i would never recommend a reit as a buy especially a strong buy and then suggest that i would be happy with a dividend cut that is nonsense more importantly jussi is missing one of the most important lessons of investing and one that is critical to securities analysis that is that shareholders are owners and they deserve to be treated with respect and consideration src’s previous ceo was responsible for a number of misfires and thats what ultimately led to his departure the market was not necessarily reacting to revised guidance the market was simply fed up with the complexity created by the management team multiple forced errors recommending a reit based solely on valuation could result in underperformance i have found it critical to evaluate stocks from an owner’s perspective and while a strong buy may sound good on paper a shareholder could lose substantial sums with a dividend cut nobody likes unpredictability and that’s why i decided to focus my article today on a dividend stalwart and “if you like consistency you will love this reit” photo source wp carey invest for the long haul now while i disagree with jussi’s strong buy call with src i agree with his buy recommendation with wp carey wpc jussi writes wpc is an aboveaveragequality reit selling at a belowaverage valuation before comparing wpc with the other peers let’s examine the differences in  bill carey started wp carey  co with a focus on putting shareholders first and by delivering sound risk management practices carey believed that over the long run investors would enjoy stable riskadjusted returns as a pioneer in saleleaseback financing carey was one of the first companies to build a net lease vehicle to assist global companies to monetize freestanding real estate over the years it has evolved into one of the largest net lease landlords in the world with a successful track record of investing through multiple economic cycles since  in  wpc converted from an mlp wp carey  co llc to a reit wp carey inc to boost scale and to simplify tax reporting for shareholders no longer used ks by merging wp carey  co and corporate property associates  inc a nontraded reit the combined company structured as a reit produced enhanced dividend payments and better flexibility to access capital bill carey the founder recognized decades ago that owning highquality real estate would not produce outsized returns over short cycles but that instead the best way to create wealth is to own shares that would generate durable dividends by always investing for the long run see my forbes article on bill carey january   a differentiated net lease reit when i filter out these higherquality reits investmentgrade rated with a long track record of dividend growth i see even fewer opportunities wpc is one such reit that i consider to be attractive based upon my thorough fundamental research i believe the company is a particularly compelling opportunity based on a number of reasons all addressed in this article below first lets begin with the history and composition of the portfolio wpc is a leading global net lease reit that provides longterm saleleaseback and buildtosuit financing solutions for companies worldwide the company is selfmanaged always a good sign and operates two business platforms  owned real estate portfolio  of affo and  investment management platform  of affo i have highlighted cpa above and ill address that later in the article as referenced above prior to converting to a reit in  carey was structured as an mlp and since that time the company has evolved into a diversified enterprise focused on six key priorities  organic growth  through acquisitions for the owned real estate portfolio and new and existing investment management products  diversification  of income capital sources and within real estate portfolios  operational efficiency and excellence  balance sheet strength and flexibility  proactive asset management  transparency  through disclosure and investor outreach at the end of the first quarter wpcs owned real estate portfolio consisted primarily of  properties across  countries comprising  million square feet as you can see below the company is diversified with a majority of industrial  office  warehouse  retail  and selfstorage  it’s important to note that wpc does not have substantial retail exposure compared to adc nnn and o and retail exposure has never been a core strategy for wpc retail is out of favor and ill touch upon the portfolios performance below as you can see below carey invests in a variety of real estate categories with  properties in the portfolio the reit has a diversified model in which no one tenant accounts for more than  in revenue another primary differentiator with carey is its international exposure  the company has been investing internationally for  years primarily in western and northern europe as you can see around  of its revenue is generated outside of the us was  last year and the focus internationally has been in germany  france  united kingdom  spain  and poland  carey has a long history of investing in europe since  and the platform built over the last two decades requires expertise and experience that generates a flow of attractive deals jason fox wpc’s president explains in europe activity has picked up modestly from the levels we saw in  accretive investments with adequate spreads do exist especially given the low cost of borrowing however absolute yields remain low resulting in high prices per square foot which tend to be meaningfully above replacement cost he went on to say …our retail portfolio is heavily weighted to europe but only about one quarter of retail abr located in the us equivalent to just  of our total portfolio abr this is a theme that we had emphasized ever since we began investing in europe in  we believe that the us has fundamentally too much retail square footage per capita a reality that is exacerbated by the fact that the us ecommerce market is the most developed as a result we expect a pace of us store closures and retail bankruptcies to continue other key differentiators one key differentiator for carey  as i noted above  is the companys exposure internationally and another unique quality is its growth drivers approximately  of leases have either fixed or cpibased contractual rent increases with virtually no exposure to operating expenses by crafting leases directly with its tenants wpc is able to negotiate leases directly and this is a competitive advantage that allows the company to generate predictable rent growth fox said previous earnings call focusing on more complex sale leasebacks has several key advantages first we face limited competition there is a much smaller universe of buyers who can legitimately compete outside of the commodity segments of net lease we have a year track record of executing highly structured sale leaseback transactions which gives us a high degree of credibility in the marketplace for these type of deals second access with a leaseback the counterparty of the purchase becomes our longterm tenant as a result we get a highdegree of access to information about the tenant’s business and its longterm prospects as well as access to its senior management all of which ensure we get a thorough understanding of the risks and merits of each transaction we also get greater access to the real estate itself enabling us to better determine its value and quality and thoroughly evaluate its criticality to the longterm prospects of the tenant third superior lease structures because we are writing the lease we are able to tailor it to those specific circumstances as a result we believe that we are able to achieve stronger more institutional quality leases with longer lease terms better rent escalations improved financial covenants when warranted and greater downside protections he summarized the saleleaseback advantage saying because we source and structure complex sale leasebacks we believe we are able to generate a significant cap rate premium relative to both the commodity segment of the net lease market and assets that trade on the secondary market to be clear however greater initial deal complexity does not mean greater risk as mentioned above another unique feature of careys business model is its investment management business for many investors and analysts multiple business models create confusion and oftentimes that leads to underperformance in the organization one of the primary reasons for the confusion relates to conflicts of interest that can distract the goals and objectives creating blurred management responsibilities one reason that carey has been able to successfully operate its two lines of business is because of the companys long track record by raising equity through the nontraded reit channels the company has been able to build an impressive collection of assets and then merge them with the public business wp carey since  carey has aggregated hundreds of properties for the purpose of forming entities that would ultimately be sold or merged with wp carey heres a snapshot of careys investment management products the nontraded reit industry is adapting for the better with lower fees and backend loads rationalizing the cost consistent with improving governance at the fund level also blackstone nysebx launching its first nontraded reit validates the continued improvements in the nontraded sector note a noted in my disclosure i am now on the advisory board of ny residential reit see the sec filing here carey has generated asset management fees structuring fees and general partnership interests of  million in recent years accordingly the company has been able to spread costs over a larger asset base two of careys entities cpa  and cpa  own net lease buildings and it is likely that cpa  will liquidate in the near term more on that below the  billion portfolio cpa was established in  cpa  is smaller  billion aum and the property portfolio commenced raising equity just three years ago in  as i referenced in the past i believe its highly likely that cpa  will eventually merge with careys public reit as mentioned above on february   carey merged with cpa  in a deal valued at around  billion upon closing the combined company had an equity market capitalization of about  billion and a total enterprise value of approximately  billion at the time of the merger careys ffo jumped from  in  to  in  and the dividend grew from  per share to  per share  over  remember cpa  will look to monetize the portfolio and there will likely be other bidders however it is doubtful that a third party will have the inside knowledge of the portfolio and infrastructure to invest internationally that carey has most importantly i view this unique platform as an asset and catalyst going forward the balance sheet during the  first quarter wpc completed an underwritten public offering of € million denominated senior notes in january and amended and restated its senior unsecured credit facility in february extending the vast majority of debt maturities out to  and beyond as a result of this at quarter end on a prorata basis wpc’s overall weighted average interest rate was  with a weighted average debt maturity of  years versus  years at the end of the q wpc’s unsecured debt had a weighted average interest rate of  compared to  for the company’s outstanding mortgage debt over time as this mortgage debt comes due wpc will be able to replace it with lower cost upon financing at the end of q wpc’s net debt to enterprise value was  total consolidated debt to gross assets was  and net debt to adjusted ebitda was x as the company continues to grow the balance sheet through accretive acquisitions it expects leverage metrics to remain around similar levels while further enhancing the overall credit profile through the use of unsecured debt under the unencumbered strategy wpc is rated bbb o is bbb and nnn is bbb and i believe it’s likely that the company could get a credit upgrade to bbb in the next  months furthermore wpc’s balance sheet improvements also position the company for a potential rollup with cpa in  or  performance results for the  first quarter wpc generated affo per diluted share of  and raised the quarterly cash dividend to  per share maintaining a conservative payout ratio of  the first quarter dividend is equivalent to an annualized dividend rate of  per share as you can see below wpc has maintained a steady and predictable dividend growth strategy as noted above owned real estate generates about  of total affo for the quarter with the remaining  coming from the investment management business wpc’s total affo per diluted share was  lower as compared to the q due primarily to lower revenue from both the owned real estate and investment management segments partially offset by lower interest and ga expenses owned real estate revenue decreased due primarily to lower leased termination income which can fluctuate significantly from periodtoperiod the remaining decline was driven by lower leased revenues resulting from plant property dispositions during  at q wpc had seven leases expiring representing just  of total abr all of which has now been addressed primarily through new leases and lease extensions the company has  leases expiring in  representing just  of total abr twothirds of which has either been addressed or is in active negotiations wpc has affirmed the previous affo guidance range of  to  per diluted share here’s a snapshot of the ffo per share forecaster for wpc and the peer group as you can see wpc is expected to generate modest affo per share growth in  and  however these assumptions don’t include the big catalyst cpa here’s my revised forecast based on the cpa deal assuming to close in  as you can see based on affoshare growth and dividend safety i rank these reits in order of best to worst to buy right now realty income store capital stor wp carey and gramercy property gpt keep in mind wpc is the only reit that has a possible  billion portfolio and while there is no guaranty that cpa rolls up with wpc it’s highly likely and a key catalyst that makes this reit a top pick also wpc’s dividend yield is  almost  bps above the stalwarts o and nnn also wpc is trading well below o  nnn remember wpc has modest retail exposure the bottom line if there is a case for a strong buy in the net lease reit sector it would be wp carey the company has not relocated its hq to dallas the company has not acquired a portfolio of grocery stores that go belly up bankrupt within weeks of closing the company has not lowered guidance as a result of weak tenant shopko credit issues the company is not being run by rookie reit professionals the company does not have a toxic retail portfolio with lowerquality assets no wpc is the exact opposite of src and if there’s ever a net lease reit that deserves a strong buy recommendation it’s wp carey quite simply there’s nothing scary about wp carey disclosure i am on the advisory board of ny residential reit and i am also a shareholder
