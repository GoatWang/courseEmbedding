david e weekly written midhi i help run two separate syndicates on angellist dronevc focused on drone tech and neuronvc focused on applied deep learning many people are unfamiliar with how angellist syndicates work — what makes them similar and different to working with either individual angels an “angel group” or working with a traditional venture capital institution this guide hopes to clarify that for you if you’d like a basic primer in startup stocks and the like i’d recommend my free guide to stocks  options as a resourcedisclaimers galore i’m not a lawyer none of the below should be constituted as legal or tax advice for which you should seek the services of a licensed professional the below was written with us investors investing in usincorporated technology startups rules restrictions and considerations may vary considerably from the below advice for other geographies i don’t work for or represent angellist and may have materially misrepresented their program investing in startups is dangerous also don’t run with scissorsangels“angels” are what we call people who invest their own money the sec puts restrictions around what kind of investments people can make if they’re not rich yet — to keep say grandparents from getting tricked out of their retirement savings by a huckster — so most angels need to be rich by the sec’s bar if you meet this bar the sec will consider you an accredited investor these definitions haven’t changed in a while but when we talk angels we’re not talking institutions we’re talking individuals — humans with motivations and there are good and bad motivations to being an angelthe first thing an investor should ask themselves is what they’re hoping to get out of their investments if an angel is hoping to “get rich quick” “help steer an early stage company” or even “get a front row seat into a company’s operations” by angel investing they’re may well be disappointed with the process angels very rarely get special rights like a board seat or even observer rights angels that try to too aggressively interfere with a company’s operations get a bad name and for good reason — you’ll likely hurt more than you’ll helpgood angels often have a broad portfolio of companies and act as a passive “service provider” helping startups when they ask for it ron conway the “godfather” of silicon valley pioneered this approach meeting with huge numbers of companies making quick decisions about investment investing in a very large number of companies and generally not asking for controlobservation — there was just no way he’d have the time to sit on that many boards while some derided this as “spray  pray” and prefer to see investment as “smart money” where companies receive both capital and active advice ron’s returns speak for themselves ron can get access to pretty much any deal because ron has removed every reasonable objection you might have to taking his money the returns you’ll realize are going to map to whether you are able to get in on the best deals likely ones where lots of other investors are vying for entry to the deal as well if you establish a reputation for being helpful and easy to work with you make it easier to get in on any deal you wantnow lest i frame passive investors too passively ron would move mountains for a portfolio company that had a specific ask of him — even if you’d need to spend the first thirty seconds on a phone call reminding him that you were ceo of a company he invested in  i’ll disclaim that ron invested in my first company pbwiki and was a wonderful supporterthe portfolio approach is important from a returns perspective it can be very difficult to predict which companies will do really well and which will flounder a humble “black swan” style approach is for an investor to admit they’re probably going to get this wrong a lot and so to have a wide range of bets in the hope that one will be a breakout hit investor returns are typically on an extreme power law curve — if one company does really well it will do so well that it literally won’t matter what happened with any other company in your portfolio so a good angel investor will seek to build to a portfolio of eg  startups your probabilistic returns are much higher to make thirty k investments versus one k investment put another way if your only involvement in angel investment is writing one check you’re probably going to be disappointed with the outcome and conclude that angel investing isn’t for you pace yourself allocate a certain yearly budget for investment and seek to regularly make small betsanother good reason to be an angel investor is that you like meeting with founders who can teach you about new industries emerging best practices and clever approaches to problem solving and teambuilding founder energy is fun and infectious and can inspire youfinally it’s great to give back a lot of people in silicon valley maybe most of them made it big when others “took a bet” on them and thus they want to “pay it forward” by blessing newcomers with capital advice and networking this is one of the most powerful and poorly held secrets of silicon valley i attribute it to the area’s hippy history syndicatesangellist a privatelyheld company in sf offers a wide range of services to enable companies individuals and angels to connect startups can post jobs available angels can seek companies to invest in and companies can seek funding one of the features angellist has added in the past few years is the ability for an individual wellconnected angel to create a syndicate to allow other angels access to deals the lead is participating in on the same terms angel participants can “soft commit” to seriously consider funding companies alongside these influential angels this has interesting followon effects startups now have more motivation to meet with these “super angel” syndicate leads since they represent a collective of investors which means these syndicates get more and better deal flow than they would as an unorganized group of individual investors over time the size of such a syndicate may give an individual angel decisionmaking power equivalent to a traditional small venture capital firm with almost none of the typical investment overhead of a fund let’s walk through the mathif i wanted to be a syndicate lead i’d announce “i’m planning on investing  of my own money in – companies a year” i might find thirty friends who are each willing to tentatively commit to putting in  of their own money into such deals on the same terms as me now i’ve got k of my own money with k of other people’s money that i can offer for investment in a company this obviously makes it much more interesting for a company to meet with me versus if i could have only cut them a k check for those of you paying attention you’ll note that the k is only tentatively committed in reality only  of syndicate backers will actually close on a deal so with k in syndicate backing i can reasonably expect to offer k in funding to a companywhen the syndicate lead finds a specific deal that they’re excited about they agree on the terms of investment with the startup “leading” the deal or they join other investors who are investing in the company at the same time on the same terms “following” they indicate the deal to angellist which triggers some al folks reaching out to both the syndicate lead and startup to confirm terms and help the startup get their angellist page into proper shape to “launch” the deal once the deal has been approved for launch by angellist it’s up to the syndicate lead to publicizethe lead then writes up why they were interested in this particular company and shares those thoughts and data confidentially with syndicate participants participating angels in the syndicate can then review the deal and decide if they would like to optin to the deal an individual syndicate deal can only have up to  accredited investors participate if  or more investors want to join it will be up to the syndicate lead who they want to allow into the deal typically investors who choose to “prefund” their syndicate participation are first in line these investors have to actively optout of deals they’re followed by investors willing to invest larger amounts eg k vs k then everyone elsewith the deal launched angellist sets up an escrow into which syndicate participants can ach transfer or wire their funds and collects electronic signatures from the startup syndicate lead and syndicate participants angellist charges a fixed k for the deal to manage all of the backoffice so if in the above example there was a k syndicate raise k of that would get paid to angellist and k would be wired to the startup angellist creates a new delaware llc as a singlepurpose corporate vehicle to make and manage the investment the name of this llc is typically a jumbled combo of the name of the syndicate and the name of the startup being invested in in the case of dronevc’s investment in prenav for instance the entity created was called “angellistpravfund a series of angellistdrvcfunds llc” yeah that’s a mouthful to make things even more fun angellist actually outsources the management of these llcs to a company called assure fund managementfrom the startup’s perspective it’s pretty good since they only get two new shareholders on their cap table the syndicate lead who makes their investment directly as an individual and the llc so prenav got “david e weekly” as a shareholder as well as the above mouthful of an llc because there is meaningful ongoing backoffice work that needs to be done for every shareholder a company has minimizing cap table entries is a great time and money saver for startupsmost of the deals i see use pretty vanilla terms a series seed equity a safe note or otherwise templated convertible notes debt with a clear cap and discount i’ve heard a few stories of early stage investors being pretty badly abused with a safe note so i’m gently nudging people towards using series seed since it’s pretty easy for the startup and offers investors the safety of actual equitythe deal is only live for a fixed period of time typically  days this gives the lead enough time to discuss the deal with participants gives investors a chance to ask questions or come back from vacation and to wire their money in i’ll note that for most deals you’ll know within four days of launch about how well the deal will do here below are three real deals i closed with dronevc note that committed capital can dip week to week if a prefunded investor chooses to opt outsomething to be aware of angellist has syndicate amplification funds like maiden lane and csc upshot that can further financially amplify a syndicated deal with significant traction typically these funds will make a gonogo decision on investment in a few days they are looking for deals that have strong “signal” meaning several notable investors or firms are already participating in the deal beyond the syndicate so a deal led by a syndicate with only syndicate members participating is unlikely to be able to access these funds if the fund does decide to participate in a deal they’ll come in at the same terms through the syndicate vehicleif you’re a syndicate lead you’ll need to not only hype a company but also candidly disclose potential risks it’s really important to do this thoroughly if it can be shown that you knew about certain material risks to a startup’s success and didn’t disclose them to fellow investors you could end up in hot water finally you’ll need to disclose any variations — if the startup is actually run by your brother if you have been given advisory shares if you’re already a shareholder if you’re getting a different deal than syndicate participants etc needless to say it’s best if your deal has no variationscarryso far so good but you might ask what’s in it for the syndicate lead other than getting better deal exposure and getting to help their friends a syndicate lead isn’t paid a penny of the k that goes to angellist indeed the only movement regarding their bank account is the outbound money being invested in the startupthe payout to a syndicate lead happens when a company invested in by the syndicate has a liquidity event eg someone buys the company or the company goes public at this point the shares held by the llc get exchanged for cash the cash that investors put in is returned to them and money returned to the llc beyond funds invested is then called carry which is basically the profit off of the investment of the carry angellist takes  and typically syndicate leads take around  the total amount eg  is listed clearly on a syndicate’s page when investors sign up to the syndicate or a syndicated dealthanks for reading this guide to angellist syndicates let me know if it was useful to you andor what i got wrong at davidweeklyorg finally if you’re an accredited investor in interested
