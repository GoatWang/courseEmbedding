semiconductor device includes flipped top source lowside mosfet electrically connected to top surface of a die paddle first metal interconnection plate connecting between bottom drain of a highside mosfet or top source of a flipped highside mosfet to bottom drain of the lowside mosfet and second metal interconnection plate stacked on top of the highside mosfet chip the highside lowside mosfet and the ic controller can be packaged threedimensionally reducing the overall size of semiconductor devices and can maximize the chips size within a package of the same size and improves the performance of the semiconductor devices the top source of flipped lowside mosfet is connected to the top surface of the die paddle and thus is grounded through the exposed bottom surface of die paddle which simplifies the shape of exposed bottom surface of the die paddle and maximizes the area to facilitate heat dissipation inventors ho yuehse sunnyvale ca us yilmaz hamza saratoga ca us xue
