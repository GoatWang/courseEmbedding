to you edition us arabi australia brasil canada deutschland españa france greece india italia japan korea maghreb méxico québec south africa united kingdom united states close green   am et  updated jan   seaworld appeal of osha citations could impact famous orca shows ap  by carlyn kolker oct  reuters  a killer whale the lawyerson of a supreme court justice and the grisly death of wildlife trainer will play roles in a us appeals court case next month that could forever change marine park operator seaworlds marquee entertainment the signature attraction for the companys three us theme parks has been shows featuring the blackandwhite killer whales or orcas including several named shamu performing flips and other stunts under the direction of trainers who historically have been in close contact with them but that changed after the february  death of dawn brancheau a yearold trainer she drowned after being pulled into a pool by tilikum a pound bull orca at seaworlds site in orlando florida in august  the us occupational safety and health administration osha fined seaworld  for three safety violations saying it had exposed its trainers to a hazardous environment and violated a part of the occupational safety and health act known as the general duty clause osha a part of the labor department demanded seaworld make certain changes notably physically separating the killer whale trainers from the orcas during show performances seaworld is appealing the broad application of a federal safety law meant to protect workers in unusual circumstances the case will come before a threejudge panel of the us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit on nov  with animal rights activists watching eugene scalia son of supreme court justice antonin scalia will represent seaworld in its fight against a federal order that sharply criticized the marine park operators safety measures ken welsch an administrative law judge of the occupational safety and health review commission in  upheld the osha citations but downgraded one of them to serious from willful effectively reducing the fine to  from  in appealing welschs decision seaworld argued oshas fine was premised on an overly broad view and novel application of the general duty clause which mandates that employers keep their workplaces free from recognized hazards in a page opening appellate brief seaworld called the case fundamentally misguided the clause cannot be used to force a company to change the very product that it offers the public and the business it is in seaworld wrote the clause is no more an instrument for supervising the interactions between whales and humans at seaworld than it is a charter to prohibit blocking and tackling in the nfl or to post speed limits on the nascar circuit blackstone floated seaworld seaworld orlando is owned by seaworld entertainment  which was taken public in april by private equity firm blackstone group lp seaworld shares closed up  percent on monday at  each in mildly bullish trading seaworld has brought in a highpowered team from law firm gibson dunn  crutcher to press its appeal the team includes scalia formerly the labor departments top lawyer he is joined by baruch fellner also a former labor department lawyer who founded gibson dunns osha practice the general duty clause is oshas catchall clause that it wields against companies in situations where there is not necessarily a dominant clearly articulated safety standard said melissa bailey an attorney at ogletree deakins nash smoak  stewart who represents employers in osha cases the cases can be difficult to pursue because osha must show what is a recognized hazard when there are not clear industry standards she said in cases like the seaworld case thats a unique animal  no pun intended said bailey orcas and people the penalties osha can bring are relatively small but a key issue is at stake for seaworld  whether its performances can include killer whales and humans in close contact osha penalties are not that great said bailey comparing them to fines that other agencies can levy but its rarely the fine that drives the litigation its often the abatement cost and having this on your record seaworld trainers have not been in the water with an orca since the drowning said seaworld spokesman fred jacobs seaworlds primary concern in the litigation is the longterm effect that oshas requirement of separation of humans and killer whales could have on the shows in court papers seaworld called their interaction integral to its mission we want to continue to display these animals in a way that assures their health and wellbeing and is safe for our zoological staff jacobs said in an email he declined to comment further citing the pending litigation humanorca interaction has long been filled with controversy revisited earlier this year with the release of the movie blackfish about brancheaus death and tilikums year career as an entertainer and stud for other captive whales seaworld has criticized the film as inaccurate and misleading the labor department says seaworld knew that close humanorca contact was dangerous  tilikum has been involved in other human deaths  and it routinely took steps to minimize hazards the secretary of labor did not overreach in applying the general duty clause to seaworld in this case because the clause is meant to address unusual hazards for which there are no promulgated standards just like the hazard present here the labor department wrote in a brief two animalrights groups  people for the ethical treatment of animals and the animal legal defense fund  have weighed in with an amicus brief to support the labor department the groups strong critics of seaworld in the past wrote in the brief that prolonged captivity has forced the orcas to behave aggressively the case is seaworld of florida v thomas e perez no  us court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit for us department of labor m
