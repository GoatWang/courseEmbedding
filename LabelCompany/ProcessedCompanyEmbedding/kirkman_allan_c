kirkman family contact us ← older posts beware of botanicals posted on july   by david humphrey by david humphrey president kirkman group inc   the growing popularity of botanicals has prompted nutritional supplement manufacturers like kirkman to expand their use of herbal ingredients and botanical products offerings we did not expect however to encounter the difficulty we’ve had in finding “clean” herbals in fact many of the herbal samples sent to us by both suppliers in the us and foreign countries have contained multiple contaminants at potentially harmful levels obviously we don’t accept these for use in our products what causes additional concern is regulatory oversight of botanicals that currently does not prohibit certain environmental contaminants that can be harmful to human health  at least there are some guidelines to test for  heavy metals arsenic cadmium mercury and lead and certain microbial contaminants in nutritional supplements for humans there are no government requirements however for testing nutritional supplements for pets botanicals and herbals are more prone to being contaminated than other types of supplement ingredients because they are grown in the ground and nurtured by air and water where environmental contaminants exist china for example is among the most polluted countries on the planet yet many if not most of the herbs offered in the us marketplace are grown in china  high levels of lead and arsenic are routinely found in herbal products coming from china in  the attorney general of new york pulled herbals off the shelves of retail giants target walmart walgreen’s and gnc because four out of five herbal products did not contain any of the ingredients that were on the products’ labels  having extra unidentified ingredients or not having the ingredients claimed on the label are problems becoming more and more commonplace with botanicalherbal supplement products  so beware of botanicals make sure you are buying product from reputable vendors that can provide you evidence that their products are safe and pure  kirkman® has the most comprehensive program of testing for environmental contaminants in the industry so we can thoroughly screen raw materials that we use in our products kirkman® tests its products for  heavy metals bacteria yeast mold bacteria such as salmonella and enterococcus and common allergens such as egg gluten casein milk and nuts kirkman® strictly follows its ultra tested® protocol to test for more than  environmental contaminants and to ensure that what is on our label is in our product   posted in allergies  allergens environmental health  toxicity ultra tested  leave a comment  tips for establishing a healthy nutritional profile posted on july   by kulani mahikoa by kulani mahikoa executive vice presidentkirkman group inc   if you are a typical kirkman® customer with special dietary requirements and sensitivities you may be more prone to nutritional deficiencies than other folks    food allergies for example may keep you from eating the full range of foods that provide the nutrition that your body may need chronic health issues may affect your body’s ability to absorb nutrients properly causing deficiencies taste and texture issues common among special needs children may eliminate whole food groups and important nutrients from the diet   nutritional deficiencies can lead to a variety of health problems on the other hand nutritional sufficiency can help ward off health issues  for special needs individuals who can’t eat certain nutrient rich foods nutritional supplements are a good alternative to provide the nutrients that may be lacking     here are our top five recommendations to help you determine the daily nutritional regimen that’s right for you     start with your physician ask your physician to order a “nutritional status” test  this is a laboratory test that provides specific information about your body’s  condition with respect to your diet  level of nutrients  ability to maintain normal metabolic integrity based on those levels   the test provides a roadmap for you and your physician regarding a diet or nutritional supplement plan your physician can also recommend other healthcare professionals who may be helpful such as a nutritionist or dietitian     know your target nutritional goals the food and drug administration fda and the institute of medicine iom have set recommended daily values dvs and daily recommended intakes dris for the amounts of nutrients you need to keep healthy and stay well nourished  the iom also recommends the tolerable upper intake level ul of a nutrient by age group which is the amount of the nutrient that can generally be taken safely  for example with many vitamins and minerals you can safely take a dose much higher than the dv or rdi without coming close to the ul  your physician’s advice and following dv dri and ul charts can help you determine what nutrients to take and in what amounts     know what each nutrient does read up on nutrients  there are many free sources of information about nutrients on the web  an especially good source is the linus pauling institute a center devoted to research regarding the role that vitamins and micronutrients may have in enhancing health look up and know what each nutrient and supplement does and its risks and benefits       read labels information on both food and nutritional supplement labels usually contain five common elements  statement of identity the products net weight the manufacturer’s address nutrition food or supplement facts and an ingredient list  the type of nutrients the product contains and amounts are found in the nutrition or supplement facts boxes  since the fda regulates the food and supplement industries the dvs are the recommended daily values listed   the update of the  food allergen labeling and consumer protection act which took effect on january   also mandates that food and nutritional supplements containing certain allergens such as milk eggs fish shellfish peanuts tree nuts wheat and soy be declared on a label  for special needs individuals with food allergies reading these statements may be of critical importance     buy pesticide free food and nutritional supplements exposures to pesticides can cause a myriad of health problems for special needs individuals who may be particularly sensitive to environmental contaminants consuming pesticides is like adding bricks to an already full wagon    currently the regulations for the use of pesticides pertain primarily to a list of banned pesticides issued by the environmental protection agency there are no regulations regarding detecting or measuring pesticides in food and supplements even though the us uses more than  billion pounds  of the world’s pesticide usage of pesticides each year  many food and nutritional supplement companies test for pesticides in their products but kirkman® offers the most comprehensive testing for pesticides and other harmful chemicals in the marketplace kirkman® tests every product in its brand for more than  environmental contaminants including hundreds of pesticides

program for probiotics posted on july   by kulani mahikoa we’ve had unusual weather lately  at times it appeared as if winter would never end  with our changing weather pattern – a surprise snow

your product further kirkman® only ships probiotics monday through wednesday to avoid weekend delays  orders for probiotics that we receive on thursday or friday are held for shipment until monday unless you order next day shipping posted in faqs probiotics  leave a comment mthf – why it’s taking the place of folic acid in some of kirkman’s products posted on july   by kulani mahikoa  kirkman® has been adding mthf methyltetrahydrofolate as the vitamin b alternative to folic acid in its products the latest addition is in our popular children’s multivitamin and mineral formula children’s multivitaminmineral wmthf hypoallergenic   research indicates that mthf may work better for some individuals than folic acid  according to the national institute of health more than  of americans have a genetic mutation which affects their ability to absorb and properly utilize folic acid   folic acid is one of the few nutritional supplements that physicians condone it is routinely prescribed particularly to patients who are pregnant elderly or have certain mental issues in fact folic acid a synthetic compound has become so ingrained in the medical landscape that doctors may not be familiar with its natural alternative mthf and its benefits mthf has recently become commercially available for use in nutritional supplements and foods  mthf can enter the main folate metabolic cycle directly while folic acid must be cleaved from protein carriers to be absorbed this process is inefficient in some individuals if absorbed folic acid still must go through several other conversions in the body to become active and assume it’s important role in methylation the transfer of methyl groups one carbon bound to three hydrogen atoms that is essential for health individuals can submit to a simple laboratory test to find out if they have the mthr gene mutation that could affect their ability to absorb folic acid  however even individuals with impaired ability to utilize regular folic acid can readily benefit from mthf     kirkman’s products that contain mthf include   children’s multivitaminmineral with mthf – hypoallergenic   mthf smethyltetrahydrofolate  mg    mthf

practitioner   this is a great segue to get your family away from the high sugar processed ingredients in regular cookies to a more paleo nutrient dense cookie these cookies helped me to get off sugar as i was eliminating it from my diet i found that when i made them they disappeared very quickly my sons and husband think these are really good i was shocked  not only does it cut down the flour gluten and sugar but they are also very filling you’ll only want a few to make extra special cookies you may want to make your own almond floursee the instructions below  ingredients make with gluten free varieties of ingredients  cups almond meal or almond flour cup butter  organic grass feed is best tablespoons  raw honey or  tbs pure maple syrup teaspoon sea salt teaspoon baking soda teaspoons vanilla extract  cup dark chocolate chips directions preheat oven to °f in a medium bowl whisk together the almond meal salt and baking soda then add the butter honey or maple syrup and vanilla extract you can drop the vanilla if you used the maple syrup and mix well add chocolate chips and mix use spoon or small ice cream scooper to form cookies and drop onto cookie sheet  bake at °f for  minutes or when the base of cookie is browned how to make your own almond flour you’ll want a big bag of almonds so you can use it for this recipe and save some to use later i usually buy the big bags at my local box store first soak the almonds in water overnight  remove the brown outer skin next put the almonds in a dehydrator for about a day or until they feel like nuts again put nuts in a food processor and process until you have a flourlike consistency voila’    you have almond flour posted in gluten free  casein free recipe  leave a comment don’t overlook these  great supplements posted

vitamins minerals and nutrition  leave a comment a vitamin primer — important things you should know about vitamins posted on june   by kulani mahikoa by kulani mahikoa executive vice president marketing kirkman group inc   the first thing to know is that vitamins along with minerals and amino acids are considered “essential” nutrients that is – you need them  so whether you get your vitamins from food or from supplement manufacturers like kirkman® knowing about these nutrients that make your body run is a good idea   what are vitamins vitamins are important contributors to normal metabolism or the chemical processes that must occur in your body to maintain life scientists have said that to be considered a “vitamin” the nutrient must be organic that is it contains one carbon atom in its molecular structure only two vitamins can be produced by the body  these are vitamin d produced by the intake of sun on the skin and vitamin k made in small amounts by friendly bacteria in the gut most of our vitamins come from plants and even vitamins from animal products such as eggs come from plants that were ingested by an animal or created by bacteria vitamins are also associated with specific health conditions caused by a deficit of a vitamin nutrient vitamins are either fatsoluble or watersoluble fat soluble vitamins are absorbed through the intestinal tract and are stored in the fatty tissues of the body and the liver they can stay in the body as reserves for days some of them for months  water soluble vitamins do not get stored in the body for long and are excreted in urine they need to be continually replenished  how many vitamins are there what do they do what are sources  there are currently  recognized vitamins  below is a list of vitamins and some of their key characteristics    vitamin a  retinol retinal – promotes eye health sources  liver cod liver oil carrots broccoli sweet potato kale spinach pumpkin egg apricot cantaloupe and melon    vitamin b

k  phylloquinone menaquinone – supports proper blood clotting bone metabolism and the regulation of calcium levels sources  leafy vegetables like kale and swiss chard parsley kiwi fruit and avocado   how much do you need of each vitamin here’s where your work gets complicated a good practice is to enlist the help of your physician registered dietitian or nutritionist for guidance when deciding what nutrients you need and in what amounts to support your good health  there are also four official sources of information on the average requirements of vitamins and minerals for good nutrition these are rda recommended daily allowance tables  prepared by the national academy of sciences rdas have historically been used as the basis of data for vitamins and minerals rdas are recommendations for average safe and adequate amounts of daily nutrient intake by  per cent to  percent of healthy men women boys and girls in different age groups specific recommendations are also given for infants children teenagers pregnant and breastfeeding women and adults through age fifty and adults over age fifty dri dietary reference intakes tables  prepared by the national academy of sciences food and nutrition board of the institute of medicine for both americans and canadians dri tables updates the rdas for vitamins minerals and includes many other nutrients the dri tables should eventually replace the rda tables because they are more comprehensive new in the dris was the establishment of the tolerable upper intake levels ul for each nutrient as a guide to help decrease negative side effects that can develop from excessive intake of nutrients dv daily value tables   prepared by the us food and drug administration fda for product labeling purposes foreign and international standards  prepared by member nations of the united nations food and agriculture organization fao and the world health organization who the tables offer comparison standards between the us who and canada for vitamins and minerals you can find these tables under resources on kirkman’s website   food vs supplements for vitamins in  a study published in the journal of the american medical association showed that the majority of american adults used dietary supplements the council for responsible nutrition crn that has tracked the use of dietary supplements in the us for more than  years reported in  that  of us adults or more than  million americans reported taking dietary supplements the popularity of dietary supplements as a source of vitamins minerals and other nutrients reflects the public’s opinion that they can’t get enough of the nutrients they need from food there is worldwide concern that our modern farming and food processing practices are adulterating and robbing the nutrients in our food supply additionally busier lifestyles take many individuals in the direction of fastfood restaurants with their convenient staples of foods that are calorierich and nutrition poor let’s not lose sight of the important issue which is getting the nutrients you need dietary supplements provide a convenient and safe alternative to food to get those needs met posted
