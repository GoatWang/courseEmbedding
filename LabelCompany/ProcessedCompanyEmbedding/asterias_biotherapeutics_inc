clinical trial in motor complete cervical spinal cord injury sci the amendment expands the eligibility criteria to include patients with a c spinal cord injury and extends the dosing window from  to  days to  to  days postinjury the fdas decision to allow asterias to enroll qualified patients with c level injuries is the result of the data supporting the safety of both astopc and the procedure to inject the cells and means that the second most common cervical spinal cord injury population can now be eligible to receive astopc the overall changes to the study protocol will enhance the ability to enroll qualified patient candidates for current scistar study and also expect the changes to help enrollment rates in a future larger clinical study the protocol amendment will expand patient eligibility and enable study investigators to administer astopc to patients with injuries at one vertebral level higher than the trials previous c limitation to the fourth cervical vertebra down known as c near the middle of the neck a c cervical level injury the second most common level of sci in the scistar studys targeted patient population generally means that the injured person is paralyzed

in developing and commercializing therapies in the fields of cell therapy and regenerative medicine the company has over two technology platforms the first is an immunotherapy platform to teach cancer patients immune systems to attack their tumors the second is pluripotent stem cell platform pluripotent cells are a type of stem cell capable of becoming all of the cell types in the human body the company is focused on developing therapies to treat conditions with medical needs and inadequate available therapies with an initial focus on the therapeutic areas of oncology and neurology from its immunotherapy platform the company is developing over two programs astvac telomerase loaded autologous dendritic cells which allows patients own cells to recognize and fight cancer cells in acute myelogenous leukemia aml together with its collaboration partner cancer research united kingdom cruk it is developing astvac telomerase loaded allogeneic dendritic cells derived from pluripotent stem cells which could provide off the shelf cells that teaches a patients immune system to recognize and fight cancer cells in nonsmall cell lung cancer from its pluripotent stem cell platform it is developing astopc oligodendrocyte progenitor cells in an initial clinical indication of spinal cord injury with potential for later expansion into other neurodegenerative diseases such as stroke and multiple sclerosisastvac autologous telomeraseloaded dendritic cellsastvac is an autologous product candidate or a product that is derived from cells that come from the treated patient astvac consists of mature antigenpresenting dendritic cells pulsed with ribonucleic acid rna for the protein component of human telomerase htert and a portion of a lysosomal targeting signal lamp lamp directs the telomerase rna to the lysosome the subcellular organelle that directs the rna to a particular part of the cell membrane astvac is injected into the patients skin with the objective of the dendritic cells to travel to the lymph nodes and instruct cytotoxic tcells to kill tumor cells that express telomerase on their surface the company has completed phase ii clinical trial of astvacastvac hes cellderived allogeneic dendritic cellsastvac is an allogeneic or nonpatient specific cancer vaccine candidate designed to stimulate patient immune responses to telomerase astvac is produced from human embryonic stem hes cells and can be modified with any antigen the use of hes as opposed to collecting and using the patients own blood as the starting material for astvac provides a scalable system for the production of various vaccine doses in a single lot astvac may be synergistic with immune checkpoint inhibitors in development for many cancer indications astvac program are progressed towards a phase iiia clinical trial in nonsmall cell lung cancer in collaboration with cancer research uk crukastopc glial progenitor cellsthe companys astopc product candidate consists of oligodendrocyte progenitor cells which are cells that become oligodendrocytes after injection derived from a current good manufacturing practice cgmp master cell bank of undifferentiated hes cells that has been fully qualified for human use the cells which are stored frozen until ready for use are produced under cgmp conditions and screened for adventitious agents astopc cells reproduce the natural functions of oligodendrocytes in animal models including producing myelin that wraps around nerve fibers producing neurotrophic factors which offer neuroregeneration and sprouting of new nerve endings and inducing new blood vessels which provide nutrients and remove waste matter from neural tissue as it functions in the body the company has completed phase i trial of astopc in thoracic spinal cord injury sci »
