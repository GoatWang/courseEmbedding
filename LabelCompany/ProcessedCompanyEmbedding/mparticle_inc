economy is growing rapidly with app annie predicting a year compound annual growth rate of  to the point of representing more than  billion in consumer spend by  a major factor contributing to this growth is consumer’s insatiable demand for speed and convenience in their “mobile moments” keeping up with this demand is not easy however especially given the current dearth of mobile engineering product and marketing talent on the market fortunately there’s a burgeoning supply of softwareasaservice saas solutions that provide app creators with turnkey access to many of the core components needed to build and maintain highquality mobile experiences the periodic table of app data serviceson average it’s estimated that apps have  sdks which stands for software development kits also known as “thirdparty libraries” these sdks can serve a variety of purposes there are sdks for payment processing such as cardio paypal braintree stripe venmo and sdks for user login and authentication such as agilebits google signin password roughly half of the sdks in apps are marketing and customer experience related addressing needs such as analytics attribution ab testing and user engagement

planning”  dr gramme edwards planning app data collection is critical for understanding user behavior and tracking against your business objectives so that you can make informed decisions and while the output of a planning process  such as a data collection plan  is very important often the planning process in and of itself is a crucial exercise for getting clear on your business objectives and testing some basic assumptions about what you want to achieve with your app proper planning is a key best practice for app owners regardless of what platforms you use and is really a business exercise not a technology exercise for some more thoughts from us on how to properly plan for mobile app data collection see the planning best practices article  setup your workspace in mparticle select your app in the top left corner and click the workspace gear to create a new workspace you can then define the inputs that your workspace supports  ios android tvos web etc in order to obtain your mparticle key and secret to be used in your app with the mparticle sdk  instrument your app using the mparticle sdk mparticle customers have a wide range of data collection requirements and all are supported via our sdk on the easy  basic end of the scale you can start with a few lines of code which gives you app lifecycle events such as installs  upgrades session starts  ends backgroundforeground app starts  stops crash reports and network performance if you have a data rich app and want to fully instrument on the more advanced end of the scale you can use our flexible sdk to fully instrument all your custom events navigation events push events and literally anything else that goes on in your app and for which data collection is important to your business regardless of how basic or advanced your needs it is still important to go through some degree of planning as we describe in step  above your goal should be to make the app developer’s instrumentation job as mechanical as possible so when it comes time to instrument your app key considerations such as which events should be instrumented and what their naming conventions should have already been worked out your developer will thank you mparticle provides a handy tool called the live stream that helps you validate that your app is properly instrumented and sending data to mparticle correctly the live stream is a real time event viewer that displays data as it’s arriving into the mparticle platform and as it’s being forwarded out of the platform if you are forwarding to an output event service in the live stream you can click into a message to inspect its contents filter for inbound andor outbound messages and perform additional message filtering  inspection tasks  service setup if you want to forward data to an output event service we recommend that you review the documentation for each service within this documentation set before you actually instrument your app since the services you select may influence your instrumentation strategy but for many of them you can simply enter your api key enable the service and you’re off to the races again depending upon how you want to use a service it may influence your instrumentation strategy if you are to get the most out of the service we recommend that you incorporate your service requirements into your planning and instrumentation steps once you’re ready to begin forwarding to a service you can simply navigate to the mparticle setup  outputs select the service from the directory configure the required settings connect your input workspace to the service and enable no coding or additional sdks needed each service supported by mparticle has its own topic in the knowledge base if you don’t see one that you are interested in or have questions about a service that we currently support but don’t see the answer in our knowledge base please drop us a line at supportmparticlecom we are continually adding new services and every one that we add is based upon customer requests for more on service configuration options including how to sample andor filter data that gets forwarded click connections to connect your input workspace to the output configuration  submit your app to the app store submit your app to the respective app store and let’s get to business  extra credit of course the mparticle platform offers additional powerful features that we haven’t touched upon here in this brief getting started section depending upon your needs here are some additional important capabilities audiences  create user audiences from literally any mobile data and instantiate those audiences in key partners such as facebook as custom audiences media partners push notification partners email marketing partners and others create your audiences once and engage with your users everywhere activity reports  allows you to view metrics around your event data including active users installs sessions and more account management  setup and manage users manage your subscription plan and manage your billing data replay  send historical data to almost any endpoint planning best practices it is critical to spend time up front planning out your data capture strategy this gets to the very core of what it is that you are trying to accomplish with your app how well you have aligned your data capture to your business objectives will make all the difference when it comes to being successful we recommend the following basic planning steps get clear on your business objectives identify your key events name your events and attributes determine your approach for managing user identification account for privacy  get clear on your business objectives first things first let’s start with your business it is important to establish clearly what your business objectives are along with the corresponding critical metrics this seems obvious but it is a due diligence step that sometimes gets taken for granted what are you really trying to accomplish with your app and what are the key metrics that tell you if you are being successful what do you want to do with your data do you need to forward your data to integrations such as analytics firms push notification providers or others if so what data do you need to forward to them in order to fully enable the desired integration do you need to segment your users if so based upon what do you need to do some form of funnel analysis think about your business holistically on an endtoend basis  identify your key events what are the events that are critical to your business oftentimes it helps to classify events by major type and when you instrument your apps you will need to pass an event type along with the event name and attributes for example depending upon your business model some of the event types and their respective events below will certainly apply to you while others may not event type description sample events transaction any events which are part of a transaction workflow starting with item selection purchase subscribe upgrade addtocart bid search any event where users input criteria to find contentanswers search comparison search voice search tag scan navigation  content view events which indicate a user click stream or content consumption page view listen music video view category view menu selection tab selection back button social any action where users share content with others note that sharing is not limited to social media post rate tweet share attach email user preference any event which creates personalization for the user this includes registration savinglabeling content items creating profiles setting application functions permissions important this should not be confused with ‘interests’ – while personalization can reveal preference preferences or interests can also be reflected via search purchases navigation etc favorite rate bookmark tag register grant permission profile setting connect friends location events which indicate where a user is located or interacting physically check in geo fence navigate gps user content events where users create content of any sort create task compose upload capture record scan save start with your critical events although you can certainly instrument every single thing that happens in your app you should focus on those things that really have business relevance once you’ve identified your critical events establish your funnels a funnel is simply a series of steps for our purposes identified as events that a user will take prior to accomplishing a critical business event in your app this becomes important later on for understanding user behavior accomplishing funnel analytics and ultimately making datadriven decisions when it comes to app design and user workflow depending upon the scope of your app you may have one to many funnels that you will need to instrument explicitly documenting your funnels is also a good additional quality check to make sure that users have a straightforward path to conversion and that you haven’t forgotten any key event steps along the way  name your events and attributes the data ingested into mparticle is generally decomposed into events and attributes events are the name for an action performed by a user such as purchase subscribe upgrade addtocart or share attributes are namevalue pairs that represent the event details for example an event could be addtocart and the attributes could be sku colorblue price this corresponds to the user adding an item to the shopping cart that has a stock keeping unit sku of  a color of blue and a price of  it is worth noting a couple best practices when it comes to event and event attribute naming keep all event and attribute names concise and human readable this makes your instrumented code much easier to review makes your reporting much easier to read and in general constitutes a much more sustainable business practice keep your event names general attributes are where the details of the event go some of the integrations have restrictions on the number of events andor attributes that can be forwarded that you may need to be aware of in naming your events and attributes refer to the individual integration sections for details adjust amazon mobile analytics amplitude appboy appsflyer apteligent facebook flurry google adwords google analytics google doubleclick intercom kochava leanplum mixpanel nanigans oracle bluekai sfdc email sfdc mobilepush tapcommerce tune webtrends the mparticle sdk imposes a length restriction of no more than  characters on the following sdk fields event name event attribute key event attribute value user attribute key user identity value attribute restrictions the maximum length of a user attribute value is  characters  event attributes keyvalue pairs  user attributes keyvalue pairs  entries can be included in a user attribute list the maximum length of a single entry in a user attribute list is  characters  determine your approach for managing user identification it is important to identify the possible ways that a user will come to your app and your web site how you will identify the user and how your app developer will implement the mparticle sdk to ensure maximum alignment between events and identified users explicitly planning for this is important because not considering all user paths can lead to a larger amount of event data that is not linked to a specific user id  account for privacy depending upon your app functionality and data capture several privacy considerations can come into play when planning your implementation at a minimum you should consider the following is your customer privacy policy up to date where is it located  how can it be accessed by customers will personally identifiable information pii be captured capturing pii invokes a host of considerations when it comes to consumer privacy are you in compliance with the children’s online privacy protection act coppa if you are collecting information from users under the age of thirteen you must comply with the ftc coppa what are your data retention requirements exactly what data should be retained for exactly how long planning artifacts we’ve seen a wide range of planning artifacts that mparticle customers use as an output of their planning process often the best tool is the simplest such as an excel or google docs spreadsheet that identifies data collection elements and maps to their explicit naming conventions that should be used by the app developer when instrumenting the app if you need help getting started here we’re always happy to assist  drop us a line at supportmparticlecom glossary the mparticle glossary provides

incoming event data and the data that is forwarded to enabled output event services this is where you can verify how much data mparticle captured per event and how much data was sent downstream  if multiple accounts are enabled for an integration the data sent to each account will be shown separately we recommend checking this report if you notice any discrepancies in your vendor dashboards there are several filters which can be used to generate the event forwarding report which are date range  you can specific a single day to look at system alerts environment  you can select to include either production or development data input  you can select which input you want to view the data for once you’ve specified your filter values the report displays a daily summary of events it provides counts for each message type and event name along with the inbound and outbound counts for each enabled service by default a summary of data is shown you can also select a specific hour to display hourly data you can navigate across different days by selecting the left and right arrow buttons on the dayhour setting you may notice deltas between an inbound data count and an outbound data count there are a few reasons these deltas can occur below are a few things to review that can cause deltas did you enabledisable the service on the date in question are you using data filters is the message type not supported by the integration have you chosen configuration settings that exclude certain message types user insights once your firstparty app data is available in mparticle we enrich

pick up to five custom events that you deem important such as inapp purchases social shares account creation etc each row in the report is a segment and it shows how many app users this segment reaches as well as lift percentage on various kpi metrics the top  are shown in green and the bottom  are shown in red building audiences with rd party data mparticle allows you to combine your app data with rd party data in your audience definitions refer to the audiences section for general information for building audiences the steps for adding a rd party segment to your audience definition are select rd party data as the type select the data provider ie datalogix navigate through the rd party data provider data hierarchy to select the rd party segment to include in your audience definition audiences when clicking audiences from the left navigation a listing of your audiences is shown separated by single workspace and multi workspace the following metrics are displayed about each audience size adds drops volatility connected outputs created by last updated status actions audiences overview the mparticle audience manager allows you to define audiences and connect them to integrations for the purpose of engaging with your users this can be very powerful when it comes to user engagement and monetization scenarios we will illustrate several basic audience manager scenarios and then delve into the details first example scenario drive user engagement let’s say you want to engage with users that have recently installed your app but are only lightly engaged users your objective is to drive higher engagement and convert those new users to high lifetime value users you want to accomplish this across several different messaging mediums in this example push notification and email therefore your audience qualification criteria is that the user has installed your app in the last  hours and has less than three sessions with audience manager you can easily and visually define this audience and then configure audience integrations to push notification and email end points  in this example let’s use kahuna for push and mailchimp for email once you configure the respective integrations in the audience manager mparticle instantiates a corresponding audience in kahuna and updates the corresponding email marketing list in mailchimp no coding is necessary second example scenario drive app downloads as the second scenario let’s use an app install objective you want to find more users like your currently highly engaged users and run an app download campaign in facebook against that target audience you start by defining your highly engaged users using whatever criteria is important to you you may define this from lifetime value metrics session activity event activity or literally any other data points ingested into the platform once your audience is defined in audience manager you configure the facebook integration and corresponding custom audiences are defined in your facebook account from there you can leverage those custom audiences like any other custom audience in facebook in this example because we want to target users that look like our highly engaged users we will create a facebook lookalike audience from our highly engaged user audience and run a facebook app install campaign that targets that lookalike audience later on in this article we will provide a more detailed facebook example the two basic scenarios above are simply several among many audience manager possibilities leveraged by mparticle clients if you have a specific scenario in mind give us a shout at supportmparticlecom and we’d be happy to provide some tips effectively leveraging the capabilities of audience manager entails the following basic steps capture data define use case create audience specify audience criteria connect service each of these is described in detail in the following sections capture data audience manager is the most flexible audience builder tool on the market today  it allows you to define your criteria and build audiences from literally any of your data ingested into the platform data is ingested into the platform from the following sources mobile apps feeds server to server when you fully instrument your app using the mparticle sdk you are sending data from your mobile apps to the mparticle platform mparticle also has the ability to enrich that data stream with third party data sources in addition to clients’ own data for example in addition to sending your mobile app data you may want to send in data that is not collected in the app and have the mparticle platform match the data based upon a user identifier and then leverage the capabilities of audience builder to create audiences based upon this superset of data examples of data sent server side might include crm data purchase  revenue data from other nonmobile channels and so on making sure all data is captured is important for audience creation as that is the first step if you need to enable server to server data ingestion please contact us at supportmparticlecom define use case the second step in using audience manager is fleshing out your segmentation and engagement strategies what user audiences are important and why how will you engage andor monetize each user audience how will you evaluate the effectiveness of this strategy and what audience definition and engagement strategies do you anticipate will need to be adjusted with your learnings this really constitutes the planning activity that will drive your implementation of audience manager it is important to validate your use cases against your data capture to ensure that you are actually capturing the data needed for your use case create audience when you first create an audience you must specify if it will be a single workspace or multi workspace audience a single workspace audience includes data from a single workspace however a multi workspace audience allows you to combine data across your workspaces into a single audience definition in addition you can also include any added feeds to your audience definitions the example audience for this section will be a new users low engagement audience using the single workspace mp traveler across all supported platforms the criteria will be all users who have installed the app in the last  hours and have less than  session with the same time period and the audience will be connected to send to facebook below are the steps to create an audience click audiences from the left navigation click new audience enter the audience name and optionally an external audience name the external name can be displayed in place of the name to ensure data confidentiality we will auto fill the external name unless you specify a value select the configurations to include by checking the platforms and feeds for which data can be used in this audience definition click create specify audience criteria the scope of data that is evaluated by your audience criteria is dependent upon the configurations you have selected the amount of data the mparticle platform has available for the configurations audience manager will incorporate all input data ingested from your app limited by the data storage limit of your current subscription plan now that you have created an audience it’s time to add to the audience definition follow these steps to add criteria to your audience definition click add criteria select the type of data to be used in the audience definition if you have selected both platforms and feeds you will need to specify which one to use in the audience criteria specify additional qualifying parameters ie attribute value recency frequency platform version build version etc click done optionally add multiple criteria to the audience by adding andorexclusive criteria to the definition and click done once you have completed the definition of your audience you can either elect to save or activate the audience save  saves your audience definition but does not activate the audience for population activate  activates the audience and it will start populating with users and be available for connecting to end points in this example we will go ahead and activate the audience by clicking activate below is as screen shot showing the new users low engagement audience definition on audience criteria the possibilities for audience definition within mparticle are endless  at the end of this article we explain more about the way data is organized in audience manager and the different criteria filtering capabilities that you can utilize for exceptionally flexible and granular audience creation connect audience to output audience service the next step is to connect the audience to the services where you want to ship your audience to a listing and overview of currently supported audience integrations is located here for this example we will forward the new user low engagement audience to facebook follow these steps to add the audience integration within the directory select the facebook tile and click add facebook to setup check the output audience integration type and click add to setup on the setup screen facebook will be added to the output audience configuration section select the facebook configuration and click configure to display the audience configuration form enter a configuration name and the specific facebook audience settings click save now that you have configured the facebook audience configuration follow these steps to connect the audience to the facebook output audience service select the audience you want to connect in this example we will select the new users low engagement audience under single workspace click connect click connect output to display a list of configured output audience services select the facebook service select the configuration name of the output facebook configuration specify the facebook specific connection settings for this facebook example you can specify the user matching criteria emails facebook ids idfas andor google advertising ids a facebook custom audience will be created for each matching criteria that you specify in the example we will leave the defaults click add connection for the facebook service specifically once you complete your connection you will see audiences in your facebook ad manager account as custom audiences within a couple of seconds once your audiences are created and configured they will be listed in tabular form in audience manager with stats about each audience size adds drops volatility connected outputs created by last updated status actions bulk audience connections if you have defined a large number of audience that you want to send to an audience configuration you can establish the connections for many audiences at once rather than doing them one at a time navigate to setup  outputs and select audience configurations select connect audiences to the right of the audience configuration you want to connect audiences to select the audiences you want to connect and click next choose your settings the same settings will apply to all audiences click connect you will see a status message showing all successful audience connections if any audiences cannot be connected error details will be shown selecting data criteria audience manager organizes data into major categories in order to make it easier for you to find and select your criteria every time you add a new criteria you begin by choosing one of the following major data categories events ecommerce users crashes installs uninstalls sessions upgrades attribution screen views rd party data depending on the category selected you can also specify attributes in your audience definition you can search for attribute values by entering a search term into the text box if there is a match at most  results will be shown and you can further refine the list of attribute values by adding additional characters to the search term recency  frequency along with app  build versions can also be included in the audience definition event data event data represents the “heavy lifting” of app instrumentation all custom events that you have logged will be available here when you select your event data criteria you can simply include the event name or you can keep filtering the criteria down to attribute name and values recency and frequency and event app version and app build version the criteria dropdowns will dynamically populate based upon the app data that has been sent in by your apps  so for example any custom event names that you have will automatically populate in the criteria drop downs only an event name is selected more granular event data is specified to include attributes recency and frequency jfk airport at least once in the last  days ecommerce data similar to event data all ecommerce events that you have logged can be used as part of your audience criteria below are some of the possible choices shopping  cart level purchase cart abandonment shopping  product level add to cart remove from cart purchase refund product detail item abandonment promotions view click impressions product bags user data user data represents data specific to users using audience manager you can include user data in your audience definition criteria by including user attributes  this must be explicitly instrumented by the app developer using the mparticle sdk user attribute lists  this must be explicitly instrumented by the app developer using the mparticle sdk lifetime value ltv  this must be explicitly instrumented by the app developer using the mparticle sdk location  this information is automatically detected and captured by the mparticle sdk if location tracking is enabled technographic information such as device operating system os and carrier  this information is automatically detected and captured by the mparticle sdk crash data with audience manager you can include app errors as part of your audience criteria you can select the types of crashes all handled unhandled crashes you can further specify recency  frequency along with app  build version install data with audience manager you can include install data as part of your audience criteria you can specify the time frame of the install you can further specify app  build version session data with audience manager you can include session data as part of your audience criteria you can specify the session frequency and recency upgrade data with audience manager you can include upgrade data as part of your audience criteria you can specify upgrade recency you can further specify app  build version attribution with audience manager you can include attribution data as part of your audience criteria you can select an attribution type attributed install unattributed install if you select attributed install you can further qualify the criteria by specifying the following additional properties service provider campaign publisher screen views with audience manager you can include screen views as part of your audience criteria you can further specify recency  frequency along with app  build version rd party data refer to the rd party data topic for additional details multi workspace audiences if you have multiple workspaces in your account you can combine data received from these workspaces to create more complex audience definition when you first create an audience you must specify if it is a single or multiple workspace audience the audience manager is a very powerful and flexible tool for taking your raw data and creating actionable audiences if you have any questions about audience manager please drop us a line at supportmparticlecom audience sharing audience sharing is in beta testing if you would like to enable audience sharing in your mparticle account please contact your success manager audience sharing lets mparticle clients share audience data with each other there are two basic use cases for audience sharing sharing an audience with a media platform to efficiently target campaigns mptravel wants to run a retargeting campaign for their web app on the mpmovies media platform since both are mparticle clients mptravel can share the retargeting audience they have created with mpmovies who can then use that audience to determine which users to target with ads for mptravel mutually sharing audiences with a related app to allow both parties to expand their user base mptravel and mprestaurants both target users interested in travel and entertainment since they are both mparticle customers they agree to share audiences with each other so that each can target the other’s users any audience sharing arrangement has two parties the initiator offers to share one or more of the audiences they have created in mparticle the receiver gains access to the shared audience in their own mparticle dashboard in order to receive audiences you must opt in either party can end the arrangement at any time opt in to receive audiences to be able to receive audiences navigate to audiences in the dashboard click pp audiences and turn on the receiving switch you will be prompted to accept the sharing terms and conditions and upload a png file of your company logo share an audience to share an audience from the audience page under pp audiences  shared and click share audience select the audiences you want to share and the mparticle customers you want to receive them only activated audiences can be shared the receiver must accept the audiences before sharing begins until the audience is accepted it will appear as ‘pending’ in your shared audience tab your shared tab will show an uptodate view of each audience you’ve shared and which mparticle customers they are shared with receive an audience if another mparticle customer has shared an audience with you you will see a notification on the audience page under pp audiences  received showing that you have audiences pending click it to accept or reject the audiences once you have accepted an audience you can connect it to any of your audience services just like an audience you have created yourself updates to shared audiences once an audience is shared any users added deleted or updated will be reflected for all parties that share the audience stop sharing once a particular audience is being shared the sharing arrangement can end in several ways the initiator deletes the audience the initiator chooses to ‘unshare’ the audience the receiver removes the audience from their ‘shared audiences’ tab the receiver opts out of audience sharing if any of the above occur the shared audience will no longer be available to the receiver cancelling a sharing arrangement cannot be undone if you wish to resume it the initiator must resend the audience to the receiver connections the connections screen allows you to connect your added and configured platform and feed inputs to an event output service setup filters and view the live stream the following sections provide additional details on each topic connect user splits filter live stream connect the connect screen is where you can setup and view the connection between your configured inputs platforms and feeds and your configured output event services in this example we’re setting up a connection between our ios platform and the google analytics output event configuration to setup a connection follow these steps click select input to display the list of added platform and configured input feeds select the ios platform and click select click connect output to display the list of configured output event services select google analytics as the service you want to connect to the selected input select the configuration name for the selected service and click next enter the connection specific parameters click add connection google analytics will now be shown as a connected output min platform version a key consideration if you are already sending data to a service is to ensure that you do not send duplicate data once you start forwarding from mparticle for example you will have some users that have an older version of your app and are therefore still sending data via the service sdk and when you enable data forwarding from mparticle you will want to ensure that the same data is not sent twice eg app data for a user is sent to a service via their sdk and the same data is forwarded by mparticle in scenarios such as this when you are already working with a service and will be removing their sdk from your app once you begin forwarding via mparticle you will use mparticle’s app version filtering capability mparticle allows you to specify a minimum version of your app for data forwarding to mparticle for example let’s say your current version that includes a services sdk is version  you next version which incorporates the mparticle sdk and removes the service sdk is version  in your mparticle connection settings you will want to specify  in the version settings this will ensure that older app versions that still have the service’s sdk still send data directly to the service and that newer versions with the mparticle sdk included and the services sdk removed will forward data via mparticle if you return to the connect screen and select an input the list of currently connected event outputs is displayed the list that is displayed can be changed by toggling show info to show or hide the configuration name service and output environment filtering by status  all active or inactive filtering by environment  all production or development entering search terms if you select a connected output the details panel is shown where you can see additional details about the connection if you click settings the connection settings form is displayed and you can update the connection settings and toggle the status of the forwarding to sending if you click tools you are provided with additional connection tools which are described in the next section forwarding rules custom mappings user sampling forwarding rules you can setup forwarding rules to a connected output service based on attribute or attribution rules select the type of forwarding to specify attribute you can specify a particular attributevalue combination rule for event forwarding select only forward to forward events when there is a match and do not forward to not forward events when there is a match in order for the rule to apply the attribute must have been mapped to an event previously sent into the mparticle platform and the value must be an exact match you can search for attribute values by entering a search term into the text box if there is a match at most  results will be shown and you can further refine the list of attribute values by adding additional characters to the search term attribute value filtering should be configured before the integration is enabled for ecommerce events the attribute must be set at the commerce event level not the individual product level attribution you can specify a particular attribution publisher rule for event forwarding select only forward to forward events when there is a match and do not forward to not forward events when there is a match in order for the rule to apply the publisher must have been mapped to an attribution event previously sent into the mparticle platform and the value must be an exact match custom mappings some services allow your incoming events to be translated into events specific to the service for example if you have a custom event named “nextlevel” typically this event would be forwarded as a custom event to a service however with custom mappings you can specify that this event be forwarded to a service using their specific event name as follows integration integration description integration event name criteo user level finished userlevel facebook achieved level fbmobilelevelachieved tune level achieved levelachieved once you have connected the service you can view and set these mappings by clicking the custom mappings on the connection tools you can then select your incoming event and associated attributes to configure sending your incoming event to the selected service the screen shot below shows tune’s “level achieved” event and the additional attributes that can be mapped for this event the following integrations support custom mappings agilone amazon mobile analytics applovin appsflyer criteo facebook fiksu simplereach tune user sampling you can choose to send a subset or a sample of your data to a service for example if you do not need to send all your data to a particular service in order to realize the benefit that the service offers andor if you want to control the volumebased costs that are charged to you by a service mparticle sampling is user based eg if you enter a sampling value of let’s say  we will forward data for  of your users this ensures we are not forwarding data that is disassociated from user identities in order to enable sampling enter the percent of data that you want to forward in the user sampling box and click save user splits user splits is generally used to describe the practice of comparing two versions of a web page or an app view to determine which performs better for example you would compare two app views by showing two variants  let’s call them a and b  to different users at the same time you would monitor results and the one that performs better for your business objective wins in the rapidly proliferating app ecosystem world mparticle enables a different kind of user split testing  the ability to test two different services mparticle enables you to send a specific range of users and their data to one service and a mutually exclusive range of users and their data to a different service mparticle customers use these capabilities to effectively test different services for push notification effectiveness analytics email marketing and others this is an easy powerful way for you to test and evaluate similar services against one another before making a buying decision in addition we have built the feature in a very flexible fashion so that you can design and execute other forms of tests as well mparticle has implemented user splits via user ranges the mparticle platform algorithmically assigns users a random number between  and  ensuring an even distribution of your users across this range this implementation allows you to create up to  overlapping or mutually exclusive groups of users for your user split test setting up user splits in mparticle entails the following steps plan your test setup your data sampling execute your test  plan your test the most important aspect of user split testing is completely independent of the capabilities offered by mparticle planning an effective test is of paramount importance what are you testing for what is the design of the test what is a reasonable user population size for the test how long with the test run how will you evaluate the results what happens if you need to change the design of the test midstream for some reason and so on mparticle strongly recommends that you consult with the services that you will be testing as well  a comparison test is something that they should be prepared to support and conversely they should be offered an opportunity to provide input on how best to conduct a test of their capabilities  setup your data sampling once you have defined your test the mparticle setup can be done through the following steps configure the output event services and connect them to the input you plan to use for the user split test do not toggle forwarding on as that would begin forwarding all data before you’ve set the range just enter the configuration parameters and save click connections connect and then select the input to use for the user split click user splits select the services you want to include in the user split specify the percentage of users to go to each of the selected services and click save now you are ready to setup a test for this test we will send a sample of users to kissmetrics and a sample to google analytics so that we can compare two different analytics integrations from the select integration dropdown select kissmetrics and then google analytics if you already have user data sampling on for a given integration and you include that same integration in a user split mparticle automatically disables user sampling as they are mutually exclusive features you can also see that by default the sampling range for an integration is  in this example let’s send  of user data to kissmetrics and  to google analytics so we will adjust the sliders until the range parameters are correct  execute your test when you are ready to start sending sampled data to the configured services select the integration and toggle the status to on to begin forwarding data those services then execute your test plan key considerations when you are using the mparticle user splits feature there are some important considerations plan your user data ranges carefully needing to adjust these after the test goes live can have unintended consequences for example if you are testing two different push notifications services and midway through the test decide to decrease the range of users being sent to one service it will have no effect on that service since push tokens for the initial range of users will have already been forwarded to those users’ devices and once issued cannot be retracted embedded kits require mparticle support in order to enable these providers for user splits you must contact us at supportmparticlecom filter the filtering section of the connection screen allows you to filter data from your input platforms and feeds to the connected output event services you first need to select at most  connected services to display in the filter view to view and modify their filter parameters if you have configured multiple configurations for a service you can select the specific configurations for the service for each output event service there are standard mparticle filter configurations that are available to all event integrations including send new data points by default event filters let’s review each of these in turn send new data points by default the send new data points by default feature you allows you to control whether new data points are automatically sent to a service or if you have to review and enable data by service the value is set to true by default which means that mparticle will automatically forward all newlydetected events and user identities to the service that support them if you set this value to false by unchecking the field and you you make a change to your app to send in additional data to mparticle the data will not be forwarded to the service until you review and enable it event filters you can easily filter what data gets sent to a given service for example filtering out personally identifiable information pii or if there are company insights inherent in the data that you don’t want to share with a particular service for each configured service you can enabledisable which data is sent to each based upon your app and service requirements all events that have been send into mparticle are available for filtering you can switch between the following tabs to restrict filtering of the following types events users  a maximum of  user attributes are displayed screens ecommerce only the events and users tabs are available for feeds live stream the live stream is a real time view of inbound and outbound data to mparticle it allows you to review inbound data from mparticle instrumented apps to ensure correct sdk andor ss implementation and review outbound events to services to ensure a correct implementation a timestamp name message device and location details are displayed in tabular form if there are any errors in forwarding event data to a specific integration an error icon will appear next to the integration message type displaying the reason live stream filters there are several filters which can be used to restrict the list of events shown in the live stream inputs  you can select an individual platform or feed in your workspace the following filters will impact newly arriving events and will not filter events already displayed in the tabular view outputs  you can select an individual output event configuration in your workspace message direction  when you incorporate the sdk into your mobile app a device running your app generates events that are sent to mparticle these events are referred to as inbound events measured from the perspective of the mparticle server when the server receives these inbound events it processes them and produces outbound events to the integrations that you have configured and enabled for your app you can choose to view only inbound messages only outbound messages or both types of messages when evaluating your event instrumentation you typically watch only inbound messages when attempting to evaluate your service configurations you typically choose to observe outbound messages although you may choose to watch both so that you can more easily see the cause and effect of your code instrumentation this filter takes place on newly arriving events device  typically during testing you will want to monitor a specific test device the device dropdown shows all devices that are currently sending messages to all workspaces in the account additionally the dropdown list shows all devices that have been saved you can use the device filter to choose a specific device to monitor you can also choose to monitor all dev data saved devices typically have a userassigned friendly name while observed devices have the following format

java sdk to build either a lambda or http integration as long as you can respond to the following requests in the required format moduleregistrationrequest eventprocessingrequest event integrations only audiencesubscriptionrequest audience integrations only audiencemembershipchangerequest audience integrations only see the mparticle firehose wiki for more information on these requests and the json samples in the sdk repository for formatting aws lambda integrations leveraging amazon aws’s lambda platform mparticle will send your “lambda function” data as it comes into our system so that your function can then forward it along to your own api two sample projects are available on github to help you get started with your lambda integration sample project can be cloned to get started on building your lambda integration iterable extension is a real world event and audience integration built using the mparticle java sdk this can be used as a reference to see a full working example javadocs contains the javadocs for the different classes and methods available in the mparticle java sdk don’t forget to provide a highresolution logo to mparticle in svg format with a transparent background performance tuning tips machine size  aws uses the memory that you allocate to your function as a proxy for cpu allocation a function with mb of memory will be allocated x more cpu than a function with mb of memory a function with mb will be allocated x cpu of a mb function etc most of the lambda functions that we see actually use less than mb of memory but we provision them with mb of memory just to get that cpu and reduce execution time http requests  make only a single http request for each function invocation if possible blocking io  mparticle will invoke your aws function from the aws us east availability region  so your lambda function should be deployed in same us east region try to only make blocking io requests to other apis physically nearby rather than to the west coast for example memory  keep expensive objects in memory when mparticle invokes your lambda function for the first time aws will immediately provision a machine for it when repeated invocations are made over the span of minutesseconds that same machinememory space will be used this means that you should keep every object in memory that you can a simple example of this is shown in our sample firehose function we allocate the messageserializer object as a member of the requeststreamhandler instance on subsequent invocations the handlerequest function will be called on the same requeststreamhandler instance and therefore not waste time creating another messageserializer object the above point is particularly useful if you’re using an http client or other io library that can reuse connections keep that client in memory as a member of your requeststreamhandler instance if possible asynchronous io  aws lambda will allow you to create new threads use thread pools etc if the above pointers still don’t help you could always make your io requests completely asynchronous particularly for audiencemembershipchangerequests you can queue your api request and return an empty audiencemembershipchangeresponse to mparticle there are several http client libraries such as retrofitokhttp which make this really easy lambda throttling mparticle servers will stream data to your function at the same rate at which it is received if your lambda function cannot process the data as fast as mparticle is sending mparticle will be throttled and will receive a  too many requests error code the default lambda limits are the requests per second limit is  which is account wide the concurrent requests limit is  which is account wide before publishing an integration the concurrent requests limit must be increased to a minimal value of  to prevent throttling once the request has been submitted to aws mparticle can assist in escalating the ticket for completion the following parameters are suggested values which can be used in the request expected average requests per second   expected peak requests per second   expected function duration in seconds   function memory size  increase to a minimum of  invocation type  requestresponse event source  http api use case description  high volume function refer to the aws documentation for additional details on aws lambda limits and scalability and availability you can also check your current usage on the cloudwatch console by selecting lambda below metrics in the left pane in the right pane select throttles as metric name and you should see anything you’re being throttled on within lambda a good guide would be to take the highest number and request  more than that you can request a higher limit by opening a case with aws support keep this in mind as you’re developing your lambda function as it may determine how it should process and to which of your apis you should send data data rate and volume will depend on the size of the customer that has enabled your integration the amount oftypes of data for which you register if you have registered to receive audience data the volatility and size of a given customer’s audiences latency requirements mparticle requires an average response time of under ms for  of all calls to your lambda function testing  if during testing and review the integration partner is unable to meet latency requirements the integration will not be approved and made available in the mparticle platform released  if the integration has been released and available to customers and latency drops below expected requirements mparticle will within our best effort notify you immediately if integration partner is unable to remedy latency concerns within a reasonable timeframe mparticle may disable the integration until latency requirements are met http integrations the http integration method will make http calls over tls  using the same protocol and integration methodology that aws lambda integrations use except that it calls a nominated http endpoint directly endpoint requirements the endpoint must be https the endpoint must be located in the east coast united states response latency must be under ms in order to ensure necessary throughput can be maintained we suggest requests are accepted and queued for asynchronous processing mparticle will send calls with an authorization header you can choose whether to authenticate mparticle as the caller with this header the format will be “authorization  token token” this token value will be provided to you by email encoded with a pgp encryption key you provide to generate a token mparticle needs to be able to import the moduleregistrationresponse so this response should not require authentication responses mparticle expects to receive a  ok or a  accepted response for all requests retries will occur only if a  too many requests response is received a given message will retry  times before being dropped all xx errors will not be retried the endpoint must accept the same json format as the lambda api samples of the json requests can be found here the following methods should be supported registration

svg format with a transparent background embedded kit integrations in a mobile environment most of mparticle’s integrations involve collecting data using the mparticle sdk transforming it into a format accepted by the partner and forwarding it to the partner servertoserver occasionally there are features of a partner platform using their own sdk which are not currently supported using mparticle’s sdk and ss forwarding in these cases it may be possible to create an embedded kit integration in this scenario the partner develops a version of their sdk delivering key functionality that can be wrapped by the mparticle sdk allowing direct communication between client mobile app and the partner typically mparticle will only commit to supporting an embedded kit integration when an mparticle customer has indicated that it is a requirement and commited to incorporating the kit into their app the following resources are available for developing embedded kit integration android example kit development guide ios example kit development guide as with other integration types you will need to provide a high resolution logo for your company in svg format for our integration directory mparticle will work with you to collect other information required and to test and deploy your integration inbound integrations partners can also send client data to mparticle as a feed so that mutual customers can forward their data on to other services to make a customer’s data available as a feed you need to send it to mparticle’s server to server api in mparticle’s batch format mparticle will provide you with a template to complete with information about your company and the data your feed will provide we will also work with you to document your feed and test that it performs as expected to build a feed integration you need to create a function or service to convert the data you want to forward into mparticle’s batch format create a secure way for your clients to be able to provide you with the api key and secret necessary to send their data to mparticle’s server to server api you can either build this into your platform ui or communicate directly with each client wanting to access your feed in mparticle using the credentials provided by each client forward data either to our https api or an amazon sqs endpoint see our server to server api documentation for more information don’t forget to provide a highresolution logo to mparticle in svg format with a transparent background faq what happens to my data if i cancel my subscription your data can be exported or will be deleted within  days who owns the data we take data ownership very seriously which means your data is your data and yours alone you decide what you want to do with it we do not combine data across clients for our own marketing purposes or comingle client data in any way how long does it take to integrate implementing mparticle can range based upon your objectives depending on if you’re solving for speed and simplicity or if you’re going for total control mparticle can be implemented in as little as  minutes how long do you keep my data active for it varies by plan and each plan can be customized further depending on how long you want your data to be readily available do you compete with any of the services you’re integrated into no mparticle is a data and integration layer that makes it easier for you to use the great services without further code changes you still have to establish a direct relationship with each of the integrations you want to use what platforms do you support currently we support ios tvos android alexa roku firetv xbox smarttv mobile web how can i be assured that no data will be lost and what happens if one of the integrations goes down not to worry we store your data on amazon s and then again on amazon glacier for long term storage amazon s has never had an outage resulting in data loss and is designed to provide  durability of objects over a given year if an integration goes down we queue up all pending messages and send them on their way once the integration is restored if i can’t find what i’m looking for in the docs or i have other questions where can i go for help you can always reach us at supportmparticlecom  we love questions and feedback ios android javascript unity   mparticle inc all rights
