between the active and passive management active managers try to improve performance attributes alpha and passive strategies try to deliver performance consistent with a specific category or asset class beta this piece discusses both approaches and highlights the middle ground that may be found by using a factorbased smart beta approachalternative assetsdiscusses why integrating alternatives into a traditional portfolio should help reduce portfolio volatility and improve the odds of preserving capital over the long termamnesia effectdiscusses the failed behavior of fearbased market timing and performance chasing instead of remembering the potential value of diversification including constant exposure to noncorrelated investments such as managed futuresasset class historya look at the calendar year performance history of various asset classes during the past two decades in its entirety this colorful table provides a clear view that asset classes go in and out of favor from year to year making a powerful case for the potential benefits of diversificationasset class seasonalitystudying asset class seasonality helps to address the old adage of “sell in may and go away” the piece examines if there is statistical truth to the yearly superstition with regard to the stock market and if it also applies to other asset classes hopefully as case is made for the potential value of diversification and longterm investment horizons in an attempt to overcome shortterm swings and anecdotal observationsbetas on the cuspstudies the increasing beta of various asset classes relative to the stock market on the cusp of a credit crisis and considers taking a minsky approach to modern portfolio theory through the use of alternative investmentsbroken incomeowning a bond fund is not the same as owning a bond this piece explains the inherent structural problem with many bond funds and makes a case for using absolute return funds as a possible alternative for portfolio diversificationcommoditiesa basic introduction to commodity investing analyzes some of the indexes commonly used as benchmarks for mutual funds including a comparison of holdings investment methodology and performancecommodity turnslike any investment commodities have historically gone in and out of favor when they are in a prolonged period of delivering negative returns at some point investors begin to wonder when they may begin to make a new upward turn this piece looks at the historical returns of multiple asset classes and identifies previous times when commodities rebounded from low points and turned sharply upward contango and cashthis article discusses commodity investing and some technical terms such as contango backwardation and the use of futures contracts it also addresses the idea of using a strategy that is more aligned with the objectives of longterm investorscorrelationthis piece explains correlation and why it is such an important element for diversification it also provides some perspective on historical correlations specifically the difference between longterm and shortterm averagesduration dilemmawhen interest rates rise bond values generally fall in order to address interest rate sensitivity in a low rate environment many investors will reducing the average duration of their bond portfolios by moving to shorter maturities however reducing the duration of a bond portfolio in such a low rate environment often results in an lower portfolio yield one potential solution is to consider using other sources of yield outside of traditional bonds where duration and maturity are not factorsendowment allocationthis educational piece discusses the asset allocation strategy of sophisticated endowment funds like harvard and yaleflood insurancemanaged futures strategies can go in and out of favor but generally tend to attract the most assets after there is a sharp decline in the stock market there is an argument to be made for using a strategy that work in both bull and bear markets this piece examines the similarity between assets flowing into managed futures after a market correction versus people buying insurance after a floodinflationthis piece explains the history of inflation a commonly used statistical measurement for rising prices it also provides some perspective on the way inflation affects an investors portfolio and how adding commodities may act as a hedgeinvestor behaviorshows how asset allocation strategies can be used to help limit losses caused by fearbased sellinginvestor returnsthis

periods as a possible way of analyzing historical market turning points by studying history perhaps we can learn how the market adjusts prices during times of crisis and prepares for potential reboundsportable sigmawhen seeking diversification investors often favor using low risk investments to offset the higher volatility of stockcentric portfolios because of the lower volatility the low risk investments require a greater allocation percentage in order to achieve the desired level of diversification for a portfolio the idea of portable alpha is to use a lower percentage of higher volatility diversifiers provided they have low correlation in order to free up some capital for additional investmentsportfolio chemistrycommodities have a historically been viewed as a fairly risky asset class not unlike equities some investors avoid the asset class because of the historical volatility similar to high school chemistry this piece discusses the concept of combining two risky asset classes commodities and equities to actually reduce overall portfolio volatilityrelative strengthan introduction to relative strength investing which includes information about the basic premise supporting the theory as well as the actual practice of portfolio constructionrelative strength environmentsan analysis of the sectors within the sp  from a correlation perspective the piece discusses the pre and postfinancial crisis periods and illustrates a timeline of events that may have created a challenging environment for trendfollowing strategiesrelative strength turnsexplains the cyclical nature of relative strength investment models by illustrating the historical performance compared to the overall equity market sp  discusses the potential for relative strength to outperform known as “rs alpha” but often does so with upward and downward trend periodsrisk managementthis piece explains standard deviation a commonly used statistical measurement for risk it also provides some perspective on the historical price movements of stocks and bonds relative to investors risk tolerancescare marketsmany investors have difficulty identifying the difference between a temporary market correction and a longterm bear market this piece breaks down the basic differences to help investors make their own determination if a market decline seems like a longterm problem or just part of a normal market cycle tactical betadiscusses the potential benefits of tactical investment strategies by increasing and reducing exposure to various asset classes at different times in an attempt to enhance potential returns and reduce the impact of shortterm fluctuationstactical diversificationtactical investment strategies and diversification are two terms that often seem contradictory but may actually complement one another when added to a portfoliothe new in order to account for everchanging risk environments portfolio modeling should include a tactical element which can add an extra level of diversification rather than relying on a static  allocation to stocks and bonds the new  asks investors to consider blending a  mix of traditional assets with tactical and alternative strategiesthree legged stoolthis dorsey wright insights illustrates a portfolio management strategy known as the three legged stool which combines a core portfolio of tactical and alternative mutual funds with three active management strategiesvalue and momentummany investors believe that the way to diversify a valuebased strategy is to add a growth strategy however growth can contradict value adding growth has the risk of reducing the effectiveness of a value strategy in the first place this piece makes the case for using a momentum strategy such as relative strength to complement valuevolatility  diversificationthe purpose of diversification is generally to improve the risk and return characteristics of a portfolio many investors believe the only way to reduce a portfolio’s risk is to add investments with less volatility often at the cost of less return but according to modern portfolio theory it may be possible to combine higher volatility investments to reduce a portfolio’s overall risk without sacrificing the potential for greater returns   arrow investment advisors home  about arrow  press  news  contact us  privacy statement before investing please read
