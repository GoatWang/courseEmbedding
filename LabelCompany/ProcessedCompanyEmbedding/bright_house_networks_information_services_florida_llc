florida carriage disputesedit when bright house networks was separate from time warner cable most of its carriage deals were still negotiated on its behalf by time warner cable thus bright house customers were affected whenever there were carriage disputes between twc and a content provider which has happened several times bright house networks spectrum from its inception in  bright houses systems in central florida including orlando refused to carry fox sports florida this dated back to when the central florida cable franchise was held by cablevision and then time warner cable as bright house is by far the largest cable provider in central florida this left most of the orlando area without most orlando magic games the dispute ended in  when bright house added fox sports florida to its lineup on september   bright house temporarily dropped stations owned by the lin tv corporation on its pensacola defuniak springs and indiana systems affected stations were walatv in mobile alabama wishtvwndytvwiihca in indianapolis and wanetv in fort wayne indiana even though the controversy was focused on time warner cable systems bright house was included in the dispute in

any viacom channel beyond the end of year therefore time warner and bright house networks would have lost all  viacom channels including comedy central and nickelodeon starting on january   this

lead to foxs owned and operated affiliates to be pulled from bright house systems in the detroit tampa bay orlando and gainesville markets along with foxs cable and sports channels in all markets served by bright house the carriage protests were announced shortly before fox was to carry the bowl championship series which included the florida gators in the sugar bowl the dispute excluded fox news channel fox business network and some regional sports channels which are on separate contracts shortly before the  midnight et deadline on december   fox granted time warner cable and bright house a brief extension during new years day as talks continued so viewers would not miss the sugar bowl though the other bowl games and the nfl lineup remained at risk a settlement between the two parties was reached the evening of january   though no terms were disclosed during the discussions that day none of foxs channels or stations were blacked out in july  abcs parent company disney

nexstar broadcasting group while other hearst stations on bright house were replaced with other cable channels offered by bright house nexstar complained that bright house has used wbres signal outside their markets without permission while bright house argued it was within its rights to use that stations signal as a replacement until a deal with hearst was reached according to time warner cable the dispute stemmed from hearsts demand of a  increase in its retransmission fees the substitutions lasted until july   when the deal was reached between hearst and time warner on august   at  pm the carriage deal between cbs and time warner cable expired with no renewal deal being reached until a month later time warner had major markets affected by the blackout while only a few bright

agent start my llc how to start an llc in florida in  steps whether you are launching a new company right out of college or starting a business in retirement the state of florida is brimming with opportunity the sunshine state is well known for its favorable business climate offering several tax advantages profit flexibility and fewer fees than in other states still there are a few unique bylaws you need to know here’s how to form your florida llc step  your florida llc’s name the first step in forming a new llc in florida is to create and file your llc name this name must be recognizably different from any other business name registered in florida you can call and ask about the availability of a name by calling the state llc filing office or you can research llc name availability on the florida division of corporations’ website however florida does not allow you to reserve a prospective name ahead of time there are a few additional rules for naming your new florida llc what you can’t do the llc’s name can’t have language that could give the impression it has been started for a business purpose other than that stated in its articles of organization or one that’s not allowed by state law it also cannot give the impression that the llc is connected with the federal or state government what you must do as the last words of the name the words “limited company” or “limited liability company” or the abbreviations “lc” or “llc” must be included “limited” can be shortened to “ltd” and “company” may be abbreviated as “co” step  create and file your articles of organization now that you have a name for your florida llc incfile can help you file your articles of organization with the florida department of state’s division of corporations the articles of organization must state the llc name the names and addresses of the organizers the address of the llc’s primary place of business the articles have to be signed by at least one organizer or an authorized representative of an organizer the articles of organization may also contain other things chosen by the members so long as they are not contrary to law such as whether the llc will be managed by a manager or managers the name and street address of the llc’s registered agent along with a statement that the agent agrees to the appointment and the duties it entails requirements for florida llc registered agents florida llcs must have a registered agent living in florida who can receive official correspondence from the state both administrative and legal a registered agent for a florida llc can be an individual resident of florida whose business office is the same as the registered office or a business entity foreign or domestic that can conduct business in florida and whose business office is the same as the registered office incfile can provide registered agent service for your florida llc if needed the new llc is recognized as “organized” once the articles of organization and a copy are delivered to the secretary of state’s office with the required filing fee and that office confirms that they are in order your llc is not a legal business entity until the state of florida has filed the company florida llc filing fees the filing fee is  and checks should be made payable to the florida department of state for additional fees you can get a certified copy of your articles from the llc filing office and a certificate of status that certifies that your llc has an active status the llc will be presumed to be perpetual in duration unless otherwise stated in the articles of organization step  create an operating agreement for your florida llc after its articles of organization the llc’s most vital document is the operating agreement which can be amended or repealed as specified by either the agreement itself or applicable law just like a corporation’s bylaws the operating agreement isn’t required by state law but it’s a critical internal document that officially sets out how the llc will operate an llc’s operating agreement should list the members see below for how membership works in a florida llc how much each has invested how profits are to be divided how much of a voting share each member has when voting it may also specify requirements for meetings such as how much notice how many members constitute a quorum voting rules and so on it also usually includes statemandated requirements so that all the llc’s operational rules are laid out in one place the articles of organization can also include constraints on members’ authority to adopt amend or repeal an operating agreement if there is more than one member when the llc is formed the initial operating agreement must be approved in writing by all members how membership works in a florida llc florida llcs must have one or more members all of whom are individuals not business entities to become a member one normally needs to make some kind of contribution pay cash or transfer property to the llc or take on an obligation to do so member contributions to the llc can be in cash property promissory notes services already or to be rendered or some other obligation to contribute cash property or contracts for services a member can resign from an llc so long as he or she follows the procedures listed in the articles of organization or the operating agreement which also usually specify a minimum amount of time before a member is allowed to resign llcs have the option of pursuing remedies for damages to the llc caused by a member’s resignation ongoing requirements for llcs in florida including taxes there are several filing and recordkeeping tasks that llcs owners in florida need to remember to do florida llcs must file a report annually with the florida secretary of state that specifies the following the llc names and the governmental jurisdiction under which it was organized the llc’s date of organization or if it’s a foreign llc the date on which it was authorized to do business in the state the county and street address of the llc’s registered office the name of the llc’s registered agent at the registered florida office the mailing and street addresses of its primary place of business the llc’s federal employer identification number ein or if it doesn’t have one whether one has been applied for the names and addresses of its managing members or managers any additional information requested by the secretary of state when you work with incfile we will send you courtesy email reminders at the approach of due dates for florida’s ongoing requirements taxes info for florida llcs taxes are another ongoing issue for llc owners llcs do offer tax advantages over a corporation such as the availability of more deductions additionally an llc does not have to be a separate tax entity in the same way as a corporation instead it can be a “passthrough” entity for tax purposes so that the llc owners report business losses or profits on their personal tax returns in the same way as a partnership unless you choose for your llc to be taxed as a corporation the irs treats singlemember llcs as sole proprietorships for tax purposes this means the llc itself does not pay taxes on its own account and does not have to file a tax return the irs treats multiplemember llcs as partnerships for tax purposes unless you choose for your llc to be taxed as a corporation the result of this is that llc owners each pay taxes on their lawful share of the profits on their personal income tax returns rather than the llc itself the llc tax rate for florida varies based on taxable net income dissolution of an llc in florida a florida llc is considered dissolved when any one of these events occur events happen specified in the articles of organization or operating agreement as requiring dissolution agreement to dissolve by a number or percentage of members specified in the operating agreement an event that makes it illegal for the llc to continue when a member leaves the llc unless the remaining members agree within  days to continue the llc a judicial decree is entered that orders dissolution launch your business today

contact dashboard login incorporate now why thousands of small business owners choose incfile scroll down deciding on a company formation service can be very confusing and seemingly overwhelming process there are a multitude of companies on the web that perform the function of starting new entities and each has its own unique offerings and packages that can potentially you make feel that they are comparing apples to oranges although our modesty prohibits us from claiming that we are the best listed below are some of the distinguishing features that we think separate us from other companies  value – nobody gives you more for less  more first and foremost our basic price of a new entity formation is  plus state filing fees and although you may find companies claiming to do it for less you have to be aware that many of these companies only prepare the documents and mail them to you our service is end to end we prepare your documents file them with the state and only deliver everything to you only after the company has been filed and if for any reason we cannot get your filed we will issue a full refund to you less  registered agent service  st year free  more each of our  packages include a  free year of registered agent service if you do not need us to act as your registered agent you are not obliged to do so and you can name yourself or whomever you wish after the first year you have the option to renew the registered agent service for the annual price of  we do not ever under any circumstance charge your payment card automatically if you decide to renew you will need to enter the site and process the renewal with your payment information we only point this out because there are companies that will offer the registered agent service for a pre specified time lets say  weeks or  months and then auto charge your payment card for whatever there annual fee is and then keep charging every year thereafter going forward making the assumption that the company is still active or that you have not changed the agent on file with the state less  transparency  more we have dedicated much time and effort to make sure that you know exactly what not only the final cost of your formation will be throughout the order process but we also make sure that you are aware of any additional post filing fees that the state may require of you after the formation is complete on the first page of our order process you will see a link at the towards the top of the page that will present itself after the state and entity type have been selected titled state compulsory filing requirements we strongly urge you to review this link as many states ie nevada exercise very expensive fees that are due within a close proximity to the entity being filed the link will also inform you what the annual fees and requirements for keeping the company active will be as most states require the entity to file document known as an annual report or franchise tax we will let you know when it is due and what it will cost less  notifications  more all of our packages include lifetime notification alerts as long as we have a valid email we will also send email alerts informing our clients of important filing dates regarding their entities these emails are sent on a schedule that will allow you to know when an annual report or franchise tax report is due so that you can avoid missing important filing dates less  internal documents  more it is very important that clients understand that the company formation process is more than just filing the articles of organization  incorporation with the state depending on the state in which the company is filed some states may not list the members of an llc or the directors and shareholders of a corporation we create custom operating agreements for the lllc which will list the name and percentage of ownership for each member in addition we also create custom bylaws and organizational meeting minutes for corporations which list the names of the directors and shareholders as well as the number of shares that each shareholder owns the internal documents stated above are in addition to other custom documents as well such as the statement of the organizer  incorporator and banking resolutions if changes need to be made to any of these documents we can also provide them to our clients in digital format so that they can be customized as needed less  electronic copies  more we know that sometimes even the best organized person can misplace or lose important documents therefore we make sure to keep copies of every filing in digital format should you need it in the future less  privacy  more you can always rest assured that your personal information will remain such we do not sell or solicit your information to any person or outside business the only we will share any of your personal information with any outside agency is through the receipt of a subpoena although we do have partners that we encourage our clients to use they will only be provided your contact information if you personally opt in we also do not store any payment card information in our database and scrape any other sensitive information from our site ie social security numbers from the database as soon as the order is completed less  sales practices  more we do not employ sales people any person that you speak to on the telephone regarding information about a new formation will always be knowledgable long time employee or on of the owners of the company we only provide you with clear concise information that will allow you to make the best decision for your needs even though it is much more profitable for us we never have or will encourage our clients to form entities in states outside of the location where the business is physically located as this practice adds further complexity to the process if additional steps are not taken and can leave the client exposed in the event of litigation or the pursuance of additional licensing in the state of location we would strongly urge you to be wary of companies that compel you to form a business entity in this state or that state as this can have detrimental consequences if the additional steps are not taken follow the link for more information regarding this less  experience  more when we entered this industry in  the landscape of competitors was completely different from the companies we see today through hard work and determination we weathered the incremental business cycles that all business are subject to and are still here today we have formed well over  companies and the majority of our staff has been with us since the beginning of the companies existence what that means for you is that you can rest assured that your documents will be handled by individuals who have vast knowledge and experience in filing business entities and are familiar with the nuances of each of the  states less  humility  more at the end of the day we know that we are not perfect we make mistakes sometimes its difficult to reach us on the phones and speak to a live person however if we do make a an error or fall short of expectations you can rest assured that we will do everything within in reason to ensure that you leave a satisfied customer and have a positive experience our goal is to provide to provide the most value at the lowest cost and the cost for that is that we cannot staff a pleather of call takers to man the phones if you do need to reach us immediately the best way to contact us for a prompt response is to use the messaging tool found at
