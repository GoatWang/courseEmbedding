dedicated to qcl performance improvement pranalytica also uses its proprietary packaging and thermal management solutions to fully extract the available device performance and to provide well characterized and reliable high power products that can be easily integrated into real world systems the company now offers an industry leading family of high power high efficiency singlyemitter products with cw optical power levels exceeding w and w at µm and µm respectively and over w in the lwir spectral region several singleemitters can be spectrally combined in multilux platform to cover multiple spectral bands with total optical power of up to w optimization of swap characteristics is of a critical importance for a number of applications that include infrared beacons and target designators to address these applications pranalytica has recently introduced to the market unique ultrasmall high power qcw lasers with a hermitic butterfly package measuring less than cm and delivering over w at µm and over w at µm in a collimated output beam for spectroscopy applications pranalytica offers widely tunable systems omnilux platform incorporates four external cavity lasers covering µm with more than mw of average power in the entire spectral region a singleemitter version of the system is currently being developed references  j faist f capasso d l sivco c sirtori a l

researchdocuments rd grants and contracts journal publications invited presentations patents  trademarks aboutpranalytica basic information board members distributors customer base personnel certifications news release contact gas sensors the opticalnose onose™ technology optical spectroscopy is one of the most powerful methods for quantitatively analyzing the composition of gas mixtures including at trace levels this is due to the fact that the vast majority of polyatomic molecules exhibit distinct optical absorption features in the midwave and longvawe infrared mwir and lwir respectively spectral regions probing these features with tunable lasers allows simultaneous quantitative measurement of the composition of multiple gases even if their absorption features overlap pranalytica stands in a unique position among gas sensing companies as a pioneer in both novel methods and algorithms for gas sensing and in gamechanging spectroscopic light sources pranalyticas unique patented algorithms for quantitative measurement of constituent gases in a mixture with overlapping absorption features have originally been developed with funding from drapa subsequently pranalyticas unique method for quantifying gas sensor performance in the presence of interfering species has become a defacto method of chemical sensor evaluation in parallel pranalytica successfully leveraged its position as the world leader in commercial high performance mwir and lwir quantum cascade lasers qcls to create high performance spectroscopic laser sources combining its unique laser and sensing technologies has allowed pranalytica to field gas sensing instruments of unparalleled performance our instruments are characterized for their very high sensitivity typically parts per billion – ppb – or better combined with excellent immunity to interference from other gases that plague many competing sensors our sensors based on our unique suite of opticalnose onose™ technology have found acceptance in a wide range of applications in the industrial arena our sensors continuously and autonomously monitor technological processes in semiconductor fab lines or trace gas contamination with subppb precision facilitating yield improvements and costeffective process control in the environmental sciences our sensors monitor gaseous precursors to smog enabling better understanding of pollution control and mitigation in medicine pranalyticas sensors analyze human breath to monitor kidney dialysis to detect early onset of a dangerous pregnancy complication preeclampsia and other applications in the security landscape our sensors provide monitoring safeguards against chemical warfare agents explosives and toxic industrial chemicals pranalytica has recently expanded its sensing technology to remote detection of explosives via optical spectroscopy allowing their reliable identification at safe distances combining unmatched gas sensing expertise with worldleading spectroscopic laser sources pranalytica has the track record to successfully tackle the most difficult gas sensing problems allowing its customers to solve problems that may be intractable by any other means figure  schematic of the optical nose technology platform onose™ since the onose technology is based on a platform concept the carbon dioxide laser can be replaced with a carbon monoxide laser  a spinflip raman laser  or a tunable semiconductor laser with or without obtaining power boost from an optical amplifier such as a fiber amplifier  this flexibility will permit in the future virtually limitless options for measurement of any trace gas species  specifically a combination of the co and a co laser based instrumentation was shown to detect ppb levels of ammonia benzene butadiene butene ethylene methanol nitric oxide nitrogen dioxide propylene trichloroethylene and hcn  the onose technology is the engine of the nephrolux™ that measures ppb level ammonia in expired human breath in presence of large number of other interfering species including  carbon dioxide  water vapor and more that  volatile organic compounds this instrument is user friendly and has been deployed in uclas kidney dialysis center and in the obgyn center in the olive view medical clinic in sylmar ca where they are used exclusively by physicians and nurse practitioners to collect clinical data on kidney dialysis patients and potential preeclampsia patients the onose technology is also the engine in the nitrolux™ that is designed to measure subppb levels of ammonia in semiconductor industry clean rooms and ambient air monitoring because at ppb and subppb levels the absorption caused by the gaseous species being detected is very small a number of optoacoustic cells can be inserted in the path of the optical beam such optical multiplexing allows monitoring of multiple streams of gases simultaneously in the industrial environment  references
