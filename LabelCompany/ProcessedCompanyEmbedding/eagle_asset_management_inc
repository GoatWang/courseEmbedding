portal fixed income fixedincome securities have proven over time to be a critical part of wellallocated portfolios because it is important to have assets that arent correlated to stockmarket investments bond investing has become increasingly challenging over the years and we believe that an actively managed fixedincome portfolio  either through a separately managed account or a mutual fund  may make sense for longterm investors to that end eagle has employed an experienced team of bond managers analysts and traders to help investors meet their longterm financial goals we offer a wide range of both taxable and taxadvantaged programs  all of which share our focus on fundamental research  we invite you to consider  click the charts below to learn more taxable taxadvantaged risk information risks associated with fixed income investing many investors consider bonds to be “risk free” investment vehicles historically bonds have indeed provided less volatility and less risk of loss of capital than has equity investing however there are many factors that may affect the risk and return profile of a fixedincome portfolio the two most prominent factors are interestrate movements and the creditworthiness of the bond issuer bonds issued by the us government have significantly less risk of default than those issued by corporations and municipalities however the overall return on government bonds tends to be less than these other types of fixedincome securities investors should pay careful attention to the types of fixedincome securities that comprise their portfolio and remember that as with all investments there is the risk of the loss of capital not every investment opportunity will meet all of the stringent investment criteria mentioned to the same degree tradeoffs must be made which is where experience and judgment play a key role accounts are invested at the discretion of the portfolio manager and may take up to  days to become fully invested be sure
