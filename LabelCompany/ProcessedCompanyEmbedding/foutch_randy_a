good day ladies and gentlemen and welcome to laredo petroleum incorporated first quarter  earnings conference call my name is chanel and i will be your operator for today at this time all participants are in a listenonly mode we will be conducting a questionandanswer session after the financial and operational reports as a reminder this conference is being recorded for replay purposes it is now my pleasure to introduce mr ron hagood director of investor relations you may proceed sir ronald hagood thank you and good morning joining me today are randy foutch chairman and chief executive officer rick buterbaugh executive vice president and chief financial officer dan schooley senior vice president operations james courtier vice president exploration and geosciences technology as well as other additional members of our management team before we begin this morning let me remind you that during today’s call we’ll be making forwardlooking statements these statements including those describing our beliefs goals expectations forecasts and assumptions are intended to be covered by the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  the company’s actual results may differ from these forwardlooking statements for a variety of reasons many of which are beyond our control in addition we’ll be making reference to adjusted net income and adjusted ebitda which are nongaap financial measures reconciliations of gaap net income to these nongaap financial measures are included in yesterday’s news release yesterday afternoon the company issued a news release and presentation detailing its financial and operating results for first quarter of  if you do not have a copy of this news release or presentation you may access it on the company’s website at wwwlaredopetrocom i will now turn the call over to randy foutch chairman and chief executive officer randy foutch thanks ron and good morning everyone thank you for joining laredo’s first quarter  earnings conference call in the first quarter the company again fired on all cylinders our wells continue to outperform our type curves and we maintained our already low capital and operating cost we demonstrated our operational strengths as we put a nine well package on production but three wells with planned lateral lengths exceed  feet in fact these were the longest drilled laterals ever existed in the basin company is executing as we have said it would and we believe there is upside from here we are continually driving more value from our continuous acreage base our technology and our infrastructure that key to the value creation we’re achieving is our continuous acreage position this drives our ability to drill return enhancing long laterals our ability to utilize our production corridors to lower operational capital cost and direct our strategy to high density development across our acreage all of this is facilitated by our ability to analyze large amounts of data to accelerate learning and formulate best practices our inhouse technology development enables identification and quantification of discrete production drivers this has now progressed to advanced reservoir fraction modeling that when incorporated into our technology workflows is expected to increase the value of our acreage through the high density development of each drilling spacing unit laredo is extremely wellsituated to expedite value creation of our high quality inventory with no debt due for approximately five years substantive oil and natural gas hedges in  manageable leveraged ratios and liquidity of more than  million we’re positioned to develop and execute the optimal longterm plan for our asset i would now like to turn it over to james to further elaborate on our technology and testing james courtier thank you randy we remained focused on maximizing value from our midland basin assets in the most capital efficient manner through applying stateoftheart technology to assist in this regard laredo has continued to evolve its proprietary earth model workflows to the next level to make the best decisions on vertical and horizontal spacing and completion design laredo’s earth model was originally developed to assess the impact of geology on the horizontal well production directing optimal landing point selection from both our trajectories we have refined the data analytics and geocellular modeling elements of our earth model workflows to develop corporate competencies in multivariate analytics and high resolution three dimensional reservoir and completion modeling laredo’s extensive highquality dataset has proved a vital element in this endeavor providing an assessment of the individual impact of geologic completion and well design variables on horizontal well production this process has enabled laredo to fully leverage its contiguous acreage base to support drilling extended lateral lengths from  feet to more than  feet today which we believe will provide superior economic returns sophisticated data driven models have assisted in understanding how production is affecting specifically due to horizontal and vertical well spacing minimizing parentchild impact and deriving the maximum value from each drilling spacing unit this led to a current development strategy of completing large packages of wells simultaneously wherever possible they were in the process of further refining our development plan by investing multiple landing points within individual formations increased proper concentrations sites perforation cluster spacing along with other proprietary techniques and their relative effects on well spacing confirming hydraulic fracture simulation modeling on high resolution three dimensional geo models provides benefits of assessing a wide array of completion designs within various well spacing configurations to develop an optimal design before conducting field trials we have validated our fraction simulation models with microseismic data rate trends and analysis and well performance confirming tighter perforation cluster spacing and more sand are resulting in increased propped surface area greater near wellbore fracture complexity and overall tighter and more consistent hydraulic fracture geometries around the wellbore we believe applying these spacing and completion workflows will increase the value of each spacing unit as it optimizes well density and total resource recovery this becomes increasingly important as commodity price and service cost environments change while result in spacing and completion designs may differ in order to achieve the highest value we will be testing this concept with a six well spacing test that will spud during the second quarter five of the wells will target both the upper and middle wolfcamp with chevron patent to test the codevelopment concept to several landing points in stacked formations additionally recent core analysis has reconfirmed the potential of the lower wolfcamp which will comprise the sixth well in this test we expect to see initial results from this test around the end of this year i will now pass over to dan for an operational update daniel schooley thank you james and good morning laredo continue to demonstrate its operation excellence during the first quarter completed drilling operations on two wells with drilled lateral lengths greater than  feet and spudded three wells planned drilled lateral lengths of approximately  feet in the first quarter we completed a ninewell package that tested various stimulation designs five wells with higher proppant concentrations and three with tighter perforation cluster spacing and we kept capital and operating costs low in the face of increased demand for services and pricing pressures during the first quarter we produced  boe per day an increase of  from the first quarter of  we completed  wells during the quarter averaging approximately  feet of completed lateral length as i mentioned nine of the wells were completed as a single package three of the wells were part of another ninewell package with the remaining six wells of the package to be second quarter completions the operational efficiencies of drilling and completing wells as packages cannot be overemphasized the savings associated with batch drilling and zipper fracs have helped offset increased service pricing in the first quarter we continue to successfully push the envelope in the drilling of long laterals according to ihs we have drilled the three longest horizontal wells in the permian basin and drilled and completed th of the  longest the three  foot plus wells were drilled in an average of  days from rig accept to rig release as noted on page  of our company presentation the economics of drilling these wells is extremely compelling especially as we see no degradation involvements with the longer laterals we continue to try and hold the line on service cost increases but as you can imagine no operator was immune from this trend while our well costs were in line with our expectations in the first quarter we began to see pricing for stimulation services increase at the end of the quarter we are reviewing our options with service providers to modify pricing based on different parameters evaluating different providers and identifying alternate means of sourcing items usually purchased from the service providers the company has not increased its budget and well cost assumptions at this time but continues to review our assumptions based on actual well look backs on which we evaluate the economics of wells we approve for development for the second quarter of  we expect to complete approximately  wells approximately  of the completions are expected to be divided between the upper and middle wolfcamp with four wells expected to be in the cline well completions are expected to be relatively evenly distributed throughout the quarter laredo continues to recognize outsized benefits relative to its capital investment in its field infrastructure and production corridors during the first quarter we gathered on pipe  of our total flowback in produced water producing a benefit of approximately  million additionally  of flowback in produced water was sent to lms water treatment facility which in conjunction with utilizing recycled water and completions produced a benefit of approximately  million these benefits are expected to grow  million by the fourth quarter of  as additional wells are developed along production corridors and volumes handled by our water system increase with these new wells the other main driver of infrastructure benefits is lms’s crude oil gathering system the system gathered  of laredo’s total gross operating production during the first quarter producing a benefit of approximately  million like the water system as wells are developed along production corridors volumes gathered by the system will increase we expect gathered volumes to increase approximately  by fourth quarter of  increasing the benefit to laredo to approximately  million during the fourth quarter of  the medallionmidland basin system in which we own  interest continued to grow as activity in the basin accelerated first quarter  volumes grew at approximately  barrels of oil per day an increase of  from the first quarter of  an increase of  from the fourth quarter of  volumes on the system are expected to grow to an average daily of  barrels of oil per day in the second quarter of  with that i will turn the call over to rick richard buterbaugh thank you dan and good morning as you saw in last night’s earnings release laredo’s first quarter  production and unit cost were in line with our expectations and the quarterly guidance that we’ve previously provided production volumes were slightly under the range midpoint reflecting the timing of production as large well packages came online and slightly longer cycle times associated with some of the testing activities that james and dan discussed keep in mind that increased volumes associated with the fourth horizontal rig that was recently added will begin having a meaningful production impact during the second quarter we have reiterated our second quarter guidance range of  to  barrels of oil equivalent per day and remain on track with our original production guidance for the first half of  we continue to expect full year production growth to exceed  our ongoing focus on cost control continue to show benefits as unit cost both cash and total each tracked at or below the low end of our guidance range we have further reduced our unit cost estimates for the second quarter as detailed in the guidance reflected in yesterday’s earnings release adjusted ebitda for the first quarter of  increased  million from the prior year quarter to  million this is up slightly from the fourth quarter of  after adjusting for the  million reduction in cash settlements received from derivatives net of premiums paid we continue to maintain an active hedging program to protect our cash obligations for debt service employee costs and maintain a reasonable capital program to accomplish this we consistently review our current hedge position and regularly add to it through the use of puts collars and swaps details of our strong hedge position are shown on pages  and  of the corporate presentation that was furnished last night and available on our website please note that we have recently added  mmbtu per day of natural gas hedges for  one item to keep in mind about our natural gas hedges is that they are all priced at waha therefore our  natural gas hedges which have a weighted average floor price of  per mmbtu at waha are equivalent to approximately  per mmbtu at henry hub based on recent basis differentials during the first quarter cash flow from operating activities coupled with the proceeds from the small acreage sale previously announced more than funded the approximate  million invested in development activities during the quarter included in this amount is the additional cost for testing of the five wells in which we used higher proppant concentrations and the additional cost of testing tighter full cluster spacing also included in this amount is increased activity associated with the addition of a fourth rig at the end of the quarter we had ongoing activities occurring on  wells and another six wells waiting on completion in the second quarter we expect production and cost incurred figures to be more aligned as we fully integrate the fourth rig into our drilling program as dan mentioned we are seeing potential upward pressure on service costs currently we expect to fully execute our  program within the previously announced  million budget although sustained increase in cost could change this expectation as james mentioned we continue to test multiple completion methods should any of these be fully in the remainder of  program budget assumptions may also need to be adjusted earlier this week we completed an amendment to our senior secured credit facility this facility now has a borrowing base of  billion up from  million previously with a maturity extended to  we currently have  million drawn on this facility resulting in approximately  million of liquidity including cash on hand as with the previous facility our interest in the medallionmidland basin system is not pledged as collateral additionally this week the  million face amount of our seven   notes became callable which when coupled with a  million of   notes that are also callable today totals  million of optionalities surrounding our longterm debt we believe the combination of our substantial liquidity and ability to call more than  of our longterm debt provides significant financial flexibility to the company this enables the company to accelerate value creation as our data guides are value enhancing development plan production growth alone does not necessarily equate to value creation as we use our data driven strategy to determine the optimal development path we expect to take a measured approach to growth that preserves efficiencies and extracts the full value of our resource operator at this time would you please open the lines for any questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of derrick whitfield of stifel your line is now open richard buterbaugh good morning eric derrick whitfield good morning randy and team there are definitely several positive updates in your powerpoint looking at page  i thought that slide was particularly impressive and wanted to ask you guys if you have a view on the baseline degradation one should expect from long lateral development and if so what factors do you attribute to your consistent well performance on a peripheral lateral basis randy foutch we’ve consistently i think said that we think – we just have so much evidence that the longer laterals are more economic and i think i’ve said in the past that we had some concern early on when we went from  to   to  and so on and so forth about the operations and the ability to stimulate that last  feet or so of the well but i think what we’re trying to show is that we’ve collected enough data now on enough long laterals that we’re pretty comfortable we’re not seeing any degradation and that’s substantively changes the economics and again our acreage base allows us to do that eric so we think all the data we’ve seen and we probably have as much or more than anybody that we’re actually able to stimulate the last thousand feet of that wellbore just like the first thousand feet derrick whitfield that’s great and then moving over to page  when i’m reading that chart the thing that i’m trying to understand is how much of the improved outperformance which is  on that chart do you attribute to your proppant intensity versus controlled flowback randy foutch the flowback is interesting to us and i may let jason talk a second about the managed flowback but our view has been fairly consistently all along that this whole focus on  rps ph was probably not warranted in the sense of we worry about ultimately are you damaging the reservoir are you pulling sand back in are you clogging up what you just tracked and i don’t know that we have a good handle on the managed flowback versus optimizations but i think it’s again those things that you’ve got to have – you need to have enough data and enough wells to test the concept and so i would think it’s probably too early on the  pound of sands to really talk we’ve got a lot more data on the pound sand jason do you want to add anything on the managed flowback jason greenwald sure good morning this is jason greenwald vice president reservoir engineering i think the only point i would add to this is that in this unconventional system we do think a lot of these design elements are interlinked so really we do think the performance – outperformance that we’re seeing here is really a combination of many of the them are managed drawdown and the proppant sectors as two examples hopefully that helped derrick whitfield it does and again we’re early in the process right now but it’s all consistently working you’re just trying to understand which of knobs is perhaps having a bigger impact than the other randy foutch well as you know we’ve been slow to claim credit we’ve seen – we’ve seen many a time in my career where one or two really good wells and you relied on that data and conversely some that didn’t work we think that you need a substantive database a lot of analytical and we’re coming more and more comfortable with our multivariant and best practices approach of this so for us it’s a progression when you have the volume of rock that we have that’s capable of producing oil we want to make sure that we don’t do anything that we come back to regret in terms of claiming credit but we’re showing you real numbers some it’s working derrick whitfield it is and randy my last question for you guys is on page  with that pilot can you comment on what you’re attempting to test with the uppermost number and the top right and then the lowermost number on the bottom left and the reason i asked the question is because they don’t appear to be that close in proximity to the other wells so it seems like there’s something else you’re doing with that design that you’re testing randy foutch i’ll probably let james comment some on that but what are – what we’ve said for sometime is that the industry in general has spaced wells too closely time after time after time going back the s and the austin chalk and even going back further than that what we said at laredo was that if we – if we didn’t space closely we still had lots of inventory to drill and what we’re saying now is that we’re actively getting the data and the testing that we need to figure out the spacing we’ve talked about it several times that we have for example in the upper wolfcamp two or three different landing points in the middle we’ve got two or three so what we’re really trying to do is figure out optimal npv spacing and if we can do that right we dramatically increase the inventory of locations and dramatically increase the npv of this volume of rock that we have james james courtier so yes i’d just add to that but in the upper wolfcamp and the middle wolfcamp we’ve got about three separate landing points in both of those zones where we’ve drilled wells previously successfully so they’re being very good wells so what we’re attempting to do here is to combine multiple landing points at the same time with a codevelopment strategy so what we’re showing is six different zones in the upper and the middle wolfcamp those zones aren’t necessarily present everywhere but in this particular test we’re testing three zones – three landing points in the upper wolfcamp and one in the middle wolfcamp together randy foutch your question about the lower wolfcamp is we’ve drilled the lower wolfcamp on our acreage it was preearth model relatively short laterals and probably nowhere near as good completions as we would do on them today and as you know there are some lower wolfcamp news coming out a little deeper in the basin that’s pretty spectacular so i think it’s – we have multiple targets that at some point we’ve got to go look at we’ve talked about this before some of our better wells are cline cline’s a good one to drill because it gets all the depths held mostly so i think over time we’re going to continue to look at lower wolfcamp continue to look at cline which dan talked about at some point we’d say that we need to go look at spraberry but the real excitement for us today is if we can figure out and prove up the concept of having multiple landing zones spaced fairly close together in the upper and middle wolfcamp derrick whitfield very helpful and good update guys randy foutch thank you eric operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of james spicer of wells fargo your line is now open james spicer hi good morning you’ve talked about your bonds being callable i think you’re mentioning that from the context of a refinancing as opposed to taking those out and actually reducing your total debt amount maybe you could just clarify that and then more generally talk about the priorities right now with respect to the balance sheet randy foutch rick do you want to… richard buterbaugh yes as we mentioned during the call  million of notes are callable today so that gives us significant optionality and flexibility of what we may do with our balance sheet it is not meant to give any indication of what we do or may or may not do going forward but we do have that option we’re seeing very positive results from our drilling program the liquidity that we have the flexibility around those bonds gives us a significant amount of optionality of how we go about further acceleration of the development of the properties james spicer okay that’s helpful and then i was also wondering one recurring topic that i know people discuss here is a potential monetization of your interest in medallion can you just share your latest thoughts on – thoughts on that randy foutch our latest thoughts are basically the same thing we’ve been saying for a year or so last quarter went into a little more detail on talking about medallion dan mentioned the – what we consider a fairly rapid expansion in the ebitda in the barrels going through medallion we think that probably translates at some point into an overall value for the system but i think our view is that if the more people drill in the midland basin the more crude probably goes through medallion so i think there’ll be a correct time for us to make a decision but we do think the value creation whether we ultimately monetize it or whether we keep the ebitda or whatever we do there’s a number of choices we think that value creation and the possible barrels going through and the ebitda growth are all moving in the right direction pretty fast james spicer okay appreciate that and then one more just last housekeeping item if i could you have a  million proceeds from dispositions in your cash flow statement what is that related to richard buterbaugh that’s the sale of a small piece of acreage that we had on the northern portion of our property that we have previously announced that sale wasn’t affected with drilling completed in early january and we had a minimal amount of production but when you’re looking at the comparison of first quarter versus prior quarters there’s several hundred barrels a day of production associated with that acreage james spicer okay got it thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of kashy harrison of simmons piper jaffray your line is now open kashy harrison good morning everyone randy foutch good morning kashy harrison so with respect to drilling longer laterals at what point do you think you would completely transition to a program or transition to a program where you primarily employed  foot or  foot laterals as opposed to your average for next quarter which is about  randy foutch that’s a good question i think our view is that we’re recognizing the longer values – the longer laterals do have greater economic value to us and what we’ve done is we’ve set out on this process of really trying to figure out the appropriate spacing and what landing zone we can do in the upper and the middle and what we’ve chosen to do is to not vary too many variables at one time a lot of our acreage supports longer laterals i think once we understand the spacing both vertically and horizontally we’ll be looking at drilling more of the longer laterals then we’re doing this year kashy harrison got it and then just a quick followup on the pound completions about how many  about how much data – how many days of data do you think you would need before you could definitively say whether it’s adding economic value or not randy foutch we’ve seen even in acreage surrounding us but also throughout my career where early data was positive and ultimately that whatever we were testing proved not to be economic  days of good production above your type curve is meaningful but so many times we’ve seen things that revert back to the mean after some months and the volume above the type curve when you integrate it didn’t pay out the additional cost so i think for us we’re a little bit different there as i said earlier we’re not going to claim credit based upon four or five good wells over two or three months i think we’re going to want to see a substantive number of wells and a substantive production history being a year or so it just doesn’t – the early data are sometimes pretty indicative but they’re also – you just need to see substantive production data to really call it good and one point i’ll point out on that  pound slide is that those are also managed drawdown so we’re keeping kind of a little bit of a gap on the first month or two or three of production so what you’re seeing is really exciting but we kind of have this constant evaluation process and for us we’re going to see – we’re going to want to see substantive production history on a number of wells richard buterbaugh the only thing i’d add to that that gives you the performance of those enhanced completions but they’re going to be looked at and reviewed from an economic standpoint based upon commodity prices as well as service costs and so that is an ongoing process with every well as we go about designing their completion for that so we do not expect to ever get to a specific standard design that you’re going to march across the acreage with it needs to be looked at individually from an economic return standpoint randy foutch to reexplain we drilled over  now horizontal wells i’m not sure exactly how many but we’re on version  plus of our completion design we are using all of our data to pick that landing point then we drill the well we look at the data we get from drilling the well after it’s drilled and then we kind of custom fit that completion design to what we see in that wellbore i think that continues forever around here kashy harrison got it thank you thanks for the time randy foutch thank you operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of chris stevens of keybanc your line is now open randy foutch good morning chris stevens good morning guys i just wanted to followup on a couple other previous questions out there i guess in regard to the longer laterals and the  footers how much – how many of those do you have in your inventory i mean could you drill   foot laterals going forward or is it a limited portion of the inventory randy foutch when you look at our inventory it’s pretty blocked up and the facts are i think that we’ve got several years of drilling at  foot but we get more inventory at  more inventory at  i think the message is that we’ve got a lot of options that we’re doing there that make us think that the longer laterals are better so we – we’d like that and i think as we get better handles on our spacing we’ll be drilling a lot more longer laterals and the – what’s happening i think and i was struggling how to best point this out is that the land grabs over i think to a significant deal and i think you can see that people are starting to really recognize the value of longer laterals and so i think there’s going to be more effort put on people getting together and doing land trades land swaps or land sales or whatever to drill those longer laterals the important thing to us is that we’re not seeing any degradation so when we get there it’s going to be extremely economical to drill the interesting thing also on that i think which is we’ve talked about it a lot in the past is it takes a lot of infrastructure especially water but also handling the flush production coming back to drill longer laterals if you’re drilling  foot one off wells then you don’t need as much infrastructure we’ve got the infrastructure in place and we’ve proven that we can handle the water needs with our infield infrastructure and the medallion system we’ve proven that we can handle the flushed oil production coming back same thing with our wet gas going out so the corridors the blocked up acreage our water handling facilities all make us comfortable that we’re going to be drilling longer laterals for some time to come it’s a longwinded answer but hopefully chris it helped out chris stevens yes got it and then on slide  the codevelopment of the landing points it definitely looks like there’s a lot of potential upside to the inventory for all these different landing points what’s the implied spacing here of this specific test and what the potential upside would be to your inventory just from this specific pilot that you’re doing out here randy foutch yes there’s some – there is some risk on that slide but a couple of points i’ll make and then i’ll see if someone else wants to turn in here but we’ve tested each one of those zones individually so we know that for example the three zones in the upper and the two in the middle or three in the middle will produce as a standalone horizontal well so what we’re really trying to do is see if we can effectively double down and it has a huge impact on inventory and the overall npv of the company james do you want or some jason you want jason greenwald yes no i can chip in here so we do have a number of tests across our acreage position testing spacing and then a chevron configuration like what we’ve displayed on slide  in terms of what’s the kind of equivalent spacing across those tests it’s really kind of  feet to  feet kind of between two landing zones kind of per formation and this is almost always a chevron configuration and so specifically on slide  what we’re testing here in the upper wolfcamp is really  wells per section with an upside to  wells per section across these four landing zones chris stevens okay  just in the upper wolfcamp or upper or middle jason greenwald that’s across both chris stevens okay okay got it i appreciate the color guys thanks a lot randy foutch thanks chris operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of dan mcspirit of bmo capital markets your line is now open randy foutch good morning dan dan mcspirit thank you good morning folks just to clarify what percentage of acreage can accommodate wells with lateral lengths of  feet or greater randy foutch we were asked that question a little earlier i think the answer is blocked up acreage – i’m not going to give you the number but the blockedup acreage our infrastructure our ability to handle water give us some confidence that we’re going to drill longer laterals and whether that’s  or  or  we’ll have to see there is some – there are some areas to where one or two small acreage additions to us would open that up some but it’s clearly something that we’re pretty excited about it’s – currently it’s in some of our zones it’s – it’s years of inventory so i think – i don’t think we’re going to run out and drill only  foot laterals we were drilling foot laterals and having to normalize our information down to a  foot length many others we’re having to normalize up and i think there’s a little bit of a viewpoint that for example in the cline and lower wolfcamp where we have less drilling that might well lend itself very very amenably to the longer laterals so that i’m not giving you a number i know that but i think that answer’s in progress dan mcspirit okay okay that’s great and as a followup to that just to clarify for my own understanding here what you identify as the lower wolfcamp is the same as what others identify as say the wolfcamp c is that correct randy foutch yes i think you probably ought to own dan mcspirit okay randy foutch i think it’s kind of directionally correct but we started off that nomenclature from the railroad commission years ago it never changed dan mcspirit got it okay and appreciating that you have drilled some i guess from preearth model lower wolfcamp wells how does the product mix on those wells differ from say the upper wolfcamp if at all randy foutch the lower wolfcamp we drilled i don’t think we drilled in any several years so they were kind of early in the game stuff and i think in some ways kind of like some of our early cline and the results were kind of scattered there are some of those that we don’t like there is some that are pretty decent but i think the message is not to oversimplify it but we’ve got – we now know what we’ve been saying for several years and we’ve proved it again we’ve got    foot thick section of rock that we know unequivocally is capable of production so it’s a question of how do we best get that economically developed for the best npv for the company dan mcspirit got it wonderful thank you and have a great day randy foutch thanks dan operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of stephen thomas of brenham capital your line is now open stephen thomas hi guys thanks for taking my question good quarter i just had a quick question on medallion and the throughput volumes that you guided to for q is it fair for us to assume that in that  to  growth sequentially for the rest of this year richard buterbaugh i think what we – i think dan you can help me out here but i think on page  or was it  whatever  we gave you what we thought the ebitda growth was going to be for the year in page  in the presentation and that we think that kind of growth is kind of where we view going forward we’re not making a lot of projections but i think it’s dependent upon the speed in which thirdparty people drill in the midland basin and under acreage at one way or another puts that throughput through medallion so if you look at that growth in thirdparty volumes going through there we like that growth and i think our view is that whatever percentage that continues we think it is up and to the right stephen thomas okay thank you richard buterbaugh thank you stephen thomas okay and then my followup question given some of the recent transactions of systems pretty close to medallion and the multiples that those parties have received and just the ebitda growth that your system is projecting and the eventual throughput it seems like on our math the valuation is over  billion net to laredo you’d think that that would be a nice positive catalyst for the stock and certainly your balance sheet could use an inflow of  billion is the apprehension to really pursue a process or really discussed details are on the process is that more to do with the fact that your private equity partners the majority owner of this system and they’re really the ones at liberty to discuss a process or is there just something else there that we might be missing randy foutch one of the things that we’ve said before and is that we like – the medallion system gave us the operational things that we require we pay for firm transportation out of the basins such that if a basin differential blows out again like it did a couple of years ago we can take our crude to the gulf it allows us not to have to truck very much of our oil so those things that we’ve captured we keep whether we own medallion or not we’ve also said that we’ve made the investment in medallion and it’s turned around now to where the ebitda coming off medallion is such that we could reinvest that ebitda into a very very high rate of return drilling location so we think we have a lot of optionality with medallion and there will be a time in which we’ll make a decision on what to do it with it but i’m excited about the future growth of medallion stephen thomas all right guys thanks a lot richard buterbaugh the only thing i’d add to that chris is – excuse me steve is that we do carry probably a little more debt than some of our peers however that debt is extremely manageable none of it’s due prior to  we are very well hedged so one of our core competencies we believe in purposes of our hedging program is to make sure that we always have our debt service or ga and a reasonable capital program cover so we are very comfortable with the debt that we have but also we have significant optionality around that as we discussed earlier in that  of that longterm debt we’re actually about  of that longterm note is callable and we have a meaningful amount of liquidity that gives us we believe significant flexibility to do what we think is best for our shareholders in maximizing the value of the company stephen thomas great thank you guys operator thank you and i’m showing no further questions at this time i would now like to turn the call over to mr ron hagood for closing remarks ronald hagood thank you for joining us for our first quarter update this concludes our call and have a good morning

oklahoma independent petroleum association’s wildcatters luncheon at tulsa country club courtesy ceo randy foutch talks laredo petroleums strategy at wildcatter luncheon by casey smith tulsa world nov    laredo petroleum chairman and ceo randy foutch speaks wednesday at the oklahoma independent petroleum association’s wildcatters luncheon at tulsa country club courtesy chairman and ceo randy foutch has a handful of core tenets that have guided him and laredo petroleum’s senior management team in creating value for stakeholders of the tulsabased exploration and production companyone he said always hedge to protect anticipated cash flow“we always try to hedge our product” foutch said “we want to make sure that we can always pay debt and always make sure that we can pay salary if you can pay debt and you can pay salary you can always take hard knocks”foutch said laredo typically tries to hedge in threeyear contracts so that any shortterm movement in oil prices doesn’t affect the company’s ability to perform current contracts mean that oil would have to be above  per barrel for the company to lose out he saidfoutch made his remarks as part of “wildcatter wednesday” a luncheon that the oklahoma independent petroleum association hosts to provide a forum for its membership to hear from oil and natural gas industry leaders as well as state and federal politicians the monthly events alternate between oklahoma city and tulsa wednesday’s event was held at the tulsa country cluboipa is an advocacy group made up of more than  members working in exploration and production or affiliated businesses for the crude oil and and natural gas industries the organization focuses on legislation regulation and industry affairslaredo petroleum’s focus is the permian basin during the third quarter ending sept  laredo produced a company record  barrels of oil equivalent per day and increased anticipated production growth for fullyear  to approximately  percentduring the same threemonth period laredo completed  horizontal development wells and reduced unit lease operating expenses to  per barrel of oil equivalent down approximately  percent from the thirdquarter  rate of efficiency foutch said requires longterm planning in addition to hedging laredo’s plans for success consist of putting together a contiguous acreage position and having a plan to hold acreage by production strong data collection and analysis infrastructure investments and maintaining liquidity and balance sheet flexibility“we feel like data is critical — better data makes better decisions and that’s been core to all of our companies” foutch said referring to laredo and the three companies that he previously founded and sold — latigo petroleum lariat petroleum and colt resourcesfoutch said that when laredo petroleum first went public in  the company was criticized by some for putting so much money into data collection and on building infrastructure but it is clear now that those
