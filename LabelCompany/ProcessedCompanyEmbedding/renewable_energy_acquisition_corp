 if the minimum number of units is sold and  if the maximum number of units is sold of net proceeds will be placed in a trust fund maintained by associated bank na minneapolis minnesota as trustee the proceeds will not be released from the trust fund until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation the proceeds held in the trust fund may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business combination any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions as determined by our board of directors at that time craig laughlin an officer and director is providing office space secretarial support and related administrative services through his whollyowned company src funding inc at a monthly rate of  we estimate legal and accounting fees associated with filing our periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission over the next two years will be approximately  this amount does include additional legal accounting or other professional fees that we may incur in connection with evaluating a prospective business combination transfer agent and registrar fees over the next two years are estimated at  and the estimated premium payment on our director and officer insurance during that period is estimated at between  and  we intend to use the excess working capital between approximately  if the minimum is sold and approximately  if the maximum is sold for due diligence legal accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations which may include compensation to our directors engaged as consultants to perform specific services in connection with a business combination as well as for reimbursement of any outofpocket expenses incurred by our officers and directors in connection with the search for and evaluation of prospective business combinations we believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs to the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination the proceeds held in the trust fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the operations of the target business the net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not immediately required for the purposes set forth above will only be invested in united states government securities defined as any treasury bill issued by the united states having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the investment company act the interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations including associated professional fees until a business combination is completed we believe that upon consummation of this offering we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next  months assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that time a public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund including interest earned on its portion of the trust fund only in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate in no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust fund in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business we expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates many of these competitors possess greater technical human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors while we believe there are numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with the net proceeds of this offering our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business further · our obligation to seek stockholder approval of a business combination may delay the completion of a transaction · our obligation to convert into cash shares of common stock held by our public stockholders in certain instances may reduce the resources available to us for a business combination and · our outstanding warrants and the future dilution they potentially represent may not be viewed favorably by certain target businesses any of these obligations may place us at a competitive disadvantage in successfully negotiating a business combination our management believes however that our status as a public entity and potential access to the united states public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privatelyheld entities having a similar business objective as us in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms if we succeed in effecting a business combination there will be in all likelihood intense competition from competitors of the target business in the renewable energy and environmental industries and their related infrastructures and elsewhere such a business combination may also be subject to regulatory approval there is substantial competition in all aspects and segments of our industry focus numerous companies most of which have substantially greater financial resources available to them than we do are already engaged in the industry segments we intend to focus on we cannot assure you that subsequent to a business combination we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively company description we are a blank check company organized under the laws of the state of nevada on june   we were formed to effect a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an operating business in either the renewable energy industry or the environmental industry and their related infrastructures to date our efforts have been limited to organizational activities the renewable energy industry and its related infrastructure generally includes the production generation transmission and distribution of electricity heat fuel and other consumable forms of energy through the utilization of renewable fuel sources such as geothermal biofuels biomass wind fuel cells ocean waves solar and waste stream pyrolysis to mention a few and the infrastructure needed to maintain and operate the facilities services and installations used in the foregoing areas although we may consider a target business in any segment of the renewable energy industry we currently intend to concentrate our search for an acquisition candidate on companies in the following areas · wind electric generation distribution and transmission · solar power · cogeneration · biomass · synthetic gas production distribution and transmission · energy efficiency and energy conservation related products and services · alternative transportation technologies · steam generation and distribution · energy storage technologies · other alternative and renewable energy technologies and · the development installation or manufacturing of any of the above the environmental industry and its related infrastructure generally includes the technologies and services that protect the natural and human environment from destruction and pollution and the infrastructure needed to maintain and operate the facilities services and installations used in the foregoing areas the environmental industry also seeks to ameliorate the negative effects of industrial production and unhealthy practices and materials on our population as a whole landfill closures and the difficulty of positioning new facilities in certain parts of the country have required that waste be transported long distances for environmentally sound disposal new landfills require additional remediation measures to ensure that waste does not contaminate the surrounding ground or nearby water supplies new technologies and expenditures are increasingly required with respect to air emissions and water cleanup as pollution from power and industrial plants merit increasing examination and concern searches for new energy and water sources must meet stringent environmental standards while existing and alternative forms of energy that are being used developed and tested must adhere to an expanding body of practices and procedures to ensure that our environment is protected although we may consider a target business in any segment of the environmental industry we currently intend to concentrate our search for an acquisition candidate on companies in the following areas · waste management and disposal including wastewater treatment and management and sewage control · air treatment and ionization pollution and emission control · abatement and sequestration of carbon dioxide and other global warming gases · other energyenvironmental related technologies and · the infrastructure necessary to operate in the environmental industry including but not limited to areas such as the operation of water supply facilities waste and wastewater treatment facilities pollution control facilities and transportation facilities and the production transportation or distribution of the equipment and products incidental to such operations although we believe there are many positive trends that make acquisition candidates in both the renewable energy and environmental industries attractive there are various risks of acquiring a business in such industries including substantial government regulation depending on the industry segment we ultimately operate in we may be required to spend substantial amounts of time and money in complying with such governmental regulations while we may seek to effect business combinations with more than one target business our initial business combination must be with a target business whose fair market value is at least equal to  of our net assets at the time of such acquisition consequently it is likely that we will have the ability to effect only a single business

certified public accountants the accompanying notes are an integral part of these financial statements            renewable energy acquisition corp a development stage company notes to financial statements march   and december       note a  background and description of business   renewable energy acquisition corp company was incorporated on june   under the laws of the state of nevada   the company was formed to effect a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an operating business in either the renewable energy or the environmental industry and their related infrastructures  to date our efforts have been limited to organizational activities  as the company has had no substantial operations or substantial assets since inception the company is considered in the development stage     note b  preparation of financial statements   the company follows the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and has elected a yearend of december    the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  actual results could differ from those estimates   management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud  the company’s system of internal accounting control is designed to assure among other items that  recorded transactions are valid  valid transactions are recorded and  transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the company for the respective periods being presented   during interim periods the company follows the accounting policies set forth in its audited financial statements filed with the u s securities and exchange commission in its general form for registration of securities pursuant to section b or g of the securities exchange act of  on form  containing the company’s financial statements for the years ended december    and  respectively  the information presented within these interim financial statements may not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles and the users of financial information provided for interim periods should refer to the annual financial information and footnotes when reviewing the interim financial results presented herein   in the opinion of management the accompanying interim financial statements prepared in accordance with the u s securities and exchange commission’s instructions for form q are unaudited and contain all material adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the company for the respective interim periods presented  the current period results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results which ultimately will be reported for the full fiscal year ending december       note c  going concern uncertainty   the company was formed to effect a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an operating business in either the renewable energy or the environmental industry and their related infrastructures  to date the company’s efforts have been limited to organizational activities  as the company has had no substantial operations or substantial assets since inception the company is considered in the development stage  there is no assurance that the company will be able to successful in the implementation of this business plan            renewable energy acquisition corp a development stage company notes to financial statements  continued march   and december       note c  going concern uncertainty  continued   the company has no operating history limited cash on hand no assets and has a business plan with inherent risk  because of these factors the company’s auditors have issued an audit opinion on the company’s financial statements which includes a statement describing our going concern status  this means in the auditor’s opinion substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern exists at the date of their opinion   the company’s current management anticipates that the initial capitalization will be sufficient to maintain the corporate status of the company for the immediate future  because of the companys lack of operating assets the company’s continuance may become fully dependent upon either future sales of securities andor advances or loans from significant stockholders or corporate officers to provide sufficient working capital to preserve the integrity of the corporate entity during the development phase  in the event that working capital sufficient to maintain the corporate entity and implement our business plan is not available the company’s existing controlling stockholders intend to maintain the corporate status of the company and provide all necessary working capital support on the companys behalf  however no formal commitments or arrangements to advance or loan funds to the company or repay any such advances or loans exist  there is no legal obligation for either management or existing controlling stockholders to provide additional future funding further the company is at the mercy of future economic trends and business operations for the company’s existing controlling stockholders to have the resources available to support the company   the companys continued existence is dependent upon its ability to implement its business plan generate sufficient cash flows from operations to support its daily operations and provide sufficient resources to retire existing liabilities and obligations on a timely basis  the company faces considerable risk in it’s business plan and a potential shortfall of funding due to our uncertainty to raise adequate capital in the equity securities market   the company anticipates offering future sales of equity securities  however there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional funding through the sales of additional equity securities or that such funding if available will be obtained on terms favorable to or affordable by the company   the company’s articles of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  million shares of preferred stock and  shares of common stock  the company’s ability to issue preferred stock may limit the company’s ability to obtain debt or equity financing as well as impede the implementation of the company’s business plan  the company’s ability to issue these authorized but unissued securities may also negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our debt or equity securities   in such a restricted cash flow scenario the company would be unable to complete its business plan steps and would instead delay all cash intensive activities  without necessary cash flow the company may become dormant during the next twelve months or until such time as necessary funds could be raised in the equity securities market   while the company is of the opinion that good faith estimates of the company’s ability to secure additional capital in the future to reach its goals have been made there is no guarantee that the company will receive sufficient funding to sustain operations or implement any future business plan steps     note d  summary of significant accounting policies    cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all cash on hand and in banks certificates of deposit and other highlyliquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents    organization costs   the company has adopted the provisions required by the startup activities topic of the fasb accounting standards codification whereby all costs incurred with the incorporation and organization of the company were charged to operations as incurred            renewable energy acquisition corp a development stage company notes to financial statements  continued march   and december       note d  summary of significant accounting policies  continued    income taxes   the company files income tax returns in the united states of america and various states as appropriate and applicable  the company may become subject to us federal state and local as applicable income tax examinations by regulatory taxing authorities for any period since its inception  however the company does not anticipate any examinations of returns filed since its inception   the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  at march   and december   respectively the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability accounts as recorded when material to the financial statements are entirely the result of temporary differences  temporary differences generally represent differences in the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes primarily accumulated depreciation and amortization allowance for doubtful accounts and vacation accruals   the company has adopted the provisions required by the income taxes topic of the fasb accounting standards codification  the codification topic requires the recognition of potential liabilities as a result of management’s acceptance of potentially uncertain positions for income tax treatment on a “morelikelythannot” probability of an assessment upon examination by a respective taxing authority  as a result of the implementation of codification’s income tax topic the company did not incur any liability for unrecognized tax benefits    income loss per share   basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing the net income loss available to common stockholders by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the respective period presented in our accompanying financial statements   fully diluted earnings loss per share is computed similar to basic income loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of common stock equivalents primarily outstanding options and warrants   common stock equivalents represent the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of the outstanding stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method at either the beginning of the respective period presented or the date of issuance whichever is later and only if the common stock equivalents are considered dilutive based upon the company’s net income loss position at the calculation date   as of march   and  the company had no outstanding stock warrants options or convertible securities which could be considered as dilutive for purposes of the loss per share calculation    new and pending accounting pronouncements   the company is of the opinion that any and all pending accounting pronouncements either in the adoption phase or not yet required to be adopted will not have a significant impact on the companys financial position or results of operations     note e  fair value of financial instruments   the carrying amount of cash accounts receivable accounts payable and notes payable as applicable approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these items andor the current interest rates payable in relation to current market conditions            renewable energy acquisition corp a development stage company notes to financial statements  continued march   and december       note e  fair value of financial instruments  continued   interest rate risk is the risk that the company’s earnings are subject to fluctuations in interest rates on either investments or on debt and is fully dependent upon the volatility of these rates  the company does not use derivative instruments to moderate its exposure to interest rate risk if any   financial risk is the risk that the company’s earnings are subject to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates and are fully dependent upon the volatility of these rates  the company does not use derivative instruments to moderate its exposure to financial risk if any     note f  notes payable to stockholders   in conjunction with the initial capitalization of the company the subscribing shareholders agreed that additional working capital would be needed to support the initial phases of the company’s implementation of its business plan  accordingly two controlling shareholders agreed to lend the company an aggregate  with an initial maturity of the sooner of august   or  days after the closing of an anticipated initial public offering   the notes are noninterest bearing and as such the company has recognized an aggregate of approximately  as additional paidin capital for economic event calculated at an imputed interest rate of  per annum related to the noninterest bearing feature on the aforementioned notes payable to stockholders   on september   the company paid the controlling shareholders an aggregate of  as principal repayment and the controlling shareholders converted their remaining  in debt into  shares of restricted unregistered common stock   as of march   and december   the outstanding balances on

notes are an integral part of these financial statements             renewable energy acquisition corp a development stage company notes to financial statements september   and december       note a  background and description of business   renewable energy acquisition corp company was incorporated on june   under the laws of the state of nevada   the company was formed to effect a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an operating business in either the renewable energy or the environmental industry and their related infrastructures  to date our efforts have been limited to organizational activities and seeking potential acquisition targets  as the company has had no substantial operations or substantial assets since inception the company is considered in the development stage     note b  preparation of financial statements   the company follows the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and has elected a yearend of december    the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period  actual results could differ from those estimates   management further acknowledges that it is solely responsible for adopting sound accounting practices establishing and maintaining a system of internal accounting control and preventing and detecting fraud  the company’s system of internal accounting control is designed to assure among other items that  recorded transactions are valid  valid transactions are recorded and  transactions are recorded in the proper period in a timely manner to produce financial statements which present fairly the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the company for the respective periods being presented   during interim periods the company follows the accounting policies set forth in its audited financial statements filed with the u s securities and exchange commission in its general form for registration of securities pursuant to section b or g of the securities exchange act of  on form  containing the company’s financial statements for the years ended december    and  respectively  the information presented within these interim financial statements may not include all disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles and the users of financial information provided for interim periods should refer to the annual financial information and footnotes when reviewing the interim financial results presented herein   in the opinion of management the accompanying interim financial statements prepared in accordance with the u s securities and exchange commission’s instructions for form q are unaudited and contain all material adjustments consisting only of normal recurring adjustments necessary to present fairly the financial condition results of operations and cash flows of the company for the respective interim periods presented  the current period results of operations are not necessarily indicative of results which ultimately will be reported for the full fiscal year ending december       note c  going concern uncertainty   the company was formed to effect a merger capital stock exchange asset acquisition or other similar business combination with an operating business in either the renewable energy or the environmental industry and their related infrastructures  to date the company’s efforts have been limited to organizational activities and seeking potential acquisition targets  as the company has had no substantial operations or substantial assets since inception the company is considered in the development stage  there is no assurance that the company will be able to successfully consummate an acquisition or merger with a private operating company or if successful that any acquisition or merger will result in the appreciation of our stockholders’ investment in the then outstanding common stock             renewable energy acquisition corp a development stage company notes to financial statements  continued september   and december       note c  going concern uncertainty  continued   the company has no operating history limited cash on hand no assets and a business plan with inherent risk  because of these factors the company’s auditors have issued an audit opinion on the company’s financial statements which includes a statement describing our going concern status  this means in the auditor’s opinion substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern exists at the date of their opinion   the company’s current management anticipated that the initial capitalization would be sufficient to maintain the corporate status of the company for the immediate future  however because of the companys lack of operating assets the company’s continuance may become fully dependent upon either future sales of securities andor advances or loans from significant stockholders or corporate officers to provide sufficient working capital to preserve the integrity of the corporate entity during the development phase  in the event that working capital sufficient to maintain the corporate entity and implement our business plan is not available the company’s existing controlling stockholders intend to maintain the corporate status of the company and provide all necessary working capital support on the companys behalf  however no formal commitments or arrangements to advance or loan funds to the company or repay any such advances or loans exist  there is no legal obligation for either management or existing controlling stockholders to provide additional future funding further the company is at the mercy of future economic trends and business operations for the company’s existing controlling stockholders to have the resources available to support the company   the companys continued existence is dependent upon its ability to implement its business plan generate sufficient cash flows from operations to support its daily operations and provide sufficient resources to retire existing liabilities and obligations on a timely basis  the company faces considerable risk in its business plan and a potential shortfall of funding due to our uncertain ability to raise adequate capital in the equity securities market   the company anticipates offering future sales of equity securities  however there is no assurance that the company will be able to obtain additional funding through the sales of additional equity securities or that such funding if available will be obtained on terms favorable to or affordable by the company   the company’s articles of incorporation authorizes the issuance of up to  million shares of preferred stock and  shares of common stock  the company’s ability to issue preferred stock may limit the company’s ability to obtain debt or equity financing as well as impede the implementation of the company’s business plan  the company’s ability to issue these authorized but unissued securities may also negatively impact our ability to raise additional capital through the sale of our debt or equity securities   in such a restricted cash flow scenario the company would be unable to complete its business plan steps and would instead delay all cash intensive activities  without necessary cash flow the company may become dormant during the next twelve months or until such time as necessary funds could be raised in the equity securities market   while the company is of the opinion that good faith estimates of the company’s ability to secure additional capital in the future to reach its goals have been made there is no guarantee that the company will receive sufficient funding to sustain operations or implement any future business plan steps     note d  summary of significant accounting policies    cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all cash on hand and in banks certificates of deposit and other highlyliquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash and cash equivalents    organization costs   the company has adopted the provisions required by the startup activities topic of the fasb accounting standards codification whereby all costs incurred with the incorporation and organization of the company were charged to operations as incurred             renewable energy acquisition corp a development stage company notes to financial statements  continued september   and december       note d  summary of significant accounting policies  continued    income taxes   the company files income tax returns in the united states of america and various states as appropriate and applicable  the company may become subject to us federal state and local as applicable income tax examinations by regulatory taxing authorities for any period since its inception  however the company does not anticipate any examinations of returns filed since its inception   the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes  at september   and december   respectively the deferred tax asset and deferred tax liability accounts as recorded when material to the financial statements are entirely the result of temporary differences  temporary differences generally represent differences in the recognition of assets and liabilities for tax and financial reporting purposes primarily accumulated depreciation and amortization allowance for doubtful accounts and vacation accruals   the company has adopted the provisions required by the income taxes topic of the fasb accounting standards codification  the codification topic requires the recognition of potential liabilities as a result of management’s acceptance of potentially uncertain positions for income tax treatment on a “morelikelythannot” probability of an assessment upon examination by a respective taxing authority  as a result of the implementation of codification’s income tax topic the company did not incur any liability for unrecognized tax benefits    income loss per share   basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing the net income loss available to common stockholders by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the respective period presented in our accompanying financial statements   fully diluted earnings loss per share is computed similar to basic income loss per share except that the denominator is increased to include the number of common stock equivalents primarily outstanding options and warrants   common stock equivalents represent the dilutive effect of the assumed exercise of the outstanding stock options and warrants using the treasury stock method at either the beginning of the respective period presented or the date of issuance whichever is later and only if the common stock equivalents are considered dilutive based upon the company’s net income loss position at the calculation date   as of september   and  the company had no outstanding stock warrants options or convertible securities which could be considered as dilutive for purposes of the loss per share calculation    new and pending accounting pronouncements   the company does not expect any recently issued accounting pronouncements either in the adoption phase or not yet required to be adopted to have a significant impact on the companys financial position results of operations or cash flows     note e  fair value of financial instruments   the carrying amount of cash accounts receivable accounts payable and notes payable as applicable approximates fair value due to the short term nature of these items andor the current interest rates payable in relation to current market conditions             renewable energy acquisition corp a development stage company notes to financial statements  continued september   and december       note e  fair value of financial instruments  continued   interest rate risk is the risk that the company’s earnings are subject to fluctuations in interest rates on either investments or on debt and is fully dependent upon the volatility of these rates  the company does not use derivative instruments to moderate its exposure to interest rate risk if any   financial risk is the risk that the company’s earnings are subject to fluctuations in interest rates or foreign exchange rates and are fully dependent upon the volatility of these rates  the company does not use derivative instruments to moderate its exposure to financial risk if any     note f  notes payable to stockholders   in conjunction with the initial capitalization of the company the subscribing shareholders agreed that additional working capital would be needed to support the initial phases of the company’s implementation of its business plan  accordingly two controlling shareholders agreed to lend the company an aggregate  with an initial maturity of the sooner of august   or  days after the closing of an anticipated initial public offering   the notes are noninterest bearing and as such the company has recognized an aggregate of approximately  as additional paidin capital for e
