the sand qualities on the leased property and the fact that these sands warranted further testing this lead to csi entering into lease agreements jun    csi tested  holes backhoed under the

plant design and cost financial data and compiled other data to assist in the preparation of a ni  report required for additional financing   our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to raise approximately  million in capital financing the proceeds of this financing would first be used to complete a ni report if recommended to by the ni report it is our intention to continue to drill out the property to establish the both the size and quality of the frac sand resource evident on the mineral leases and to provide working capital to the company the company has continued to borrow funds from its management with some of these funds the company has entered into a loan agreement with nafsca utilizing the mining leases as collateral for any advances made by the company as a consequence of this arrangement nafsca has been able to retain northwest corporation a calgary based mineral engineering company to conduct certain development work on the mineral leases for the purpose of determining the presence of and economic resource and completing a ni report as well as to pay the annual minimum lease payments on the mineral leases and thereby keep mineral leases in good standing the field work initially was to compile previously completed mineral testing results and to write an ni report based on this data however the integrity of the data obtained was such that additional development work was required this work includes an auger drilling field program as well as additional assay and other tests are currently underway   although we are not presently engaged in any other capital raising activities we anticipate that we may engage in one or more private offerings of our company’s securities we would most likely rely upon the transaction exemptions from registration provided by regulation d rule  or conduct a private offering under section  of the securities act of    the implementation of our business strategy is estimated to take approximately  months once we are able to secure funding implementation will begin immediately the major parts of the strategy to be immediately implemented will be the sales and marketing and office equipment and

absence of positive cash flows from operations the company will require additional funding for continuing the development and marketing these factors raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying financial statements do not include any adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty   we are presently not able to meet

will arise from the need to fund our growth from operations pay current obligations and future capital expenditures the primary sources of funding for such requirements are expected to be cash generated from operations and raising additional funds from the private sources andor debt financing however we can provide no assurances that we will be able to generate sufficient cash flow from operations andor obtain additional financing on terms satisfactory to us if at all to remain a going concern our continuation as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet our obligations on a timely basis and ultimately to attain profitability our plan of operation for the next twelve months is to raise capital to continue to expand our operations although we are not presently engaged in any capital raising activities we anticipate that we may engage in one or more private offering of our company’s securities after the completion of this

contents   item  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   we are a smaller reporting company as defined by rule b of the securities exchange act of  and are not required to provide the information under this item   item  controls and procedures   a management’s quarter report on internal control over financial reporting   the management of the company is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting the company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process designed under the supervision of the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the company’s financial statements for external purposes in accordance with the us generally accepted accounting principles   as of march   under the supervision and with the participation of our management we conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of the design and operations of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule ae and de promulgated under the securities exchange act of  and based on the criteria for effective internal control described internal control – integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission  based on this evaluation management concluded that our financial disclosure controls and procedures were not effective so as to timely identify correct and disclose information required to be included on our securities and exchange commission “sec” reports due to the company’s limited internal resources and lack of ability to have multiple levels of transaction review through the use of external consultants and the review process management believes that the financial statements and other information presented herewith are materially correct   the management including its chief executive officer and chief financial officer our sole officer does not expect that its disclosure controls and procedures or its internal controls will prevent all error and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefit of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected   material weaknesses identified by management included lack of an audit committee and audit committee financial expert lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors resulting in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives and affecting the functions of authorization recordkeeping custody of assets and reconciliation and management dominated by a single individual without adequate compensating controls   management believes that the material weaknesses set forth above did not have an effect on our financial results however management believes that the lack of a functioning audit committee and the lack of a majority of outside directors on our board of directors results in ineffective oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures which could result in a material misstatement in our financial statements in future periods        table of contents   management’s remediation initiatives   in an effort to remediate the identified material weaknesses and other deficiencies and enhance our internal controls we have initiated or plan to initiate the following series of measures   we will create a position to segregate duties consistent with control objectives and will increase our personnel resources and technical accounting expertise within the accounting function when funds are available to us and we plan to appoint one or more outside directors to our board of directors who shall be appointed to an audit committee resulting in a fully functioning audit committee who will undertake the oversight in the establishment and monitoring of required internal controls and procedures such as reviewing and approving estimates and assumptions made by management when funds are available to us   management believes that the appointment of one or more outside directors who shall be appointed to a fully functioning audit committee will remedy the lack of a functioning audit committee and a lack of a majority of outside directors on our board   we will work as quickly as possible to implement these initiatives however the lack of adequate working capital and positive cash flow from operations will likely slow this implementation   this report does not include an attestation report of the company’s independent registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over
