information business description history background information on applica incorporated  miami lakes drivemiami lakes florida usa company perspectives applica incorporated aims to be a premiere marketer and manufacturer of consumer appliances that provide product solutions to help consumers through their day history of applica incorporated applica incorporated is a manufacturer and marketer of a wide range of branded licensed and privatelabel small household appliances mostly in north america latin america and the caribbean through its operating subsidiary applica consumer products inc the company markets products under licensed brand names such as black  decker under the windmere name applica also designs and markets kitchen and seasonal products at discount prices the company manufactures and distributes hair care appliances to the professional salon industry personal care products home environment products and pet care products such as the computerized littermaid cat litter box in june  applica acquired black  deckers household products group which designs kitchen and clothingcare appliances under black  decker licenses and markets these products to retailers and distributors in north and latin america within the united states applica holds leading market share in several product categories such as toaster ovens and irons previously known as windmeredurable holdings applica changed its name in may  early history applica was founded in  by belvin friedson a longtime operator of five barber colleges in downtown miami with an initial capital investment of  the former college dropout launched saveway barber and beauty supply inc selling various haircare products on a cashandcarry discount basis to both professional shop owners and consumers in  friedson opened his first store in north miami beach and generated  million in sales quickly taking advantage of the contacts he had developed during his career in the barber and beauty shop industry in his fourth year of operating the company friedson took it public to raise funds for his rapidly expanding business the  generated from the initial public offering of common stock not only stood as a visible sign of the promise shown by the young company but it provided the capital for product diversification backed by this financial support saveways early success continued in the late s as friedson began marketing womens wigs and hairpieces nationwide with the new decade came the first serious test for the company the market for beauty and barber supplies virtually dried up forcing friedson to focus on a new market in  he switched to the product line that would soon become the companys backbone hair dryers curlers and other personal care accessories that same year he enlisted the services of durable a chinese manufacturing company that would later become a subsidiary to supply saveway with appliances friedson established the windmere products division to handle the distribution of the new product line the new strategy showed early signs of success by  revenues had grown to  million saveway had landed its most important sales contract to date entering into an agreement with eckerd drugs a nationally known retailer that would remain one of its largest customers through the s during the mids the windmere division quickly rose to the forefront of the company friedsons son david took over as the divisions national sales manager in  after he dropped out of college under his direction windmere sales increased fivefold over the next eight years jumping to  million in  which represented  percent of revenue for the entire company the rapid expansion of windmere products was fueled primarily by what toni mack of forbes has called an unabashed copycat strategy instead of developing its own products the company attempted to reproduce gadgets that others had made successful for instance when an industry leader such as bristolmyers clairol was successful with an innovative curling iron or hair roller set windmere would quickly join forces with durable to produce a replica of the product at a considerably lower cost taking advantage of cheap labor costs in durables hong kong factories windmere was able to pass the savings along to its customers and become the lowcost producer in the industry durable became a  percent joint partner in  explosive growth in the s having completed a second public offering that raised an additional  million the company entered the s with a sound balance sheet and momentum from a year that saw revenues increase by  percent to  million and net profit more than double to  million such rapid growth however was temporarily checked in the early s by a shortage of labor in the companys hong kong factories that made getting products out the door on time a difficult task to fix the chronic problem friedson and durable established manufacturing operations in china where labor was abundant and half as costly although the decision proved to be sound in the long run immediate gains were negated by high setup costs that resulted in three years of slow growth a new marketing strategy would serve as another catalyst for the companys strong growth in the mids having adopted the corporate name windmere in  making saveway industries inc a division the company attempted to increase its presence in the hair care products market and jumpstart its profit margins through an aggressive mailin rebate campaign hair dryers and curling irons for instance were advertised at an outrageously low final cost—usually below  and sometimes even free consumers had only to follow the rebate form correctly and mail it in with their coupon and sales receipt to take advantage of the savings although the company would of course lose money on consumers who were so diligent friedson wagered that most would not after leaving the store take the time to follow the correct procedure friedsons views on human nature proved correct on average only one out of every four buyers went to the trouble to claim the rebate money and the cost of paying off that  percent according to friedson did not come close to offsetting the increase in sales volume—at no additional cost—that the rebates generated one product alone the vip pro hair dryer advertised at just  after rebate netted a profit of  million this was a large contribution to a  percent climb in total earnings in  although this rebate gimmick provided a needed boost during a down period in the personal care appliance market it could not sustain longterm growth that would depend on the companys ability to add reputable brand names to its product base through acquisition while at the same time adapting rapidly to the trends in the volatile haircare appliance industry to meet the first of these two marketing objectives windmere acquired a  percent interest in extron international inc in  and the remaining  percent the following year the purchase of the texasbased private corporation gave windmere the licensing rights to the trade names faberge brut and grand finale six months after signing the deal windmere acquired an exclusive license to market four lines of ronson electric shavers and other small consumer appliances by june  the company had contracted japanese and austrian firms to manufacture rotary electric and rechargeable razors and was selling them by as much as  less than the competition six months later windmere controlled five percent of the national electric razor market licensing established product names such as these proved a more costeffective strategy for expanding the company not only did the company save on research and development expenses but it did not have to invest heavily in the expensive advertising campaigns needed to introduce a new product to the market much of the companys growth in the mid and late s however was the direct result of the strong performance of its own products from its earliest days the company had attempted to develop the windmere product line by introducing products used in beauty salons to the general public in the s for instance windmere began manufacturing and selling a pistolgrip hairdryer based on a model from its professional line the company tried to make the same profitable transition a decade later with a product designed to make hair wavy known as the crimper although retailers initially showed little interest in the haircrimper when it was introduced in  once it became popular in trendsetting hollywood it became a huge success a similar type of curling iron called the waver was introduced that same year along with the clothes shaver a device that removed fuzz and fabric pills from clothing both products helped to give windmere instant brand recognition something it had struggled  years to achieve as young women across the country snatched up the newfangled curling irons in hopes of achieving the in look windmere revenues and profits soared to record levels by  the performance of the company had exploded to recordbreaking levels sales climbed to  million and earnings had risen to  million which represented increases of  percent and  percent respectively from the previous year the momentum from these new products led the company to another year of torrid growth in  as sales rose to  million and earnings more than doubled to  million meanwhile its stock jumped from  a share to a high of  per share late s setbacks although most outward signs suggested that windmere had finally arrived as a major player in the personal appliances industry a number of obstacles surfaced in the late s that brought growth to a near standstill in may  the first sign of trouble appeared sales of hot products such as the crimper fell victim to changing fashion trends leading to an  percent decline in earnings and an alarming buildup of inventory moreover products designed to fill the void performed poorly exacerbating the problem and in november friedson sold  million worth of company stock shortly before another quarter of disappointing financial results was released as windmere stock plummeted revenues which had been predicted by some analysts to exceed  million dipped to  million and earnings fell to  million perhaps the most serious threat to the stability of the company however came from china the site for  percent of windmeres manufacturing operations and the centsanhour labor that made the company the lowcost producer in the industry in june  a series of studentled protests and period of political unrest temporarily slowed down production and jeopardized the future of windmeres manufacturing operations although the turmoil in china directly affected the company for only four to six weeks it posed a serious threat to the companys debt financing with virtually all of the companys manufacturing factories based within the tumultuous area of the violence in tiananmen square the financial community viewed windmere too much of a risk for the next three years the company would be forced to take out unsecured loans on a  to day basis early s recovery windmeres downward spiral continued into the new decade it failed to come up with a new premier product that could pick up the slack left by declining sales of the crimper the waver and the clothes shaver the companys entrance into the healthrelated products industry through the introduction of an electric rotary toothbrush called plaktrak did not live up to the high expectations suggested by a  million advertising campaign furthermore an ongoing unfair competition and patent infringement lawsuit brought by philips electronics regarding a rotary electric shaver manufactured by izumi products and sold by windmere initiated in  continued to divert muchneeded resources and energy from the development of a viable management strategy for renewal in  however windmere emerged from the lawsuit victorious and was awarded an  million judgment two years later the company collected  million as part of a full settlement from philips the decision not only gave the company a financial shot in the arm—a net gain of  million after legal fees taxes and other expenses—but it enabled friedson and his managerial team to focus on reshaping the business n may  windmere paid izumi products  million effectively removing itself as a party to the japanese manufacturers suit against windmere and philips electronics which claimed that the settlement between windmere and philips took place without izumis consent and was therefore unfair between the time of the decision and the time of the final settlement in  windmere devoted its attention primarily to reorganization and restructuring the company cut costs at its durable manufacturing facilities reducing the breakeven point by more than onethird largely by reducing its work force by  percent down to  at the same time the company worked to reduce its inventories and tighten up its balance sheet not only did the company trim its inventories by more than  percent but it used the money from the lawsuit to pay off debts a favorable decision by the us government to retain chinas status as a most favored nation added to the positive momentum of the lawsuit if duties had been imposed windmere would have had to raise prices and most likely would have lost its advantage over such competitors as conair bristolmyers squibb and helen of troy these companies manufactured in costa rica or bought from the far east locations that all had higher labor and manufacturing costs the mids renewal as windmere celebrated its th anniversary in  it showed several visible signs of renewed financial health total revenues for the second straight year approached the record levels of  more significant the company attained the strongest financial position in its history with  million in equity  million in cash and virtually no debt an aggressive television and print campaign to support new lines of hair and curling irons combined with completely redesigned packaging represented the companys renewed commitment to its core business the following year the company strengthened its presence by acquiring the licensing rights to the helene curtis salon selectives brand name for a line of personal hair care appliances this opened the way for a new line of hair dryers curling irons hair setters combs and brushes as windmere entered the second half of the s it looked to distance itself further from the  decline and regain the respect of its stockholders and the financial community while continuing to improve the efficiency of its operations the company also hoped to develop a gadget that would do for the s what the crimper and the clothes shaver did for the s in a june  meeting with shareholders friedson unveiled one of the leading candidates the littermaid a computerized cat box billed as the pooper scooper for the internet age friedson planned an extensive marketing campaign including infomercials and adding specialty retailers to market the companys latest gadget to the  million cat owners in the united states since littermaid was introduced in  more than  million cats and their owners have enjoyed this product which uses infrared signals to activate an automatic raking system to keep litter clean and virtually odor free in late  applica relaunched the brand with a new logo redesigned packaging and designed an improved web site and an updated infomercial to capitalize on the momentum brandbuilding and millennial marketing in the late s brands were big business in the kitchenware industry in january  windmere bought the rights to the farberware name also that year through partners salton inc and newtech electronic industries inc the company signed agreements with kmart to become a supplier of a wide range of small electrical appliance and consumer electronics under the whitewestinghouse brand name in july  cbs corp and white consolidated industries inc settled a dispute over the westinghouse trademark allowing both salton inc and windmere to continue to use the whitewestinghouse name for more than two years windmere searched for a highprofile brand it could champion in june  black and decker agreed to sell its household products division to windmeredurable holdings for  million as part of its acquisition of the black  decker household products group in june  applica licensed the black  decker brand in north america central america south america except brazil and the caribbean for specific household appliances black and decker would keep lighting and cleaning products such as the dustbuster cordless vacuum the licensing agreement was subject to renewal if desired by both companies in july  applica extended its trademark license agreement with the black  decker corporation through december  applicas early renewal was partially motivated by its intent to use the black  decker brand on the first product being developed under a strategic alliance with a yettobe announced packagegoods firm in december  windmeredurable holdings consolidated its sales marketing and product development business into a single division called the consumer product group headed by mike michienzi the reorganization combined the companys household products group and windmere corporation into one entity based in shelton conn michienzi now oversaw all windmeres small electrics brands and personal care professional care jerdon and littlemaid divisions until this point the parent company operated windmere and household products as separate entities windmeres miami headquarters would now house backoffice functions such as financial and supplyline operations the company consolidated operations at its plants in china and mexico and integrated its backoffice operations in miami the millennial year was a significant one for the company which changed its name to applica incorporated in may  the word applica comes from the english word appliance and the latin word plicare which means to fold into one unified whole at the beginning of  the company recorded  million a year in sales and planned to extend the black  decker name to seasonal products such as air conditioners heaters humidifiers and fans product innovation was a key piece of applicas overall strategy and the company debuted  new products at the industry housewares show including countertop coffeemakers—a category that black  decker had vacated at this juncture the companys fiveyear strategy included plans to capitalize on the growing personal care market estimated at  billion annually applica which sold primarily through mass market and drug channels was seeking alternative distribution channels for its wares meanwhile applica developed a dualbrand strategy that positioned the black and decker line as the premiere brand while windmere appliances served consumers at bargain price points eager to launch new product categories applica developed rice cookers grills griddles waffle makers and irons the company was taking steps to be a leader in small appliances and a player on the global stage new black  decker kitchen products on the horizon included the smart brew coffeemaker line which included a perfectpour feature tying in with applicas strategy to link the brand with innovative solutionoriented products meanwhile the company was also building upon retail brands through partnerships with companies such as starbucks and target in mid applica added the black  decker slow cooker to the housewares collection launched the previous year by famed architect michael graves at discount chain target which rounded out its products in the collection around this time kmart expanded its merchandise of applicamanufactured black  decker small electric products a line that now included products made exclusively for kmart the retailer stated an intention to become a destination for black  decker small electrics which now contributed  percent of applicas annual revenue in november  amid much industry speculation applica entered a joint productiondevelopment deal with an unnamed packaged goods firm with the first product to be unveiled by  because of a confidentiality agreement applica has not been allowed to name the partner until the release of the first product although applicas fourthquarter  bottom line declined because of the slower economy and higher raw material costs the company managed to lower its inventory levels and cut debt the company remained ambitious with a goal of  percent market share in each category in which it competes looking at how the company can continue to grow applica knows it must develop innovations for products that serve an eternal
