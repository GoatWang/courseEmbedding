outlook credit supernova share add download print this is the way the world ends… not with a bang but a whimper ts eliot they say that time is money what they don’t say is that money may be running out of time there may be a natural evolution to our fractionally reserved credit system which characterizes modern global finance much like the universe which began with a big bang nearly  billion years ago but is expanding so rapidly that scientists predict it will all end in a “big freeze” trillions of years from now our current monetary system seems to require perpetual expansion to maintain its existence and too the advancing entropy in the physical universe may in fact portend a similar decline of “energy” and “heat” within the credit markets if so then the legitimate response of creditors debtors and investors inextricably intertwined within it should logically be to ask about the economic and investment implications of its ongoing transition but before mimicking ts eliot on the way our monetary system might evolve let me first describe the “big bang” beginning of credit markets so that you can more closely recognize its transition the creation of credit in our modern day fractional reserve banking system began with a deposit and the profitable expansion of that deposit via leverage banks and other lenders don’t always keep  of their deposits in the “vault” at any one time – in fact they keep very little – thus the term “fractional reserves” that first deposit then and the explosion outward of x and more of levered lending is modern day finance’s equivalent of the big bang when it began is actually harder to determine than the birth of the physical universe but it certainly accelerated with the invention of central banking – the us in  – and with it the increased confidence that these newly licensed lenders of last resort would provide support to financial and real economies banking and central banks were and remain essential elements of a productive global economy but they carried within them an inherent instability that required the perpetual creation of more and more credit to stay alive those initial loans from that first deposit they were made most certainly at yields close to the rate of real growth and creation of real wealth in the economy lenders demanded that yield because of their risk and borrowers were speculating that the profit on their fledgling enterprises would exceed the interest expense on those loans in many cases they succeeded but the economy as a whole could not logically grow faster than the real interest rates required to pay creditors in combination with the near doubledigit returns that equity holders demanded to support the initial leverage – unless – unless – it was supplied with additional credit to pay the tab in a sense this was a “sixteen tons” metaphor another day older and deeper in debt except few within the credit system itself understood the implications economist hyman minsky did with credit now expanding the sophisticated economic model provided by minsky was working its way towards what he called ponzi finance first he claimed the system would borrow in low amounts and be relatively selfsustaining – what he termed “hedge” finance then the system would gain courage lever more into a “speculative” finance mode which required more credit to pay back previous borrowings at maturity finally the end phase of “ponzi” finance would appear when additional credit would be required just to cover increasingly burdensome interest payments with accelerating inflation the end result minsky’s concept developed nearly a half century ago shortly after the explosive decoupling of the dollar from gold in  was primarily a cyclically contained model which acknowledged recession and then rejuvenation once the system’s leverage had been reduced that was then he perhaps could not have imagined the hyperbolic as opposed to linear secular rise in us credit creation that has occurred since as shown in chart  patterns for other developed economies are similar while there has been cyclical delevering it has always been mild – even during the volcker era of  when minsky formulated his theory in the early s credit outstanding in the us totaled  trillion† today at  trillion and counting it is a monster that requires perpetually increasing amounts of fuel a supernova star that expands and expands yet in the process begins to consume itself each additional dollar of credit seems to create less and less heat in the s it took four dollars of new credit to generate  of real gdp over the last decade it has taken  and since   to produce the same result minsky’s ponzi finance at the  stage goes more and more to creditors and market speculators and less and less to the real economy this “credit new normal” is entropic much like the physical universe and the “heat” or real growth that new credit now generates becomes less and less each year  real growth now instead of an historical  over the past  years likely even less as the future unfolds not only is more and more anemic credit created by lenders as its “sixteen tons” becomes “thirtytwo” then “sixtyfour” but in the process today’s near zero bound interest rates cripple savers and business models previously constructed on the basis of positive real yields and wider margins for loans net interest margins at banks compress liabilities at insurance companies threaten their levered equity and underfunded pension plans require greater contributions from their corporate funders unless regulatory agencies intervene what has followed has been a gradual erosion of real growth as layoffs bank branch closings and business consolidations create less of a need for labor and physical plant expansion in effect the initial magic of credit creation turns less magical in some cases even destructive and begins to consume credit markets at the margin as well as portions of the real economy it has created for readers demanding a more modeldriven historical example of the negative impact of zero based interest rates they have only to witness the modern day example of japan with interest rates close to zero for the last decade or more a sharply declining rate of investment in productive plants and equipment shown in chart  is the best evidence a japanese credit market supernova exploding and then contracting onto itself money and credit may be losing heat and running out of time in other developed economies as well including the us investment strategy if so then the legitimate question is how much time does moneycredit have left and what are the investment consequences between now and then well first i will admit that my supernova metaphor is more instructive than literal the end of the global monetary system is not nigh but the entropic characterization is most illustrative credit is now funneled increasingly into market speculation as opposed to productive innovation asset price appreciation as opposed to simple yield or “carry” is now critical to maintain the system’s momentum and longevity investment banking which only a decade ago promoted small business development and transition to public markets now is dominated by leveraged speculation and the ponzi finance minsky once warned against so our creditbased financial markets and the economy it supports are levered fragile and increasingly entropic – it is running out of energy and time when does money run out of time the countdown begins when investable assets pose too much risk for too little return when lenders desert credit markets for other alternatives such as cash or real assets repeat the countdown begins when investable assets pose too much risk for too little return visible first signs for creditors would logically be  longterm bond yields too low relative to duration risk  credit spreads too tight relative to default risk and  pe ratios too high relative to growth risks not immediately but over time credit is exchanged figuratively or sometimes literally for cash in a mattress or conversely for real assets gold diamonds in a vault it also may move to other credit markets denominated in alternative currencies as it does domestic systems delever as credit and its supernova heat is abandoned for alternative assets unless central banks and credit extending private banks can generate real or at second best nominal growth with their trillions of dollars euros and yen then the risk of credit market entropy will increase the element of time is critical because investors and speculators that support the system may not necessarily fully participate in it for perpetuity we ask ourselves frequently at pimco what else could we do what else could we invest in to avoid the consequences of financial repression and negative real interest rates approaching minus  the choices are varied cash to help protect against an inflationary expansion or just the opposite – long treasuries to take advantage of a deflationary bust real assets emerging market equities etc one of our investment committee members swears he would buy land in new zealand and set sail most of us can’t do that nor can you the fact is that pimco and almost all professional investors are in many cases index constrained and thus duration and risk constrained we operate in a world that is primarily credit based and as credit loses energy we and our clients should acknowledge its entropy which means accepting lower returns on bonds stocks real estate and derivative strategies that likely will produce less than doubledigit returns still investors cannot simply surrender to their entropic destiny time may be running out but time is still money as the original saying goes how can you make some position for eventual inflation the end stage of a supernova credit explosion is likely to produce more inflation than growth and more chances of inflation as opposed to deflation in bonds buy inflation protection via tips shorten maturities and durations don’t fight central banks – anticipate them by buying what they buy first look as well for offshore sovereign bonds with positive real interest rates mexico italy brazil for example get used to slower real growth qes and zerobased interest rates have negative consequences move money to currencies and asset markets in countries with less debt and less hyperbolic credit systems australia brazil mexico and canada are candidates invest in global equities with stable cash flows that should provide historically lower but relatively attractive returns transition from financial to real assets if possible at the margin buy something you can sink your teeth into – gold other commodities anything that can’t be reproduced as fast as credit think of pimco in this transition we hope to be “your global investment authority” we have a product menu to assist be cognizant of property rights and confiscatory policies in all governments appreciate the supernova characterization of our current credit system at some point it will transition to something else we may be running out of time but time will always be money speed read for credit supernova why is our credit market running out of heat or fuel a as it expands at a rate of trillions per year real growth in the economy has failed to respond more credit goes to pay interest than future investment b zerobased interest rates which are the result of qe and credit creation have negative as well as positive effects historic business models may be negatively affected and investment spending may be dampened c look to the japanese historical example what options should an investor consider a seek inflation protection in credit market assets shorten durations b increase real assetscommoditiesstable cash flow equities at the margin c accept lower future returns in portfolio planning         william h gross managing director  the terms
