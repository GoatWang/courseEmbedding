the world nascar did not gain the success or popularity it has today overnight the sport has evolved to entertain its fans and continuously prosper early stock car racing in the years immediately following world war ii stock car racing was experiencing the greatest popularity it had ever seen tracks throughout the country were drawing more drivers and bigger crowds nonetheless there was a serious lack of organization from track to track rules were different some tracks were makeshift facilities producing one big show at a county fair or something similar to capitalize on the crowds
