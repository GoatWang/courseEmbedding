through four reportable segments corporate private equity global market strategies real assets and investment solutions formerly referred to as solutions corporate private equity  our corporate private equity segment advises our  buyout and  growth capital funds which seek a wide variety of investments of different sizes and growth potentials as of december   our corporate private equity segment had approximately  billion in aum and approximately  billion in feeearning aum global market strategies  our global market strategies segment advises a group of  funds that pursue investment opportunities across structured credit distressed debt corporate and energy mezzanine debt middlemarket and senior debt as well as credit emerging markets and commoditiesfocused hedge funds and a mutual fund as of december   our global market strategies segment had approximately  billion in aum and approximately  billion in feeearning aum real assets  our real assets segment advises our nine us and internationally focused real estate funds our infrastructure fund our two power funds our international energy fund as well as our five legacy energy funds funds that we jointly advise with riverstone the segment also includes seven ngp management fee funds and three carry funds advised by ngp as of december   our real assets segment had approximately  billion in aum and approximately  billion in feeearning aum investment solutions  our investment solutions segment advises a global private equity fund of funds program and related coinvestment and secondary activities across  fund of funds vehicles on july   we acquired a  interest in alpinvest on august   we acquired the remaining  equity interest in alpinvest on november   we acquired metropolitan real estate equity management llc metropolitan one of the largest managers of indirect investments in global real estate which manages  fund of funds vehicles additionally on february   we acquired diversified global asset management corporation dgam a global manager of fund of hedge funds vehicles which manages  fund of funds vehicles as of december   our investment solutions segment had approximately  billion in aum and approximately  billion billion in feeearning aum we earn management fees pursuant to contractual arrangements with the investment funds that we manage and fees for transaction advisory and oversight services provided to portfolio companies of these funds we also typically receive a performance fee from an investment fund which may be either an incentive fee or a special residual allocation of income which we refer to as a carried interest in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund under us generally accepted accounting principles us gaap we are required to consolidate some of the investment funds that we advise however for segment reporting purposes we present revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates these investment funds accordingly our segment revenues primarily consist of fund management and related advisory fees performance fees consisting of incentive fees and carried interest allocations investment income including realized and unrealized gains on our investments in our funds and other trading securities as well as interest and other income our segment expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits expenses including salaries bonuses performance payment arrangements and equitybased compensation excluding awards granted in our initial public offering or in connection with acquisitions and strategic investments and general and administrative expenses refer to note  to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k for more information on the differences between our financial results reported pursuant to us gaap and our financial results for segment reporting purposes trends affecting our business we believe that on an annual basis our diversified multiproduct global platform which invests across numerous industries asset classes and geographies generally enhances the stability of our management fee revenues and distributable earnings and decreases our exposure to a negative event associated with any specific fund investment or vintage however our results of operations particularly our quarterly results are affected by a variety of factors including global economic market and financial conditions particularly in the united states europe and asia in general a climate of reasonable interest rates and high levels of liquidity in the debt and equity capital markets provide a positive environment for us to generate attractive investment returns in our carry funds but periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets can present us with opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future revenue growth for our hedge funds opportunities to generate revenue depend on their respective investment strategies certain of which may benefit from higher market volatility these strategies include but are not limited to low levels of correlation in equity and debt markets differences in market prices versus fundamental value and opportunities to profit from trading inefficiencies during  the general economic climate started the year weaker but by the second half of the year the us macroeconomic outlook improved with gross domestic product growth averaging nearly  at an annualized rate this acceleration in growth helped to offset the  contraction in the first quarter of  and bring gdp growth for the year to roughly  economic strength in the second half of the year contributed to an  increase in the sp  index for the year stock markets outside of the us were generally weaker in  with the eurostoxx index up by  the msci exus index down by  and the msci emerging index down by  the us dollar strengthened against almost all other currencies in  with gains of  versus the japanese yen and the euro and  versus the chinese yuan renminbi on a tradeweighted basis the us dollar rose by  for  the increase in the value of the us dollar likely will depress the foreign earnings of us businesses which could cause asset prices to decline or valuation ratios to increase further while this may pressure the us dollar values of our assets and portfolio outside the united states we also expect it to create opportunities for our funds to invest in assets at more reasonable prices than have been available over the past several years in october  the federal reserve ended its large scale asset purchase program and has signaled its intention to raise interest rates during  depending on the results of incoming economic data during the year despite the expected increase in policy rates marketbased interest rates generally declined in  with the year yield falling from  at the end of  to just  in early  yields on year german and japanese government debt fell to  and  respectively by january  the decline in interest rates has been partially due to increased monetary accommodation in japan and the expectation that the european central bank will launch an asset purchase program in the first quarter of  some of the considerations informing our strategic decisions include our ability to grow our feeearning aum during the year ended december   we raised more than  billion of new capital commitments across our fund platform although the time required to raise a fund remains lengthened relative to historical years prior to the recession and the environment is competitive our fundraising levels exceeded expectations in  during which several of our larger funds were in the market if our fundraising levels decline this decline also will impact our feeearning aum our feeearning aum declined from  billion in  to  billion in  primarily due to large distributions from our funds stemming from significant exit activity during  we expect that much of our fundraising will come from midsize funds and we will continue to sell remaining investments in many of the older larger buyout funds which may make it difficult to grow feeearning aum in our openended funds to the extent we face significant investor redemptions that are not replaced with subscriptions our feeearning aum would be adversely impacted effective january   we had  billion net redemptions in our gms hedge fund operations furthermore from time to time we may raise funds or managed accounts where we take fees on invested capital rather than on committed capital so we will not earn any fees from such commitments until we make an investment as of december   we also had  billion of newly raised capital for which we have not yet commenced charging management fees to the extent we fail to grow our feeearning aum our management fee revenues also will be adversely impacted our ability to offer and market differentiated products that engage new fund investors our ability to attract new capital and investors in our funds is driven in part by the extent to which they continue to see the alternative asset management industry generally and our investment products specifically as an attractive vehicle for capital appreciation we continually seek to create avenues to meet our investors evolving needs and broaden the appeal of our investment products by offering an expansive range of investment funds developing new products and creating managed accounts and other investment vehicles tailored to our investors goals one area of recent attention has been the expansion of access to our products for a new base of individual fund investors including through the launch of a mutual fund we utilize both external strategies including the use of feeder funds and other registered investment products and our internal team of lp relations professionals to reach out to and expand our investor base we have dedicated and expect to continue to dedicate significant resources to maintain our existing relationships further develop external avenues to reach investors and support our lp relations personnel which could increase our fundraising costs our successful deployment of capital our ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is dependent upon our ability to deploy successfully the capital that our investors have committed to our investment funds greater competition high valuations cost of credit and other general market conditions may impact our ability to identify and execute attractive investments because we maintain a disciplined investment approach and analyze each carry fund transaction based on our ability to achieve our targeted returns while taking on a reasonable level of risk we will not deploy our capital until we have sourced a suitable investment opportunity at an attractive price we have a longterm investment horizon and the capital deployed in any one quarter may vary significantly from the capital deployed in any other quarter or the quarterly average of capital deployed in any given year during  we invested approximately  billion in new and existing investments in our carry funds over the past five years we have invested an average of more than  billion a year in new and existing investments in our carry funds as of december   we had capital available for investment through our carry funds of  billion our ability to generate strong absolute and risk adjusted returns the strength of our investment performance affects investors willingness to commit capital to our funds the capital we are able to attract is one of the main drivers of the growth of our aum and the management fees we earn during the year ended december   we realized proceeds of approximately  billion for our carry fund investors our decision to realize carry considers such factors as the level of embedded valuation gains the portion of the fund invested the portion of the fund returned to limited partner investors and the length of time the fund has been in carry as well as other qualitative measures the valuation of our carry fund portfolio increased  overall during  with a  increase in our corporate private equity segment a  increase in our global market strategies segment and a  decline in our real assets segment the decline in real assets was primarily driven by depreciation in funds in our energy platform in late  but was partially mitigated by the lower economics of our interests in the performance fees from our legacy energy funds as opposed to the enhanced economics we hold in funds in our broadened energy and natural resources platform we believe that this broadened platform will provide significant opportunities for future returns on our investment as we seek to deploy significant capital into the sector at current attractive values given increased competition for investments and the effect particularly in europe and asia of the rising dollar against foreign currencies the internal rates of return we are able to generate may be lower than our historical rates but we continue to follow our core investment tenets and disciplined approach to make investments where we believe we can create value and achieve appreciation recent transactions on february   the fasb issued asu  consolidation topic  key financial measures management fees attributable to carlyle partners vi lp cp vi our sixth

rule  b registration no  prospectus  common units representing limited partner interests         this is the initial public offering of common units representing limited partner interests in the carlyle group lp no public market currently exists for our common units we are offering all of the  common units representing limited partner interests in this offering our common units have been approved for listing on the nasdaq global select market under the symbol cg   investing in our common units involves risks see risk factors beginning on page  these risks include the following   we are managed by our general partner which is owned by our senior carlyle professionals our common unitholders will have only limited voting rights and will have no right to remove our general partner or except in limited circumstances elect the directors of our general partner moreover immediately following this offering our senior carlyle professionals generally will have sufficient voting power to determine the outcome of those few matters that may be submitted for a vote of our limited partners in addition our partnership agreement limits the liability of and reduces or eliminates the duties including fiduciary duties owed by our general partner to our common unitholders and restricts the remedies available to our common unitholders for actions that might otherwise constitute breaches of our general partners duties as a limited partnership we will qualify for and intend to rely on exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements under the rules of the nasdaq global select market for example we will not be required to comply with the requirements that a majority of the board of directors of our general partner consist of independent directors and that we have independent director oversight of executive officer compensation and director nominations   our business is subject to many risks including those associated with       adverse economic and market conditions which can affect our business and liquidity position in many ways including by reducing the value or performance of the investments made by our investment funds and reducing the ability of our investment funds to raise or deploy capital       changes in the debt financing markets which could negatively impact the ability of our funds and their portfolio companies to obtain attractive financing or refinancing for their investments and operations and could increase the cost of such financing if it is obtained leading to loweryielding investments       the potential volatility of our revenue income and cash flow       our dependence on our founders and other key personnel and our ability to attract retain and motivate high quality employees who will bring value to our operations       business and regulatory impediments to our efforts to expand into new investment strategies markets and businesses       the fact that most of our investment funds invest in illiquid longterm investments that are not marketable securities and such investments may lose significant value during an economic downturn       the potential for poor performance of our investment funds and       the possibility that we will not be able to continue to raise capital from thirdparty investors on advantageous terms     as discussed in material us federal tax considerations the carlyle group lp will be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes and our common unitholders therefore will be required to take into account their allocable share of items of income gain loss and deduction of the carlyle group lp in computing their us federal income tax liability although we currently intend to make annual distributions in an amount sufficient to cover the anticipated us federal state and local income tax liabilities of holders of common units in respect of their allocable share of our net taxable income it is possible that such tax liabilities will exceed the cash distributions that holders of common units receive from us although not enacted the us congress has considered legislation that would have precluded us from qualifying as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or required us to hold carried interest through taxable subsidiary corporations for taxable years after a tenyear transition period and would have taxed individual holders of common units with respect to certain income and gains at increased rates similar legislation could be enacted in the future

distressed securities mezzanine loans emerging markets equities macroeconomic products and the inherent difficulties in aggregating the performance of closedend and openend funds the presentation of aggregate investment performance across this segment would not be meaningful   financial strength   the investment performance across our broad fund base has enabled us to generate economic net income of  million in  and  billion in  and distributable earnings of  million and  million for the same periods our income before provision for income taxes a gaap measure was approximately  billion in  and  billion in  this performance is also reflected in the rate of appreciation of the investments in our carry funds in recent periods with a  increase in our carry fund value in  and a  increase in  additionally distributions to our fund investors have been robust with more than  billion distributed to fund investors in  and approximately  billion in  we believe the investment pace and available capital of our carry funds position us well for the future our carry funds invested approximately  billion in  and more than  billion in  and as of december   these funds had approximately  billion in capital commitments that had not yet been invested   stable and diverse team of talented investment professionals with a strong alignment of interests   we have a talented team of more than  investment professionals and we are assisted by our executive operations group of  operating executives with an average of over  years of relevant operating financial and regulatory experience who are a valuable resource to our portfolio companies and our firm our investment professionals are supported by a centralized investor services and support group which includes more than  professionals the interests of our professionals are aligned with the interests of the investors in our funds and in our firm since our inception through december   we and our senior carlyle professionals operating executives and other professionals have invested or committed to invest in excess of  billion in or alongside our funds we have also sought to align the longterm incentives of our senior carlyle professionals with our common unitholders including through equity compensation arrangements that include certain vesting minimum retained ownership and transfer restrictions see management  vesting minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions   commitment to responsible global citizenship   we believe that being a good corporate citizen is part of good business practice and creates longterm value for our fund investors we have worked to apply the private equity growth capital councils guidelines for responsible investment which we helped to develop in  demonstrating our commitment to environmental social and governance standards in our investment activities in addition we were the first global alternative asset management firm to release a corporate citizenship report which catalogues and describes our corporate citizenship efforts including our responsible investment policy and practices and those of our portfolio companies    our strategy for the future   we intend to create value for our common unitholders by seeking to       continue to generate attractive investment returns for our fund investors across our multifund multiproduct global investment platform including by increasing the value of our current portfolio and leveraging the strong capital position of our investment funds to pursue new investment opportunities       continue to inspire the confidence and loyalty of our more than  active carry fund investors and further expand our investor base with a focus on client service and strong investment performance       continue to grow our aum by raising followon investment funds across our four segments and by broadening our platform through both organic growth and selective acquisitions where we believe we can provide investors with differentiated products to meet their needs       further advance our leadership position in core nonus geographic markets including highgrowth emerging markets such as china latin america india mena and subsaharan africa and       continue to demonstrate principled industry leadership and to be a responsible and respected member of the global community by demonstrating our commitment to environmental social and governance standards in our investment activities   investment risks   an investment in our common units involves substantial risks and uncertainties some of the more significant challenges and risks relating to an investment in our common units include those associated with       adverse economic and market conditions which can affect our business and liquidity position in many ways including by reducing the value or performance of the investments made by our investment funds and reducing the ability of our investment funds to raise or deploy capital       changes in the debt financing markets which could negatively impact the ability of our funds and their portfolio companies to obtain attractive financing or refinancing for their investments and operations and could increase the cost of such financing if it is obtained leading to loweryielding investments       the potential volatility of our revenue income and cash flow which is influenced by       the fact that carried interest is only received when investments are realized and achieve a certain specified return       changes in the carrying values and performance of our funds investments and       the life cycle of our carry funds which influences the timing of our accrual and realization of carried interest       the fact that the fees we receive for transaction advisory services are dependent upon the level of transactional activity during the period       our dependence on our founders and other key personnel and our ability to attract retain and motivate high quality employees who will bring value to our operations       business and regulatory impediments to our efforts to expand into new investment strategies markets and businesses          the fact that most of our investment funds invest in illiquid longterm investments that are not marketable securities and such investments may lose significant value during an economic downturn       the potential for poor performance of our investment funds and       the possibility that we will not be able to continue to raise capital from thirdparty investors on advantageous terms   as a limited partnership we will qualify for and intend to rely on exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements under the rules of the nasdaq global select market for example we will not be required to comply with the requirements that a majority of the board of directors of our general partner consist of independent directors and that we have independent director oversight of executive officer compensation and director nominations   in addition and as discussed in material us federal tax considerations       the carlyle group lp will be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes and our common unitholders therefore will be required to take into account their allocable share of items of income gain loss and deduction of the carlyle group lp in computing their us federal income tax liability       although we currently intend to make annual distributions in an amount sufficient to cover the anticipated us federal state and local income tax liabilities of holders of common units in respect of their allocable share of our net taxable income it is possible that such tax liabilities will exceed the cash distributions that holders of common units receive from us and       although not enacted the us congress has considered legislation that would have precluded us from qualifying as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or required us to hold carried interest through taxable subsidiary corporations for taxable years after a tenyear transition period and would have taxed individual holders of common units with respect to certain income and gains now taxed at capital gains rates including gain on disposition of units at increased rates similar legislation could be enacted in the future   please see risk factors for a discussion of these and other factors you should consider before making an investment in our common units     the carlyle group lp was formed in delaware on july   our principal executive offices are

holding entities tc group llc tc group cayman lp tc group investment holdings lp and tc group cayman investment holdings lp we refer to these four holding entities collectively as the parent entities the parent entities have been under the common ownership and control of the partners of our firm who we refer to as our senior carlyle professionals and two strategic investors that own minority interests in our business  entities affiliated with mubadala development company an abudhabi based strategic development and investment company mubadala and california public employees retirement system calpers in addition certain individuals engaged in our businesses own interests in the general partners of our existing carry funds certain of these individuals have as described below contributed a portion of these interests to us as part of the reorganization we refer to these individuals together with the owners of the parent entities prior to this offering collectively as our existing owners   reorganization   prior to this offering we completed a series of transactions pursuant to which our business was reorganized into a holding partnership structure as described under organizational structure following the reorganization and this offering the carlyle group lp is a holding partnership and through whollyowned subsidiaries holds equity interests in three carlyle holdings partnerships which we refer to collectively as carlyle holdings which in turn own the four parent entities through its whollyowned subsidiaries the carlyle group lp is the sole general partner of each of the carlyle holdings partnerships accordingly the carlyle group lp will operate and control all of the business and affairs of carlyle holdings and will consolidate the financial results of carlyle holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the limited partners of carlyle holdings will be reflected as a noncontrolling interest in the carlyle group lps consolidated financial statements at the time of this offering our existing owners are the only limited partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships   certain existing and former owners of the parent entities including calpers and former and current senior carlyle professionals have beneficial interests in investments in or alongside our funds that were funded by such persons indirectly through the parent entities in order to minimize the extent of third party ownership interests in firm assets prior to the completion of the offering we i distributed a portion of these interests approximately  million as of december   to the beneficial owners so that they are held directly by such persons and are no longer consolidated in our financial statements and ii restructured the remainder of these interests approximately  million as of december   so that they are reflected as noncontrolling interests in our financial statements in addition prior to the offering the parent entities have restructured the ownership of certain carried interest rights allocated to retired senior carlyle professionals so that such carried interest rights will be reflected as noncontrolling interests in our financial statements such restructured carried interest rights accounted for approximately  million of our performance fee revenue for the year ended december   prior to the date of the offering the parent entities have also made a cash distribution of previously undistributed earnings to their owners totaling  million see unaudited pro forma financial information   our existing owners then contributed to the carlyle holdings partnerships their interests in the parent entities and a portion of the equity interests they owned in the general partners of our existing investment funds and other entities that have invested in or alongside our funds   accordingly following the reorganization subsidiaries of carlyle holdings generally will be entitled to       all management fees payable in respect of all current and future investment funds that we advise as well as the fees for transaction advisory and oversight services that may be payable      by these investment funds portfolio companies subject to certain third party interests as described below       all carried interest earned in respect of all current and future carry funds that we advise

professionals and       all returns on investments of our own balance sheet capital that we make following this offering as well as on existing investments with an aggregate value of approximately  million as of december     in certain cases the entities that receive management fees from our investment funds are owned by carlyle together with other persons for example management fees from our energy and renewables funds are received by an entity we own together with riverstone and the claren road esg and alpinvest management companies are partially owned by the respective founders and managers of these businesses we may have similar arrangements with respect to the ownership of the entities that advise our funds in the future   in order to better align the interests of our senior carlyle professionals and the other individuals who manage our carry funds with our own interests and with those of the investors in these funds such individuals are allocated directly a portion of the carried interest in our carry funds prior to the reorganization the level of such allocations vary by fund but generally are at least  of the carried interests in the fund as a result of the reorganization the allocations to these individuals will be approximately  of all carried interest on a blended average basis earned in respect of investments made prior to the date of the reorganization and approximately  of any carried interest that we earn in respect of investments made from and after the date of the reorganization in each case with the exception of the riverstone funds where we will retain essentially all of the carry to which we are entitled under our arrangements for those funds in addition under our arrangements with the historical owners and management team of alpinvest such persons are allocated all carried interest in respect of the historical investments and commitments to our fund of funds vehicles that existed as of december    of the carried

from carlyle holdings net of taxes and amounts payable under the tax receivable agreement as described below we currently anticipate that we will cause carlyle holdings to make quarterly distributions to its partners including the carlyle group lps wholly owned subsidiaries that will enable the carlyle group lp to pay a quarterly distribution of  per common unit with the first such quarterly distribution being ratably reduced to reflect the portion of the quarter following the completion of this offering in addition we currently anticipate that we will cause carlyle holdings to make annual distributions to its partners including the carlyle group lps wholly owned subsidiaries in an amount that taken together with the other abovedescribed quarterly distributions represents substantially all of our distributable earnings in excess of the amount determined by our general partner to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business to make appropriate investments in our business and our funds or to comply with applicable law or any of our financing agreements we anticipate that the aggregate amount of our distributions for most years will be less than our distributable earnings for that year due to these funding requirements for a discussion of the difference between distributable earnings and cash distributions during the historical periods presented see cash distribution policy   notwithstanding the foregoing the declaration and payment of any distributions will be at the sole discretion of our general partner which may change our

partnership and has no material assets other than its ownership of partnership units in carlyle holdings held through whollyowned subsidiaries we intend to cause carlyle holdings to make distributions to its partners including the whollyowned subsidiaries of the carlyle group lp in order to fund any distributions we may declare on the common units if carlyle holdings makes such distributions the limited partners of carlyle holdings will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions pro rata based on their partnership interests in carlyle holdings because carlyle holdings i gp inc must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreement the amounts ultimately distributed by the carlyle group lp to common unitholders are expected to be less on a per unit basis than the amounts distributed by the carlyle holdings partnerships to the limited partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships in respect of their carlyle holdings partnership units   in addition the partnership agreements of the carlyle holdings partnerships provide for cash distributions which we refer to as tax distributions to the partners of such partnerships if our whollyowned subsidiaries that are the general partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships determine that the taxable income of the relevant partnership will give rise to taxable income for its partners generally these tax distributions will be computed based on our estimate of the net taxable income of the relevant partnership allocable to a partner multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the highest effective marginal combined us federal state and local income tax rate prescribed for an individual or corporate resident in new york new york taking into account the nondeductibility of certain expenses and the character of our income the carlyle holdings partnerships will make tax distributions only to the extent distributions from such partnerships for the relevant year were otherwise insufficient to cover such tax liabilities the carlyle group lp is not required to distribute to its common unitholders any of the cash that its whollyowned subsidiaries may receive as a result of tax distributions

restrictions respectively would be subject to the restrictions described in such sections a carlyle holdings limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of the three carlyle holdings partnerships to effect an exchange for a common unit as the number of carlyle holdings partnership units held by the limited partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships declines the number of votes to which tcg carlyle global partners llc is entitled as a result of its ownership of the special voting unit will be correspondingly reduced for information concerning transfer restrictions that will apply to holders of carlyle holdings partnership units including our senior carlyle professionals see management  vesting minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions   tax receivable agreement future exchanges of carlyle holdings partnership units are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of carlyle holdings primarily attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in our business these increases in tax basis will increase for tax purposes depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of tax that certain of our subsidiaries including carlyle holdings i gp inc which we refer to as the corporate taxpayers would otherwise be required to pay in the future this increase in tax basis may also decrease gain or increase loss on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with our existing owners whereby the corporate taxpayers have agreed to pay to our existing owners  of the amount of cash tax savings if any in us federal state and local income tax that they realize as a result of these increases in tax basis the corporate taxpayers have the right to terminate the tax receivable agreement by making payments to our existing owners calculated by reference to the value of all future payments that our existing owners    would have been entitled to receive under the tax receivable agreement using certain valuation assumptions including that any carlyle holdings partnership units that have not been exchanged are deemed exchanged for the market value of the common units at the time of termination and that the corporate taxpayers will have sufficient taxable income in each future taxable year to fully realize all potential tax savings based upon certain assumptions described in greater detail under certain relationships and related person transactions 

liabilities and cash flows and has no effect on net income attributable to carlyle group or members equity      risk factors   an investment in our common units involves risks you should carefully consider the following information about these risks together with the other information contained in this prospectus before investing in our common units   risks related to our company   adverse economic and market conditions could negatively impact our business in many ways including by reducing the value or performance of the investments made by our investment funds reducing the ability of our investment funds to raise or deploy capital and impacting our liquidity position any of which could materially reduce our revenue and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition   our business may be materially affected by conditions in the global financial markets and economic conditions or events throughout the world that are outside of our control including but not limited to changes in interest rates availability of credit inflation rates economic uncertainty changes in laws including laws relating to taxation trade barriers commodity prices currency exchange rates and controls and national and international political circumstances including wars terrorist acts or security operations these factors may affect the level and volatility of securities prices and the liquidity and the value of investments and we may not be able to or may choose not to manage our exposure to these market conditions andor other events in the event of a market downturn each of our businesses could be affected in different ways   for example the unprecedented turmoil in the global financial markets during  and  provoked significant volatility of securities prices contraction in the availability of credit and the failure of a number of companies including leading financing institutions and had a significant material adverse effect on our corporate private equity real assets and global market strategies businesses during that period many economies around the world including the us economy experienced significant declines in employment household wealth and lending in addition the recent speculation regarding the inability of greece and certain other european countries to pay their national debt the response by eurozone policy makers to mitigate this sovereign debt crisis and the concerns regarding the stability of the eurozone currency have created uncertainty in the credit markets as a result there has been a strain on banks and other financial services participants which could adversely affect our ability to obtain credit on favorable terms or at all those events led to a significantly diminished availability of credit and an increase in the cost of financing the lack of credit in  and  materially hindered the initiation of new largesized transactions for our corporate private equity and real assets segments and adversely impacted our operating results in those periods while the adverse effects of that period have abated to a degree global financial markets have experienced significant volatility following the downgrade by standard  poors on august   of the longterm credit rating of us treasury debt from aaa to aa the capital market volatility we are currently experiencing that became more pronounced beginning in august  has continued to impact valuations of a significant number of our funds investments and fund performance as of and for the year ended december   there continue to be signs of economic weakness such as relatively high levels of unemployment in major markets including the united states and europe further financial institutions have not yet provided debt financing in amounts and on the terms commensurate with what they provided prior to    our funds may be affected by reduced opportunities to exit and realize value from their investments by lower than expected returns on investments made prior to the deterioration of the credit markets and by the fact that we may not be able to find suitable investments for the funds to effectively deploy capital all of which could adversely affect the timing of new funds and our ability to raise new funds during periods of difficult market conditions or slowdowns which may be across one or more industries or geographies our funds portfolio companies may experience adverse operating performance decreased revenues financial losses difficulty in obtaining access to financing and increased funding costs negative financial results in our funds portfolio companies may result in lower    investment returns for our investment funds which could materially and adversely affect our ability to raise new funds as well as our operating results and cash flow during such periods of weakness our funds portfolio companies may also have difficulty expanding their businesses and operations or meeting their debt service obligations or other expenses as they become due including expenses payable to us furthermore such negative market conditions could potentially result in a portfolio company entering bankruptcy proceedings or in the case of our real assets funds the abandonment or foreclosure of investments thereby potentially resulting in a complete loss of the funds investment in such portfolio company or real assets and a significant negative impact to the funds performance and consequently our operating results and cash flow as well as to our reputation in addition negative market conditions would also increase the risk of default with respect to investments held by our funds that have significant debt investments such as our global market strategies funds   our operating performance may also be adversely affected by our fixed costs and other expenses and the possibility that we would be unable to scale back other costs within a time frame sufficient to match any decreases in revenue relating to changes in market and economic conditions in order to reduce expenses in the face of a difficult economic environment we may need to cut back or eliminate the use of certain services or service providers or terminate the employment of a significant number of our personnel that in each case could be important to our business and without which our operating results could be adversely affected   finally during periods of difficult market conditions or slowdowns our fund investment performance could suffer resulting in for example the payment of less or no carried interest to us the payment of less or no carried interest could cause our cash flow from operations to significantly decrease which could materially and adversely affect our liquidity position and the amount of cash we have on hand to conduct our operations having less cash on hand could in turn require us to rely on other sources of cash such as the capital markets which may not be available to us on acceptable terms to conduct our operations which include for example funding significant general partner and coinvestment commitments to our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles furthermore during adverse economic and market conditions we might not be able to renew all or part of our credit facility or find alternate financing on commercially reasonable terms as a result our uses of cash may exceed our sources of cash thereby potentially affecting our liquidity position   changes in the debt financing markets could negatively impact the ability of certain of our funds and their portfolio companies to obtain attractive financing or refinancing for their investments and could increase the cost of such financing if it is obtained which could lead to loweryielding investments and potentially decreasing our net income   any recurrence of the significant contraction in the market for debt financing that occurred in  and  or other adverse change to us relating to the terms of such debt financing with for example higher rates higher equity requirements andor more restrictive covenants particularly in the area of acquisition financings for leveraged buyout and real assets transactions could have a material adverse impact on our business in the event that certain of our funds are unable to obtain committed debt financing for potential acquisitions or can only obtain debt at an increased interest rate or on unfavorable terms certain of our funds may have difficulty completing otherwise profitable acquisitions or may generate profits that are lower than would otherwise be the case either of which could lead to a decrease in the investment income earned by us similarly our funds portfolio companies regularly utilize the corporate debt markets in order to obtain financing for their operations to the extent that the credit markets render such financing difficult to obtain or more expensive this may negatively impact the operating performance of those portfolio companies and therefore the investment returns of our funds in addition to the extent that the markets make it difficult or impossible to refinance debt that is maturing in the near term some of our portfolio companies may be unable to repay such debt at maturity and may be forced to sell assets undergo a recapitalization or seek bankruptcy protection    our revenue net income and cash flow are variable which may make it difficult for us to achieve steady earnings growth on a quarterly basis   our revenue net income and cash flow are variable for example our cash flow fluctuates due to the fact that we receive carried interest from our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles only when investments are realized and achieve a certain preferred return in addition transaction fees received by our carry funds can vary from quarter to quarter we may also experience fluctuations in our results including our revenue and net income from quarter to quarter due to a number of other factors including changes in the carrying values and performance of our funds investments that can result in significant volatility in the carried interest that we have accrued or as to which we have reversed prior accruals from period to period as well as changes in the amount of distributions dividends or interest paid in respect of investments changes in our operating expenses the degree to which we encounter competition and general economic and market conditions for instance during the most recent economic downturn we recorded significant reductions in the carrying values of many of the investments of the investment funds we advise the carrying value of fund investments may be more variable during times of market volatility such variability in the timing and amount of our accruals and realizations of carried interest and transaction fees may lead to volatility in the trading price of our common units and cause our results and cash flow for a particular period not to be indicative of our performance in a future period we may not achieve steady growth in net income and cash flow on a quarterly basis which could in turn lead to adverse movements in the price of our common units or increased volatility in our common unit price generally the timing and receipt of carried interest also varies with the life cycle of our carry funds for instance the significant distributions made by our carry funds during  and  were partly a function of the relatively large portion of our aum attributable to carry funds and investments that were in their harvesting period during such time as opposed to the fundraising or investment periods which precede harvesting during periods in which a significant portion of our aum is attributable to carry funds and fund of funds vehicles or their investments that are not in their harvesting periods as has been the case from time to time we may receive substantially lower distributions moreover even if an investment proves to be profitable it may be several years before any profits can be realized in cash or other proceeds we cannot predict precisely when or if realizations of investments will occur for example for an extended period beginning the latter half of  the global credit crisis made it difficult for potential purchasers to secure financing to purchase companies in our investment funds portfolio which limited the number of potential realization events a downturn in the equity markets also makes it more difficult to exit investments by selling equity securities if we were to have a realization event in a particular quarter the event may have a significant impact on our quarterly results and cash flow for that particular quarter which may not be replicated in subsequent quarters   we recognize revenue on investments in our investment funds based on our allocable share of realized and unrealized gains or losses reported by such investment funds and a decline in realized or unrealized gains or an increase in realized or unrealized losses would adversely affect our revenue which could further increase the volatility of our quarterly results and cash flow because our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles have preferred investor return thresholds that need to be met prior to us receiving any carried interest declines in or failures to increase sufficiently the carrying value of the investment portfolios of a carry fund or fund of funds vehicle may delay or eliminate any carried interest distributions paid to us in respect of that fund or vehicle since the value of the assets in the fund or vehicle would need to recover to their aggregate cost basis plus the preferred return over time before we would be entitled to receive any carried interest from that fund or vehicle   with respect to certain of the investment funds and vehicles that we advise we are entitled to incentive fees that are paid annually semiannually or quarterly if the net asset value of a fund has increased these funds also have highwater mark provisions whereby if the funds have experienced losses in prior periods we will not be able to earn incentive fees with respect to an investors account until the net asset value of the investors account exceeds the highest period end    value on which incentive fees were previously paid the incentive fees we earn are therefore dependent on the net asset value of these funds or vehicles which could lead to volatility in our quarterly results and cash flow   our fee revenue may also depend on the pace of investment activity in our funds in many of our carry funds the base management fee may be reduced when the fund has invested substantially all of its capital commitments we may receive a lower management fee from such funds after the investing period and during the period the fund is harvesting its investments as a result the variable pace at which many of our carry funds invest capital may cause our management fee revenue to vary from one quarter to the next for example the investment periods for many of the large carry funds that we raised during the particularly productive period from  to early  will unless extended begin to expire this year which will result in stepdowns in the applicable management fee rates for certain of these funds our management fee revenues will be reduced by these stepdowns in management fee rates as well as by any adverse impact on feeearning aum resulting from successful realization activity in our carry funds our failure to successfully replace and grow feeearning aum through the integration of recent acquisitions and anticipated new fundraising initiatives could have an adverse effect on our management fee revenue   we depend on our founders and other key personnel and the loss of their services or investor confidence in such personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition   we depend on the efforts skill reputations and business contacts of our senior carlyle professionals including our founders messrs conway daniello and rubenstein and other key personnel including members of our management committee operating committee the investment committees of our investment funds and senior investment teams the information and deal flow they and others generate during the normal course of their activities and the synergies among the diverse fields of expertise and knowledge held by our professionals accordingly our success will depend on the continued service of these individuals our founders currently have no immediate plans to cease providing services to our firm but our founders and other key personnel are not obligated to remain employed with us in addition all of the carlyle holdings partnership units received by our founders and a portion of the carlyle holdings partnership units that other key personnel have received in the reorganization as described in organizational structure are fully vested several key personnel have left the firm in the past and others may do so in the future and we cannot predict the impact that the departure of any key personnel will have on our ability to achieve our investment objectives the loss of the services of any of them could have a material adverse effect on our revenues net income and cash flow and could harm our ability to maintain or grow aum in existing funds or raise additional funds in the future under the provisions of the partnership agreements governing most of our carry funds the departure of various key carlyle personnel could under certain circumstances relieve fund investors of their capital commitments to those funds if such an event is not cured to the satisfaction of the relevant fund investors within a certain amount of time we have historically relied in part on the interests of these professionals in the investment funds carried interest and incentive fees to discourage them from leaving the firm however to the extent our investment funds perform poorly thereby reducing the potential for carried interest and incentive fees their interests in carried interest and incentive fees become less valuable to them and may become a less effective retention tool   our senior carlyle professionals and other key personnel possess substantial experience and expertise and have strong business relationships with investors in our funds and other members of the business community as a result the loss of these personnel could jeopardize our relationships with investors in our funds and members of the business community and result in the reduction of aum or fewer investment opportunities for example if any of our senior carlyle professionals were to join or form a competing firm that could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition    recruiting and retaining professionals may be more difficult in the future which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   our most important asset is our people and our continued success is highly dependent upon the efforts of our senior and other professionals our future success and growth depends to a substantial degree on our ability to retain and motivate our senior carlyle professionals and other key personnel and to strategically recruit retain and motivate new talented personnel including new senior carlyle professionals however we may not be successful in our efforts to recruit retain and motivate the required personnel as the market for qualified investment professionals is extremely competitive   following this offering we may not be able to provide future senior carlyle professionals with equity interests in our business to the same extent or with the same economic and tax consequences as those from which our existing senior carlyle professionals previously benefited for example following this offering our investment professionals and other employees are expected to be incentivized by the receipt of partnership units in carlyle holdings deferred restricted common units granted pursuant to our equity plans participation interests in carried interest and bonus compensation the portion of their economic incentives comprising carlyle holdings partnership units and grants of restricted units will be greater after the offering than before the offering and these incentives have different economic and tax characteristics than the blend of financial incentives we used before the offering   if legislation were to be enacted by the us congress or any state or local governments to treat carried interest as ordinary income rather than as capital gain for tax purposes such legislation would materially increase the amount of taxes that we and possibly our unitholders would be required to pay thereby adversely affecting our ability to recruit retain and motivate our current and future professionals see  risks related to us taxation our structure involves complex provisions of us federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available our structure also is subject to potential legislative judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations possibly on a retroactive basis and  although not enacted the us congress has considered legislation that would have i in some cases after a tenyear transition period precluded us from qualifying as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or required us to hold carried interest through taxable subsidiary corporations and ii taxed certain income and gains at increased rates if any similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us the after tax income and gain related to our business as well as our distributions to you and the market price of our common units could be reduced moreover the value of the common units we may issue our senior carlyle professionals at any given time may subsequently fall as reflected in the market price of our common units which could counteract the intended incentives   as a result of the foregoing in order to recruit and retain existing and future senior carlyle professionals and other key personnel we may need to increase the level of compensation that we pay to them accordingly as we promote or hire new senior carlyle professionals and other key personnel over time or attempt to retain the services of certain of our key personnel we may increase the level of compensation we pay to these individuals which could cause our total employee compensation and benefits expense as a percentage of our total revenue to increase and adversely affect our profitability the issuance of equity interests in our business in the future to our senior carlyle professionals and other personnel would also dilute public common unitholders   we strive to maintain a work environment that reinforces our culture of collaboration motivation and alignment of interests with investors if we do not continue to develop and implement the right processes and tools to manage our changing enterprise and maintain this culture our ability to compete successfully and achieve our business objectives could be impaired which could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition    given the priority we afford the interests of our fund investors and our focus on achieving superior investment performance we may reduce our aum restrain its growth reduce our fees or otherwise alter the terms under which we do business when we deem it in the best interest of our fund investors  even in circumstances where such actions might be contrary to the interests of unitholders   in pursuing the interests of our fund investors we may take actions that could reduce the profits we could otherwise realize in the short term while we believe that our commitment to our fund investors and our discipline in this regard is in the longterm interest of us and our common unitholders our common unitholders should understand this approach may have an adverse impact on our shortterm profitability and there is no guarantee that it will be beneficial in the long term one of the means by which we seek to achieve superior investment performance in each of our strategies might include limiting the aum in our strategies to an amount that we believe can be invested appropriately in accordance with our investment philosophy and current or anticipated economic and market conditions for instance in  we released jpy  billion  million of coinvestment commitments associated with our second japan buyout fund cjp ii in exchange for an extension of the funds investment period in prioritizing the interests of our fund investors we may also take other actions that could adversely impact our shortterm results of operations when we deem such action appropriate for example in  we decided to shut down one of our real assets funds and guaranteed to reimburse investors of the fund for capital contributions made for investments and fees to the extent investment proceeds did not cover such amounts additionally we may voluntarily reduce management fee rates and terms for certain of our funds or strategies when we deem it appropriate even when doing so may reduce our shortterm revenue for example in  we voluntarily increased the transaction fee rebate for our latest us buyout fund cp v and our latest european buyout fund cep iii from  to  and voluntarily reduced cep iii management fees by  for the years  and  we have also waived management fees on certain leveraged finance vehicles at various times to improve returns   we may not be successful in expanding into new investment strategies markets and businesses which could adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition   our growth strategy is based in part on the expansion of our platform through selective investment in and development or acquisition of alternative asset management businesses or other businesses complementary to our business this strategy can range from smallersized liftouts of investment teams to strategic alliances or acquisitions this growth strategy involves a number of risks including the risk that the expected synergies from an acquisition or strategic alliance will not be realized that the expected results will not be achieved or that the investment process controls and procedures that we have developed around our existing platform will prove insufficient or inadequate in the new investment strategy we may also incur significant charges in connection with such acquisitions and investments and they may also potentially result in significant losses and costs for instance in  we made an investment in a multistrategy hedge fund joint venture which we liquidated at a significant loss in  amid deteriorating market conditions and global financial turmoil similarly in  we established an investment fund which invested primarily in us agency mortgagebacked securities beginning in march  there was an unprecedented deterioration in the market for us agency mortgage backed securities and the fund was forced to enter liquidation resulting in a recorded loss for us of approximately  million such losses could adversely impact our business results of operations and financial condition as well as do harm to our professional reputation   the success of our growth strategy will depend on among other things       the availability of suitable opportunities       the level of competition from other companies that may have greater financial resources       our ability to value potential development or acquisition opportunities accurately and negotiate acceptable terms for those opportunities          our ability to obtain requisite approvals and licenses from the relevant governmental authorities and to comply with applicable laws and regulations without incurring undue costs and delays and       our ability to successfully negotiate and enter into beneficial arrangements with our counterparties   moreover even if we are able to identify and successfully negotiate and complete an acquisition these types of transactions can be complex and we may encounter unexpected difficulties or incur unexpected costs including       the diversion of managements attention to integration matters       difficulties and costs associated with the integration of operations and systems       difficulties and costs associated with the assimilation of employees and       the risk that a change in ownership will negatively impact the relationship between an acquiree and the investors in its investment vehicles   each transaction may also present additional unique challenges for example our investment in alpinvest faces the risk that the other asset managers in whose funds alpinvest invests may no longer be willing to provide alpinvest with investment opportunities as favorable as in the past if at all   our organizational documents do not limit our ability to enter into new lines of business and we may from time to time expand into new investment strategies geographic markets and businesses each of which may result in additional risks and uncertainties in our businesses   we intend to the extent that market conditions warrant to seek to grow our businesses and expand into new investment strategies geographic markets and businesses moreover our organizational documents do not limit us to the asset management business to the extent that we make strategic investments or acquisitions in new geographic markets or businesses undertake other related strategic initiatives or enter into a new line of business we may face numerous risks and uncertainties including risks associated with the following       the required investment of capital and other resources       the possibility that we have insufficient expertise to engage in such activities profitably or without incurring inappropriate amounts of risk       the combination or integration of operational and management systems and controls and       the broadening of our geographic footprint including the risks associated with conducting operations in certain foreign jurisdictions where we currently have no presence   further entry into certain lines of business may subject us to new laws and regulations with which we are not familiar or from which we are currently exempt and may lead to increased litigation and regulatory risk if a new business generates insufficient revenue or if we are unable to efficiently manage our expanded operations our results of operations may be adversely affected   our strategic initiatives may include joint ventures which may subject us to additional risks and uncertainties in that we may be dependent upon and subject to liability losses or reputational damage relating to systems controls and personnel that are not under our control we currently participate in several joint ventures and may elect to participate in additional joint venture opportunities in the future if we believe that operating in such a structure is in our best interests there can be no assurances that our current joint ventures will continue in their current form or at all in the future or that we will be able to identify acceptable joint venture partners in the future or that our participation in any additional joint venture opportunities will be successful    although not enacted the us congress has considered legislation that would have i in some cases after a tenyear transition period precluded us from qualifying as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or required us to hold carried interest through taxable subsidiary corporations and ii taxed certain income and gains at increased rates if any similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us the after tax income and gain related to our business as well as our distributions to you and the market price of our common units could be reduced   over the past several years a number of legislative and administrative proposals have been introduced and in certain cases have been passed by the us house of representatives in may  the us house of representatives passed legislation or may  house bill that would have in general treated income and gains now treated as capital gains including gain on disposition of interests attributable to an investment services partnership interest ispi as income subject to a new blended tax rate that is higher than the capital gains rate applicable to such income under current law except to the extent such ispi would have been considered under the legislation to be a qualified capital interest your interest in us our interest in carlyle holdings ii lp and the interests that carlyle holdings ii lp holds in entities that are entitled to receive carried interest may have been classified as ispis for purposes of this legislation the us senate considered but did not pass similar legislation recently on february   representative levin introduced similar legislation or  levin bill that would generally tax carried interest at ordinary income rates unlike previous proposals the  levin bill includes exceptions including exceptions for interests in publicly traded partnerships like the carlyle group lp that would appear to not recharacterize all of the gain from a disposition of units as ordinary income it is unclear when or whether the us congress will vote on this legislation or what provisions will be included in any legislation if enacted   both the may  house bill and the  levin bill provide that for taxable years beginning  years after the date of enactment income derived with respect to an ispi that is not a qualified capital interest and that is subject to the rules discussed above would not meet the qualifying income requirements under the publicly traded partnership rules therefore if similar legislation is enacted following such tenyear period we would be precluded from qualifying as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or be required to hold all such ispis through corporations possibly us corporations if we were taxed as a us corporation or required to hold all ispis through corporations our effective tax rate would increase significantly the federal statutory rate for corporations is currently  in addition we could be subject to increased state and local taxes furthermore you could be subject to tax on our conversion into a corporation or any restructuring required in order for us to hold our ispis through a corporation   on september   the obama administration submitted similar legislation to congress in the american jobs act that would tax income and gain now treated as capital gains including gain on disposition of interests attributable to an ispi at rates higher than the capital gains rate applicable to such income under current law except to the extent such ispi would be considered to be a qualified capital interest the proposed legislation would also characterize certain income and gain in respect of ispis as nonqualifying income under the publicly traded partnership rules after a tenyear transition period from the effective date with an exception for certain qualified capital interests this proposed legislation follows several prior statements by the obama administration in support of changing the taxation of carried interest furthermore in its published revenue proposal for  the obama administration proposed that current law regarding the treatment of carried interest be changed to subject such income to ordinary income tax which is taxed at a higher rate than the proposed blended tax rate under the house legislation the obama administrations published revenue proposals for   and  contained similar proposals   more recently on february   the obama administration announced its framework of key elements to change the us federal income tax rules for businesses few specifics were included and it is unclear what any actual legislation would provide when it would be proposed or what its prospects for enactment would be several parts of the framework if enacted could adversely affect    us first the framework would reduce the deductibility of interest for corporations in some manner not specified a reduction in interest deductions could increase our tax rate and thereby reduce cash available for distribution to investors or for other uses by us such a reduction could also increase the effective cost of financing by companies in which we invest which could reduce the value of our carried interest in respect of such companies the framework suggests some entities currently treated as partnerships for tax purposes should be subject to an entitylevel income tax similar to the corporate income tax if such a proposal caused us to be subject to additional entitylevel taxes it could reduce cash available for distribution to investors or for other uses by us finally the framework reiterates the presidents support for treatment of carried interest as ordinary income as provided in the presidents revenue proposal for  described above because the framework did not include specifics its effect on us is unclear but the framework reflects a commitment by the president to try to change the tax law in ways that could be adverse to us   states and other jurisdictions have also considered legislation to increase taxes with respect to carried interest for example new york considered legislation under which you even if a nonresident could be subject to new york state income tax on income in respect of our common units as a result of certain activities of our affiliates in new york this legislation would have been retroactive to january   it is unclear when or whether similar legislation will be enacted in addition states and other jurisdictions have considered legislation to increase taxes involving other aspects of our structure in addition states and other jurisdictions have considered and enacted legislation which could increase taxes imposed on our income and gain for example the district of columbia has recently passed legislation that could expand the portion of our income that could be subject to district of columbia income tax   we will expend significant financial and other resources to comply with the requirements of being a public entity   as a public entity we will be subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act and requirements of the sarbanesoxley act of  the sarbanesoxley act these requirements may place a strain on our systems and resources the exchange act requires that we file annual quarterly and current reports with respect to our business and financial condition the sarbanesoxley act requires that we maintain effective disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls over financial reporting which is discussed below see  our internal controls over financial reporting do not currently meet all of the standards contemplated by section  of the sarbanesoxley act and failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section  of the sarbanesoxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and common unit price in order to maintain and improve the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures significant resources and management oversight will be required we will be implementing additional procedures and processes for the purpose of addressing the standards and requirements applicable to public companies these activities may divert managements attention from other business concerns which could have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition results of operations and cash flows we expect to incur significant additional annual expenses related to these steps and among other things additional directors and officers liability insurance director fees reporting requirements of the securities and exchange commission the sec transfer agent fees hiring additional accounting legal and administrative personnel increased auditing and legal fees and similar expenses   our internal controls over financial reporting do not currently meet all of the standards contemplated by section  of the sarbanesoxley act and failure to achieve and maintain effective internal controls over financial reporting in accordance with section  of the sarbanesoxley act could have a material adverse effect on our business and common unit price   we have not previously been required to comply with the requirements of the sarbanesoxley act including the internal control evaluation and certification requirements of section  of that    statute section  and we will not be required to comply with all of those requirements until we have been subject to the reporting requirements of the exchange act for a specified period of time accordingly our internal controls over financial reporting do not currently meet all of the standards contemplated by section  that we will eventually be required to meet we are in the process of addressing our internal controls over financial reporting and are establishing formal policies processes and practices related to financial reporting and to the identification of key financial reporting risks assessment of their potential impact and linkage of those risks to specific areas and activities within our organization   additionally we have begun the process of documenting our internal control procedures to satisfy the requirements of section  which requires annual management assessments of the effectiveness of our internal controls over financial reporting and a report by our independent registered public accounting firm addressing these assessments because we do not currently have comprehensive documentation of our internal controls and have not yet tested our internal controls in accordance with section  we cannot conclude in accordance with section  that we do not have a material weakness in our internal controls or a combination of significant deficiencies that could result in the conclusion that we have a material weakness in our internal controls as a public entity we will be required to complete our initial assessment in a timely manner if we are not able to implement the requirements of section  in a timely manner or with adequate compliance our operations financial reporting or financial results could be adversely affected and our independent registered public accounting firm may not be able to certify as to the adequacy of our internal controls over financial reporting matters impacting our internal controls may cause us to be unable to report our financial information on a timely basis and thereby subject us to adverse regulatory consequences including sanctions by the sec or violations of applicable stock exchange listing rules and result in a breach of the covenants under the agreements governing any of our financing arrangements there could also be a negative reaction in the financial markets due to a loss of investor confidence in us and the reliability of our financial statements confidence in the reliability of our financial statements could also suffer if our independent registered public accounting firm were to report a material weakness in our internal controls over financial reporting this could materially adversely affect us and lead to a decline in our common unit price   operational risks may disrupt our businesses result in losses or limit our growth   we rely heavily on our financial accounting information and other data processing systems if any of these systems do not operate properly or are disabled or if there is any unauthorized disclosure of data whether as a result of tampering a breach of our network security systems a cyber incident or attack or otherwise we could suffer substantial financial loss increased costs a disruption of our businesses liability to our funds and fund investors regulatory intervention or reputational damage in addition we operate in businesses that are highly dependent on information systems and technology our information systems and technology may not continue to be able to accommodate our growth and the cost of maintaining such systems may increase from its current level such a failure to accommodate growth or an increase in costs related to such information systems could have a material adverse effect on us   furthermore we depend on our headquarters in washington dc where most of our administrative and operations personnel are located and our office in arlington virginia which houses our treasury and finance functions for the continued operation of our business a disaster or a disruption in the infrastructure that supports our businesses including a disruption involving electronic communications or other services used by us or third parties with whom we conduct business or directly affecting our headquarters could have a material adverse impact on our ability to continue to operate our business without interruption our disaster recovery programs may not be sufficient to mitigate the harm that may result from such a disaster or disruption in addition insurance and other safeguards might only partially reimburse us for our losses if at all    in addition sustaining our growth will also require us to commit additional management operational and financial resources to identify new professionals to join our firm and to maintain appropriate operational and financial systems to adequately support expansion due to the fact that the market for hiring talented professionals is competitive we may not be able to grow at the pace we desire   extensive regulation in the united states and abroad affects our activities and creates the potential for significant liabilities and penalties   our business is subject to extensive regulation including periodic examinations by governmental agencies and selfregulatory organizations in the jurisdictions in which we operate around the world many of these regulators are empowered to conduct investigations and administrative proceedings that can result in fines suspensions of personnel or other sanctions including censure the issuance of ceaseanddesist orders or the suspension or expulsion of a brokerdealer or investment adviser from registration or memberships even if an investigation or proceeding does not result in a sanction or the sanction imposed against us or our personnel by a regulator were small in monetary amount the adverse publicity relating to the investigation proceeding or imposition of these sanctions could harm our reputation and cause us to lose existing fund investors or fail to gain new investors or discourage others from doing business with us some of our investment funds invest in businesses that operate in highly regulated industries including in businesses that are regulated by the us federal communications commission and us federal and state banking authorities the regulatory regimes to which such businesses are subject may among other things condition our funds ability to invest in those businesses upon the satisfaction of applicable ownership restrictions or qualification requirements moreover our failure to obtain or maintain any regulatory approvals necessary for our funds to invest in such industries may disqualify our funds from participating in certain investments or require our funds to divest themselves of certain assets in addition we regularly rely on exemptions from various requirements of the securities act of  as amended the securities act the exchange act the investment company act of  as amended the  act and the us employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa in conducting our asset management activities in the united states similarly in conducting our asset management activities outside the united states we rely on available exemptions from the regulatory regimes of various foreign jurisdictions these exemptions from regulation within the united states and abroad are sometimes highly complex and may in certain circumstances depend on compliance by third parties whom we do not control if for any reason these exemptions were to become unavailable to us we could become subject to regulatory action or thirdparty claims and our business could be materially and adversely affected moreover the requirements imposed by our regulators are designed primarily to ensure the integrity of the financial markets and to protect investors in our funds and are not designed to protect our common unitholders consequently these regulations often serve to limit our activities and impose burdensome compliance requirements see business  regulatory and compliance matters   we may become subject to additional regulatory and compliance burdens as we expand our product offerings and investment platform for example if we were to sponsor a registered investment company under the  act such registered investment company and our subsidiary that serves as its investment adviser would be subject to the  act and the rules thereunder which among other things regulate the relationship between a registered investment company and its investment adviser and prohibit or severely restrict principal transactions and joint transactions this could increase our compliance costs and create the potential for additional liabilities and penalties   regulatory changes in the united states could adversely affect our business and the possibility of increased regulatory focus could result in additional burdens and expenses on our business   as a result of the financial crisis and highly publicized financial scandals investors have exhibited concerns over the integrity of the us financial markets and the domestic regulatory environment in which we operate in the united states there has been an active debate over the    appropriate extent of regulation and oversight of private investment funds and their managers we may be adversely affected as a result of new or revised legislation or regulations imposed by the sec or other us governmental regulatory authorities or selfregulatory organizations that supervise the financial markets we also may be adversely affected by changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules by these governmental authorities and selfregulatory organizations regulatory focus on our industry is likely to intensify if as has happened from time to time the alternative asset management industry falls into disfavor in popular opinion or with state and federal legislators as the result of negative publicity or otherwise   on july   president obama signed into law the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act the doddfrank act which imposes significant new regulations on almost every aspect of the us financial services industry including aspects of our business among other things the doddfrank act includes the following provisions which could have an adverse impact on our ability to conduct our business       the doddfrank act establishes the financial stability oversight council the fsoc an interagency body acting as the financial systems systemic risk regulator with the authority to review the activities of nonbank financial companies predominantly engaged in financial activities that are designated as systemically important such designation is applicable to companies where material financial distress could pose risk to the financial stability of the united states or if the nature scope size scale concentration interconnectedness or mix of their activities could pose a threat to us financial stability on april   the fsoc issued a final rule and interpretive guidance regarding the process by which it will designate nonbank financial companies as systemically important the final rule and interpretive guidance detail a threestage process with the level of scrutiny increasing at each stage during stage  the fsoc will apply a broad set of uniform quantitative metrics to screen out financial companies that do not warrant additional review the fsoc will consider whether a company has at least  billion in total consolidated assets and whether it meets other thresholds relating to credit default swaps outstanding derivative liabilities total debt outstanding a threshold leverage ratio of total consolidated assets excluding separate accounts to total equity of  to  and a shortterm debt ratio of debt with maturities of less than  months to total consolidated assets excluding separate accounts of  a company that meets or exceeds both the asset threshold and one of the other thresholds will be subject to additional review although it is unlikely that we would be designated as systemically important under the process outlined in the final rule and interpretive guidance the designation criteria could and is expected to evolve over time while the fsoc will use the stage  thresholds in identifying nonbank financial companies for further evaluation it may initially evaluate any nonbank financial company based on other firmspecific quantitative or qualitative factors irrespective of whether such company meets the thresholds in stage  if the fsoc were to determine that we were a systemically important nonbank financial company we would be subject to a heightened degree of regulation which could include a requirement to adopt heightened standards relating to capital leverage liquidity risk management credit exposure reporting and concentration limits restrictions on acquisitions and being subject to annual stress tests by the federal reserve       the doddfrank act under what has become known as the volcker rule generally prohibits depository institution holding companies including foreign banks with us branches and insurance companies with us depository institution subsidiaries insured depository institutions and subsidiaries and affiliates of such entities from investing in or sponsoring private equity funds or hedge funds the volcker rule will become effective on july   and is subject to certain transition periods and exceptions for certain permitted activities that would enable certain institutions subject to the volcker rule to continue investing in private equity funds under certain conditions although we do not currently anticipate that the volcker rule will adversely affect our fundraising to any significant extent there is uncertainty regarding the implementation of the volcker rule and its practical      implications and there could be adverse implications on our ability to raise funds from the types of entities mentioned above as a result of this prohibition on october   the federal reserve and other federal regulatory agencies issued a proposed rule implementing the volcker rule a final rule may not be issued until after the effective date       the doddfrank act requires many private equity and hedge fund advisers to register with the sec under the advisers act to maintain extensive records and to file reports with information that the regulators identify as necessary for monitoring systemic risk although a carlyle subsidiary has been registered as an investment adviser for over  years the doddfrank act will affect our business and operations including increasing regulatory costs imposing additional burdens on our staff and potentially requiring the disclosure of sensitive information       the doddfrank act authorizes federal regulatory agencies to review and in certain cases prohibit compensation arrangements at financial institutions that give employees incentives to engage in conduct deemed to encourage inappropriate risk taking by covered financial institutions such restrictions could limit our ability to recruit and retain investment professionals and senior management executives       the doddfrank act requires public companies to adopt and disclose policies requiring in the event the company is required to issue an accounting restatement the clawback of related incentive compensation from current and former executive officers       the doddfrank act amends the exchange act to compensate and protect whistleblowers who voluntarily provide original information to the sec and establishes a fund to be used to pay whistleblowers who will be entitled to receive a payment equal to between  and  of certain monetary sanctions imposed in a successful government action resulting from the information provided by the whistleblower   many of these provisions are subject to further rulemaking and to the discretion of regulatory bodies such as the fsoc and the federal reserve   in june  the sec approved rule  under the advisers act regarding pay to play practices by investment advisers involving campaign contributions and other payments to government clients and elected officials able to exert influence on such clients the rule prohibits investment advisers from providing advisory services for compensation to a government client for two years subject to very limited exceptions after the investment adviser its senior executives or its personnel involved in soliciting investments from government entities make contributions to certain candidates and officials in position to influence the hiring of an investment adviser by such government client advisers are required to implement compliance policies designed among other matters to track contributions by certain of the advisers employees and engagement of third parties that solicit government entities and to keep certain records in order to enable the sec to determine compliance with the rule any failure on our part to comply with the rule could expose us to significant penalties and reputational damage in addition there have been similar rules on a statelevel regarding pay to play practices by investment advisers for example in may  we reached resolution with the office of the attorney general of the state of new york the nyag regarding its inquiry into the use of placement agents by various asset managers including carlyle to solicit new york public pension funds for private equity and hedge fund investment commitments we made a  million payment to new york state as part of this resolution in november  and agreed to adopt the nyags code of conduct   in september  california enacted legislation which became effective in january  requiring placement agents who solicit funds from the california state retirement systems such as calpers and the california state teachers retirement system to register as lobbyists in addition to increased reporting requirements the legislation prohibits placement agents from receiving contingent compensation for soliciting investments from california state retirement systems new york city has enacted similar measures which became effective on january   that require asset management firms and their employees that solicit investments from new york citys five public pension systems    to register as lobbyists like the california legislation the new york city measures impose significant compliance obligations on registered lobbyists and their employers including annual registration fees periodic disclosure reports and internal recordkeeping and also prohibit the acceptance of contingent fees moreover other states or municipalities may consider similar legislation as that enacted in california and new york city or adopt regulations or procedures with similar effect these types of measures could materially and adversely impact our business   it is impossible to determine the extent of the impact on us of the doddfrank act or any other new laws regulations or initiatives that may be proposed or whether any of the proposals will become law any changes in the regulatory framework applicable to our business including the changes described above may impose additional costs on us require the attention of our senior management or result in limitations on the manner in which we conduct our business moreover as calls for additional regulation have increased there may be a related increase in regulatory investigations of the trading and other investment activities of alternative asset management funds including our funds compliance with any new laws or regulations could make compliance more difficult and expensive affect the manner in which we conduct our business and adversely affect our profitability   recent regulatory changes in jurisdictions outside the united states could adversely affect our business   similar to the environment in the united states the current environment in jurisdictions outside the united states in which we operate in particular europe has become subject to further regulation governmental regulators and other authorities in europe have proposed or implemented a number of initiatives and additional rules and regulations that could adversely affect our business   in october  the eu council of ministers adopted a directive to amend the revised capital requirements directive crd iii which among other things requires european union eu member states to introduce stricter control on remuneration of key employees and risk takers within specific credit institutions and investment firms the financial services authority the fsa has implemented crd iii by amending its remuneration code although the extent of the regulatory impact will differ depending on a firms size and the nature of its activities   in addition in november  the european parliament voted to approve the eu directive on alternative investment fund managers the eu directive which establishes a new eu regulatory regime for alternative investment fund managers including private equity and hedge fund managers the eu directive generally applies to managers with a registered office in the eu or managing an eubased fund vehicle as well as noneubased managers that market securities of alternative investment funds in the european union in general the eu directive will have a staged implementation over a period of years beginning in mid for eubased managers or eubased funds and no later than  for noneubased managers marketing noneubased funds into the european union compliance with the eu directive will subject us to a number of additional requirements including rules relating to the remuneration of certain personnel principally adopting the provisions of crd iii referred to above certain capital requirements for alternative investment fund managers leverage oversight for each investment fund liquidity management and retention of depositories for each investment fund compliance with the requirements of the eu directive will impose additional compliance expense for us and could reduce our operating flexibility and fund raising opportunities   in december  chinas national development and reform commission issued a new circular regulating the activities of private equity funds established in china the circular includes new rules relating to the establishment fundraising and investment scope of such funds risk control mechanisms basic responsibilities and duties of fund managers information disclosure systems and record filing compliance with these requirements may impose additional expense affect the manner in which we conduct our business and adversely affect our profitability   our investment businesses are subject to the risk that similar measures might be introduced in other countries in which our funds currently have investments or plan to invest in the future or that    other legislative or regulatory measures that negatively affect their respective portfolio investments might be promulgated in any of the countries in which they invest the reporting related to such initiatives may divert the attention of our personnel and the management teams of our portfolio companies moreover sensitive business information relating to us or our portfolio companies could be publicly released   see risks related to our business operations  our funds make investments in companies that are based outside of the united states which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investments in companies that are based in the united states and busin e ss  regulatory and compliance matters for more information   we are subject to substantial litigation risks and may face significant liabilities and damage to our professional reputation as a result of litigation allegations and negative publicity   the investment decisions we make in our asset management business and the activities of our investment professionals on behalf of portfolio companies of our carry funds may subject them and us to the risk of thirdparty litigation arising from investor dissatisfaction with the performance of those investment funds the activities of our portfolio companies and a variety of other litigation claims and regulatory inquiries and actions from time to time we and our portfolio companies have been and may be subject to regulatory actions and shareholder class action suits relating to transactions in which we have agreed to acquire public companies   for example on february   a private class action lawsuit challenging club bids and other alleged anticompetitive business practices was filed in the us district court for the district of massachusetts the complaint alleges among other things that certain private equity firms including carlyle violated section  of the sherman antitrust act of  the sherman act by forming multisponsor consortiums for the purpose of bidding collectively in corporate buyout auctions in certain going private transactions which the plaintiffs allege constitutes a conspiracy in restraint of trade it is difficult to determine what impact if any this litigation and any future related litigation together with any increased governmental scrutiny or regulatory initiatives will have on the private equity industry generally or on us and our funds specifically as a result the foregoing could have an adverse impact on us or otherwise impede our ability to effectively achieve our asset management objectives see business  legal proceedings for more information on this and other proceedings   in addition to the extent that investors in our investment funds suffer losses resulting from fraud gross negligence willful misconduct or other similar misconduct investors may have remedies against us our investment funds our principals or our affiliates under the federal securities laws andor state law the general partners and investment advisers to our investment funds including their directors officers other employees and affiliates are generally indemnified with respect to their conduct in connection with the management of the business and affairs of our private equity funds for example we have agreed to indemnify directors and officers of carlyle capital corporation limited in connection with the matters involving that fund discussed under business  legal proceedings however such indemnity generally does not extend to actions determined to have involved fraud gross negligence willful misconduct or other similar misconduct   if any lawsuits were brought against us and resulted in a finding of substantial legal liability the lawsuit could materially adversely affect our business results of operations or financial condition or cause significant reputational harm to us which could materially impact our business we depend to a large extent on our business relationships and our reputation for integrity and highcaliber professional services to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for our funds as a result allegations of improper conduct by private litigants or regulators whether the ultimate outcome is favorable or unfavorable to us as well as negative publicity and press speculation about us our investment activities or the private equity industry in general whether or not valid may harm our reputation which may be more damaging to our business than to other types of businesses    in addition with a workforce composed of many highly paid professionals we face the risk of litigation relating to claims for compensation which may individually or in the aggregate be significant in amount the cost of settling any such claims could negatively impact our business results of operations and financial condition   employee misconduct could harm us by impairing our ability to attract and retain investors in our funds and subjecting us to significant legal liability and reputational harm fraud and other deceptive practices or other misconduct at our portfolio companies could harm performance   there is a risk that our employees could engage in misconduct that adversely affects our business our ability to attract and retain investors and to pursue investment opportunities for our funds depends heavily upon the reputation of our professionals especially our senior carlyle professionals we are subject to a number of obligations and standards arising from our asset management business and our authority over the assets managed by our asset management business the violation of these obligations and standards by any of our employees would adversely affect our clients and us our business often requires that we deal with confidential matters of great significance to companies in which our funds may invest if our employees were to use or disclose confidential information improperly we could suffer serious harm to our reputation financial position and current and future business relationships as well as face potentially significant litigation it is not always possible to detect or deter employee misconduct and the extensive precautions we take to detect and prevent this activity may not be effective in all cases if any of our employees were to engage in misconduct or were to be accused of such misconduct whether or not substantiated our business and our reputation could be adversely affected and a loss of investor confidence could result which would adversely impact our ability to raise future funds   we will also be adversely affected if there is misconduct by senior management of portfolio companies in which our funds invest such misconduct might undermine our due diligence efforts with respect to such companies and it might negatively affect the valuation of a funds investments   in recent years the us department of justice the doj and the sec have devoted greater resources to enforcement of the foreign corrupt practices act the fcpa in addition the united kingdom has recently significantly expanded the reach of its antibribery laws while we have developed and implemented policies and procedures designed to ensure strict compliance by us and our personnel with the fcpa such policies and procedures may not be effective in all instances to prevent violations any determination that we have violated the fcpa or other applicable anticorruption laws could subject us to among other things civil and criminal penalties material fines profit disgorgement injunctions on future conduct securities litigation and a general loss of investor confidence any one of which could adversely affect our business prospects financial position or the market value of our common units   certain policies and procedures implemented to mitigate potential conflicts of interest and address certain regulatory requirements may reduce the synergies across our various businesses and inhibit our ability to maintain our collaborative culture   we consider our one carlyle philosophy and the ability of our professionals to communicate and collaborate across funds industries and geographies one of our significant competitive strengths as a result of the expansion of our platform into various lines of business in the alternative asset management industry we are currently and as we continue to develop our managed account business and expand we will be subject to a number of actual and potential conflicts of interest and subject to greater regulatory oversight than that to which we would otherwise be subject if we had just one line of business in addition as we expand our platform the allocation of investment opportunities among our investment funds may become more complex in addressing these conflicts and regulatory requirements across our various businesses we have and may continue to implement certain policies and procedures for example information barriers that may reduce the positive synergies that we cultivate across these businesses through our one    carlyle approach for example although we maintain ultimate control over alpinvest alpinvests historical management team who are our employees will continue to exercise independent investment authority without involvement by other carlyle personnel see  risks related to our business operations  our fund of funds solutions business is subject to additional risks in addition we may come into possession of material nonpublic information with respect to issuers in which we may be considering making an investment as a consequence we may be precluded from providing such information or other ideas to our other businesses that benefit from such information   risks related to our business operations   poor performance of our investment funds would cause a decline in our revenue income and cash flow may obligate us to repay carried interest previously paid to us and could adversely affect our ability to raise capital for future investment funds   in the event that any of our investment funds were to perform poorly our revenue income and cash flow could decline in some of our funds such as our hedge funds a reduction in the value of our aum in such funds could result in a reduction in management fees and incentive fees we earn in other funds managed by us such as our private equity funds a reduction in the value of the portfolio investments held in such funds could result in a reduction in the carried interest we earn moreover we could experience losses on our investments of our own capital as a result of poor investment performance by our investment funds furthermore if as a result of poor performance of later investments in a carry funds or fund of funds vehicles life the fund does not achieve certain investment returns for the fund over its life we will be obligated to repay the amount by which carried interest that was previously distributed to us exceeds the amount to which we are ultimately entitled these repayment obligations may be related to amounts previously distributed to our senior carlyle professionals prior to the completion of this offering with respect to which our common unitholders did not receive any benefit see  we may need to pay giveback obligations if and when they are triggered under the governing agreements with our investors   poor performance of our investment funds could make it more difficult for us to raise new capital investors in carry funds and fund of funds vehicles might decline to invest in future investment funds we raise and investors in hedge funds or other investment funds might withdraw their investments as a result of the poor performance of the investment funds in which they are invested investors and potential investors in our funds continually assess our investment funds performance and our ability to raise capital for existing and future investment funds and avoid excessive redemption levels will depend on our investment funds continued satisfactory performance accordingly poor fund performance may deter future investment in our funds and thereby decrease the capital invested in our funds and ultimately our management fee income alternatively in the face of poor fund performance investors could demand lower fees or fee concessions for existing or future funds which would likewise decrease our revenue   our asset management business depends in large part on our ability to raise capital from thirdparty investors if we are unable to raise capital from thirdparty investors we would be unable to collect management fees or deploy their capital into investments and potentially collect transaction fees or carried interest which would materially reduce our revenue and cash flow and adversely affect our financial condition   our ability to raise capital from thirdparty investors depends on a number of factors including certain factors that are outside our control certain factors such as the performance of the stock market the pace of distributions from our funds and from the funds of other asset managers or the asset allocation rules or regulations or investment policies to which such thirdparty investors are subject could inhibit or restrict the ability of thirdparty investors to make investments in our investment funds for example during  and  many thirdparty investors that invest in alternative assets and have historically invested in our investment funds experienced significant volatility in valuations of their    investment portfolios including a significant decline in the value of their overall private equity real assets venture capital and hedge fund portfolios which affected our ability to raise capital from them coupled with a lack of distributions from their existing private equity and real assets portfolios many of these investors were left with disproportionately outsized remaining commitments to and invested capital in a number of investment funds which significantly limited their ability to make new commitments to thirdparty managed investment funds such as those advised by us although economic conditions have improved and many investors have increased the amount of commitments they are making to alternative investment funds there can be no assurance that this will continue moreover as some existing investors cease or significantly curtail making commitments to alternative investment funds we may need to identify and attract new investors in order to maintain or increase the size of our investment funds there can be no assurances that we can find or secure commitments from those new investors our ability to raise new funds could similarly be hampered if the general appeal of private equity and alternative investments were to decline an investment in a limited partner interest in a private equity fund is more illiquid and the returns on such investment may be more volatile than an investment in securities for which there is a more active and transparent market private equity and alternative investments could fall into disfavor as a result of concerns about liquidity and shortterm performance such concerns could be exhibited in particular by public pension funds which have historically been among the largest investors in alternative assets many public pensions are significantly underfunded and their funding problems have been exacerbated by the recent economic downturn concerns with liquidity could cause such public pension funds to reevaluate the appropriateness of alternative investments in addition the evolving preferences of our fund investors may necessitate that alternatives to the traditional investment fund structure such as managed accounts smaller funds and coinvestment vehicles become a larger part of our business going forward this could increase our cost of raising capital at the scale we have historically achieved   the failure to successfully raise capital commitments to new investment funds may also expose us to credit risk in respect of financing that we may provide such funds when existing capital commitments to a new investment fund are insufficient to fund in full a new investment funds participation in a transaction we may lend money to or borrow money from financial institutions on behalf of such investment funds to bridge this difference and repay this financing with capital from subsequent investors to the fund our inability to identify and secure capital commitments from new investors to these funds may expose us to losses in the case of money that we lend directly to such funds or adversely impact our ability to repay such borrowings or otherwise have an adverse impact on our liquidity position finally if we seek to expand into other business lines we may also be unable to raise a sufficient amount of capital to adequately support such businesses   the failure of our investment funds to raise capital in sufficient amounts could result in a decrease in our aum as well as management fee and transaction fee revenue or could result in a decline in the rate of growth of our aum and management fee and transaction fee revenue any of which could have a material adverse impact on our revenues and financial condition our past experience with growth of aum provides no assurance with respect to the future for example our next generation of large buyout and other funds could be smaller in overall size than our current large buyout and other funds there can be no assurance that any of our business segments will continue to experience growth in aum   some of our fund investors may have concerns about the prospect of our becoming a publicly traded company including concerns that as a public company we will shift our focus from the interests of our fund investors to those of our common unitholders some of our fund investors may believe that we will strive for nearterm profit instead of superior riskadjusted returns for our fund investors over time or grow our aum for the purpose of generating additional management fees without regard to whether we believe there are sufficient investment opportunities to effectively deploy the additional capital there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our efforts to address such concerns or to convince fund investors that our decision to pursue this offering will not affect our longstanding priorities or the way we conduct our business a decision by a significant number of our fund investors not to commit additional    capital to our funds or to cease doing business with us altogether could inhibit our ability to achieve our investment objectives and could have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition   our investors in future funds may negotiate to pay us lower management fees and the economic terms of our future funds may be less favorable to us than those of our existing funds which could adversely affect our revenues   in connection with raising new funds or securing additional investments in existing funds we negotiate terms for such funds and investments with existing and potential investors the outcome of such negotiations could result in our agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us than the terms of prior funds we have advised or funds advised by our competitors such terms could restrict our ability to raise investment funds with investment objectives or strategies that compete with existing funds reduce fee revenues we earn reduce the percentage of profits on thirdparty capital that we share in or add expenses and obligations for us in managing the fund or increase our potential liabilities all of which could ultimately reduce our profitability for instance we have confronted and expect to continue to confront requests from a variety of investors and groups representing investors to increase the percentage of transaction fees we share with our investors or to decline to receive any transaction fees from portfolio companies owned by our funds to the extent we accommodate such requests it would result in a decrease in the amount of fee revenue we earn moreover certain institutional investors have publicly criticized certain fund fee and expense structures including management fees we have confronted and expect to continue to confront requests from a variety of investors and groups representing investors to decrease fees and to modify our carried interest and incentive fee structures which could result in a reduction in or delay in the timing of receipt of the fees and carried interest and incentive fees we earn any modification of our existing fee or carry arrangements or the fee or carry structures for new investment funds could adversely affect our results of operations see  the alternative asset management business is intensely competitive   in addition we believe that certain institutional investors including sovereign wealth funds and public pension funds could in the future demonstrate an increased preference for alternatives to the traditional investment fund structure such as managed accounts smaller funds and coinvestment vehicles there can be no assurance that such alternatives will be as efficient as the traditional investment fund structure or as to the impact such a trend could have on the cost of our operations or profitability if we were to implement these alternative investment structures moreover certain institutional investors are demonstrating a preference to insource their own investment professionals and to make direct investments in alternative assets without the assistance of private equity advisers like us such institutional investors may become our competitors and could cease to be our clients   valuation methodologies for certain assets in our funds can involve subjective judgments and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may be incorrect which could result in the misstatement of fund performance and accrued performance fees   there are often no readily ascertainable market prices for a substantial majority of illiquid investments of our investment funds we determine the fair value of the investments of each of our investment funds at least quarterly based on the fair value guidelines set forth by generally accepted accounting principles in the united states the fair value measurement accounting guidance establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework that ranks the observability of market inputs used in measuring financial instruments at fair value the observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors including the type of financial instrument the characteristics specific to the financial instrument and the state of the marketplace including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants financial instruments with readily quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value    investments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity of operating companies or real estate properties fair values of such investments are determined by reference to projected net earnings earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda the discounted cash flow method comparable values in public market or private transactions valuations for comparable companies and other measures which in many cases are unaudited at the time received valuations may be derived by reference to observable valuation measures for comparable companies or transactions for example multiplying a key performance metric of the investee company or asset such as ebitda by a relevant valuation multiple observed in the range of comparable companies or transactions adjusted by management for differences between the investment and the referenced comparables and in some instances by reference to option pricing models or other similar models in determining fair values of real estate investments we also consider projected operating cash flows sales of comparable assets replacement costs and capitalization rates cap rates analysis additionally where applicable projected distributable cash flow through debt maturity will also be considered in support of the investments carrying value the fair values of creditoriented investments are generally determined on the basis of prices between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services specifically for investments in distressed debt and corporate loans and bonds the fair values are generally determined by valuations of comparable investments in some instances other valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow method may be used to value illiquid investments   the determination of fair value using these methodologies takes into consideration a range of factors including but not limited to the price at which the investment was acquired the nature of the investment local market conditions trading values on public exchanges for comparable securities current and projected operating performance and financing transactions subsequent to the acquisition of the investment these valuation methodologies involve a significant degree of management judgment for example as to investments that we share with another sponsor we may apply a different valuation methodology than the other sponsor does or derive a different value than the other sponsor has derived on the same investment which could cause some investors to question our valuations   because there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of or in the stability of the value of illiquid investments the fair values of such investments as reflected in an investment funds net asset value do not necessarily reflect the prices that would be obtained by us on behalf of the investment fund when such investments are realized realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected in prior fund net asset values would result in reduced earnings or losses for the applicable fund the loss of potential carried interest and incentive fees and in the case of our hedge funds management fees changes in values attributed to investments from quarter to quarter may result in volatility in the net asset values and results of operations that we report from period to period also a situation where asset values turn out to be materially different than values reflected in prior fund net asset values could cause investors to lose confidence in us which could in turn result in difficulty in raising additional funds   the historical returns attributable to our funds including those presented in this prospectus should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns expected on an investment in our common units   we have presented in this prospectus information relating to the historical performance of our investment funds the historical and potential future returns of the investment funds that we advise are not directly linked to returns on our common units therefore any continued positive performance of the investment funds that we advise will not necessarily result in positive returns on an investment in our common units however poor performance of the investment funds that we advise would cause a decline in our revenue from such investment funds and could therefore have a negative effect on our performance our ability to raise future funds and in all likelihood the returns on an investment in our common units    moreover with respect to the historical returns of our investment funds       market conditions at times were significantly more favorable for generating positive performance particularly in our corporate private equity and real assets businesses than the market conditions we experienced in recent years and may continue to experience for the foreseeable future       the rates of returns of our carry funds reflect unrealized gains as of the applicable measurement date that may never be realized which may adversely affect the ultimate value realized from those funds investments       unitholders will not benefit from any value that was created in our funds prior to your investment in our common units to the extent such value has been realized       in recent years there has been increased competition for private equity investment opportunities resulting from the increased amount of capital invested in alternative investment funds and high liquidity in debt markets and the increased competition for investments may reduce our returns in the future       the rates of returns of some of our funds in certain years have been positively influenced by a number of investments that experienced rapid and substantial increases in value following the dates on which those investments were made which may not occur with respect to future investments       our investment funds returns in some years have benefited from investment opportunities and general market conditions that may not repeat themselves including for example particularly favorable borrowing conditions in the debt markets during   and early  and our current or future investment funds might not be able to avail themselves of comparable investment opportunities or market conditions and       we may create new funds in the future that reflect a different asset mix and different investment strategies as well as a varied geographic and industry exposure as compared to our present funds and any such new funds could have different returns than our existing or previous funds   in addition future returns will be affected by the applicable risks described elsewhere in this prospectus including risks related to the industries and businesses in which our funds may invest see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  segment analysis  fund performance metrics for additional information   dependence on significant leverage in investments by our funds could adversely affect our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on those investments   many of our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles investments rely heavily on the use of leverage and our ability to achieve attractive rates of return on investments will depend on our ability to access sufficient sources of indebtedness at attractive rates for example in many private equity investments indebtedness may constitute and historically has constituted up to  or more of a portfolio companys or real estate assets total debt and equity capitalization including debt that may be incurred in connection with the investment the absence of available sources of sufficient debt financing for extended periods of time could therefore materially and adversely affect our corporate private equity and real assets businesses in addition an increase in either the general levels of interest rates or in the risk spread demanded by sources of indebtedness such as the increase we experienced during  would make it more expensive to finance those businesses investments increases in interest rates could also make it more difficult to locate and consummate private equity investments because other potential buyers including operating companies acting as strategic buyers may be able to bid for an asset at a higher price due to a lower overall cost of capital or their ability to benefit from a higher amount of cost savings following the acquisition of    the asset in addition a portion of the indebtedness used to finance private equity investments often includes highyield debt securities issued in the capital markets availability of capital from the highyield debt markets is subject to significant volatility and there may be times when we might not be able to access those markets at attractive rates or at all when completing an investment finally the interest payments on the indebtedness used to finance our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles investments are generally deductible expenses for income tax purposes subject to limitations under applicable tax law and policy any change in such tax law or policy to eliminate or substantially limit these income tax deductions as has been discussed from time to time in various jurisdictions would reduce the aftertax rates of return on the affected investments which may have an adverse impact on our business and financial results see  our funds make investments in companies that are based outside of the united states which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in companies that are based in the united states   investments in highly leveraged entities are also inherently more sensitive to declines in revenue increases in expenses and interest rates and adverse economic market and industry developments the incurrence of a significant amount of indebtedness by an entity could among other things       subject the entity to a number of restrictive covenants terms and conditions any violation of which could be viewed by creditors as an event of default and could materially impact our ability to realize value from the investment       allow even moderate reductions in operating cash flow to render the entity unable to service its indebtedness leading to a bankruptcy or other reorganization of the entity and a loss of part or all of the equity investment in it       give rise to an obligation to make mandatory prepayments of debt using excess cash flow which might limit the entitys ability to respond to changing industry conditions to the extent additional cash is needed for the response to make unplanned but necessary capital expenditures or to take advantage of growth opportunities       limit the entitys ability to adjust to changing market conditions thereby placing it at a competitive disadvantage compared to its competitors that have relatively less debt       limit the entitys ability to engage in strategic acquisitions that might be necessary to generate attractive returns or further growth and       limit the entitys ability to obtain additional financing or increase the cost of obtaining such financing including for capital expenditures working capital or other general corporate purposes   as a result the risk of loss associated with a leveraged entity is generally greater than for companies with comparatively less debt for example a number of investments consummated by private equity sponsors during   and  that utilized significant amounts of leverage subsequently experienced severe economic stress and in certain cases defaulted on their debt obligations due to a decrease in revenue and cash flow precipitated by the subsequent downturn during  and  similarly the leveraged nature of the investments of our real assets funds increases the risk that a decline in the fair value of the underlying real estate or tangible assets will result in their abandonment or foreclosure for example in  and  several investments of our real estate funds were foreclosed resulting in aggregate writeoffs of approximately  million in  and  million in    when our private equity funds existing portfolio investments reach the point when debt incurred to finance those investments matures in significant amounts and must be either repaid or refinanced those investments may materially suffer if they have not generated sufficient cash flow to repay maturing debt and there is insufficient capacity and availability in the financing markets to permit them to refinance maturing debt on satisfactory terms or at all if a limited availability of    financing for such purposes were to persist for an extended period of time when significant amounts of the debt incurred to finance our corporate private equity and real assets funds existing portfolio investments came due these funds could be materially and adversely affected   many of our global market strategies funds may choose to use leverage as part of their respective investment programs and regularly borrow a substantial amount of their capital the use of leverage poses a significant degree of risk and enhances the possibility of a significant loss in the value of the investment portfolio a fund may borrow money from time to time to purchase or carry securities or may enter into derivative transactions such as total return swaps with counterparties that have embedded leverage the interest expense and other costs incurred in connection with such borrowing may not be recovered by appreciation in the securities purchased or carried and will be lost and the timing and magnitude of such losses may be accelerated or exacerbated in the event of a decline in the market value of such securities gains realized with borrowed funds may cause the funds net asset value to increase at a faster rate than would be the case without borrowings however if investment results fail to cover the cost of borrowings the funds net asset value could also decrease faster than if there had been no borrowings increases in interest rates could also decrease the value of fixedrate debt investment that our investment funds make   any of the foregoing circumstances could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations financial condition and cash flow   a decline in the pace or size of investments by our carry funds or fund of funds vehicles could result in our receiving less revenue from transaction fees   the transaction fees that we earn are driven in part by the pace at which our funds make investments and the size of those investments any decline in that pace or the size of such investments could reduce our transaction fees and could make it more difficult for us to raise capital on our anticipated schedule many factors could cause such a decline in the pace of investment including       the inability of our investment professionals to identify attractive investment opportunities       competition for such opportunities among other potential acquirers       decreased availability of capital on attractive terms and       our failure to consummate identified investment opportunities because of business regulatory or legal complexities and adverse developments in the us or global economy or financial markets   for example the more limited financing options for large corporate private equity and real assets investments resulting from the credit market dislocations in  and  reduced the pace and size of investments by our corporate private equity and real assets funds   in addition we have confronted and expect to continue to confront requests from a variety of investors and groups representing investors to increase the percentage of transaction fees we share with our investors or to decline to receive transaction fees from portfolio companies held by our funds to the extent we accommodate such requests it would result in a decrease in the amount of fee revenue we earn see  our investors in future funds may negotiate to pay us lower management fees and the economic terms of our future funds may be less favorable to us than those of our existing funds which could adversely affect our revenues   the alternative asset management business is intensely competitive   the alternative asset management business is intensely competitive with competition based on a variety of factors including investment performance business relationships quality of service provided to investors investor liquidity and willingness to invest fund terms including fees brand recognition and business reputation our alternative asset management business competes with a    number of private equity funds specialized investment funds hedge funds corporate buyers traditional asset managers real estate development companies commercial banks investment banks and other financial institutions as well as sovereign wealth funds for instance carlyle and riverstone have mutually decided not to pursue another jointly managed fund as cosponsors accordingly we expect that our future energy and renewable funds will compete with riverstone among other alternative asset managers for investment opportunities and fund investors in the energy and renewable space a number of factors serve to increase our competitive risks       a number of our competitors in some of our businesses have greater financial technical marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do       some of our funds may not perform as well as competitors funds or other available investment products       a significant number of investors have materially decreased or temporarily suspended making new fund investments recently because of the global economic downturn and poor returns in their overall investment portfolios in  and        several of our competitors have significant amounts of capital and many of them have similar investment objectives to ours which may create additional competition for investment opportunities and may reduce the size and duration of pricing inefficiencies that otherwise could be exploited       some of these competitors may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us which may create competitive disadvantages for us with respect to investment opportunities       some of our competitors may have higher risk tolerances different risk assessments or lower return thresholds than us which could allow them to consider a wider variety of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments that we want to make       some of our competitors may be subject to less regulation and accordingly may have more flexibility to undertake and execute certain businesses or investments than we do andor bear less compliance expense than we do       some of our competitors may have more flexibility than us in raising certain types of investment funds under the investment management contracts they have negotiated with their investors       some of our competitors may have better expertise or be regarded by investors as having better expertise in a specific asset class or geographic region than we do       our competitors that are corporate buyers may be able to achieve synergistic cost savings in respect of an investment which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for an investment       there are relatively few barriers to entry impeding the formation of new alternative asset management firms and the successful efforts of new entrants into our various businesses including former star portfolio managers at large diversified financial institutions as well as such institutions themselves is expected to continue to result in increased competition       some investors may prefer to invest with an asset manager that is not publicly traded or is smaller with only one or two investment products that it manages and       other industry participants may from time to time seek to recruit our investment professionals and other employees away from us   we may lose investment opportunities in the future if we do not match investment prices structures and terms offered by our competitors alternatively we may experience decreased rates of return and increased risks of loss if we match investment prices structures and terms offered by our    competitors moreover if we are forced to compete with other alternative asset managers on the basis of price we may not be able to maintain our current fund fee and carried interest terms we have historically competed primarily on the performance of our funds and not on the level of our fees or carried interest relative to those of our competitors however there is a risk that fees and carried interest in the alternative asset management industry will decline without regard to the historical performance of a manager fee or carried interest income reductions on existing or future funds without corresponding decreases in our cost structure would adversely affect our revenues and profitability see  our investors in future funds may negotiate to pay us lower management fees and the economic terms of our future funds may be less favorable to us than those of our existing funds which could adversely affect our revenues   in addition the attractiveness of our investment funds relative to investments in other investment products could decrease depending on economic conditions this competitive pressure could adversely affect our ability to make successful investments and limit our ability to raise future investment funds either of which would adversely impact our business revenue results of operations and cash flow see  our investors in future funds may negotiate to pay us lower management fees and the economic terms of our future funds may be less favorable to us than those of our existing funds which could adversely affect our revenues   the due diligence process that we undertake in connection with investments by our investment funds may not reveal all facts that may be relevant in connection with an investment   before making private equity and other investments we conduct due diligence that we deem reasonable and appropriate based on the facts and circumstances applicable to each investment the objective of the due diligence process is to identify attractive investment opportunities based on the facts and circumstances surrounding an investment and in the case of private equity investments prepare a framework that may be used from the date of an acquisition to drive operational achievement and value creation when conducting due diligence we may be required to evaluate important and complex business financial tax accounting environmental and legal issues outside consultants legal advisors accountants and investment banks may be involved in the due diligence process in varying degrees depending on the type of investment nevertheless when conducting due diligence and making an assessment regarding an investment we rely on the resources available to us including information provided by the target of the investment and in some circumstances thirdparty investigations the due diligence process may at times be subjective with respect to newlyorganized companies for which only limited information is available accordingly we cannot be certain that the due diligence investigation that we carry out with respect to any investment opportunity will reveal or highlight all relevant facts that may be necessary or helpful in evaluating such investment opportunity instances of fraud accounting irregularities and other deceptive practices can be difficult to detect and fraud and other deceptive practices can be widespread in certain jurisdictions several of our funds invest in emerging market countries that may not have established laws and regulations that are as stringent as in more developed nations or where existing laws and regulations may not be consistently enforced for example our funds invest throughout china latin america and mena and we have recently hired investment professionals to facilitate investment in subsaharan africa due diligence on investment opportunities in these jurisdictions is frequently more complicated because consistent and uniform commercial practices in such locations may not have developed fraud accounting irregularities and deceptive practices can be especially difficult to detect in such locations for example two chinese companies in which we have minority investments have recently been made the subject of internal investigations in connection with allegations of financial or accounting irregularities and a purported class action has been brought against one of the chinese companies and certain of its present and former officers and directors including a carlyle employee who is a former director of such entity we do not have sufficient information at this time to give an assessment of the likely outcome of these matters or as to the ultimate impact these allegations if true may have on the value of our investments    we cannot be certain that our due diligence investigations will result in investments being successful or that the actual financial performance of an investment will not fall short of the financial projections we used when evaluating that investment failure to identify risks associated with our investments could have a material adverse effect on our business   our funds invest in relatively highrisk illiquid assets and we may fail to realize any profits from these activities for a considerable period of time or lose some or all of our principal investments   many of our investment funds invest in securities that are not publicly traded in many cases our investment funds may be prohibited by contract or by applicable securities laws from selling such securities for a period of time our investment funds will not be able to sell these securities publicly unless their sale is registered under applicable securities laws or unless an exemption from such registration is available the ability of many of our investment funds particularly our private equity funds to dispose of investments is heavily dependent on the public equity markets for example the ability to realize any value from an investment may depend upon the ability to complete an initial public offering of the portfolio company in which such investment is held even if the securities are publicly traded large holdings of securities can often be disposed of only over a substantial length of time exposing the investment returns to risks of downward movement in market prices during the intended disposition period accordingly under certain conditions our investment funds may be forced to either sell securities at lower prices than they had expected to realize or defer potentially for a considerable period of time sales that they had planned to make we have made and expect to continue to make significant principal investments in our current and future investment funds contributing capital to these investment funds is subject to significant risks and we may lose some or all of the principal amount of our investments   the investments of our private equity funds are subject to a number of inherent risks   our results are highly dependent on our continued ability to generate attractive returns from our investments investments made by our private equity funds involve a number of significant risks inherent to private equity investing including the following       we advise funds that invest in businesses that operate in a variety of industries that are subject to extensive domestic and foreign regulation such as the telecommunications industry the aerospace defense and government services industry and the healthcare industry including companies that supply equipment and services to governmental agencies that may involve greater risk due to rapidly changing market and governmental conditions in those sectors       significant failures of our portfolio companies to comply with laws and regulations applicable to them could affect the ability of our funds to invest in other companies in certain industries in the future and could harm our reputation       companies in which private equity investments are made may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations which may be accompanied by a deterioration in the value of their equity securities or any collateral or guarantees provided with respect to their debt       companies in which private equity investments are made are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons and as a result the death disability resignation or termination of one or more of those persons could have a material adverse impact on their business and prospects and the investment made       companies in which private equity investments are made may from time to time be parties to litigation may be engaged in rapidly changing businesses with products subject to a      substantial risk of obsolescence and may require substantial additional capital to support their operations finance expansion or maintain their competitive position       companies in which private equity investments are made generally have less predictable operating results       instances of fraud and other deceptive practices committed by senior management of portfolio companies in which our funds invest may undermine our due diligence efforts with respect to such companies and upon the discovery of such fraud negatively affect the valuation of a funds investments as well as contribute to overall market volatility that can negatively impact a funds investment program       our funds may make investments that they do not advantageously dispose of prior to the date the applicable fund is dissolved either by expiration of such funds term or otherwise resulting in a lower than expected return on the investments and potentially on the fund itself       our funds generally establish the capital structure of portfolio companies on the basis of the financial projections based primarily on management judgments and assumptions and general economic conditions and other factors may cause actual performance to fall short of these financial projections which could cause a substantial decrease in the value of our equity holdings in the portfolio company and cause our funds performance to fall short of our expectations and       executive officers directors and employees of an equity sponsor may be named as defendants in litigation involving a company in which a private equity investment is made or is being made   our real estate funds are subject to the risks inherent in the ownership and operation of real estate and the construction and development of real estate   investments in our real estate funds will be subject to the risks inherent in the ownership and operation of real estate and real estaterelated businesses and assets these risks include the following       those associated with the burdens of ownership of real property       general and local economic conditions       changes in supply of and demand for competing properties in an area as a result for instance of overbuilding       fluctuations in the average occupancy and room rates for hotel properties       the financial resources of tenants       changes in building environmental and other laws       energy and supply shortages       various uninsured or uninsurable risks       natural disasters       changes in government regulations such as rent control       changes in real property tax rates       changes in interest rates       the reduced availability of mortgage funds which may render the sale or refinancing of properties difficult or impracticable       negative developments in the economy that depress travel activity          environmental liabilities       contingent liabilities on disposition of assets and       terrorist attacks war and other factors that are beyond our control   during  and  real estate markets in the united states europe and japan generally experienced increases in capitalization rates and declines in value as a result of the overall economic decline and the limited availability of financing as a result the value of investments in our real estate funds declined significantly in addition if our real estate funds acquire direct or indirect interests in undeveloped land or underdeveloped real property which may often be nonincome producing they will be subject to the risks normally associated with such assets and development activities including risks relating to the availability and timely receipt of zoning and other regulatory or environmental approvals the cost and timely completion of construction including risks beyond the control of our fund such as weather or labor conditions or material shortages and the availability of both construction and permanent financing on favorable terms additionally our funds properties may be managed by a third party which makes us dependent upon such third parties and subjects us to risks associated with the actions of such third parties any of these factors may cause the value of the investments in our real estate funds to decline which may have a material impact on our results of operations   we often pursue investment opportunities that involve business regulatory legal or other complexities   as an element of our investment style we may pursue unusually complex investment opportunities this can often take the form of substantial business regulatory or legal complexity that would deter other asset managers our tolerance for complexity presents risks as such transactions can be more difficult expensive and timeconsuming to finance and execute it can be more difficult to manage or realize value from the assets acquired in such transactions and such transactions sometimes entail a higher level of regulatory scrutiny or a greater risk of contingent liabilities any of these risks could harm the performance of our funds   our investment funds make investments in companies that we do not control   investments by many of our investment funds will include debt instruments and equity securities of companies that we do not control such instruments and securities may be acquired by our investment funds through trading activities or through purchases of securities from the issuer in addition our funds may acquire minority equity interests in large transactions which may be structured as consortium transactions due to the size of the investment and the amount of capital required to be invested a consortium transaction involves an equity investment in which two or more private equity firms serve together or collectively as equity sponsors we participated in a number of consortium transactions in prior years due to the increased size of many of the transactions in which we were involved consortium transactions generally entail a reduced level of control by our firm over the investment because governance rights must be shared with the other consortium sponsors accordingly we may not be able to control decisions relating to a consortium investment including decisions relating to the management and operation of the company and the timing and nature of any exit our funds may also dispose of a portion of their majority equity investments in portfolio companies over time in a manner that results in the funds retaining a minority investment those investments may be subject to the risk that the company in which the investment is made may make business financial or management decisions with which we do not agree or that the majority stakeholders or the management of the company may take risks or otherwise act in a manner that does not serve our interests if any of the foregoing were to occur the value of investments by our funds could decrease and our financial condition results of operations and cash flow could suffer as a result    our funds make investments in companies that are based outside of the united states which may expose us to additional risks not typically associated with investing in companies that are based in the united states   many of our investment funds generally invest a significant portion of their assets in the equity debt loans or other securities of issuers that are based outside of the united states a substantial amount of these investments consist of investments made by our carry funds for example as of december   approximately  of the equity invested by our carry funds was attributable to foreign investments investments in nonus securities involve risks not typically associated with investing in us securities including       certain economic and political risks including potential exchange control regulations and restrictions on our nonus investments and repatriation of profits on investments or of capital invested the risks of political economic or social instability the possibility of expropriation or confiscatory taxation and adverse economic and political developments       the imposition of nonus taxes on gains from the sale of investments by our funds       the absence of uniform accounting auditing and financial reporting standards practices and disclosure requirements and less government supervision and regulation       changes in laws or clarifications to existing laws that could impact our tax treaty positions which could adversely impact the returns on our investments       differences in the legal and regulatory environment or enhanced legal and regulatory compliance       limitations on borrowings to be used to fund acquisitions or dividends       political hostility to investments by foreign or private equity investors       less liquid markets       reliance on a more limited number of commodity inputs service providers andor distribution mechanisms       adverse fluctuations in currency exchange rates and costs associated with conversion of investment principal and income from one currency into another       higher rates of inflation       higher transaction costs       less government supervision of exchanges brokers and issuers       less developed bankruptcy corporate partnership and other laws       difficulty in enforcing contractual obligations       less stringent requirements relating to fiduciary duties       fewer investor protections and       greater price volatility   we operate in numerous national and subnational jurisdictions throughout the world and are subject to complex taxation requirements that could result in the imposition of taxes upon us that exceed the amounts we reserve for such purposes in addition the portfolio companies of our funds are typically subject to taxation in the jurisdictions in which they operate in denmark germany and france for example the deductibility of interest and other financing expenses in companies in which our funds have invested or may invest in the future may be limited this could adversely affect portfolio companies that operate in those countries and limit the benefit of additional investments in those countries    our funds investments that are denominated in a foreign currency will be subject to the risk that the value of a particular currency will change in relation to one or more other currencies among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances levels of shortterm interest rates differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies longterm opportunities for investment and capital appreciation and political developments we may employ hedging techniques to minimize these risks but we can offer no assurance that such strategies will be effective if we engage in hedging transactions we may be exposed to additional risks associated with such transactions see  risks related to our business operations  risk management activities may adversely affect the return on our funds investments   we may need to pay giveback obligations if and when they are triggered under the governing agreements with our investors   if at the end of the life of a carry fund or earlier with respect to certain of our real estate funds the carry fund has not achieved investment returns that in most cases exceed the preferred return threshold or in all cases the general partner receives net profits over the life of the fund in excess of its allocable share under the applicable partnership agreement we will be obligated to repay an amount equal to the extent to which carried interest that was previously distributed to us exceeds the amounts to which we are ultimately entitled these repayment obligations may be related to amounts previously distributed to our senior carlyle professionals prior to the completion of this offering with respect to which our common unitholders did not receive any benefit this obligation is known as a giveback obligation as of december   we had accrued a giveback obligation of  million representing the giveback obligation that would need to be paid if the carry funds were liquidated at their current fair values at that date if as of december   all of the investments held by our carry funds were deemed worthless the amount of realized and distributed carried interest subject to potential giveback would have been  million on an aftertax basis where applicable although a giveback obligation is several to each person who received a distribution and not a joint obligation the governing agreements of our funds generally provide that to the extent a recipient does not fund his or her respective share then we may have to fund such additional amounts beyond the amount of carried interest we retained although we generally will retain the right to pursue any remedies that we have under such governing agreements against those carried interest recipients who fail to fund their obligations we have historically withheld a portion of the cash from carried interest distributions to individual senior carlyle professionals and other employees as security for their potential giveback obligations however we have not at this time set aside cash reserves relating to our secondary liability for such giveback obligations or in respect of giveback obligations related to carried interest we may receive and retain in the future we intend to monitor our giveback obligations and may need to use or reserve cash to repay such giveback obligations instead of using the cash for other purposes see business  structure and operation of our investment funds  incentive arrangements  fee structure and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contractual obligations  contingent obligations giveback and notes  and  to the combined and consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this prospectus   our investment funds often make common equity investments that rank junior to preferred equity and debt in a companys capital structure   in most cases the companies in which our investment funds invest have or are permitted to have outstanding indebtedness or equity securities that rank senior to our funds investment by their terms such instruments may provide that their holders are entitled to receive payments of dividends interest or principal on or before the dates on which payments are to be made in respect of our investment also in the event of insolvency liquidation dissolution reorganization or bankruptcy of a company in which an investment is made holders of securities ranking senior to our investment would typically be entitled to receive payment in full before distributions could be made in respect of our investment after repaying senior security holders the company may not have any remaining assets to use for    repaying amounts owed in respect of our investment to the extent that any assets remain holders of claims that rank equally with our investment would be entitled to share on an equal and ratable basis in distributions that are made out of those assets also during periods of financial distress or following an insolvency the ability of our funds to influence a companys affairs and to take actions to protect their investments may be substantially less than that of the senior creditors   thirdparty investors in substantially all of our carry funds have the right to remove the general partner of the fund for cause to accelerate the liquidation date of the investment fund without cause by a simple majority vote and to terminate the investment period under certain circumstances and investors in certain of the investment funds we advise may redeem their investments these events would lead to a decrease in our revenues which could be substantial   the governing agreements of substantially all of our carry funds provide that subject to certain conditions thirdparty investors in those funds have the right to remove the general partner of the fund for cause other than the alpinvest fund of funds vehicles or to accelerate the liquidation date of the investment fund without cause by a simple majority vote resulting in a reduction in management fees we would earn from such investment funds and a significant reduction in the expected amounts of total carried interest and incentive fees from those funds carried interest and incentive fees could be significantly reduced as a result of our inability to maximize the value of investments by an investment fund during the liquidation process or in the event of the triggering of a giveback obligation finally the applicable funds would cease to exist after completion of liquidation and windingup in addition the governing agreements of our investment funds provide that in the event certain key persons in our investment funds do not meet specified time commitments with regard to managing the fund for example messrs conway daniello and rubenstein in the case of our private equity funds then investors in certain funds have the right to vote to terminate the investment period by a simple majority vote in accordance with specified procedures accelerate the withdrawal of their capital on an investorbyinvestor basis or the funds investment period will automatically terminate and the vote of a simple majority of investors is required to restart it in addition to having a significant negative impact on our revenue net income and cash flow the occurrence of such an event with respect to any of our investment funds would likely result in significant reputational damage to us and could negatively impact our future fundraising efforts   the alpinvest fund of funds vehicles generally provide for suspension or termination of investment commitments in the event of cause key person or regulatory events changes in control of carlyle or of majority ownership of alpinvest and in some cases other performance metrics but generally have not provided for liquidation without cause where alpinvest fund of funds vehicles include key person provisions they are focused on specific existing alpinvest personnel while we believe that existing alpinvest management have appropriate incentives to remain at alpinvest based on equity ownership profit participation and other contractual provisions we are not able to guarantee the ongoing participation of alpinvest management team members in respect of the alpinvest fund of funds vehicles in addition alpinvest fund of funds vehicles have historically had few or even a single investor in such cases an individual investor may hold disproportionate authority over decisions reserved for thirdparty investors   investors in our hedge funds may generally redeem their investments on an annual semiannual or quarterly basis following the expiration of a specified period of time when capital may not be withdrawn typically between one and three years subject to the applicable funds specific redemption provisions in a declining market the pace of redemptions and consequent reduction in our aum could accelerate the decrease in revenues that would result from significant redemptions in our hedge funds could have a material adverse effect on our business revenue and cash flow   in addition because our investment funds generally have an adviser that is registered under the advisers act the management agreements of all of our investment funds would be terminated upon    an assignment of these agreements without investor consent which assignment may be deemed to occur in the event these advisers were to experience a change of control we cannot be certain that consents required to assignments of our investment management agreements will be obtained if a change of control occurs assignment of these agreements without investor consent could cause us to lose the fees we earn from such investment funds   thirdparty investors in our investment funds with commitmentbased structures may not satisfy their contractual obligation to fund capital calls when requested by us which could adversely affect a funds operations and performance   investors in our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles make capital commitments to those funds that we are entitled to call from those investors at any time during prescribed periods we depend on investors fulfilling their commitments when we call capital from them in order for those funds to consummate investments and otherwise pay their obligations for example management fees when due any investor that did not fund a capital call would generally be subject to several possible penalties including having a significant amount of its existing investment forfeited in that fund however the impact of the penalty is directly correlated to the amount of capital previously invested by the investor in the fund and if an investor has invested little or no capital for instance early in the life of the fund then the forfeiture penalty may not be as meaningful investors may also negotiate for lesser or reduced penalties at the outset of the fund thereby inhibiting our ability to enforce the funding of a capital call if investors were to fail to satisfy a significant amount of capital calls for any particular fund or funds the operation and performance of those funds could be materially and adversely affected   our failure to deal appropriately with conflicts of interest in our investment business could damage our reputation and adversely affect our businesses   as we have expanded and as we continue to expand the number and scope of our businesses we increasingly confront potential conflicts of interest relating to our funds investment activities certain of our funds may have overlapping investment objectives including funds that have different fee structures and potential conflicts may arise with respect to our decisions regarding how to allocate investment opportunities among those funds for example a decision to acquire material nonpublic information about a company while pursuing an investment opportunity for a particular fund gives rise to a potential conflict of interest when it results in our having to restrict the ability of other funds to take any action we may also cause different private equity funds to invest in a single portfolio company for example where the fund that made an initial investment no longer has capital available to invest we may also cause different funds that we manage to purchase different classes of securities in the same portfolio company for example one of our clo funds could acquire a debt security issued by the same company in which one of our buyout funds owns common equity securities a direct conflict of interest could arise between the debt holders and the equity holders if such a company were to develop insolvency concerns and that conflict would have to be carefully managed by us in addition conflicts of interest may exist in the valuation of our investments and regarding decisions about the allocation of specific investment opportunities among us and our funds and the allocation of fees and costs among us our funds and their portfolio companies lastly in certain infrequent instances we may purchase an investment alongside one of our investment funds or sell an investment to one of our investment funds and conflicts may arise in respect of the allocation pricing and timing of such investments and the ultimate disposition of such investments to the extent we fail to appropriately deal with any such conflicts it could negatively impact our reputation and ability to raise additional funds and the willingness of counterparties to do business with us or result in potential litigation against us    risk management activities may adversely affect the return on our funds investments   when managing our exposure to market risks we may on our own behalf or on behalf of our funds from time to time use forward contracts options swaps caps collars and floors or pursue other strategies or use other forms of derivative instruments to limit our exposure to changes in the relative values of investments that may result from market developments including changes in prevailing interest rates currency exchange rates and commodity prices the scope of risk management activities undertaken by us varies based on the level and volatility of interest rates prevailing foreign currency exchange rates the types of investments that are made and other changing market conditions the use of hedging transactions and other derivative instruments to reduce the effects of a decline in the value of a position does not eliminate the possibility of fluctuations in the value of the position or prevent losses if the value of the position declines such transactions may also limit the opportunity for gain if the value of a position increases moreover it may not be possible to limit the exposure to a market development that is so generally anticipated that a hedging or other derivative transaction cannot be entered into at an acceptable price the success of any hedging or other derivative transaction generally will depend on our ability to correctly predict market changes the degree of correlation between price movements of a derivative instrument and the position being hedged the creditworthiness of the counterparty and other factors as a result while we may enter into such a transaction in order to reduce our exposure to market risks the transaction may result in poorer overall investment performance than if it had not been executed   certain of our fund investments may be concentrated in particular asset types or geographic regions which could exacerbate any negative performance of those funds to the extent those concentrated investments perform poorly   the governing agreements of our investment funds contain only limited investment restrictions and only limited requirements as to diversification of fund investments either by geographic region or asset type for example we advise funds that invest predominantly in the united states europe asia japan or mena and we advise funds that invest in a single industry sector such as financial services during periods of difficult market conditions or slowdowns in these sectors or geographic regions decreased revenue difficulty in obtaining access to financing and increased funding costs experienced by our funds may be exacerbated by this concentration of investments which would result in lower investment returns for our funds such concentration may increase the risk that events affecting a specific geographic region or asset type will have an adverse or disparate impact on such investment funds as compared to funds that invest more broadly   certain of our investment funds may invest in securities of companies that are experiencing significant financial or business difficulties including companies involved in bankruptcy or other reorganization and liquidation proceedings such investments may be subject to a greater risk of poor performance or loss   certain of our investment funds especially our distressed and corporate opportunities funds may invest in business enterprises involved in workouts liquidations reorganizations bankruptcies and similar transactions and may purchase high risk receivables an investment in such business enterprises entails the risk that the transaction in which such business enterprise is involved either will be unsuccessful will take considerable time or will result in a distribution of cash or a new security the value of which will be less than the purchase price to the fund of the security or other financial instrument in respect of which such distribution is received in addition if an anticipated transaction does not in fact occur the fund may be required to sell its investment at a loss investments in troubled companies may also be adversely affected by us federal and state laws relating to among other things fraudulent conveyances voidable preferences lender liability and a bankruptcy courts discretionary power to disallow subordinate or disenfranchise particular claims investments in securities and private claims of troubled companies made in connection with an    attempt to influence a restructuring proposal or plan of reorganization in a bankruptcy case may also involve substantial litigation because there is substantial uncertainty concerning the outcome of transactions involving financially troubled companies there is a potential risk of loss by a fund of its entire investment in such company   our private equity funds performance and our performance may be adversely affected by the financial performance of our portfolio companies and the industries in which our funds invest   our performance and the performance of our private equity funds is significantly impacted by the value of the companies in which our funds have invested our funds invest in companies in many different industries each of which is subject to volatility based upon economic and market factors over the last few years the credit crisis has caused significant fluctuations in the value of securities held by our funds and the global economic recession had a significant impact in overall performance activity and the demands for many of the goods and services provided by portfolio companies of the funds we advise although the us economy has begun to improve there remain many obstacles to continued growth in the economy such as high unemployment global geopolitical events risks of inflation and high deficit levels for governments in the united states and abroad these factors and other general economic trends are likely to impact the performance of portfolio companies in many industries and in particular industries that are more impacted by changes in consumer demand such as the consumer products sector and real estate in addition the value of our investments in portfolio companies in the financial services industry is impacted by the overall health and stability of the credit markets for example the recent speculation regarding the inability of greece and certain other european countries to pay their national debt the response by eurozone policy makers to mitigate this sovereign debt crisis and the concerns regarding the stability of the eurozone currency have created uncertainty in the credit markets as a result there has been a strain on banks and other financial services participants including our portfolio companies in the financial services industry which could have a material adverse impact on such portfolio companies the performance of our private equity funds and our performance may be adversely affected to the extent our fund portfolio companies in these industries experience adverse performance or additional pressure due to downward trends in respect of real estate various factors could halt or limit a recovery in the housing market and have an adverse effect on investment performance including but not limited to continued high unemployment a low level of consumer confidence in the economy andor the residential real estate market and rising mortgage interest rates   the financial projections of our portfolio companies could prove inaccurate   our funds generally establish the capital structure of portfolio companies on the basis of financial projections prepared by the management of such portfolio companies these projected operating results will normally be based primarily on judgments of the management of the portfolio companies in all cases projections are only estimates of future results that are based upon assumptions made at the time that the projections are developed general economic conditions which are not predictable along with other factors may cause actual performance to fall short of the financial projections that were used to establish a given portfolio companys capital structure because of the leverage that we typically employ in our investments this could cause a substantial decrease in the value of our equity holdings in the portfolio company the inaccuracy of financial projections could thus cause our funds performance to fall short of our expectations   contingent liabilities could harm fund performance   we may cause our funds to acquire an investment that is subject to contingent liabilities such contingent liabilities could be unknown to us at the time of acquisition or if they are known to us we may not accurately assess or protect against the risks that they present acquired contingent liabilities could thus result in unforeseen losses for our funds in addition in connection with the disposition of an investment in a portfolio company a fund may be required to make    representations about the business and financial affairs of such portfolio company typical of those made in connection with the sale of a business a fund may also be required to indemnify the purchasers of such investment to the extent that any such representations are inaccurate these arrangements may result in the incurrence of contingent liabilities by a fund even after the disposition of an investment accordingly the inaccuracy of representations and warranties made by a fund could harm such funds performance   we and our investment funds are subject to risks in using prime brokers custodians administrators and other agents   we and many of our investment funds depend on the services of prime brokers custodians administrators and other agents to carry out certain securities transactions the counterparty to one or more of our or our funds contractual arrangements could default on its obligations under the contract if a counterparty defaults we and our funds may be unable to take action to cover the exposure and we or one or more of our funds could incur material losses the consolidation and elimination of counterparties resulting from the disruption in the financial markets has increased our concentration of counterparty risk and has decreased the number of potential counterparties our funds generally are not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of their transactions with one counterparty in the event of the insolvency of a party that is holding our assets or those of our funds as collateral we and our funds may not be able to recover equivalent assets in full as we and our funds will rank among the counterpartys unsecured creditors in addition our and our funds cash held with a prime broker custodian or counterparty may not be segregated from the prime brokers custodians or counterpartys own cash and we and our funds therefore may rank as unsecured creditors in relation thereto the inability to recover our or our investment funds assets could have a material impact on us or on the performance of our funds   our fund of funds solutions business is subject to additional risks   we established our fund of funds solutions business on july   at the time we completed our acquisition of alpinvest our fund of funds solutions business is subject to additional risks including the following       the alpinvest business is subject to business and other risks and uncertainties generally consistent with our business as a whole including without limitation legal and regulatory risks the avoidance or management of conflicts of interest and the ability to attract and retain investment professionals and other personnel       we will restrict our daytoday participation in the alpinvest business which may in turn limit our ability to address risks arising from the alpinvest business for so long as alpinvest maintains separate investment operations although we maintain ultimate control over alpinvest alpinvests historical management team who are our employees will continue to exercise independent investment authority without involvement by other carlyle personnel for so long as these arrangements are in place carlyle representatives will serve on the board of alpinvest but we will observe substantial restrictions on our ability to access investment information or engage in daytoday participation in the alpinvest investment business including a restriction that alpinvest investment decisions are made and maintained without involvement by other carlyle personnel and that no specific investment data other than data on the investment performance of its client mandates will be shared as such we will have a reduced ability to identify or respond to investment and other operational issues that may arise within the alpinvest business relative to other carlyle investment funds       alpinvest is currently subject to capital requirements which may limit our ability to withdraw cash from alpinvest or require additional investments of capital in order for alpinvest to maintain certain licenses to operate its business          historically the main part of alpinvest capital commitments have been obtained from its initial coowners with such owners thereby holding highly concentrated voting rights with respect to potential suspension or termination of investment commitments made to alpinvest       alpinvest is expected to seek to broaden its client base by advising separate accounts for investors on an accountbyaccount basis alpinvest has only limited experience in attracting new clients and may not be successful in this strategy       alpinvests coinvestment business is subject to the risk that other private equity sponsors alongside whom alpinvest has historically invested in leveraged buyouts and growth capital transactions throughout europe north america and asia will no longer be willing to provide alpinvest with investment opportunities as favorable as in the past if at all as a result of our ownership of alpinvest       alpinvests secondary investments business is subject to the risk that opportunities in the secondary investments market may not be as favorable as the recent past   our hedge fund investments are subject to additional risks   investments by the hedge funds we advise are subject to additional risks including the following       generally there are few limitations on the execution of these hedge funds investment strategies which are subject to the sole discretion of the management company or the general partner of such funds       these funds may engage in shortselling which is subject to a theoretically unlimited risk of loss because there is no limit on how much the price of a security may appreciate before the short position is closed out a fund may be subject to losses if a security lender demands return of the lent securities and an alternative lending source cannot be found or if the fund is otherwise unable to borrow securities that are necessary to hedge its positions       these funds may be limited in their ability to engage in short selling or other activities as a result of regulatory mandates such regulatory actions may limit our ability to engage in hedging activities and therefore impair our investment strategies in addition these funds may invest in securities and other assets for which appropriate market hedges do not exist or cannot be acquired on attractive terms       these funds are exposed to the risk that a counterparty will not settle a transaction in accordance with its terms and conditions because of a dispute over the terms of the contract whether or not bona fide or because of a credit or liquidity problem thus causing the fund to suffer a loss       credit risk may arise through a default by one of several large institutions that are dependent on one another to meet their liquidity or operational needs so that a default by one institution causes a series of defaults by the other institutions this systemic risk could have a further material adverse effect on the financial intermediaries such as prime brokers clearing agencies clearing houses banks securities firms and exchanges with which these funds transact on a daily basis       the efficacy of investment and trading strategies depend largely on the ability to establish and maintain an overall market position in a combination of financial instruments which can be difficult to execute       these funds may make investments or hold trading positions in markets that are volatile and may become illiquid       these funds investments are subject to risks relating to investments in commodities futures options and other derivatives the prices of which are highly volatile and may be subject to a theoretically unlimited risk of loss in certain circumstances in addition the funds assets are      subject to the risk of the failure of any of the exchanges on which their positions trade or of their clearinghouses or counterparties       these funds may make investments that they do not advantageously dispose of prior to the date the applicable fund is dissolved either by expiration of such funds term or otherwise although we generally expect that investments will be disposed of prior to dissolution or be suitable for inkind distribution at dissolution and the general partners of the funds have a limited ability to extend the term of the fund with the consent of fund investors or the advisory board of the fund as applicable our funds may have to sell distribute or otherwise dispose of investments at a disadvantageous time as a result of dissolution this would result in a lower than expected return on the investments and perhaps on the fund itself   risks related to our organizational structure   our common unitholders do not elect our general partner or except in limited circumstances vote on our general partners directors and will have limited ability to influence decisions regarding our business   our general partner carlyle group management llc which is owned by our senior carlyle professionals will manage all of our operations and activities the limited liability company agreement of carlyle group management llc establishes a board of directors that will be responsible for the oversight of our business and operations unlike the holders of common stock in a corporation our common unitholders will have only limited voting rights and will have no right to remove our general partner or except in the limited circumstances described below elect the directors of our general partner our common unitholders will have no right to elect the directors of our general partner unless as determined on january  of each year the total voting power held by holders of the special voting units in the carlyle group lp including voting units held by our general partner and its affiliates in their capacity as such or otherwise held by thencurrent or former carlyle personnel treating voting units deliverable to such persons pursuant to outstanding equity awards as being held by them collectively constitutes less than  of the voting power of the outstanding voting units of the carlyle group lp unless and until the foregoing voting power condition is satisfied our general partners board of directors will be elected in accordance with its limited liability company agreement which provides that directors may be appointed and removed by members of our general partner holding a majority in interest of the voting power of the members which voting power is allocated to each member ratably according to his or her aggregate relative ownership of our common units and partnership units immediately following this offering our existing owners will collectively have  of the voting power of the carlyle group lp limited partners or  if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units as a result our common unitholders will have limited ability to influence decisions regarding our business see material provisions of the carlyle group lp partnership agreement  election of directors of general partner   our senior carlyle professionals will be able to determine the outcome of those few matters that may be submitted for a vote of the limited partners   immediately following this offering our existing owners will beneficially own  of the equity in our business or  if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units tcg carlyle global partners llc an entity whollyowned by our senior carlyle professionals will hold a special voting unit that provides it with a number of votes on any matter that may be submitted for a vote of our common unitholders voting together as a single class on all such matters that is equal to the aggregate number of vested and unvested carlyle holdings partnership units held by the limited partners of carlyle holdings accordingly immediately following this offering our existing owners generally will have sufficient voting power to determine the outcome of those few matters that may be submitted for a vote of the limited partners of the carlyle group lp see material provisions of the carlyle group lp partnership    agreement  withdrawal or removal of the general partner  meetings voting and  election of directors of general partner   our common unitholders voting rights will be further restricted by the provision in our partnership agreement stating that any common units held by a person that beneficially owns  or more of any class of the carlyle group lp common units then outstanding other than our general partner and its affiliates or a direct or subsequently approved transferee of our general partner or its affiliates cannot be voted on any matter in addition our partnership agreement will contain provisions limiting the ability of our common unitholders to call meetings or to acquire information about our operations as well as other provisions limiting the ability of our common unitholders to influence the manner or direction of our management our partnership agreement also will not restrict our general partners ability to take actions that may result in our being treated as an entity taxable as a corporation for us federal and applicable state income tax purposes furthermore the common unitholders will not be entitled to dissenters rights of appraisal under our partnership agreement or applicable delaware law in the event of a merger or consolidation a sale of substantially all of our assets or any other transaction or event   as a result of these matters and the provisions referred to under  our common unitholders do not elect our general partner or except in limited circumstances vote on our general partners directors and will have limited ability to influence decisions regarding our business our common unitholders may be deprived of an opportunity to receive a premium for their common units in the future through a sale of the carlyle group lp and the trading prices of our common units may be adversely affected by the absence or reduction of a takeover premium in the trading price   we are permitted to repurchase all of the outstanding common units under certain circumstances and this repurchase may occur at an undesirable time or price   we have the right to acquire all of our thenoutstanding common units at the thencurrent trading price either if  or less of our common units are held by persons other than our general partner and its affiliates or if we are required to register as an investment company under the  act as a result of our general partners right to purchase outstanding common units a holder of common units may have his common units purchased at an undesirable time or price   we are a limited partnership and as a result will qualify for and intend to rely on exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements under the rules of the nasdaq global select market and the securities and exchange commission   we are a limited partnership and will qualify for exceptions from certain corporate governance and other requirements of the rules of the nasdaq global select market pursuant to these exceptions limited partnerships may elect not to comply with certain corporate governance requirements of the nasdaq global select market including the requirements  that a majority of the board of directors of our general partner consist of independent directors  that we have independent director oversight of executive officer compensation and director nominations and  that we obtain unitholder approval for a certain private placements of units that equal or exceed  of the outstanding common units or voting power b certain acquisitions of stock or assets of another company or c a change of control transaction in addition we will not be required to hold annual meetings of our common unitholders following this offering we intend to avail ourselves of these exceptions accordingly you will not have the same protections afforded to equityholders of entities that are subject to all of the corporate governance requirements of the nasdaq global select market   in addition on march   the sec proposed rules to implement provisions of the doddfrank act pertaining to compensation committee independence and the role and disclosure of compensation consultants and other advisers to the compensation committee the secs proposed    rules if adopted would direct each of the national securities exchanges including the nasdaq global select market to develop listing standards requiring among other things that       compensation committees be composed of fully independent directors as determined pursuant to new independence requirements       compensation committees be explicitly charged with hiring and overseeing compensation consultants legal counsel and other committee advisors and       compensation committees be required to consider when engaging compensation consultants legal counsel or other advisors certain independence factors including factors that examine the relationship between the consultant or advisors employer and the company   as a limited partnership we will not be subject to these compensation committee independence requirements if and when they are adopted by the nasdaq global select market under the secs proposed rules   potential conflicts of interest may arise among our general partner its affiliates and us our general partner and its affiliates have limited fiduciary duties to us and our common unitholders which may permit them to favor their own interests to the detriment of us and our common unitholders   conflicts of interest may arise among our general partner and its affiliates on the one hand and us and our common unitholders on the other hand as a result of these conflicts our general partner may favor its own interests and the interests of its affiliates over the interests of our common unitholders these conflicts include among others the following       our general partner determines the amount and timing of our investments and dispositions indebtedness issuances of additional partnership interests and amounts of reserves each of which can affect the amount of cash that is available for distribution to you       our general partner is allowed to take into account the interests of parties other than us and the common unitholders in resolving conflicts of interest which has the effect of limiting its duties including fiduciary duties to our common unitholders for example our subsidiaries that serve as the general partners of our investment funds have certain duties and obligations to those funds and their investors as a result of which we expect to regularly take actions in a manner consistent with such duties and obligations but that might adversely affect our nearterm results of operations or cash flow       because our senior carlyle professionals hold their carlyle holdings partnership units directly or through entities that are not subject to corporate income taxation and the carlyle group lp holds carlyle holdings partnership units through whollyowned subsidiaries some of which are subject to corporate income taxation conflicts may arise between our senior carlyle professionals and the carlyle group lp relating to the selection structuring and disposition of investments and other matters for example the earlier disposition of assets following an exchange or acquisition transaction by a senior carlyle professional generally will accelerate payments under the tax receivable agreement and increase the present value of such payments and the disposition of assets before an exchange or acquisition transaction will increase an existing owners tax liability without giving rise to any rights of an existing owner to receive payments under the tax receivable agreement       our partnership agreement does not prohibit affiliates of the general partner including its owners from engaging in other businesses or activities including those that might directly compete with us       our general partner has limited its liability and reduced or eliminated its duties including fiduciary duties under the partnership agreement while also restricting the remedies available to our common unitholders for actions that without these limitations might constitute breaches of duty including fiduciary duty in addition we have agreed to indemnify our general      partner and its affiliates to the fullest extent permitted by law except with respect to conduct involving bad faith fraud or willful misconduct by purchasing our common units you will have agreed and consented to the provisions set forth in our partnership agreement including the provisions regarding conflicts of interest situations that in the absence of such provisions might constitute a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law       our partnership agreement will not restrict our general partner from causing us to pay it or its affiliates for any services rendered or from entering into additional contractual arrangements with any of these entities on our behalf so long as our general partner agrees to the terms of any such additional contractual arrangements in good faith as determined under the partnership agreement       our general partner determines how much debt we incur and that decision may adversely affect our credit ratings       our general partner determines which costs incurred by it and its affiliates are reimbursable by us       our general partner controls the enforcement of obligations owed to us by it and its affiliates and       our general partner decides whether to retain separate counsel accountants or others to perform services for us   see certain relationships and related person transactions and conflicts of interest and fiduciary responsibilities   our partnership agreement will contain provisions that reduce or eliminate duties including fiduciary duties of our general partner and limit remedies available to common unitholders for actions that might otherwise constitute a breach of duty it will be difficult for a common unitholder to successfully challenge a resolution of a conflict of interest by our general partner or by its conflicts committee   our partnership agreement will contain provisions that waive or consent to conduct by our general partner and its affiliates that might otherwise raise issues about compliance with fiduciary duties or applicable law for example our partnership agreement will provide that when our general partner is acting in its individual capacity as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner it may act without any fiduciary obligations to us or our common unitholders whatsoever when our general partner in its capacity as our general partner is permitted to or required to make a decision in its sole discretion or discretion or pursuant to any provision of our partnership agreement not subject to an express standard of good faith then our general partner will be entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it desires including its own interests and will have no duty or obligation fiduciary or otherwise to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting us or any limited partners and will not be subject to any different standards imposed by the partnership agreement otherwise existing at law in equity or otherwise   the modifications of fiduciary duties contained in our partnership agreement are expressly permitted by delaware law hence we and our common unitholders will only have recourse and be able to seek remedies against our general partner if our general partner breaches its obligations pursuant to our partnership agreement unless our general partner breaches its obligations pursuant to our partnership agreement we and our common unitholders will not have any recourse against our general partner even if our general partner were to act in a manner that was inconsistent with traditional fiduciary duties furthermore even if there has been a breach of the obligations set forth in our partnership agreement our partnership agreement will provide that our general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable to us or our common unitholders for errors of judgment or for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the general partner or its officers and directors acted in bad    faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct these modifications are detrimental to the common unitholders because they restrict the remedies available to common unitholders for actions that without those limitations might constitute breaches of duty including fiduciary duty   whenever a potential conflict of interest exists between us any of our subsidiaries or any of our partners and our general partner or its affiliates our general partner may resolve such conflict of interest our general partners resolution of the conflict of interest will conclusively be deemed approved by the partnership and all of our partners and not to constitute a breach of the partnership agreement or any duty unless the general partner subjectively believes such determination or action is opposed to the best interests of the partnership a common unitholder seeking to challenge this resolution of the conflict of interest would bear the burden of proving that the general partner subjectively believed that such resolution was opposed to the best interests of the partnership this is different from the situation with delaware corporations where a conflict resolution by an interested party would be presumed to be unfair and the interested party would have the burden of demonstrating that the resolution was fair   also if our general partner obtains the approval of the conflicts committee of our general partner any determination or action by the general partner will be conclusively deemed to be made or taken in good faith and not a breach by our general partner of the partnership agreement or any duties it may owe to us or our common unitholders this is different from the situation with delaware corporations where a conflict resolution by a committee consisting solely of independent directors may in certain circumstances merely shift the burden of demonstrating unfairness to the plaintiff by purchasing our common units you will have agreed and consented to the provisions set forth in our partnership agreement including the provisions regarding conflicts of interest situations that in the absence of such provisions might constitute a breach of fiduciary or other duties under applicable state law as a result common unitholders will as a practical matter not be able to successfully challenge an informed decision by the conflicts committee see certain relationships and related person transactions and conflicts of interest and fiduciary responsibilities   the control of our general partner may be transferred to a third party without common unitholder consent   our general partner may transfer its general partner interest to a third party in a merger or consolidation without the consent of our common unitholders furthermore at any time the members of our general partner may sell or transfer all or part of their limited liability company interests in our general partner without the approval of the common unitholders subject to certain restrictions as described elsewhere in this prospectus a new general partner may not be willing or able to form new investment funds and could form funds that have investment objectives and governing terms that differ materially from those of our current investment funds a new owner could also have a different investment philosophy employ investment professionals who are less experienced be unsuccessful in identifying investment opportunities or have a track record that is not as successful as carlyles track record if any of the foregoing were to occur we could experience difficulty in making new investments and the value of our existing investments our business our results of operations and our financial condition could materially suffer   our ability to pay periodic distributions to our common unitholders may be limited by our holding partnership structure applicable provisions of delaware law and contractual restrictions and obligations   the carlyle group lp is a holding partnership and has no material assets other than the ownership of the partnership units in carlyle holdings held through whollyowned subsidiaries the carlyle group lp has no independent means of generating revenue accordingly we intend to cause carlyle holdings to make distributions to its partners including the carlyle group lps whollyowned subsidiaries to fund any distributions the carlyle group lp may declare on the    common units if carlyle holdings makes such distributions the limited partners of carlyle holdings will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions pro rata based on their partnership interests in carlyle holdings because carlyle holdings i gp inc must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreement the amounts ultimately distributed by the carlyle group lp to common unitholders are expected to be less on a per unit basis than the amounts distributed by the carlyle holdings partnerships to the limited partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships in respect of their carlyle holdings partnership units   the declaration and payment of any distributions will be at the sole discretion of our general partner which may change our distribution policy at any time and there can be no assurance that any distributions whether quarterly or otherwise will or can be paid our ability to make cash distributions to our common unitholders will depend on a number of factors including among other things general economic and business conditions our strategic plans and prospects our business and investment opportunities our financial condition and operating results working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs contractual restrictions and obligations including fulfilling our current and future capital commitments legal tax and regulatory restrictions restrictions and other implications on the payment of distributions by us to our common unitholders or by our subsidiaries to us payments required pursuant to the tax receivable agreement and such other factors as our general partner may deem relevant   under the delaware limited partnership act we may not make a distribution to a partner if after the distribution all our liabilities other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the partnership would exceed the fair value of our assets if we were to make such an impermissible distribution any limited partner who received a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution was in violation of the delaware limited partnership act would be liable to us for the amount of the distribution for three years in addition the terms of our credit facility or other financing arrangements may from time to time include covenants or other restrictions that could constrain our ability to make distributions   we will be required to pay our existing owners for most of the benefits relating to any additional tax depreciation or amortization deductions that we may claim as a result of the tax basis stepup we receive in connection with subsequent sales or exchanges of carlyle holdings partnership units and related transactions in certain cases payments under the tax receivable agreement with our existing owners may be accelerated andor significantly exceed the actual tax benefits we realize and our ability to make payments under the tax receivable agreement may be limited by our structure   holders of partnership units in carlyle holdings other than the carlyle group lps whollyowned subsidiaries subject to the vesting and minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions applicable to such holders as set forth in the partnership agreements of the carlyle holdings partnerships may on a quarterly basis from and after the first anniversary of the date of the closing of this offering subject to the terms of the exchange agreement exchange their carlyle holdings partnership units for the carlyle group lp common units on a oneforone basis in addition subject to certain requirements calpers will generally be permitted to exchange carlyle holdings partnership units for common units from and after the closing of this offering and mubadala will generally be entitled to exchange carlyle holdings partnerships units for common units following the first anniversary of the closing of this offering any common units received by mubadala and calpers in any such exchange during the applicable restricted periods described in common units eligible for future sale  lockup arrangements  mubadala transfer restrictions and common units eligible for future sale  lockup arrangements  calpers transfer restrictions respectively would be subject to the restrictions described in such sections a carlyle holdings limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of the three carlyle holdings partnerships to effect an exchange for a common unit the exchanges are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of carlyle holdings these    increases in tax basis may increase for tax purposes depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of tax that carlyle holdings i gp inc and any other entity which may in the future pay taxes and become obligated to make payments under the tax receivable agreement as described in the fourth succeeding paragraph below which we refer to as the corporate taxpayers would otherwise be required to pay in the future although the irs may challenge all or part of that tax basis increase and a court could sustain such a challenge   we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with our existing owners that provides for the payment by the corporate taxpayers to our existing owners of  of the amount of cash savings if any in us federal state and local income tax or foreign or franchise tax that the corporate taxpayers realize as a result of these increases in tax basis and of certain other tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement this payment obligation is an obligation of the corporate taxpayers and not of carlyle holdings while the actual increase in tax basis as well as the amount and timing of any payments under this agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors including the timing of exchanges the price of our common units at the time of the exchange the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of our income we expect that as a result of the size of the transfers and increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of carlyle holdings the payments that we may make to our existing owners will be substantial the payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon our existing owners continued ownership of us in the event that the carlyle group lp or any of its whollyowned subsidiaries that are not treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes become taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes these entities will also be obligated to make payments under the tax receivable agreement on the same basis and to the same extent as the corporate taxpayers   the tax receivable agreement provides that upon certain changes of control or if at any time the corporate taxpayers elect an early termination of the tax receivable agreement the corporate taxpayers obligations under the tax receivable agreement with respect to all carlyle holdings partnership units whether or not previously exchanged would be calculated by reference to the value of all future payments that our existing owners would have been entitled to receive under the tax receivable agreement using certain valuation assumptions including that the corporate taxpayers will have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement and in the case of an early termination election that any carlyle holdings partnership units that have not been exchanged are deemed exchanged for the market value of the common units at the time of termination in addition our existing owners will not reimburse us for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement if such tax basis increase is successfully challenged by the irs the corporate taxpayers ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase and the payments to be made under this agreement will depend upon a number of factors including the timing and amount of our future income as a result even in the absence of a change of control or an election to terminate the tax receivable agreement payments to our existing owners under the tax receivable agreement could be in excess of the corporate taxpayers actual cash tax savings   accordingly it is possible that the actual cash tax savings realized by the corporate taxpayers may be significantly less than the corresponding tax receivable agreement payments there may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if the payments under the tax receivable agreement exceed the actual cash tax savings that the corporate taxpayers realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement andor distributions to the corporate taxpayers by carlyle holdings are not sufficient to permit the corporate taxpayers to make payments under the tax receivable agreement after they have paid taxes and other expenses based upon certain assumptions described in greater detail below under certain relationships and related person transactions  tax receivable agreement we estimate that if the corporate taxpayers were to exercise their    termination right immediately following this offering the aggregate amount of these termination payments would be approximately  million the foregoing number is merely an estimate and the actual payments could differ materially we may need to incur debt to finance payments under the tax receivable agreement to the extent our cash resources are insufficient to meet our obligations under the tax receivable agreement as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise   in the event that the carlyle group lp or any of its whollyowned subsidiaries become taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes these entities will also be obligated to make payments under the tax receivable agreement on the same basis and to the same extent as the corporate taxpayers   see certain relationships and related person transactions  tax receivable agreement   our gaap financial statements will reflect increased compensation and benefits expense and significant noncash equitybased compensation charges following this offering   prior to this offering our compensation and benefits expense has reflected compensation primarily salary and bonus solely to our employees who are not senior carlyle professionals historically all payments for services rendered by our senior carlyle professionals have been accounted for as partnership distributions rather than as compensation and benefits expense as a result our consolidated financial statements have not reflected compensation and benefits expense for services rendered by these individuals following this offering all of our senior carlyle professionals and other employees will receive a base salary that will be paid by us and accounted for as compensation and benefits expense our senior carlyle professionals and other employees are also eligible to receive discretionary cash bonuses based on the performance of carlyle and the investments of the funds that we advise and other matters the base salaries and any discretionary cash bonuses paid to our senior carlyle professionals will be represented as compensation and benefits expense on our gaap financials following the offering in addition as part of the reorganization our founders calpers and mubadala received  carlyle holdings partnership units all of which are vested and our other existing owners received  carlyle holdings partnership units of which  are unvested and  are vested in addition we have granted unvested deferred restricted common units to our employees at the time of this offering with an aggregate value based on the initial public offering price per common unit of  million  deferred restricted common units see management  ipo date equity awards the grant date fair value of the unvested carlyle holdings partnership units and deferred restricted common units which will be the initial public offering price per common unit in this offering will be charged to expense as such units vest over the assumed service periods which range up to six years on a straightline basis the amortization of this noncash equitybased compensation will increase our gaap expenses substantially during the relevant periods and as a result we may record significant net losses for a number of years following this offering see unaudited pro forma financial information and managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation for additional information   if the carlyle group lp were deemed to be an investment company under the  act applicable restrictions could make it impractical for us to continue our business as contemplated and could have a material adverse effect on our business   an entity generally will be deemed to be an investment company for purposes of the  act if       it is or holds itself out as being engaged primarily or proposes to engage primarily in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities or       absent an applicable exemption it owns or proposes to acquire investment securities having a value exceeding  of the value of its total assets exclusive of us government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis      we believe that we are engaged primarily in the business of providing asset management services and not in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities we hold ourselves out as an asset management firm and do not propose to engage primarily in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities accordingly we do not believe that the carlyle group lp is or following this offering will be an orthodox investment company as defined in section aa of the  act and described in the first bullet point above furthermore following this offering the carlyle group lp will have no material assets other than its interests in certain whollyowned subsidiaries which in turn will have no material assets other than general partner interests in the carlyle holdings partnerships these whollyowned subsidiaries will be the sole general partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships and will be vested with all management and control over the carlyle holdings partnerships we do not believe that the equity interests of the carlyle group lp in its whollyowned subsidiaries or the general partner interests of these whollyowned subsidiaries in the carlyle holdings partnerships are investment securities moreover because we believe that the capital interests of the general partners of our funds in their respective funds are neither securities nor investment securities we believe that less than  of the carlyle group lps total assets exclusive of us government securities and cash items on an unconsolidated basis after this offering will be composed of assets that could be considered investment securities accordingly we do not believe that the carlyle group lp is or following this offering will be an inadvertent investment company by virtue of the  test in section ac of the  act as described in the second bullet point above in addition we believe that the carlyle group lp is not an investment company under section b of the  act because it is primarily engaged in a noninvestment company business   the  act and the rules thereunder contain detailed parameters for the organization and operation of investment companies among other things the  act and the rules thereunder limit or prohibit transactions with affiliates impose limitations on the issuance of debt and equity securities generally prohibit the issuance of options and impose certain governance requirements we intend to conduct our operations so that the carlyle group lp will not be deemed to be an investment company under the  act if anything were to happen which would cause the carlyle group lp to be deemed to be an investment company under the  act requirements imposed by the  act including limitations on our capital structure ability to transact business with affiliates including us and ability to compensate key employees could make it impractical for us to continue our business as currently conducted impair the agreements and arrangements between and among the carlyle group lp carlyle holdings and our senior carlyle professionals or any combination thereof and materially adversely affect our business results of operations and financial condition in addition we may be required to limit the amount of investments that we make as a principal or otherwise conduct our business in a manner that does not subject us to the registration and other requirements of the  act   changes in accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb or other standardsetting bodies may adversely affect our financial statements   our financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap as defined in the accounting standards codification asc of the fasb from time to time we are required to adopt new or revised accounting standards or guidance that are incorporated into the asc it is possible that future accounting standards we are required to adopt could change the current accounting treatment that we apply to our combined and consolidated financial statements and that such changes could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations   in addition the fasb is working on several projects with the international accounting standards board which could result in significant changes as gaap converges with international financial reporting standards ifrs including how our financial statements are presented furthermore the sec is considering whether and how to incorporate ifrs into the us financial reporting system the accounting changes being proposed by the fasb will be a complete change to how we account for and report significant areas of our business the effective dates and transition    methods are not known however issuers may be required to or may choose to adopt the new standards retrospectively in this case the issuer will report results under the new accounting method as of the effective date as well as for all periods presented the changes to gaap and ultimate conversion to ifrs will impose special demands on issuers in the areas of governance employee training internal controls and disclosure and will likely affect how we manage our business as it will likely affect other business processes such as the design of compensation plans   risks related to our common units and this offering   there may not be an active trading market for our common units which may cause our common units to trade at a discount from the initial offering price and make it difficult to sell the common units you purchase   prior to this offering there has not been a public trading market for our common units it is possible that after this offering an active trading market will not develop or continue or if developed that any market will not be sustained which would make it difficult for you to sell your common units at an attractive price or at all the initial public offering price per common unit will be determined by agreement among us and the representatives of the underwriters and may not be indicative of the price at which our common units will trade in the public market after this offering   the market price of our common units may decline due to the large number of common units eligible for exchange and future sale   the market price of our common units could decline as a result of sales of a large number of common units in the market after the offering or the perception that such sales could occur these sales or the possibility that these sales may occur also might make it more difficult for us to sell common units in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate see common units eligible for future sale subject to the lockup restrictions described below we may issue and sell in the future additional common units   in addition upon completion of this offering our existing owners will own an aggregate of  carlyle holdings partnership units prior to this offering we have entered into an exchange agreement with the limited partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships so that these holders subject to the vesting and minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions applicable to such limited partners as set forth in the partnership agreements of the carlyle holdings partnerships may on a quarterly basis from and after the first anniversary of the date of the closing of this offering subject to the terms of the exchange agreement exchange their carlyle holdings partnership units for the carlyle group lp common units on a oneforone basis subject to customary conversion rate adjustments for splits unit distributions and reclassifications in addition subject to certain requirements calpers will generally be permitted to exchange carlyle holdings partnership units for common units from and after the closing of this offering and mubadala will generally be entitled to exchange carlyle holdings partnerships units for common units following the first anniversary of the closing of this offering any common units received by mubadala and calpers in any such exchange during the applicable restricted periods described in common units eligible for future sale  lockup arrangements  mubadala transfer restrictions and common units eligible for future sale  lockup arrangements  calpers transfer restrictions respectively would be subject to the restrictions described in such sections a carlyle holdings limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of the three carlyle holdings partnerships to effect an exchange for a common unit the common units we issue upon such exchanges would be restricted securities as defined in rule  under the securities act unless we register such issuances however we will enter into one or more registration rights agreements with the limited partners of carlyle holdings that would require us to register these common units under the securities act see common units eligible for future sale  registration rights and certain relationships and related person transactions  registration rights agreements while the partnership agreements of the carlyle holdings partnerships and related    agreements will contractually restrict our existing owners ability to transfer the carlyle holdings partnership units or the carlyle group lp common units they hold these contractual provisions may lapse over time or be waived modified or amended at any time see management  vesting minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions   mubadala will have the ability to sell its equity interests whether held in the form of common units partnership units or otherwise subject to the transfer restrictions set forth in the subscription agreement described under common units eligible for future sale  lockup arrangements  mubadala transfer restrictions except for the restrictions described under common units eligible for future sale  lockup arrangements  calpers transfer restrictions the carlyle holdings partnership units held by calpers are not subject to transfer restrictions we have also agreed to provide mubadala and calpers with registration rights to effect certain sales see common units eligible for future sale  registration rights   under our equity incentive plan we have granted to our employees at the time of this offering deferred restricted common units with an aggregate value based on the initial public offering price per common unit in this offering of  million  deferred restricted common units and phantom deferred restricted common units with an aggregate value based on the initial public offering price per common unit in this offering of  million  phantom deferred restricted common units additional common units and carlyle holdings partnership units will be available for future grant under our equity incentive plan which plan provides for automatic annual increases in the number of units available for future issuance see management  equity incentive plan and  ipo date equity awards we have filed a registration statement and intend to file additional registration statements on form s under the securities act to register common units or securities convertible into or exchangeable for common units issued or available for future grant under our equity incentive plan including pursuant to automatic annual increases any such form s registration statement will automatically become effective upon filing accordingly common units registered under such registration statement will be available for sale in the open market the initial registration statement on form s covered  common units   in addition our partnership agreement authorizes us to issue an unlimited number of additional partnership securities and options rights warrants and appreciation rights relating to partnership securities for the consideration and on the terms and conditions established by our general partner in its sole discretion without the approval of any limited partners in accordance with the delaware limited partnership act and the provisions of our partnership agreement we may also issue additional partnership interests that have certain designations preferences rights powers and duties that are different from and may be senior to those applicable to common units similarly the carlyle holdings partnership agreements authorize the whollyowned subsidiaries of the carlyle group lp which are the general partners of those partnerships to issue an unlimited number of additional partnership securities of the carlyle holdings partnerships with such designations preferences rights powers and duties that are different from and may be senior to those applicable to the carlyle holdings partnerships units and which may be exchangeable for our common units   if securities or industry analysts do not publish research or reports about our business or if they downgrade their recommendations regarding our common units our stock price and trading volume could decline   the trading market for our common units will be influenced by the research and reports that industry or securities analysts publish about us or our business if any of the analysts who cover us downgrades our common units or publishes inaccurate or unfavorable research about our business our common unit stock price may decline if analysts cease coverage of us or fail to regularly publish reports on us we could lose visibility in the financial markets which in turn could cause our common unit stock price or trading volume to decline and our common units to be less liquid    the market price of our common units may be volatile which could cause the value of your investment to decline   even if a trading market develops the market price of our common units may be highly volatile and could be subject to wide fluctuations securities markets worldwide experience significant price and volume fluctuations this market volatility as well as general economic market or political conditions could reduce the market price of common units in spite of our operating performance in addition our operating results could be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors due to a number of potential factors including variations in our quarterly operating results or distributions to unitholders additions or departures of key management personnel failure to meet analysts earnings estimates publication of research reports about our industry litigation and government investigations changes or proposed changes in laws or regulations or differing interpretations or enforcement thereof affecting our business adverse market reaction to any indebtedness we may incur or securities we may issue in the future changes in market valuations of similar companies or speculation in the press or investment community announcements by our competitors of significant contracts acquisitions dispositions strategic partnerships joint ventures or capital commitments adverse publicity about the industries in which we participate or individual scandals and in response the market price of our common units could decrease significantly you may be unable to resell your common units at or above the initial public offering price   in the past few years stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations in the past following periods of volatility in the overall market and the market price of a companys securities securities class action litigation has often been instituted against public companies this type of litigation if instituted against us could result in substantial costs and a diversion of our managements attention and resources   you will suffer dilution in the net tangible book value of the common units you purchase   the initial public offering price per common unit is substantially higher than our pro forma net tangible book value per common unit immediately after this offering as a result you will pay a price per common unit that substantially exceeds the book value of our total tangible assets after subtracting our total liabilities at the initial public offering price of  per common unit you will incur immediate dilution in an amount of  per common unit assuming that the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional common units see certain relationships and related person transactions  exchange agreement and dilution   risks related to us taxation   our structure involves complex provisions of us federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available our structure also is subject to potential legislative judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations possibly on a retroactive basis   the us federal income tax treatment of common unitholders depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of us federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available you should be aware that the us federal income tax rules are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the irs and the us treasury department frequently resulting in revised interpretations of established concepts statutory changes revisions to regulations and other modifications and interpretations the irs pays close attention to the proper application of tax laws to partnerships the present us federal income tax treatment of an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative legislative or judicial interpretation at any time possibly on a retroactive basis and any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made changes to the us federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the exception for us to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes that is not taxable as a corporation referred to as the qualifying income exception affect or cause us to change our investments and commitments affect the tax considerations of an investment in us    change the character or treatment of portions of our income including for instance the treatment of carried interest as ordinary income rather than capital gain and adversely affect an investment in our common units for example as discussed above under  risks related to our company although not enacted the us congress has considered legislation that would have i in some cases after a tenyear transition period precluded us from qualifying as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or required us to hold carried interest through taxable subsidiary corporations and ii taxed certain income and gains at increased rates if any similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us the after tax income and gain related to our business as well as our distributions to you and the market price of our common units could be reduced the us congress has considered various legislative proposals to treat all or part of the capital gain and dividend income that is recognized by an investment partnership and allocable to a partner affiliated with the sponsor of the partnership ie a portion of the carried interest as ordinary income to such partner for us federal income tax purposes   our organizational documents and governing agreements will permit our general partner to modify our limited partnership agreement from time to time without the consent of the common unitholders to address certain changes in us federal income tax regulations legislation or interpretation in some circumstances such revisions could have a material adverse impact on some or all common unitholders for instance our general partner could elect at some point to treat us as an association taxable as a corporation for us federal and applicable state income tax purposes if our general partner were to do this the us federal income tax consequences of owning our common units would be materially different moreover we will apply certain assumptions and conventions in an attempt to comply with applicable rules and to report income gain deduction loss and credit to common unitholders in a manner that reflects such common unitholders beneficial ownership of partnership items taking into account variation in ownership interests during each taxable year because of trading activity as a result a common unitholder transferring units may be allocated income gain loss and deductions realized after the date of transfer however those assumptions and conventions may not be in compliance with all aspects of applicable tax requirements it is possible that the irs will assert successfully that the conventions and assumptions used by us do not satisfy the technical requirements of the internal revenue code andor treasury regulations and could require that items of income gain deductions loss or credit including interest deductions be adjusted reallocated or disallowed in a manner that adversely affects common unitholders   if we were treated as a corporation for us federal income tax or state tax purposes or otherwise became subject to additional entity level taxation including as a result of changes to current law then our distributions to you would be substantially reduced and the value of our common units would be adversely affected   the value of your investment in us depends in part on our being treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes which requires that  or more of our gross income for every taxable year consist of qualifying income as defined in section  of the internal revenue code and that our partnership not be registered under the  act qualifying income generally includes dividends interest capital gains from the sale or other disposition of stocks and securities and certain other forms of investment income we may not meet these requirements or current law may change so as to cause in either event us to be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes or otherwise subject to us federal income tax moreover the anticipated aftertax benefit of an investment in our common units depends largely on our being treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes we have not requested and do not plan to request a ruling from the irs on this or any other matter affecting us   if we were treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes we would pay us federal income tax on our taxable income at the applicable tax rates in addition we would likely be liable for state and local income andor franchise tax on all our income distributions to you would generally be taxed again as corporate distributions and no income gains losses deductions or credits would otherwise flow through to you because a tax would be imposed upon    us as a corporation our distributions to you would be substantially reduced which would cause a reduction in the value of our common units   current law may change causing us to be treated as a corporation for us federal or state income tax purposes or otherwise subjecting us to additional entity level taxation see  risks related to our company although not enacted the us congress has considered legislation that would have i in some cases after a tenyear transition period precluded us from qualifying as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or required us to hold carried interest through taxable subsidiary corporations and ii taxed certain income and gains at increased rates if any similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us the after tax income and gain related to our business as well as our distributions to you and the market price of our common units could be reduced for example because of widespread state budget deficits several states are evaluating ways to subject partnerships to entity level taxation through the imposition of state income franchise or other forms of taxation if any state were to impose a tax upon us as an entity our distributions to you would be reduced   you will be subject to us federal income tax on your share of our taxable income regardless of whether you receive any cash distributions from us   as long as  of our gross income for each taxable year constitutes qualifying income as defined in section  of the internal revenue code and we are not required to register as an investment company under the  act on a continuing basis and assuming there is no change in law we will be treated for us federal income tax purposes as a partnership and not as an association or a publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation accordingly you will be required to take into account your allocable share of our items of income gain loss and deduction distributions to you generally will be taxable for us federal income tax purposes only to the extent the amount distributed exceeds your tax basis in the common unit that treatment contrasts with the treatment of a shareholder in a corporation for example a shareholder in a corporation who receives a distribution of earnings from the corporation generally will report the distribution as dividend income for us federal income tax purposes in contrast a holder of our common units who receives a distribution of earnings from us will not report the distribution as dividend income and will treat the distribution as taxable only to the extent the amount distributed exceeds the unitholders tax basis in the common units but will instead report the holders allocable share of items of our income for us federal income tax purposes as a result you may be subject to us federal state local and possibly in some cases foreign income taxation on your allocable share of our items of income gain loss deduction and credit including our allocable share of those items of any entity in which we invest that is treated as a partnership or is otherwise subject to tax on a flow through basis for each of our taxable years ending with or within your taxable

foreign investment company pfic may produce taxable income prior to the receipt of cash relating to such income and common unitholders that are us taxpayers will be required to take such income into account in determining their taxable income in the event of an inadvertent termination of our partnership status for which the irs has granted us limited relief each holder of our common units may be obligated to make such adjustments as the irs may require to maintain our status as a partnership    such adjustments may require persons holding our common units to recognize additional amounts in income during the years in which they hold such units   the carlyle group lps interest in certain of our businesses will be held through carlyle holdings i gp inc which will be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes such corporation may be liable for significant taxes and may create other adverse tax consequences which could potentially adversely affect the value of

through carlyle holdings i gp inc which will be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes such corporation could be liable for significant us federal income taxes and applicable state local and other taxes that would not otherwise be incurred which could adversely affect the value of your investment those additional taxes have not applied to our existing owners in our organizational structure in effect before this offering and will not apply to our existing owners following this offering to the extent they own equity interests directly or indirectly in the carlyle holdings partnerships   complying with certain taxrelated requirements may cause us to invest through foreign or domestic corporations subject to corporate income tax or enter into acquisitions borrowings financings or arrangements we may not have otherwise entered into   in order for us to be treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes and not as an association or publicly traded partnership taxable as a corporation we must meet the qualifying income exception discussed above on a continuing basis and we must not be required to register as an investment company under the  act in order to effect such treatment we or our subsidiaries may be required to invest through foreign or domestic corporations subject to corporate income tax forgo attractive investment opportunities or enter into acquisitions borrowings financings or other transactions we may not have otherwise entered into this may adversely affect our ability to operate solely to maximize our cash flow   our structure also may impede our ability to engage in certain corporate acquisitive transactions because we generally intend to hold all of our assets through the carlyle holdings partnerships in addition we may be unable to participate in certain corporate reorganization transactions that would be taxfree to our common unit holders if we were a corporation   tax gain or loss on disposition of our common units could be more or less than expected   if you sell your common units you will recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the amount realized and the adjusted tax basis in those common units prior distributions to you in excess of the total net taxable income allocated to you which decreased the tax basis in your common units will in effect become taxable income to you if the common units are sold at a price greater than your tax basis in those common units even if the price is less than the original cost a portion of the amount realized whether or not representing gain may be ordinary income to you   because we do not intend to make or cause to be made an otherwise available election under section  of the internal revenue code to adjust our asset basis or the asset basis of certain of the carlyle holdings partnerships a holder of common units could be allocated more taxable income in respect of those common units prior to disposition than if we had made such an election   we currently do not intend to make or cause to be made an election to adjust asset basis under section  of the internal revenue code with respect to us or carlyle holdings ii lp if no such election is made there generally will be no adjustment to the basis of the assets of carlyle holdings ii lp upon our acquisition of interests in carlyle holdings ii lp in

interests or units immediately prior to the acquisition consequently upon a sale of an asset by us carlyle holdings ii lp gain allocable to a holder of common units could include builtin gain in the asset existing at the time we acquired those interests or such holder acquired such units which builtin gain would otherwise generally be eliminated if we had made a section  election see material us federal tax considerations  consequences to us holders of common units  section  election   nonus persons face unique us tax issues from owning common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them   in light of our intended investment activities we generally do not expect to generate significant amounts of income treated as effectively connected income with respect to nonus holders of our common units eci however there can be no assurance that we will not generate eci currently or in the future and subject to the qualifying income rules described under material us federal tax considerations  taxation of our partnership and the carlyle holdings partnerships we are under no obligation to minimize eci to the extent our income is treated as eci nonus holders generally would be subject to withholding tax on their allocable shares of such income would be required to file a us federal income tax return for such year reporting their allocable shares of income effectively connected with such trade or business and any other income treated as eci and would be subject to us federal income tax at regular us tax rates on any such income state and local income taxes and filings may also apply in that event in addition certain income of nonus holders from us sources not connected to any such us trade or business conducted by us could be treated as eci nonus holders that are corporations may also be subject to a  branch profits tax on their allocable share of such income in addition certain income from us sources that is not eci allocable to nonus holders will be reduced by withholding taxes imposed at the highest effective applicable tax rate a portion of any gain recognized by a nonus holder on the sale or exchange of common units could also be treated as eci   taxexempt entities face unique tax issues from owning common units that may result in adverse tax consequences to them   in light of our intended investment activities we generally do not expect to make investments directly in operating businesses that generate significant amounts of unrelated business taxable income for taxexempt holders of our common units ubti however certain of our investments may be treated as debtfinanced investments which may give rise to debtfinanced ubti accordingly no assurance can be given that we will not generate ubti currently or in the future and subject to the qualifying income rules described under material us federal tax considerations  taxation of our partnership and the carlyle holdings partnerships we are under no obligation to minimize ubti consequently a holder of common units that is a taxexempt organization may be subject to unrelated business income tax to the extent that its allocable share of our income consists of ubti a taxexempt partner of a partnership could be treated as earning ubti if the partnership regularly engages in a trade or business that is unrelated to the exempt function of the taxexempt partner if the partnership derives income from debtfinanced property or if the partnership interest itself is debtfinanced   we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units and we will therefore adopt certain income tax accounting positions that may not conform with all aspects of applicable tax requirements the irs may challenge this treatment which could adversely affect the value of our common units   because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units we will adopt depreciation amortization and other tax accounting positions that may not conform with all aspects of existing treasury regulations a successful irs challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our common unitholders it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain on the sale of common units and could have a negative    impact on the value of our common units or result in audits of and adjustments to our common unitholders tax returns   in addition our taxable income and losses will be determined and apportioned among investors using conventions we regard as consistent with applicable law as a result if you transfer your common units you may be allocated income gain loss and deduction realized by us after the date of transfer similarly a transferee may be allocated income gain loss and deduction realized by us prior to the date of the transferees acquisition of our common units a transferee may also bear the cost of withholding tax imposed with respect to income allocated to a transferor through a reduction in the cash distributed to the transferee   the sale or exchange of  or more of our capital and profit interests will result in the termination of our partnership for us federal income tax purposes we will be considered to have been terminated for us federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of  or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a twelvemonth period our termination would among other things result in the closing of our taxable year for all common unitholders and could result in a deferral of depreciation deductions allowable in computing our taxable income see material us federal tax considerations for a description of the consequences of our termination for us federal income tax purposes   common unitholders may be subject to state and local taxes and return filing requirements as a result of investing in our common units   in addition to us federal income taxes our common unitholders may be subject to other taxes including state and local taxes unincorporated business taxes and estate inheritance or intangible taxes that are imposed by the various jurisdictions in which we do business or own property now or in the future even if our common unitholders do not reside in any of those jurisdictions our common unitholders may also be required to file state and local income tax returns and pay state and local income taxes in some or all of these jurisdictions further common unitholders may be subject to penalties for failure to comply with those requirements it is the responsibility of each common unitholder to file all us federal state and local tax returns that may be required of such common unitholder our counsel has not rendered an opinion on the state or local tax consequences of an investment in our common units   we may not be able to furnish to each unitholder specific tax information within  days after the close of each calendar year which means that holders of common units who are us taxpayers should anticipate the need to file annually a request for an extension of the due date of their income tax return in addition it is possible that common unitholders may be required to file amended income tax returns   as a publicly traded partnership our operating results including distributions of income dividends gains losses or deductions and adjustments to carrying basis will be reported on schedule k and distributed to each unitholder annually although we currently intend to distribute schedule ks on or around  days after the end of our fiscal year it may require longer than  days after the end of our fiscal year to obtain the requisite information from all lowertier entities so that ks may be prepared for us for this reason holders of common units who are us taxpayers should anticipate that they may need to file annually with the irs and certain states a request for an extension past april  or the otherwise applicable due date of their income tax return for the taxable year see material us federal tax considerations  administrative matters  information returns   in addition it is possible that a common unitholder will be required to file amended income tax returns as a result of adjustments to items on the corresponding income tax returns of the partnership any obligation for a common unitholder to file amended income tax returns for that or    any other reason including any costs incurred in the preparation or filing of such returns are the responsibility of each common unitholder   we may hold or acquire certain investments through an entity classified as a pfic or cfc for us federal income tax purposes   certain of our investments may be in foreign corporations or may be acquired through a foreign subsidiary that would be classified as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes such an entity may be a pfic or a cfc for us federal income tax purposes us holders of common units indirectly owning an interest in a pfic or a cfc may experience adverse us tax consequences see material us federal tax considerations  consequences to us holders of common units  passive foreign investment companies and  consequences to us holders of common units controlled foreign companies for additional information regarding such consequences   changes in us tax law could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from certain foreign investors   under the us foreign account tax compliance act fatca following the expiration of an initial phase inperiod a broadly defined class of foreign financial institutions are required to comply with a complicated and expansive reporting regime or be subject to certain us withholding taxes the reporting obligations imposed under fatca require foreign financial institutions to enter into agreements with the irs to obtain and disclose information about certain account holders and investors to the irs additionally certain nonus entities that are not foreign financial institutions are required to provide certain certifications or other information regarding their us beneficial ownership or be subject to certain us withholding taxes although administrative guidance and proposed regulations have been issued regulations implementing fatca have not yet been finalized and it is difficult to determine at this time what impact any such guidance may have thus some foreign investors may hesitate to invest in us funds until there is more certainty around fatca implementation in addition the administrative and economic costs of compliance with fatca may discourage some foreign investors from investing in us funds which could adversely affect our ability to raise funds from these investors

following this offering as discussed in greater detail below and in this section the carlyle group lp will hold through whollyowned subsidiaries a number of carlyle holdings partnership units that is equal to the number of common units that the carlyle group lp has issued and will benefit from the income of carlyle holdings to the extent of its equity interests in the carlyle holdings partnerships

economically identical in all respects to the carlyle holdings partnership units that will be held by our existing owners accordingly the income of carlyle holdings will benefit the carlyle group lp

will hold a special voting unit that provides it with a number of votes on any matter that may be submitted for a vote of our common unitholders that is equal to the aggregate number of vested and unvested carlyle holdings partnership units held by the limited partners of carlyle holdings we refer to our common units other than those held by any person whom our general partner may from time to time with such persons consent designate as a nonvoting common unitholder and our special voting units as voting units our common unitholders voting rights will be further restricted by the provision in our partnership agreement stating that any common units held by a person that beneficially owns  or more of any class of the carlyle group lp common units then outstanding other than our general partner and its affiliates or a direct or subsequently approved transferee of our general partner or its affiliates cannot be voted on any matter    in general our common unitholders will have no right to elect the directors of our general partner however when our senior carlyle professionals and other thencurrent or former carlyle personnel hold less than  of the limited partner voting power our common unitholders will have the right to vote in the election of the directors of our general partner this voting power condition will be measured on january  of each year and will be triggered if the total voting power held by holders of the special voting units in the carlyle group lp including voting units held by our general partner and its affiliates in their capacity as such or otherwise held by thencurrent or former carlyle personnel treating voting units deliverable to such persons pursuant to outstanding equity awards as being held by them collectively constitutes less than  of the voting power of the outstanding voting units of the carlyle group lp see material provisions of the carlyle group lp partnership agreement  election of directors of general partner unless and until the foregoing voting power condition is satisfied our general partners board of directors will be elected in accordance with its limited liability company agreement which provides that directors may be appointed and removed by members of our general partner holding a majority in interest of the voting power of the members which voting power is allocated to each member ratably

directly by such persons and are no longer consolidated in our financial statements and ii restructured the remainder of these interests approximately  million as of december   so that they are reflected as noncontrolling interests in our financial statements in addition prior to the offering the parent entities have restructured ownership of certain carried interest rights allocated to

for approximately  million of our performance fee revenue for the year ended december   see unaudited pro forma financial information   distribution of earnings   during  in the ordinary course of business we have made distributions to our existing owners including distributions sourced from realized carried interest and incentive fees prior to the date of the offering the parent entities have

carlyle holdings limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of the three carlyle holdings partnerships to effect an exchange for a common unit as the number of carlyle holdings partnership units held by the limited partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships declines the number of votes to which tcg carlyle global partners llc is entitled as a result of its ownership of the special voting unit will be correspondingly reduced see certain relationships and related person transactions  exchange agreement   future exchanges of carlyle holdings partnership units are expected to result in transfers of and increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of carlyle holdings primarily attributable to a portion of the goodwill inherent in our business these transfers and increases in tax basis will increase for tax purposes depreciation and amortization and therefore reduce the amount of tax that certain of our subsidiaries including carlyle holdings i gp inc which we refer to as the corporate taxpayers would otherwise be required to pay in the future this increase in    tax basis may also decrease gain or increase loss on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets we entered into a tax receivable agreement with our existing owners whereby the corporate taxpayers have agreed to pay to our existing owners  of the amount of cash tax savings if any in us federal state and local income tax or foreign or franchise tax that it realizes as a result of these increases in tax basis and in limited cases transfers or prior increases in tax basis see certain relationships and related person transactions  tax receivable agreement   offering transactions   we estimate that the net proceeds to the carlyle group lp from this offering after deducting estimated underwriting discounts will be approximately  million or  million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units the carlyle group lp intends to use all of these proceeds to purchase newly issued carlyle holdings partnership units from carlyle holdings see use of proceeds accordingly the carlyle group lp will hold through the carlyle holdings general partners a number of carlyle holdings partnership units equal to the aggregate number of common units that the carlyle group lp has issued in connection with this offering from carlyle holdings   at the time of this offering we have granted to our employees deferred restricted common units with an aggregate value based on the initial public offering price per common unit in this offering of approximately  million  deferred restricted common units and phantom deferred restricted common units with an aggregate value based on the initial public offering price per common unit in this offering of approximately  million  phantom deferred restricted common units in addition at the time of this offering we have granted to our directors who are not employees of or advisors to carlyle deferred restricted common units with an aggregate value based on the initial public offering price per common unit in this offering of approximately  million  deferred restricted common units see management  director compensation additional common units and carlyle holdings partnership units will be available for future grant under our equity incentive plan which plan provides for automatic annual increases in the number of units available for future issuance see management  ipo date equity awards   we refer to the above described transactions as the offering transactions   as a result immediately following the offering transactions       the carlyle group lp through its whollyowned subsidiaries will hold  partnership units in carlyle holdings or  partnership units if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units and will through its whollyowned subsidiaries be the sole general partner of each of the carlyle holdings partnerships and through carlyle holdings and its subsidiaries operate the contributed businesses       our existing owners will hold  vested partnership units and  unvested partnership units in carlyle holdings and more specifically       our founders calpers and mubadala will hold  vested partnership units and       our other existing owners will hold  vested partnership units and  unvested partnership units       investors in this offering will hold  common units or  common units if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units and       on those few matters that may be submitted for a vote of the limited partners of the carlyle group lp such as the approval of amendments to the limited partnership agreement of the carlyle group lp that the limited partnership agreement does not authorize our general      partner to approve without the consent of the limited partners and the approval of certain mergers or sales of all or substantially all of our assets       investors in this offering will collectively have  of the voting power of the carlyle group lp

group lp limited partners or  if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units   these percentages correspond with the percentages of the carlyle holdings partnership units that will be held by the carlyle group lp through its whollyowned subsidiaries on the one hand and by our existing owners on the other hand   holding partnership structure   as discussed in material us federal tax considerations the carlyle group lp will be treated as a partnership and not as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes an entity that is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes is not a taxable entity and incurs no us federal income tax liability instead each partner is required to take into account its allocable share of items of income gain loss and deduction of the partnership in computing its us federal income tax liability regardless of whether or not cash distributions are made investors in this offering will become partners in the carlyle group lp distributions of cash by a partnership to a partner are generally not taxable unless the amount of cash distributed to a partner is in excess of the partners adjusted basis in its partnership interest however our partnership agreement does not restrict our ability to take actions that may result in our being treated as an entity taxable as a corporation for us federal and applicable state income tax purposes see material us federal tax considerations for a summary discussing certain us federal income tax considerations related to the purchase ownership and disposition of our common units as of the date of this prospectus   we believe that the carlyle holdings partnerships will also be treated as partnerships and not as corporations for us federal income tax purposes accordingly the holders of partnership units in carlyle holdings including the carlyle group lps whollyowned subsidiaries will incur us federal state and local income taxes on their proportionate share of any net taxable income of carlyle holdings net profits and net losses of carlyle holdings generally will be allocated to its partners including the carlyle group lps whollyowned subsidiaries pro rata in accordance with the percentages of their respective partnership interests because the carlyle group lp will indirectly own  of the total partnership units in carlyle holdings or  if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units the carlyle group lp will indirectly be allocated  of the net profits and net losses of carlyle holdings or  if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units the remaining net profits and net losses will be allocated to the limited partners of carlyle holdings these percentages are subject to change including upon an exchange of carlyle holdings partnership units for the carlyle group lp common units and upon issuance of additional the carlyle group lp common units to the public the carlyle group lp will hold through whollyowned subsidiaries a number of carlyle holdings partnership units equal to the number of common units that the carlyle group lp has issued   after this offering we intend to cause carlyle holdings to make distributions to its partners including the carlyle group lps whollyowned subsidiaries in order to fund any distributions the carlyle group lp may declare on the common units if carlyle holdings makes such distributions the limited partners of carlyle holdings will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions pro rata based on their partnership interests in carlyle holdings because carlyle holdings i gp inc must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreement the amounts ultimately distributed by the carlyle group lp to common unitholders are expected to be    less on a per unit basis than the amounts distributed by the carlyle holdings partnerships to the limited partners of carlyle holdings in respect of their carlyle holdings partnership units   the partnership agreements of the carlyle holdings partnerships will provide for cash distributions which we refer to as tax distributions to the partners of such partnerships if the whollyowned subsidiaries of the carlyle group lp which are the general partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships determine that the taxable income of the relevant partnership will give rise to taxable income for its partners generally these tax distributions will be computed based on our estimate of the net taxable income of the relevant partnership allocable to a partner multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the highest effective marginal combined us federal state and local income tax rate prescribed for an individual or corporate resident in new york new york taking into account the nondeductibility of certain expenses and the character of our income if we had effected the reorganization on january   the assumed effective tax rate for  would have been approximately  the carlyle holdings partnerships will make tax distributions only to the extent distributions from such partnerships for the relevant year were otherwise insufficient to cover such tax liabilities the carlyle group lp is not required to distribute to its common unitholders any of the cash that its whollyowned subsidiaries may receive as a result of tax distributions by the carlyle holdings partnerships      use of proceeds   we estimate that the net proceeds to the carlyle group lp from this offering after deducting estimated underwriting discounts will be approximately  million or  million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common units   the carlyle group lp intends to use all of these proceeds to purchase newly issued carlyle holdings partnership units from carlyle holdings as described under organizational structure  offering transactions we intend to cause carlyle holdings to use substantially all of these proceeds to repay the remaining outstanding indebtedness under the revolving credit facility of our existing senior secured credit facility we intend to cause carlyle holdings to use any proceeds from the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase additional common units from us to repay indebtedness under a loan agreement we entered into in connection with the acquisition of claren road and any remainder for general corporate purposes including general operational needs growth initiatives acquisitions and strategic investments and to fund capital commitments to and other investments in and alongside of our investment funds we anticipate that the acquisitions we may pursue will be those that would broaden our platform where we believe we can provide investors with differentiated products to meet their needs carlyle holdings will also bear or reimburse the carlyle group lp for all of the expenses of this offering which we estimate will be approximately  million   outstanding borrowings under our revolving credit facility were  million as of december   and  million as of may   our revolving credit facility matures on september   and currently bears interest at a rate equal to at our option either a at an alternate base rate plus an applicable margin not to exceed  or b at libor plus an applicable margin not to exceed  borrowings under our revolving credit facility have been used to fund the redemption of the subordinated notes payable to mubadala portions of the consideration andor related transaction

operations  recent transactions and notes   and  to the combined and consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus affiliates of some of the underwriters are lenders under the revolving credit facility and will receive proceeds to the extent their currently outstanding loans under that facility are repaid as described above see underwriting the claren road loan matures on december   and bears interest at an adjustable annual rate currently     cash distribution policy   our general partner currently intends to cause the carlyle group lp to make quarterly distributions to our common unitholders of its share of distributions from carlyle holdings net of taxes and amounts payable under the tax receivable agreement as described below we currently anticipate that we will cause carlyle holdings to make quarterly distributions to its partners including the carlyle group lps wholly owned subsidiaries that will enable the carlyle group lp to pay a quarterly distribution of  per common unit with the first such quarterly distribution being ratably reduced to reflect the portion of the quarter following the completion of this offering in addition we currently anticipate that we will cause carlyle holdings to make annual distributions to its partners including the carlyle group lps wholly owned subsidiaries in an amount that taken together with the other abovedescribed quarterly distributions represents substantially all of our distributable earnings in excess of the amount determined by our general partner to be necessary or appropriate to provide for the conduct of our business to make appropriate investments in our business and our funds or to comply with applicable law or any of our financing agreements we anticipate that the aggregate amount of our distributions for most years will be less than our distributable earnings for that year due to these funding requirements   notwithstanding the foregoing the declaration and payment of any distributions will be at the sole discretion of our general partner which may change our distribution policy at any time our general partner will take into account       general economic and business conditions       our strategic plans and prospects       our business and investment opportunities       our financial condition and operating results including our cash position our net income and our realizations on investments made by our investment funds       working capital requirements and anticipated cash needs       contractual restrictions and obligations including payment obligations pursuant to the tax receivable agreement and restrictions pursuant to our credit facility       legal tax and regulatory restrictions       other constraints on the payment of distributions by us to our common unitholders or by our subsidiaries to us and       such other factors as our general partner may deem relevant   because the carlyle group lp is a holding partnership and has no material assets other than its ownership of partnership units in carlyle holdings held through whollyowned subsidiaries we will fund distributions by the carlyle group lp if any in three steps       first we will cause carlyle holdings to make distributions to its partners including the carlyle group lps whollyowned subsidiaries if carlyle holdings makes such distributions the limited partners of carlyle holdings will be entitled to receive equivalent distributions pro rata based on their partnership interests in carlyle holdings       second we will cause the carlyle group lps whollyowned subsidiaries to distribute to the carlyle group lp their share of such distributions net of taxes and amounts payable under the tax receivable agreement by such whollyowned subsidiaries and       third the carlyle group lp will distribute its net share of such distributions to our common unitholders on a pro rata basis   because our whollyowned subsidiaries must pay taxes and make payments under the tax receivable agreement the amounts ultimately distributed by us to our common unitholders are    expected to be less on a per unit basis than the amounts distributed by the carlyle holdings partnerships to the limited partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships in respect of their carlyle holdings partnership units   in addition the partnership agreements of the carlyle holdings partnerships will provide for cash distributions which we refer to as tax distributions to the partners of such partnerships if the whollyowned subsidiaries of the carlyle group lp which are the general partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships determine that the taxable income of the relevant partnership will give rise to taxable income for its partners generally these tax distributions will be computed based on our estimate of the net taxable income of the relevant partnership allocable to a partner multiplied by an assumed tax rate equal to the highest effective marginal combined us federal state and local income tax rate prescribed for an individual or corporate resident in new york new york taking into account the nondeductibility of certain expenses and the character of our income the carlyle holdings partnerships will make tax distributions only to the extent distributions from such partnerships for the relevant year were otherwise insufficient to cover such tax liabilities the carlyle group lp is not required to distribute to its common unitholders any of the cash that its whollyowned subsidiaries may receive as a result of tax distributions by the carlyle holdings partnerships   under the delaware limited partnership act we may not make a distribution to a partner if after the distribution all our liabilities other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the partnership would exceed the fair value of our assets if we were to make such an impermissible distribution any limited partner who received a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution was in violation of the delaware limited partnership act would be liable to us for the amount of the distribution for three years in addition the terms of our credit facility provide certain limits on our ability to make distributions see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation  liquidity and capital resources   in addition carlyle holdings cash flow from operations may be insufficient to enable it to make required minimum tax distributions to its partners in which case carlyle holdings may have to borrow funds or sell assets and thus our liquidity and financial condition could be materially adversely affected furthermore by paying cash distributions rather than investing that cash in our businesses we might risk slowing the pace of our growth or not having a sufficient amount of cash to fund our operations new investments or unanticipated capital expenditures should the need arise   our historical cash distributions include compensatory payments to our senior carlyle professionals which we have historically accounted for as distributions from equity rather than as employee compensation and also include distributions in respect of coinvestments made by the owners of the parent entities indirectly through the parent entities distributions related to coinvestments are allocable solely to the individuals that funded those coinvestments and would not be distributable to our common unitholders additionally the  mubadala investment was a nonrecurring transaction that resulted in a distribution to the existing owners of the parent entities in  cash distributions net of compensatory payments distributions related to coinvestments and distributions related to the mubadala investment represent distributions sourced from the income of the parent entities such as the net income of management feeearning subsidiaries and the parent entities share of the income of the fund general partners which includes carried interest not allocated to investment professionals at the fund level the following table presents our historical cash distributions including and excluding compensatory payments distributions related    to coinvestments and the distribution in  related to the mubadala investment and our historical distributable earnings amounts in millions

difference between the initial public offering price per common unit of our common units and the pro forma net tangible book value per common unit of our common units after this offering dilution results from the fact that the per common unit offering price of the common units is substantially in excess of the pro forma net tangible book value per common unit attributable to our existing owners   our pro forma net tangible book value as of december   was approximately  million or  per common unit pro forma net tangible book value represents the amount of total tangible assets less total liabilities after giving effect to the reorganization and pro forma net tangible book value per common unit represents pro forma net tangible book value divided by the number of common units outstanding after giving effect to the reorganization and treating as outstanding common units issuable upon exchange of outstanding partnership units in carlyle holdings other than those held by the carlyle group lps whollyowned subsidiaries on a oneforone basis   after giving effect to the transactions described under unaudited pro forma financial information including the repayment of indebtedness with a portion of the proceeds from this offering as described in use of proceeds our adjusted pro forma net tangible book value as of december   would have been  million or  per common unit this represents an immediate increase in net tangible book value of  per common unit to our existing owners and an immediate dilution in net tangible book value of  per common unit to investors in this offering   the following table illustrates this dilution on a per common unit basis assuming the underwriters do not exercise their option to purchase additional common units                     initial public offering price per common unit               pro forma net tangible book value per common unit as of december                 increase in pro forma net tangible book value per common

in adjusted pro forma net tangible book value per common unit to investors in this offering                                   because our existing owners do not own any of our common units in order to present more meaningfully the dilutive impact on the investors in this offering we have calculated dilution in pro forma net tangible book value per common unit to investors in this offering by dividing pro forma net tangible book value by a number of common units that includes common units issuable upon exchange of outstanding partnership units in carlyle holdings other than those held by the carlyle group lps whollyowned subsidiaries on a oneforone basis   the following table summarizes on the same pro forma basis as of december   the total number of common units purchased from us

prospectively from that date in december  we amended most of the coinvestment entities so that the presumption of control by the general partner had been overcome and therefore we ceased to consolidate those entities prospectively from that date in  the hedge fund that we had formed in february  began an orderly liquidation and ceased operations pursuant to revised consolidation guidance that became effective january   we consolidated the existing and any subsequently acquired clos where we hold a controlling financial interest the consolidation or deconsolidation of funds generally

offering   overview   we conduct our operations through four reportable segments corporate private equity real assets global market strategies and fund of funds solutions we launched operations in our fund of funds solutions segment with the acquisition of a  equity interest in alpinvest on july         corporate private equity  our corporate private equity segment advises our buyout and growth capital funds which seek a wide variety of investments of different sizes and growth potentials as of december   our corporate private equity segment had approximately  billion in aum and approximately  billion in feeearning aum       real assets  our real assets segment advises our us and internationally focused real estate and infrastructure funds as well as our energy and renewable resources funds as of december   our real assets segment had approximately  billion in aum and approximately  billion in feeearning aum       global market strategies  our global market strategies segment advises a group of funds that pursue investment opportunities across various types of credit equities and alternative instruments and as regards to certain macroeconomic strategies currencies commodities and interest rate products and their derivatives as of december   our global market strategies segment had approximately  billion in aum and approximately  billion in feeearning aum       fund of funds solutions  our fund of funds solutions segment was launched upon our acquisition of a  equity interest in alpinvest on july   and advises a global private equity fund of funds program and related coinvestment and secondary activities as of december   alpinvest had approximately  billion in aum and approximately  billion in feeearning aum   we earn management fees pursuant to contractual arrangements with the investment funds that we manage and fees for transaction advisory and oversight services provided to portfolio companies of these funds we also typically receive a performance fee from an investment fund which may be    either an incentive fee or a special residual allocation of income which we refer to as a carried interest in the event that specified investment returns are achieved by the fund under us generally accepted accounting principles we are required to consolidate some of the investment funds that we advise however for segment reporting purposes we present revenues and expenses on a basis that deconsolidates these investment funds accordingly our segment revenues primarily consist of fund management and related advisory fees performance fees consisting of incentive fees and carried interest allocations investment income including realized and unrealized gains on our investments in our funds and other trading securities as well as interest and other income our segment expenses primarily consist of compensation and benefits expenses including salaries bonuses and performance payment arrangements and general and administrative expenses   trends affecting our business   our results of operations are affected by a variety of factors including global economic and market conditions particularly in the united states europe and asia we believe that our investment philosophy and broad diversity of investments across industries asset classes and geographies enhances the stability of our distributable earnings and management fee streams reduces the volatility of our carried interest and performance fees and decreases our exposure to a negative event associated with any specific fund investment or vintage in general a climate of low and stable interest rates and high levels of liquidity in the debt and equity capital markets provide a positive environment for us to generate attractive investment returns we also believe that periods of volatility and dislocation in the capital markets present us with opportunities to invest at reduced valuations that position us for future revenue growth and to utilize investment strategies such as our distressed debt strategies which tend to benefit from such market conditions   in addition to these global macroeconomic and market factors our future performance is also heavily dependent on our ability to attract new capital and investors generate strong returns from our existing investments deploy our funds capital in appropriate and successful investments and meet evolving investor needs       the attractiveness of the alternative asset management industry   our ability to attract new capital and investors is driven in part by the extent to which investors continue to see the alternative asset management industry as an attractive vehicle for capital preservation and growth while our recent fundraising has resulted in new capital commitments at levels that remain below the historically high volume achieved during  and early  we believe our fundraising efforts will benefit from certain fundamental trends that include i institutional investors pursuit of higher relative investment returns which have historically been provided by top quartile alternative asset management funds ii distributions to existing investors from historical commitments which could be used to fund new allocations iii the entrance of new institutional investors from developing markets including sovereign wealth funds and other entities and iv increasing interest from high net worth individuals       our ability to generate strong returns   the strength of our investment performance affects investors willingness to commit capital to our funds the capital we are able to attract drives the growth of our aum and the management fees we earn during the years ended december   and december   we have distributed approximately  billion from our carry funds to our investors although we have recently exited several investments at attractive returns and the fair value of our funds net assets has increased significantly with the economic recovery there can be no assurance that these trends will continue in addition valuations in many of our funds experienced volatility during  a trend which could occur again in the near to mediumterm        during  and  many economies around the world including the us economy experienced significant declines in employment household wealth and lending those events led to a significantly diminished availability of credit and an increase in the cost of financing      the lack of credit in  and  materially hindered the initiation of new largesized transactions for our corporate private equity and real assets segments and adversely impacted our operating results in those periods while we continued to experience some capital markets volatility in  in contrast to  and  credit remains available selectively for high quality corporate transactions though financing costs remain elevated from prerecession levels finally a significant portion of our revenues are derived from performance fees the size of which is dependent on the success of our fund investments a decrease in valuations of our fund investments will result in a reduction of accrued performance fees which we would expect to be most significant in corporate private equity our largest business segment       our successful deployment of capital   our ability to maintain and grow our revenue base is dependent upon our ability to successfully deploy the capital that our investors have committed to our funds during the years ended december   and december   we have invested more than  billion in new and existing investments representing an investment pace that is comparable to our investment pace during the peak of private equity capital deployment during  through  as of december   we had approximately  billion in capital available for investment we believe that this puts us in a position to grow our revenues over time our ability to identify and execute investments which our investment professionals determine to be attractive continues to depend on a number of factors including competition valuation credit availability and pricing and other general market conditions       our ability to meet evolving investor requirements   we believe that investors will seek to deploy their investment capital in a variety of different ways including fund investments separate accounts and direct coinvestments we anticipate that this trend will result in a bifurcation within the global alternative asset management industry with a limited number of large global market participants joined by numerous smaller and more specialized funds providing investors with greater flexibility when allocating their investment capital in addition we expect that certain larger investors will seek to allocate more resources to managed accounts through which they can directly hold title to assets and better control their investments   our results of operations also reflect among other things the impact of the global financial crisis that began in mid and ultimately resulted in a deep global recession the general tightening in credit availability adversely impacted the global investment industry including our investment funds and their portfolio companies this global downturn resulted in a relative scarcity of new attractive investment opportunities and limited our ability to exit investments in our funds which in turn reduced the carried interest we generated we believe that our funds and their portfolio companies benefitted however from our efforts to work with management teams to access available liquidity strategically reposition capital structures and focus on eliminating costs within core business operations beginning in the second half of  the capital markets began to stabilize and recover from the economic recession and credit crisis although they experienced significant volatility following the downgrade by standard  poors on august   of the longterm credit rating of us treasury debt from aaa to aa while access to capital markets and asset valuations have improved markedly since  it is not known how extensive this recovery will be or whether it will continue in addition the recent speculation regarding the inability of greece and certain other european countries to pay their national debt the response by eurozone policy makers to mitigate this sovereign debt crisis and the concerns regarding the stability of the eurozone currency have created uncertainty in the credit markets as a result there has been a strain on banks and other financial services participants which could have an adverse impact on our business   we were able to make significant distributions to the investors in our carry funds in  and  as a result of successful realization activity in these funds this successful realization activity favorably impacted our realized performance fees but negatively impacted our feeearning aum to the extent such realizations occured in funds whose management fees are calculated on the basis of    invested capital to the extent such successful realization activity continues in subsequent periods we would expect a similar impact   in addition the investment periods for many of the large carry funds that we raised during the particularly productive period from  to early  are unless extended scheduled to expire beginning in  which will result in stepdowns in the applicable management fee rates for certain of these funds our management fee revenues will be reduced by these stepdowns in management fee rates as well as by any adverse impact on feeearning aum resulting from successful realization activity in our carry funds offset by the favorable impact on feeearning aum and management fee revenues of our recent acquisitions and anticipated new fundraising initiatives   as we pursue new fundraising initiatives and prepare for the demands of being a public company we anticipate that compensation and benefits and general and administrative expenses will increase in  as compared to  as we continue to add staff across the firm and build out our backoffice infrastructure and systems   preliminary fund valuation information for the three months ended march     the fund valuation information discussed below are preliminary estimates and are subject to quarterly review procedures and final reconciliations and adjustments actual fund valuations may differ from these estimates and such differences may be material   we estimate that the investments of our carry funds appreciated approximately  during the three months ended march   we estimate that the investments of our corporate private equity funds appreciated approximately  during this period with the investments of our buyout funds appreciating approximately  and the investments of our growth capital funds appreciating approximately  we estimate that the investments of our real assets funds appreciated approximately  during this period with the investments of our real estate and infrastructure funds appreciating approximately  and the investments of our energy funds appreciating approximately  we estimate that the investments of the carry funds advised by our global market strategies segment appreciated approximately  during this period preliminary valuation information for the fund of funds vehicles advised by our fund of funds solutions segment is not yet available   while the appreciationdepreciation of the investments of our carry funds is one of the many drivers of performance fees there are other factors that impact this type of revenue and this information should not be construed as an indication of performance fees or of any other component of our revenues or expenses for any period an investment in the carlyle group lp is not an investment in any of our funds see risk factors  risks related to our business operations  the historical returns attributable to our funds including those presented in this prospectus should not be considered as indicative of the future results of our funds or of our future results or of any returns expected on an investment in our common units

prospectus   reorganization   in connection with this offering we effected a reorganization described in greater detail under organizational structure the reorganization had the following primary elements   restructuring of certain third party interests   certain existing and former owners of the parent entities including calpers and former and current senior carlyle professionals have beneficial interests in investments in or alongside our funds that were funded by such persons indirectly through the parent entities in order to minimize the extent of third party ownership interests in firm assets prior to the completion of the offering we have i distributed a portion of these interests approximately  million as of december   to the beneficial owners so that they are held directly by such persons and are no longer consolidated in our financial statements and ii restructured the remainder of these interests approximately  million as of december   so that they are reflected as noncontrolling interests in our financial statements in addition prior to the offering the parent entities have restructured ownership of certain carried interest rights allocated to retired senior carlyle professionals so that such carried interest rights will be reflected as noncontrolling interests in our financial statements such restructured carried interest rights    accounted for approximately  million of our performance fee revenue for the year ended december   see unaudited pro forma financial information   distribution of earnings   during  in the ordinary course of business we have made distributions to our existing owners including distributions sourced from realized carried interest and incentive fees prior to the date of the offering the parent entities have also made to their owners a cash distribution of previously undistributed earnings totaling  million   contribution of the parent entities and other interests to carlyle holdings   prior to the consummation of this offering       our senior carlyle professionals mubadala and calpers contributed all of their interests in       tc group llc to carlyle holdings i lp       tc group investment holdings lp and tc group cayman investment holdings lp to carlyle holdings ii lp and       tc group cayman lp to carlyle holdings iii lp and       senior carlyle professionals and other individuals engaged in our business contributed to the carlyle holdings partnerships a portion of the equity interests they owned in the general partners of our existing carry funds   in consideration of these contributions our existing owners received an aggregate of  carlyle holdings partnership units   accordingly following the reorganization and this offering the carlyle group lp is a holding partnership and through wholly owned subsidiaries holds equity interests in three carlyle holdings partnerships which we refer to collectively as carlyle holdings which in turn own the four parent entities through its wholly owned subsidiaries the carlyle group lp will be the sole general partner of each of the carlyle holdings partnerships accordingly the carlyle group lp will operate and control all of the business and affairs of carlyle holdings and will consolidate the financial results of the carlyle holdings partnerships and its consolidated subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the limited partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships will be reflected as a noncontrolling interest in the carlyle group lps consolidated financial statements   consolidation of certain carlyle funds   pursuant to us gaap we consolidate certain carlyle funds related coinvestment entities and clos that we advise which we refer to collectively as the consolidated funds in our combined and consolidated financial statements for certain of the periods we present these funds represented approximately  of our aum as of december    of our fund management fees and  of our performance fees for the year ended december     we are not required under us gaap to consolidate most of the investment funds we advise in our combined and consolidated financial statements because such funds provide the limited partners with the right to dissolve the fund without cause by a simple majority vote of the noncarlyle affiliated limited partners which overcomes the presumption of control by carlyle beginning in  we consolidated certain clos that we advise as a result of revisions to the accounting standards governing consolidations beginning in july  we consolidated certain alpinvest fund of funds vehicles as of december   our consolidated clos held approximately  billion of total assets and comprised  of the assets of the consolidated funds and  of the loans payable of the consolidated funds as of december   our consolidated alpinvest fund of funds vehicles had approximately  billion of total assets and comprised  of the assets of the consolidated funds the remainder of the assets of the consolidated funds as of december   relates to our consolidated hedge funds and other consolidated funds the assets and liabilities of the consolidated funds are generally held within separate legal entities and as a result the    liabilities of the consolidated funds are nonrecourse to us for further information on consolidation of certain funds see note  to the combined and consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus   generally the consolidation of the consolidated funds has a grossup effect on our assets liabilities and cash flows but has no net effect on the net income attributable to carlyle group and members equity the majority of the net economic ownership interests of the consolidated funds are reflected as noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and equity appropriated for consolidated funds in the combined and consolidated financial statements for further information see note  to the combined and consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus   because only a small portion of our funds are consolidated the performance of the

our corporate private equity and real assets segments generally range from  to  of commitments during the investment period of the relevant fund large funds tend to have lower effective management fee

to between  and  of contributions for unrealized investments depending upon the contracted terms of investment advisory or investment management and related agreements these fees are called

commitments during the first two to five years of the investment period and  to  on the lower of cost of the capital invested or fair value of the capital invested thereafter management fees for our

percentage of the transaction and advisory fees earned which we refer to as the rebate offsets such rebate offset percentages generally range from  to  of the transaction and advisory fees earned while the portfolio advisory fees are relatively consistent transaction fees vary in accordance with our investment pace   performance fees   performance fees consist principally of the special residual allocation of profits to which we are entitled commonly referred to as carried interest from certain of our investment funds which we refer to as the carry funds we are generally entitled to a  allocation or  to  in the case of most of our fund of funds vehicles of the net realized income or gain as a carried interest after returning the invested capital the allocation of preferred returns of generally  to  and the return of certain fund costs subject to catchup provisions as set forth in the fund limited partnership agreement carried interest revenue which is a component of performance fees in our combined and consolidated financial statements is recognized by carlyle upon appreciation of the valuation of our funds investments above certain return hurdles as set forth in each respective partnership agreement and is based on the amount that would be due to us pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were liquidated at such date accordingly the amount of carried interest recognized as performance fees reflects our share of the fair value gains and losses of the associated funds underlying investments measured at their thencurrent fair values as a result the performance fees earned in an applicable reporting period are not indicative of any future period carried interest is ultimately realized and distributed when i an underlying investment is profitably disposed of ii the investment funds cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return and iii we have decided to collect carry rather than return additional capital to limited partner investors the portion of performance fees that are realized and unrealized in each period are separately reported in our statements of operations as noted above prior to the consummation of this offering we will restructure certain carried interest rights allocated to certain retired senior carlyle professionals of the parent entities so that such carried interest rights are reflected as noncontrolling interests in our financial statements in addition in connection with the reorganization the portion of carried interest allocated to our senior carlyle professionals and other personnel who work in our fund operations will decrease from historical levels to approximately  see organizational structure  reorganization among other adjustments the presentation of economic net income in our pro forma financial statements includes adjustments to our historical economic net income related to i income attributable to the carried interest rights which will be reflected as noncontrolling interests and ii the change in the portion of carried interest allocated to our senior carlyle professionals and other personnel who work in our fund operations see unaudited pro forma financial information   under our arrangements with the historical owners and management team of alpinvest such persons are allocated all carried interest in respect of the historical investments and commitments to    the fund of funds vehicles that existed as of december    of the carried interest in respect of commitments from the historical owners of alpinvest for the period between  and  and  of the carried interest in respect of all other commitments including all future commitments from third parties   our performance fees are generated by a diverse set of funds with different vintages geographic concentration investment strategies and industry specialties for an explanation of the fund acronyms used throughout this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section please see business  our family of funds   performance fees from two of our us buyout funds cp v and cp iv with total aum of approximately  billion and  billion respectively as of december   were  million and  million respectively for the year ended december   performance fees from cp iv were  million for the year ended december   the investment by our first asia buyout fund cap i and related coinvestment vehicles in china pacific insurance group co ltd china pacific with combined total aum of approximately  billion as of december   generated performance fees of  million for the year ended december     realized carried interest may be clawedback or given back to the fund if the funds investment values decline below certain return hurdles which vary from fund to fund if the fair value of a funds investments falls below the applicable return hurdles previously recognized carried interest and performance fees are reduced in all cases each investment fund is considered separately in evaluating carried interest and potential giveback obligations for any given period carried interest income could thus be negative however cumulative performance fees and allocations can never be negative over the life of a fund in addition carlyle is not obligated to pay guaranteed returns or hurdles if upon a hypothetical liquidation of a funds investments at the thencurrent fair values previously recognized and distributed carried interest would be required to be returned a liability is established in carlyles financial statements for the potential giveback obligation as discussed below each individual recipient of realized carried interest typically signs a guarantee agreement or partnership agreement that personally obligates such person to return hisher pro rata share of any amounts of realized carried interest previously distributed that are later clawed back generally the actual giveback liability if any does not become due until the end of a funds life   in addition to the carried interest from our carry funds we are also entitled to receive incentive fees or allocations from certain of our global market strategies funds when the return on aum exceeds previous calendaryear ending or dateofinvestment highwater marks our hedge funds generally pay annual incentive fees or allocations equal to  of the funds profits for the year subject to a highwater mark the highwater mark is the highest historical nav attributable to a fund investors account on which incentive fees were paid and means that we will not earn incentive fees with respect to such fund investor for a year if the nav of such investors account at the end of the year is lower that year than any prior yearend nav or the nav at the date of such fund investors investment generally excluding any contributions and redemptions for purposes of calculating nav we recognize the incentive fees from our hedge funds as they are earned in these arrangements incentive fees are recognized when the performance benchmark has been achieved and are included in performance fees in our combined and consolidated statements of operations these incentive fees are a component of performance fees in our combined and consolidated financial statements and are treated as accrued until paid to us   for any given period performance fee revenue on our statement of operations may include reversals of previously recognized performance fees due to a decrease in the value of a particular fund that results in a decrease of cumulative performance fees earned to date for the years ended december    and  the reversals of performance fees were  million  million and  million respectively   as of december   accrued performance fees and accrued giveback obligations were approximately  billion and  million respectively each balance assumes a hypothetical    liquidation of the funds investments at december   at their then current fair values these assets and liabilities will continue to fluctuate in accordance with the fair values of the fund investments until they are realized   in addition realized performance fees may be reversed in future periods to the extent that such amounts become subject to a giveback obligation if at december   all investments held by our carry funds were deemed worthless the amount of realized and previously distributed performance fees subject to potential giveback would be  million see the related discussion of contingent obligations giveback within  liquidity and capital resources   as described above each investment fund is considered separately in evaluating carried interest and potential giveback obligations as a result performance fees within funds will continue to fluctuate primarily due to certain investments within each fund constituting a material portion of the carry in that fund additionally the fair value of investments in our funds may have substantial fluctuations from period to period   in addition we use the term net performance fees to refer to the carried interest from our carry funds and global market strategies funds net of the portion allocated to our investment professionals which is reflected as performance fee related compensation expense   see  nongaap financial measures for the amount of realized and unrealized performance fees recognized and or reversed each period see  segment analysis for the realized and unrealized performance fees by segment and related discussion for each period   investment income and interest and other income   investment income and interest and other income represent the unrealized and realized gains and losses on our principal investments including our investments in carlyle funds that are not consolidated our equity method investments and other principal investments as well as any interest and other income unrealized investment income loss results from changes in the fair value of the underlying investment as well as the reversal of unrealized gains losses at the time an investment is realized as noted above prior to the consummation of this offering we will distribute to their beneficial owners certain investments in or alongside our funds beneficially owned by certain existing and former owners of the parent entities and restructure the remainder of such beneficial interests so that they are reflected as noncontrolling interests in our financial statements among other adjustments the presentation of economic net income in our pro forma financial statements includes adjustments to our historical economic net income related to the investment income that is attributable to any such investments which either will no longer be consolidated or will be reflected as noncontrolling interests as the case may be see unaudited pro forma financial information   interest and other income of consolidated funds   interest and other income of consolidated funds principally represent presently the interest earned on clo assets however the consolidated funds are not the same entities in all periods presented and may change in future periods due to changes in us gaap changes in fund terms and terminations of funds   net investment gains losses of consolidated funds   net investment gains losses of consolidated funds measures the change in the difference in fair value between the assets and the liabilities of the consolidated funds a gain loss indicates that the fair value of the assets of the consolidated funds appreciated more less or depreciated less more than the fair value of the liabilities of the consolidated funds a gain or loss is not necessarily indicative of the investment performance of the consolidated funds and does not impact the management or incentive fees received by carlyle for its management of the consolidated funds substantially all of the net investment gains losses of consolidated funds are attributable to the limited partner investors and allocated to noncontrolling interests therefore a gain or loss is not expected to have an impact on the revenues or profitability of carlyle moreover although the assets of the consolidated funds are consolidated onto our balance sheet pursuant to us gaap ultimately we do not have recourse to    such assets and such liabilities are nonrecourse to us therefore a gain or loss from the consolidated funds does not impact the assets available to our equity holders   expenses   compensation and benefits   compensation includes salaries bonuses and performance payment arrangements for nonpartners bonuses are accrued over the service period to which they relate compensation attributable to our senior carlyle professionals has historically been accounted for as distributions from equity rather than as employee compensation accordingly net income as determined in accordance with us gaap for partnerships is not comparable to net income of a corporation furthermore any unpaid obligation to our senior carlyle professionals has historically been presented as a separate liability to our senior carlyle professionals we recognize as compensation expense the portion of performance fees that are due to our employees and operating executives in a manner consistent with how we recognize the performance fee revenue these amounts are accounted for as compensation expense in conjunction with the related performance fee revenue and until paid are recognized as a component of the accrued compensation and benefits liability compensation in respect of performance fees is not paid until the related performance fees are realized and not when such performance fees are accrued the funds do not have a uniform allocation of performance fees to our employees senior carlyle professionals and operating executives therefore for any given period the ratio of performance fee compensation to performance fee revenue may vary based on the funds generating the performance fee revenue for that period and their particular allocation percentages   upon the effectiveness of this offering we will account for compensation to senior carlyle professionals as an expense in our statement of operations and have reflected the related adjustments in our pro forma financial statements see unaudited pro forma financial information in our calculations of economic net income fee related earnings and distributable earnings which are used by management in assessing the performance of our segments we include an adjustment to reflect a pro forma charge for partner compensation see  combined and consolidated results of operations  nongaap financial measures for a reconciliation of income before provision for income taxes to total segments economic net income of total segments economic net income to fee related earnings and of fee related earnings to distributable earnings   also upon the effectiveness of this offering we will implement various equitybased compensation arrangements that will require senior carlyle professionals and other employees to vest ownership of a portion of their equity interests over a future service period of up to six years which under us gaap will result in compensation charges over future periods compensation charges associated with the equitybased compensation grants issued upon completion of this offering or issued in future acquisitions will not be reflected in our calculations of economic net income fee related earnings and distributable earnings   we expect that we will hire additional individuals and that overall compensation levels will correspondingly increase which will result in an increase in compensation and benefits expense as a result of recent acquisitions we will have charges associated with contingent consideration taking the form of earnouts and profit participation some of which will be reflected as compensation expense in future periods we also expect that our fundraising will increase in future periods and as a result we expect that our compensation expense will also increase in periods where we close on increased levels of new capital commitments amounts due to employees related to such fundraising will be expensed when earned even though the benefit of the new capital and related fees will be reflected in operations over the life of the related fund   general administrative and other expenses   other operating expenses represent general and administrative expenses including occupancy and equipment expenses interest and other expenses which consist principally of professional fees travel and related expenses communications and information services depreciation and amortization and foreign currency transactions    we anticipate that general administrative and other expenses will fluctuate significantly from period to period due to the impact of foreign exchange transactions additionally we expect that general administrative and other expenses will vary due to infrequently occurring or unusual items we also expect to incur greater expenses in the future related to our recent acquisitions including amortization of acquired intangibles earnouts to equity holders and fair value adjustments on contingent consideration issued   interest and other expenses of consolidated funds   the interest and other expenses of consolidated funds consist primarily of interest expense related primarily to our clo loans professional fees and other thirdparty expenses   income taxes   prior to the reorganization in connection with this offering we have operated as a group of passthrough entities for us income tax purposes and our profits and losses are allocated to the individual senior carlyle professionals which are individually responsible for reporting such amounts we record a provision for state and local income taxes for certain entities based on applicable laws based on applicable foreign tax laws we record a provision for foreign income taxes for certain foreign entities   income taxes for foreign entities are accounted for using the liability method of accounting under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected future tax consequences of differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis using currently enacted tax rates the effect on deferred assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period when the change is enacted deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized   in the normal course of business we are subject to examination by federal and certain state local and foreign tax regulators as of december   our us federal income tax returns for the years  through  are open under the normal threeyear statute of limitations and therefore subject to examination state and local tax returns are generally subject to audit from  to  specifically our washington dc franchise tax years are currently open as are our new york city returns for the tax years  to  foreign tax returns are generally subject to audit from  to  certain of our foreign subsidiaries are currently under audit by foreign tax authorities   following this offering the carlyle holdings partnerships and their subsidiaries will continue to operate as passthrough entities for us income tax purposes and record a provision for foreign income taxes for certain foreign entities in addition carlyle holdings i gp inc is subject to additional entitylevel taxes that will be reflected in our consolidated financial statements for information on the pro forma effective tax rate of the carlyle group lp following the reorganization see note b in unaudited pro forma financial information   noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities   noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities represent the component of equity in consolidated entities not held by us these interests are adjusted for general partner allocations and by subscriptions and redemptions in hedge funds which occur during the reporting period noncontrolling interests related to hedge funds are subject to quarterly or monthly redemption by investors in these funds following the expiration of a specified period of time typically one year or may be withdrawn subject to a redemption fee in the hedge funds during the period when capital may not be withdrawn as limited partners in these types of funds have been granted redemption rights amounts relating to thirdparty interests in such consolidated funds are presented as redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities within the combined and consolidated balance sheets when redeemable amounts become legally payable to investors they are classified as a liability and included in other liabilities of consolidated funds in the combined and consolidated balance sheets following this offering we will also record significant noncontrolling interests in income of consolidated entities relating to the ownership interest of our existing owners in carlyle holdings as described in organizational structure the carlyle group lp will through whollyowned subsidiaries be the sole general partner of each of    the carlyle holdings partnerships the carlyle group lp will consolidate the financial results of carlyle holdings and its consolidated subsidiaries and the ownership interest of the limited partners of carlyle holdings will be reflected as a noncontrolling interest in the carlyle group lps consolidated financial statements   nongaap financial measures   economic net income   economic net income or eni is a key performance benchmark used in our industry eni represents segment net income which excludes the impact of income taxes acquisitionrelated items including amortization of acquired intangibles and contingent consideration taking the form of earnouts charges associated with equitybased compensation issued in this offering or future acquisitions corporate actions and infrequently occurring or unusual events we believe the exclusion of these items provides investors with a meaningful indication of our core operating performance for segment reporting purposes revenues and expenses and accordingly segment net income are presented on a basis that deconsolidates the consolidated funds eni also reflects pro forma compensation expense for compensation to our senior carlyle professionals which we have historically accounted for as distributions from equity rather than as employee compensation total segment eni equals the aggregate of eni for all segments eni is evaluated regularly by management in making resource deployment decisions and in assessing performance of our four segments and for compensation we believe that reporting eni is helpful to understanding our business and that investors should review the same supplemental financial measure that management uses to analyze our segment performance this measure supplements and should be considered in addition to and not in lieu of the results of operations discussed further under combined and consolidated results of operations prepared in accordance with us gaap   distributable earnings   distributable earnings is derived from our segment reported results and is an additional measure to assess performance and amounts potentially available for distribution from carlyle holdings to its equity holders distributable earnings which is a nongaap measure is intended to show the amount of net realized earnings without the effects of consolidation of the consolidated funds distributable earnings is total eni less unrealized performance fees unrealized investment income and the corresponding unrealized performance fee compensation expense for a discussion of the difference between distributable earnings and cash distributions during the historical periods presented see cash distribution policy   fee related earnings   fee related earnings is a component of eni and is used to measure our operating profitability exclusive of performance fees investment income from investments in our funds and performance feerelated compensation accordingly fee related earnings reflect the ability of the business to cover direct base compensation and operating expenses from fee revenues other than performance fees fee related earnings are reported as part of our segment results we use fee related earnings from operations to measure our profitability from fund management fees see note  to the combined and consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus   operating metrics   we monitor certain operating metrics that are common to the alternative asset management industry   feeearning assets

capital invested in our carry funds coinvestment vehicles and fund of funds vehicles plus the capital that we are entitled to call from investors in those funds and vehicles including our commitments to those funds and vehicles and those of senior carlyle professionals and employees pursuant to the terms of their capital commitments to those funds and vehicles   b the amount of aggregate

partnership agreements   for our carry funds coinvestment vehicles and fund of funds vehicles total aum includes the fair value of the capital invested whereas feeearning aum includes the amount of capital commitments or the remaining amount of invested capital depending on whether the investment period for the fund has expired as such feeearning aum may be greater than total aum when the aggregate fair value of the remaining investments is less than the cost of those investments   our calculations of feeearning aum and aum may differ from the calculations of other alternative asset managers and as a result this measure may not be comparable to similar measures presented by others in addition our calculation of aum includes uncalled commitments to and the    fair value of invested capital in our funds from carlyle and our personnel regardless of whether such commitments or invested capital are subject to management or performance fees our calculations of feeearning aum or aum are not based on any definition of feeearning aum or aum that is set forth in the agreements governing the investment funds that we manage   we generally use feeearning aum as a metric to measure changes in the assets from which we earn management fees total aum tends to be a better measure of our investment and fundraising performance as it reflects assets at fair value plus available uncalled capital   available capital   available capital commonly known as dry powder for our carry funds refers to the amount of capital commitments available to be called for investments amounts previously called may be added back to available capital following certain distributions expired available capital occurs when a fund has passed the investment and followon periods and can no longer invest capital into new or existing deals any remaining available capital typically a result of either recycled distributions or specific reserves established for the followon period that are not drawn can only be called for fees and expenses and is therefore removed from the total aum calculation    the table below provides the period to period rollforward of available capital and fair value

year ended december   management fees increased as a result of new capital raised for one of our us real estate funds and our south america buyout fund fund management fees include transaction and portfolio advisory fees net of rebate offsets of  million and  million for the years ended december   and  respectively the  million increase in transaction and portfolio advisory fees resulted from greater investment activity during  as compared to  these fee increases were offset by nonrecurring management fees earned in  from final closings of two corporate private equity funds and lower fees from our third european buyout fund beginning in the fourth quarter of    performance fees   performance fees for the year ended december   were  million compared to  million in  in addition performance fees from consolidated funds increased  million for the year ended december   as compared to  these fees eliminate upon consolidation the performance fees recorded in  and  were due principally to increases in the fair value of the underlying funds which increased approximately  and  in total remaining value during  and  respectively the net appreciation in the fair value of the

therefore is allocated to noncontrolling interests accordingly such amounts have no material impact on net income attributable to carlyle group   expenses   expenses were  million for the year ended december   an increase of  million from  million in  the increase in expenses is partially due to the acquisitions that occurred in  and the second half of  the increase is due primarily to increases

the acquisitions of esg alpinvest and claren road all compensation to senior carlyle professionals is accounted for as equity distributions in our combined and consolidated financial statements had such amounts been accounted for as compensation expense then total expenses would have been  million and  million in the years ended december   and  respectively representing an increase of  million

associated with the equity issued for affiliate debt financing of  million recorded in    compensation and benefits   base compensation and benefits increased  million or  in the year ended december   as compared to  which primarily relates to the acquisitions of esg alpinvest and claren road and the addition of their professionals the balance of the increase primarily reflects the increase in other personnel and increases in base compensation reflecting promotions and merit pay adjustments performance related compensation expense decreased  million in the year ended december   as compared to  of which  million was an increase in realized performance fee related compensation and  million was a decrease in unrealized performance fee related compensation compensation and benefits excludes

the liabilities of the clos reflects the fair value adjustment on the debt of the clos the liabilities of the clos have a lower degree of market liquidity than the clo investments in bonds and loans and accordingly their fair value changes will not necessarily be correlated during the year ended december   the liabilities appreciated more than the investments creating a net investment loss also contributing to the net investment losses for the year ended december   was approximately  million of net investment losses attributable to the consolidated funds from the acquisitions of claren road esg and alpinvest   net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities   net loss attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities was  million for the year

substantially all allocated to the related funds limited partners or clo investors   during the year ended december   the net loss of our consolidated funds was approximately  million this loss was substantially due to our consolidated clos and the consolidated funds associated with the claren road esg and alpinvest acquisitions the consolidated clos generated a net loss of  million in  the clo liabilities appreciated in value greater than the clo investments in loans and bonds thereby creating a net loss also the net loss from the consolidated alpinvest fund of funds vehicles was approximately  million the amount of the loss was offset by approximately  million of income allocated to the investors in the consolidated hedge funds which are reflected in redeemable noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities on our combined and consolidated balance sheet this compares to the net loss of our consolidated funds of  million for the year ended december   the  loss was driven by the losses incurred on the clo liabilities as the liabilities appreciated in value greater than the investments of the clos the investment loss was reduced by interest income in excess of interest expense from the clos the consolidated alpinvest fund of funds vehicles and hedge funds were acquired with our acquisitions of alpinvest esg and claren road and accordingly did not impact the  results   year ended december   compared to the year ended december     revenues   total revenues were  million for the year ended december   an increase of approximately  billion compared to total  revenues

for the year ended december   an increase of  million from  million for the year ended december   the significant increase in expenses was due primarily to a  million expense associated with the

consolidations and the corresponding increase in interest and other expenses of consolidated funds which increased  million in  from  million in  also contributing to the increase in expenses was an

professional fees in    interest   our interest expense for the year ended december   was  million a decrease of  million from the prior year this decrease was primarily due to lower outstanding

increase in our weightedaverage management fee rate from  to  at december   a decrease of approximately  billion of feeearning aum resulted in a decrease in fund management fees this is due largely to distributions from several buyout funds outside of their investment period   interest and other income was  million for the year ended december   a decrease from  million in     total compensation and

headcount increased general administrative and other indirect compensation increased  million for the year ended december   as compared to  the expense increase primarily reflected allocated overhead costs related to our continued investment in infrastructure and back office support   interest expense increased  million or  for the year ended december   as compared to  this increase was primarily attributable to interest expense recorded in  on our subordinated notes payable to mubadala which we issued in december  in october  and march  we used borrowings on the revolving credit facility of our existing senior secured credit facility to redeem the  million aggregate principal amount of the subordinated notes payable to mubadala as of march  the subordinated notes payable to mubadala have been fully redeemed the increase was also due to higher borrowings under our refinanced term loan and our revolving credit facility   economic net income   eni was  million for the year ended december   reflecting a  decrease as compared to eni of  million for the year ended december   the decrease in eni in  was driven by a  million decrease in net performance fees as compared to  and

earnings were  million for the year ended december   as compared to  million for  representing a decrease of  million the decrease in fee related earnings is primarily attributable to a net increase

the portfolio will move in valuation in accordance with changes in public market prices for the equity of these    companies comparatively the  million of performance fees for the year ended december   was primarily driven by increases in net asset values of two of our us buyout funds cp iii and cp iv representing performance fees of  million and  million respectively and cap ii of  million   during the year ended december   net performance fees were  million or  of performance fees and  million less than the net performance fees in    investment income   investment income for the year ended december   was  million compared to  million in  during the year ended december   realized investment income was  million as compared to  million in    distributable earnings   distributable earnings increased  for the year ended december   to  million from  million in  this primarily reflects realized net performance fees of  million in  compared to  million in  offset by a decrease in fee related earnings of  million from  to    year ended december   compared to the year ended december     total fee revenues were  million in  representing an increase of  million or  over  this increase was driven almost entirely by net transaction fees which increased  or  million over  reflecting the higher investment activity in  as compared to  fund management fees and portfolio advisory fees were largely unchanged from  the weightedaverage management fee rate decreased from  to  at december   due primarily to a reduction in the fee rate for our third european buyout fund the effect of this decrease will primarily impact our fees earned in  and    total compensation and benefits was  million and  million in  and  respectively performance fee related compensation expense was  million and  million or  and  of performance fees in  and  respectively   direct base compensation expense increased  million or  over  primarily as the result of adjustments to base compensation and bonuses as headcount remained relatively unchanged between years general administrative and other indirect compensation of  million for  was relatively consistent with    interest expense decreased  million or  over the comparable period in  this decrease was primarily due to lower outstanding borrowings during most of  until we refinanced our term loan in november  and borrowed  million of subordinated debt in december    economic net income   eni was  million for  or  of our  eni of  million for this business the composition of eni in  was substantially impacted by the growth in net

however the lower effective rate on this fund resulted in a decrease in our weightedaverage management fee rate to  at december   from  at december     interest and other income was  million for the

allocated with our investment professionals to date performance related compensation expense in real assets reflects amounts earned primarily by our real estate investment professionals as we generally incur no compensation expense for riverstone and we have not yet generated any performance fees or related compensation from our infrastructure fund accordingly performance fee compensation as a percentage of performance fees is generally not a meaningful percentage for real assets   direct base compensation was  million for the year ended december   as compared to  million for  general administrative and other indirect compensation increased  million to  million for the year ended december   as compared to  the expense increase primarily reflects allocated overhead costs related to our continued investment in infrastructure and back office support   interest expense increased  million or  for the year ended december   as compared to  this increase was primarily attributable to interest expense recorded in  on our subordinated notes payable to mubadala which we issued in december  in october  and march  we used borrowings on the revolving credit facility of our existing senior secured credit facility to redeem the  million aggregate principal amount of the subordinated notes payable to mubadala as of march  the subordinated notes payable to mubadala have been fully

  investment income   investment income was  million for the year ended december   compared to  million in    distributable earnings   distributable earnings increased  million to  million for the

ended december   as compared to    year ended december   compared to the year ended december     total fee revenues were  million in  representing an increase of  million or  over  the change in total fee revenues reflects the  million increase in net transaction and portfolio advisory fees offset by a decrease in management fees of  million the increase in transaction fees reflects the increased investment activity in  while the decrease in management fees primarily reflects a decrease in fees from our european real estate funds and to a lesser extent from the shutdown of our latin america real estate fund our weightedaverage management fee rate decreased from  to  over the period   interest and other income was  million in  representing a  decrease from  million in  the decrease was largely due to the sale of a real estate colocation property at the end of  the results of which were previously included in this business segment   total compensation and benefits was  million and  million in  and  respectively performance fee related compensation expense was  million and  million in  and  respectively   direct base compensation decreased  million to  million in  general administrative and other indirect compensation decreased  or  million in  compared to  the net expense reduction reflects cost saving initiatives derived in part from closing our latin america real estate initiative and favorable variances in foreign currency remeasurements in    interest expense decreased  million or  over the comparable period in  this decrease was primarily due to lower outstanding borrowings during most of  until we refinanced our term loan in november  and borrowed  million of subordinated debt in december    economic net income   eni was  million for  an improvement of nearly  from  million in  for this business the improvement in eni was primarily driven by the performance fees earned from our energy portfolio resulting in a  million increase in net

aggregate principal amount of the subordinated notes payable to mubadala as of march  the subordinated notes payable to mubadala have been fully redeemed the increase was also due to higher borrowings

representing a  increase over  approximately  million of the  million increase was driven by an increase in fund management fees with portfolio advisory fees making up the balance of the increase of

direct base compensation expense increased  million in  compared to  reflecting costs of the new management team we brought on board to manage this business general administrative and other indirect compensation of  million in  was relatively consistent with    interest expense decreased  million or  over the comparable period in  this decrease was primarily due to lower outstanding borrowings

resources   we require limited capital resources to support the working capital and operating needs of our business historically our management fees have largely covered our operating costs and we have distributed all realized performance fees after related compensation to senior carlyle professionals historically approximately  of all capital commitments to our funds have been provided by our fund investors with the remaining amount typically funded by our senior carlyle professionals and employees upon the completion of the offering we intend to have carlyle commit to fund approximately  of the capital commitments to our future carry funds in addition we may from time to time exercise our right to purchase additional interests in our investment funds that become available in the ordinary course of their operations we expect our senior carlyle professionals and employees to continue to make significant capital contributions to our funds based on their existing commitments and    to make capital commitments to future funds consistent with the level of their historical commitments we also intend to make investments in our openend funds and our clo vehicles   proceeds from our existing indebtedness have been used to  finance our global expansion and acquisitions  cover losses incurred in connection with the liquidation of ccc  fund the capital investments of carlyle in our funds  make distributions to senior carlyle professionals and  finance short term loans to our funds while our funds generally will use their own credit facilities to bridge capital calls from our limited partner investors we have on occasion made such loans to seed investments for new or firsttime funds that do not yet have their own credit facilities or to bridge the raising of external coinvestment in addition we have funded working capital on behalf of our funds and portfolio companies   cash flows   the significant captions and amounts from our combined and consolidated statements

net cash provided by operating activities   net cash provided by operating activities is primarily driven by our earnings in the respective periods after adjusting for noncash performance fees and related noncash compensation that are included in earnings cash flows from operating activities do not reflect any amounts paid or distributed to senior carlyle professionals as these amounts are included as a use of cash for distributions in financing activities as a public company we will record cash compensation expense to senior carlyle professionals which will have the effect of reducing cash provided by operating activities and cash used in financing activities cash used to purchase investments as well as the proceeds from the sale of such investments are also reflected in our operating activities as investments are a normal part of our operating activities over time investment proceeds may be greater than investment purchases during the year ended december   proceeds were

term loan in  the net payments on loans payable by our consolidated funds during  was  million cash flows associated with the consolidated funds were not significant in    our sources of cash and liquidity needs   in the future we expect that our primary liquidity needs will be to       provide capital to facilitate the growth of our existing business lines       provide capital to

expenditures       repay borrowings and related interest costs and expenses       pay income taxes       make distributions to carlyle holdings unit holders and       fund the capital investments

distributions to our equity owners we have multiple sources of liquidity to meet our capital needs including cash on hand annual cash flows accumulated earnings and funds from our existing senior secured credit facility including a term loan facility and a revolving credit facility with  million available as of december   inclusive of  million of availability set aside to cover our guarantee of our coinvestment loan program and we believe these sources will be sufficient to fund our capital needs for at least the next  months on september   we amended the terms of our existing senior secured credit facility to increase the revolving credit facility from  million to  million on december   we entered into a new senior credit facility the new senior credit facility while currently effective will not become operative unless and until certain conditions are satisfied including the consummation of this offering and the repayment of borrowings under the revolving credit facility of the existing senior secured credit facility used to finance distributions if any to our existing owners on march   we borrowed  million under the revolving credit facility to redeem all of the remaining  million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the subordinated notes held by mubadala for a redemption price of  million representing a  premium plus accrued interest of approximately  million we are not dependent upon the proceeds from this offering to meet our liquidity needs for the next  months after completion of this offering we intend to pay distributions from cash flow from operations and as needed from draws on available borrowings from our revolving credit facility or sales of assets    since our inception through december   we and our senior carlyle professionals

december   total liabilities were  billion at december   a decrease of  billion from december   the assets and liabilities of the consolidated funds are generally held within separate legal entities

could borrow up to  million in a term loan and  million in a revolving credit facility subsequent to the bankruptcy of one of the financial institutions that was a party to the credit facility the borrowing availability under the revolving credit facility was effectively reduced to  million both the term loan facility and revolving credit facility were scheduled to mature on august     in

associated with our variable rate debt financing to manage this risk we entered into an interest rate swap in march  to fix the interest rate on approximately  of the  million in term loan borrowings at  the interest rate swap had an initial notional balance of  million a current balance of  million as of december   and amortizes through august   the swaps maturity date as the related term loan borrowings are repaid this instrument was designated as a cash flow hedge and remains in place after the amendment of the senior secured credit facility   in december  we entered into a second

facility also contains nonfinancial covenants that restrict some of our corporate activities including our ability to incur additional debt pay certain dividends create liens make certain acquisitions or investments and engage in specified transactions with affiliates non compliance with any of the financial or nonfinancial covenants without cure or waiver would constitute an event of default under the senior secured credit facility an event of default resulting from a breach of a financial or nonfinancial covenant may result at the option of the lenders in an acceleration of the principal and

of approximately  million on march   we borrowed  million under the revolving credit facility to redeem all of the remaining  million outstanding aggregate principal amount of the subordinated notes held by mubadala for a redemption price of  million representing a  premium plus accrued interest of approximately  million the redemptions are expected to reduce our debt service costs and eliminate the dilution to equity holders that would have otherwise resulted upon conversion of the notes interest on the amounts borrowed under the revolving credit facility assuming libor rates as of december   would be approximately  million less on a quarterly basis than interest on the redeemed subordinated notes   on december   we entered into a new senior credit facility the new senior credit facility

facility will be deemed to have been repaid by borrowings in like amount under the new senior credit facility and we will no longer be subject to the financial and other covenants of the existing

borrowings under certain fund level lines of credit which are used to fund liquidity needs in the interim between the date of an investment and the receipt of capital from the investing funds investors these funds do however make direct or indirect investments in companies that utilize leverage in their capital structure the degree of leverage employed varies among portfolio companies   certain of our real estate funds have entered into lines of credits secured by their investors unpaid capital commitments due to the relatively large number of investments made by these funds the lines of credit are primarily employed to reduce the overall number of capital calls in certain instances however they may be used for other investment related activities including serving as bridge financing for investments   offbalance sheet arrangements   in the normal course of business we enter into various offbalance sheet arrangements including sponsoring and owning limited or general partner interests in consolidated and nonconsolidated funds entering into derivative transactions entering into operating leases and entering into guarantee arrangements we also have ongoing capital

any cannot be determined and has not been included in the table above or recorded in our condensed combined and consolidated financial statements as of december     tax receivable agreement   holders of partnership units in carlyle holdings other than the carlyle group lps whollyowned subsidiaries subject to the vesting and minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions applicable to such holders as set forth in the partnership agreements of the carlyle holdings partnerships may on a quarterly basis from and after the first anniversary of the date of the closing of this offering subject to the terms of the exchange agreement exchange their carlyle holdings partnership units for the carlyle group lp common units on a oneforone basis in addition subject to certain requirements calpers will generally be permitted to exchange carlyle holdings partnership units for common units from and after the closing of this offering and mubadala will generally be entitled to exchange carlyle holdings partnerships units for common units following the first anniversary of the closing of this offering any common units received by mubadala and calpers in any such exchange during the applicable restricted periods described in common units eligible for future sale  lockup arrangements  mubadala transfer restrictions and common units eligible for future sale  lockup arrangements  calpers transfer restrictions respectively would be subject to the restrictions described in such sections a carlyle holdings limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of the three carlyle holdings partnerships to effect an exchange for a common unit the exchanges are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of carlyle holdings these increases in tax basis may increase for tax purposes depreciation and amortization deductions and therefore reduce the amount of tax that carlyle holdings i gp inc and any other corporate taxpayers would otherwise be required to pay in the future although the irs may challenge all or part of that tax basis increase and a court could sustain such a challenge   as described in greater detail under certain relationships and related person transactions  tax receivable agreement we entered into a tax receivable agreement with our existing owners that provides for the payment by the corporate taxpayers to our existing owners of  of the amount of cash savings if any in us federal state and local income tax or foreign or franchise tax that the corporate taxpayers realize as a result of these increases in tax basis and of certain other tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement this payment obligation is an obligation of the corporate taxpayers and not of carlyle holdings while the actual increase in tax basis as well as the amount and timing of any payments under this agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors including the timing of exchanges the price of our common units at the time of the exchange the extent to which such exchanges are taxable and the amount and timing of our income we expect that as a result of the    size of the transfers and increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of carlyle holdings the payments that we may make to our existing owners will be substantial the payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon our existing owners continued ownership of us in the event that the carlyle group lp or any of its whollyowned subsidiaries that are not treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes become taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes these entities will also be obligated to make payments under the tax receivable agreement on the same basis and to the same extent as the corporate taxpayers   the tax receivable agreement provides that upon certain changes of control or if at any time the corporate taxpayers elect an early termination of the tax receivable agreement the corporate taxpayers obligations under the tax receivable agreement with respect to all carlyle holdings partnership units whether or not previously exchanged would be calculated by reference to the value of all future payments that our existing owners would have been entitled to receive under the tax receivable agreement using certain valuation assumptions including that the corporate taxpayers will have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement and in the case of an early termination election that any carlyle holdings partnership units that have not been exchanged are deemed exchanged for the market value of the common units at the time of termination in addition our existing owners will not reimburse us for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement if such tax basis increase is successfully challenged by the irs the corporate taxpayers ability to achieve benefits from any tax basis increase and the payments to be made under this agreement will depend upon a number of factors including the timing and amount of our future income as a result even in the absence of a change of control or an election to terminate the tax receivable agreement payments to our existing owners under the tax receivable agreement could be in excess of the corporate taxpayers actual cash tax savings   contingent obligations giveback   an accrual for potential repayment of previously received performance fees of  million at december   is shown as accrued giveback obligations on the combined and consolidated balance sheet representing the giveback obligation that would need to be paid if the funds were liquidated at their current fair values at december   however the ultimate giveback obligation if any does not arise until the end of a funds life we have recorded  million of unbilled receivables from former and current employees and our individual senior carlyle professionals as of december   related to giveback obligations which are included in due from affiliates and other receivables net in our combined and consolidated balance sheet as of such date   if as of december   all of the investments held by our funds were deemed worthless the amount of realized and distributed carried interest subject to potential giveback would be  million on an aftertax basis where applicable   our senior carlyle professionals and employees who have received carried interest distributions are severally responsible for funding their proportionate share of any giveback obligations however the governing agreements of certain of our funds provide that to the extent a current or former employee from such funds does not fund his or her respective share then we may have to fund additional amounts beyond what we received in carried interest although we will generally retain the right to pursue any remedies that we have under such governing agreements against those carried interest recipients who fail to fund their obligations   contingencies   from time to time we are involved in various legal proceedings lawsuits and claims incidental to the conduct of our business our businesses are also subject to extensive regulation which may result in regulatory proceedings against us   in september  and march  we received requests for certain documents and other information from the antitrust division of the doj in connection with the dojs investigation of alternative asset management firms to determine whether they have engaged in conduct prohibited    by us antitrust laws we have fully cooperated with the dojs investigation there can be no assurance as to the direction this inquiry may take in the future or whether it will have an adverse impact on the private equity industry in some unforeseen way   on february   a private classaction lawsuit challenging club bids and other alleged anticompetitive business practices was filed in the us district court for the district of massachusetts  police and fire retirement system of the city of detroit v apollo global management llc  the complaint alleges among other things that certain alternative asset management firms including carlyle violated section  of the sherman act by among other things forming multisponsor consortiums for the purpose of bidding collectively in certain going private transactions which the plaintiffs allege constitutes a conspiracy in restraint of trade the plaintiffs seek damages as provided for in section  of the clayton act and an injunction against such conduct in restraint of trade in the future while carlyle believes the lawsuit is without merit and is contesting it vigorously it is difficult to determine what impact if any this litigation and any future related litigation together with any increased governmental scrutiny or regulatory initiatives will have on the private equity industry generally or on carlyle   along with many other companies and individuals in the financial sector carlyle and one of our funds cmp i are named as defendants in foy v austin capital a case filed in june  pending in the state of new mexicos first judicial district court county of santa fe which purports to be a qui tam suit on behalf of the state of new mexico the suit alleges that investment decisions by new mexico public investment funds were improperly influenced by campaign contributions and payments to politically connected placement agents the plaintiffs seek among other things actual damages actual damages for lost income rescission of the investment transactions described in the complaint and disgorgement of all fees received in may  the attorney general of new mexico moved to dismiss certain defendants including carlyle and cmp i on the ground that separate civil litigation by the attorney general is a more effective means to seek recovery for the state from these defendants the attorney general has brought two civil actions against certain of those defendants not including the carlyle defendants the attorney general has stated that its investigation is continuing and it may bring additional civil actions we are currently unable to anticipate when the litigation will conclude or what impact the litigation may have on us   in july  a former shareholder of carlyle capital corporation limited ccc claiming to have lost  million filed a claim against ccc carlyle and certain of our affiliates and one of our officers  huffington v tc group llc et al  alleging violations of massachusetts blue sky law provisions and related claims involving material misrepresentations and omissions allegedly made during and after the marketing of ccc the plaintiff seeks treble damages interest expenses and attorneys fees and to have the subscription agreement deemed null and void and a full refund of the investment in march  the united states district court for the district of massachusetts dismissed the plaintiffs complaint on the grounds that it should have been filed in delaware instead of massachusetts and the plaintiff subsequently filed a notice of appeal to the united states court of appeals for the first circuit the plaintiff has lost his appeal to the first circuit and has filed a new claim in delaware state court the delaware state court granted in part and denied in part defendants motion for summary judgment the defendants are vigorously contesting the one remaining claim asserted by the plaintiff   in november  another ccc investor instituted legal proceedings on similar grounds in kuwaits court of first instance  national industries group v carlyle group  seeking to recover losses incurred in connection with an investment in ccc in july  the delaware court of chancery issued a decision restraining the plaintiff from proceeding in kuwait against either carlyle investment management llc or tc group llc based on the forum selection clause in the plaintiffs subscription agreement which provided for exclusive jurisdiction in delaware courts in september  the plaintiff reissued its complaint in kuwait naming ccc only and reissued its complaint in january  joining carlyle investment management llc as a defendant we believe these claims are without merit and intend to vigorously contest all such allegations    the guernsey liquidators who took control of ccc in march  filed four suits in july  against carlyle certain of its affiliates and the former directors of ccc in the delaware chancery court the royal court of guernsey the superior court of the district of columbia and the supreme court of new york new york county  carlyle capital corporation limited v conway et al  seeking  billion in damages they allege that carlyle and the ccc board of directors were negligent grossly negligent or willfully mismanaged the ccc investment program and breached certain fiduciary duties allegedly owed to ccc and its shareholders the liquidators further allege among other things that the directors and carlyle put the interests of carlyle ahead of the interests of ccc and its shareholders and gave priority to preserving and enhancing carlyles reputation and its brand over the best interests of ccc the defendants filed a comprehensive motion to dismiss in delaware in october  in december  the liquidators dismissed the complaint in delaware voluntarily and without prejudice and expressed an intent to proceed against the defendants in guernsey carlyle filed an action in delaware seeking an injunction against the liquidators to preclude them from proceeding in guernsey in violation of a delaware exclusive jurisdiction clause contained in the investment management agreement in july  the royal court of guernsey held that the case should be litigated in delaware pursuant to the exclusive jurisdiction clause that ruling was appealed by the liquidators and in february  was reversed by the guernsey court of appeal which held that the case should proceed in guernsey carlyle intends to seek review of that ruling pursuant to an application for special leave to the privy council carlyle will also request a stay of further proceedings pending consideration of the appeal application from the privy council also in october  the plaintiffs obtained an ex parte antiantisuit injunction in guernsey against carlyles antisuit claim in delaware that ruling has been affirmed by the guernsey court of appeal carlyle anticipates that it will seek a further appeal before the privy council on the antiantisuit injunction order the liquidators lawsuits in new york and the district of columbia were dismissed in december  without prejudice we believe that regardless of where the claims are litigated they are without merit and we will vigorously contest all allegations we recognized a loss of  million in  in connection with the winding up of ccc   in june  august  and september  three putative shareholder class actions were filed against carlyle certain of our affiliates and former directors of ccc alleging that the fund offering materials and various public disclosures were materially misleading or omitted material information two of the shareholder class actions  phelps v stomber et al  and  glaubach v carlyle capital corporation limited et al  were filed in the united states district court for the district of columbia the most recent shareholder class action  phelps v stomber et al  was filed in the supreme court of new york new york county and has subsequently been removed to the united states district court for the southern district of new york the two original dc cases were consolidated into one case under the caption of phelps v stomber and the phelps named plaintiffs have been designated lead plaintiffs by the court the new york case has been transferred to the dc federal court and the plaintiffs have requested that it be consolidated with the other two dc actions the defendants have opposed and have moved to dismiss the case as duplicative the plaintiffs in all three cases seek all compensatory damages sustained as a result of the alleged misrepresentations costs and expenses as well as reasonable attorney fees the defendants have filed a comprehensive motion to dismiss we believe the claims are without merit and will vigorously contest all claims   from  to  a luxembourg portfolio company owned by carlyle europe real estate partners lp cerep i received proceeds from the sale of real estate located in paris france cerep i is a real estate fund not consolidated by us the relevant french tax authorities have asserted that such portfolio company had a permanent establishment in france and have issued a tax assessment seeking to collect  million consisting of taxes interest and penalties we understand that the matter has been referred to the french ministry of justice which may appoint a prosecutor to conduct an investigation   during  cerep i completed a reorganization of several italian portfolio companies such italian portfolio companies subsequently completed the sale of various properties located in italy the italian tax authorities have issued revised income tax audit reports to various subsidiaries of cerep i the tax audit reports proposed to disallow deductions of certain capital losses claimed    with respect to the reorganization of the italian portfolio companies as a result of the disallowance of such deductions the audit reports proposed to increase the aggregate amount of italian income tax and penalties owed by subsidiaries of cerep i by approximately  million it is possible that the italian ministry of justice could appoint a prosecutor to conduct an investigation   cerep i and its subsidiaries and portfolio companies are contesting the french tax assessment and also intend to contest the proposed italian income tax adjustments settlement opportunities are also being explored although neither cerep i nor the relevant portfolio companies is consolidated by us we may determine to advance amounts to such nonconsolidated entities or otherwise incur costs to resolve such matters in which case we would seek to recover such advance from proceeds of subsequent portfolio dispositions by cerep i the amount of any unrecoverable costs that may be incurred by us is not estimable at this time   critical accounting policies   principles of consolidation   our policy is to consolidate those entities in which we have control over significant operating financing or investing decisions of the entity all significant interentity transactions and balances have been eliminated   for entities that are determined to be variable interest entities vies we consolidate those entities where we are deemed to be the primary beneficiary where vies have not qualified for the deferral of the revised consolidation guidance as described in note  to our consolidated financial statements an enterprise is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest a controlling financial interest is defined as a the power to direct the activities of a variable interest entity that most significantly impacts the entitys economic financial performance and b the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie the revised consolidation guidance requires analysis to a determine whether an entity in which carlyle holds a variable interest is a vie and b whether carlyles involvement through holding interests directly or indirectly in the entity or contractually through other variable interests eg management and performance related fees would give it a controlling financial interest performance of that analysis requires judgment our involvement with entities that have been subject to the revised consolidation guidance has generally been limited to our clos and the acquisitions of claren road alpinvest and esg   where vies have qualified for the deferral of the revised consolidation guidance the analysis is based on previously existing consolidation guidance pursuant to us gaap generally with the exception of the clos our funds qualify for the deferral of the revised consolidation rules under which the primary beneficiary is the entity that absorbs a majority of the expected losses of the vie or a majority of the expected residual returns of the vie or both we determine whether we are the primary beneficiary at the time we first become involved with a vie and subsequently reconsider that we are the primary beneficiary based on certain events the evaluation of whether a fund is a vie is subject to the requirements of asc  originally issued as fasb interpretation no r and the determination of whether we should consolidate such vie requires judgment these judgments include whether the equity investment at risk is sufficient to permit the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support evaluating whether the equity holders as a group can make decisions that have a significant effect on the success of the entity determining whether two or more parties equity interests should be aggregated determining whether the equity investors have proportionate voting rights to their obligations to absorb losses or rights to receive returns from an entity evaluating the nature of relationships and activities of the parties involved in determining which party within a relatedparty group is most closely associated with a vie and estimating cash flows in evaluating which member within the equity group absorbs a majority of the expected losses and hence would be deemed the primary beneficiary   for all carlyle funds and coinvestment entities collectively the funds that are not determined to be vies we consolidate those funds where as the sole general partner we have not overcome the presumption of control pursuant to us gaap    consolidation and deconsolidation of carlyle funds and certain coinvestment entities   most carlyle funds provide a dissolution right upon a simple majority vote of the noncarlyle affiliated limited partners such that the presumption of control by us is overcome accordingly these funds are not consolidated in our combined and consolidated financial statements certain carlylesponsored funds near the end of their partnership term do not provide the same dissolution right these funds consist mainly of one of our us buyout funds cp ii and its related entities and these are consolidated in our combined and consolidated financial statements the assets of the consolidated funds are classified principally within investments of consolidated funds the assets and liabilities of the consolidated funds are generally within separate legal entities therefore the liabilities of the consolidated funds are nonrecourse to us and our general creditors   performance fees   performance fees consist principally of the preferential allocation of profits to which we are entitled from certain of our funds commonly known as carried interest we are generally entitled to a  allocation or  to  in the case of most of our fund of funds vehicles of income as a carried interest after returning the invested capital the allocation of preferred returns and return of certain fund costs subject to catchup provisions carried interest is recognized upon appreciation of the funds investment values above certain return hurdles set forth in each respective partnership agreement we recognize revenues attributable to performance fees based on the amount that would be due pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were terminated at that date accordingly the amount recognized as performance fees reflects our share of the fair value gains and losses of the associated funds underlying investments   we may be required to return realized carried interests in the future if the funds investment values decline below certain levels when the fair value of a funds investments fall below certain return hurdles previously recognized performance fees are reduced as occurred for certain funds in  and  in all cases each fund is considered separately in that regard and for a given fund performance fees can never be negative over the life of a fund if upon a hypothetical liquidation of a funds investments at the current fair values previously recognized and distributed carried interest would be required to be returned a liability is established for the potential giveback obligation senior carlyle professionals and employees who have received distributions of carried interest which are ultimately returned are contractually obligated to reimburse us for the amount returned we record a receivable from current and former employees and our current and former senior carlyle professionals for their individual portion of any giveback obligation that we establish these receivables are included in due from affiliates and other receivables net in our combined and consolidated balance sheets   the timing of receipt of carried interest in respect of investments of our carry funds is dictated by the terms of the partnership agreements that govern such funds which generally allow for carried interest distributions in respect of an investment upon a realization event after satisfaction of obligations relating to the return of capital any realized losses applicable fees and expenses and the applicable annual preferred limited partner return distributions to eligible senior carlyle professionals in respect of such carried interest are generally made shortly thereafter the giveback obligation if any in respect of previously realized carried interest is generally determined and due upon the winding up or liquidation of a carry fund pursuant to the terms of the funds partnership agreement   in addition to our performance fees from our private equity funds we are also entitled to receive performance fees from certain of our other global credit alternatives funds when the return on aum exceeds certain benchmark returns or other performance targets in such arrangements performance fees are recognized when the performance benchmark has been achieved and are included in performance fees in the accompanying combined and consolidated statements of operations   performance fees due to employees and advisors   we have allocated a portion of the performance fees due to us to our employees and advisors these amounts are accounted for as compensation expense in conjunction with the related performance fee revenue and until paid recognized as a component of the accrued compensation and benefits liability upon any reversal of performance fee revenue the related compensation expense is also reversed    income taxes   no provision has been made for us federal income taxes in our combined and consolidated financial statements since we are a group of passthrough entities for us income tax purposes and our profits and losses are allocated to the senior carlyle professionals who are individually responsible for reporting such amounts based on applicable foreign state and local tax laws we record a provision for income taxes for certain entities we record a provision for state and local income taxes for certain entities based on applicable laws tax positions taken by us are subject to periodic audit by us federal state local and foreign taxing authorities   upon completion of our reorganization and related offering certain of the wholly owned subsidiaries of carlyle and the carlyle holdings partnerships will be subject to federal state and local corporate income taxes at the entity level and the related tax provision attributable to carlyles share of this income will be reflected in the consolidated financial statements the reorganization and offering may result in carlyle recording a significant deferred tax asset based on then enacted tax rates which will result in future tax deductions over time a substantial portion of this asset will be offset by a liability associated with the tax receivable agreement with our senior carlyle professionals the realization of our deferred tax assets will be dependent on the amount of our future taxable income before deductions related to the establishment of the deferred tax asset   we use the liability method of accounting for deferred income taxes pursuant to us gaap under this method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to temporary differences between the carrying value of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the statutory tax rates expected to be applied in the periods in which those temporary differences are settled the effect of a change in tax rates on deferred tax assets and liabilities is recognized in the period of the change a valuation allowance is recorded on our net deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that such assets will not be realized   under us gaap for income taxes the amount of tax benefit to be recognized is the amount of benefit that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination when appropriate we record a liability for uncertain tax positions which is included in accounts payable accrued expenses and other liabilities in our combined and consolidated balance sheets these balances include interest and penalties associated with uncertain tax positions we recognize interest accrued and penalties related to unrecognized tax positions in the provision for income taxes if recognized the entire amount of unrecognized tax positions would be recorded as a reduction in the provision for income taxes   fair value measurement   us gaap establishes a hierarchal disclosure framework which ranks the observability of inputs used in measuring financial instruments at fair value the observability of inputs is impacted by a number of factors including the type of financial instruments and their specific characteristics financial instruments with readily available quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets generally will have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value   the threelevel hierarchy for fair value measurement is defined as follows   level i   inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical instruments as of the reporting date the type of financial instruments included in level i include unrestricted securities including equities and derivatives listed in active markets we do not adjust the quoted price for these instruments even in situations where we hold a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price   level ii   inputs to the valuation methodology are other than quoted prices in active markets which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date the type of financial instruments in this category includes less liquid and restricted securities listed in active markets securities traded in other than active markets government and agency securities and certain overthecounter derivatives where the fair value is based on observable inputs    investments in hedge funds are classified in this category when their net asset value is redeemable without significant restriction   level iii   inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation financial instruments that are included in this category include investments in privatelyheld entities noninvestment grade residual interests in securitizations collateralized loan obligations and certain overthecounter derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs investments in fund of funds are generally included in this category   in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases a financial instruments level within the fair value hierarchy is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement our assessment of the significance of a particular input to any of our fair value measurements requires judgment and considers factors specific to each relevant investment noninvestment grade residual interests in securitizations collateralized loan obligations and certain overthecounter derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs   the table below summarizes the valuation of investments and other financial instruments included within our aum by segment and fair value hierarchy levels as of december                                                   as of december         corporate private           global market     fund of funds             equity     real assets     strategies     solutions     total       dollars in millions     level i                               level ii                                  level iii                                                                              total fair value                               other net asset value                                                                             total aum excluding available capital commitments                                    available capital commitments

in our hedge funds corresponding cash collateral amounts have been included in other net asset value   in the absence of observable market prices we value our investments using valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis for some investments little market activity may exist our determination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate our own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment taking into consideration a combination of internal and external factors including the appropriate risk adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity risks investments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity of operating companies real estate properties and certain debt positions the valuation technique for each of these investments is described below   corporate private equity investments   the fair values of corporate private equity investments are determined by reference to projected net earnings earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda the discounted cash flow method public market or private transactions valuations for comparable companies and other measures which in many cases are unaudited at the time received valuations may be derived by reference to observable valuation measures for comparable companies or transactions eg multiplying a key performance metric of the investee company such as ebitda by a relevant valuation multiple observed in the range of comparable companies or transactions adjusted by us for    differences between the investment and the referenced comparables and in some instances by reference to option pricing models or other similar models certain fund investments in our real assets global market strategies and fund of funds solutions segments are comparable to corporate private equity and are valued in accordance with these policies   real estate investments   the fair values of real estate investments are determined by considering projected operating cash flows sales of comparable assets if any and replacement costs among other measures the methods used to estimate the fair value of real estate investments include the discounted cash flow method andor capitalization rates cap rates analysis valuations may be derived by reference to observable valuation measures for comparable assets eg multiplying a key performance metric of the investee asset such as net operating income by a relevant cap rate observed in the range of comparable transactions adjusted by us for differences between the investment and the referenced comparables and in some instances by reference to pricing models or other similar methods additionally where applicable projected distributable cash flow through debt maturity will also be considered in support of the investments carrying value   creditoriented investments   the fair values of creditoriented investments are generally determined on the basis of prices between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services specifically for investments in distressed debt and corporate loans and bonds the fair values are generally determined by valuations of comparable investments in some instances we may utilize other valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow method   clo investments and clo loans payable   we have elected the fair value option to measure the loans payable of the clos at fair value subsequent to the date of initial adoption of the new consolidation rules as we have determined that measurement of the loans payable and preferred shares issued by the clos at fair value better correlates with the value of the assets held by the clos which are held to provide the cash flows for the note obligations the investments of the clos are also carried at fair value   the fair values of the clo loan and bond assets were primarily based on quotations from reputable dealers or relevant pricing services in situations where valuation quotations are unavailable the assets are valued based on similar securities market index changes and other factors we corroborate quotations from pricing services either with other available pricing data or with our own models   the fair values of the clo loans payable and the clo structured asset positions were determined based on both discounted cash flow analyses and thirdparty quotes those analyses considered the position size liquidity and current financial condition of the clos the thirdparty financing environment reinvestment rates recovery lags discount rates and default forecasts and is compared to broker quotations from market makers and third party dealers   generally the bonds and loans in the clos are not actively traded and are classified as level iii   net income from our consolidated clos resulting from underlying investment performance is substantially attributable to the investors in the clos and accordingly is reflected in noncontrolling interests a  change in value of the clo investments approximately  billion as of december   coupled with a correlated  change in value of the loans payable of the clos approximately  billion as of december   will result in no material net income or loss to the noncontrolling interests however if the investments in the clos change in value in an uncorrelated manner with the clo liabilities then the impact on net income attributable to noncontrolling interests could be significant regardless the impact on net income attributable to carlyle group is not significant   fund investments   our investments in funds are valued based on our proportionate share of the net assets provided by the third party general partners of the underlying fund partnerships based on the most recent available information which is typically a lag of up to     days the terms of the investments generally preclude the ability to redeem the investment distributions from these investments will be received as the underlying assets in the funds are liquidated the timing of which cannot be readily determined   investments include our ownership interests in the funds and the investments held by the consolidated funds the valuation procedures utilized for investments of the funds vary depending on the nature of the investment the fair value of investments in publicly traded securities is based on the closing price of the security with adjustments to reflect appropriate discounts if the securities are subject to restrictions upon the sale of a security the realized net gain or loss is computed on a weighted average cost basis   the valuation methodologies described above can involve subjective judgments and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may be incorrect which could result in the misstatement of fund performance and accrued performance fees because there is significant uncertainty in the valuation of or in the stability of the value of illiquid investments the fair values of such investments as reflected in an investment funds net asset value do not necessarily reflect the prices that would be obtained by us on behalf of the investment fund when such investments are realized realizations at values significantly lower than the values at which investments have been reflected in prior fund net asset values would result in reduced earnings or losses for the applicable fund the loss of potential carried interest and incentive fees and in the case of our hedge funds management fees changes in values attributed to investments from quarter to quarter may result in volatility in the net asset values and results of operations that we report from period to period also a situation where asset values turn out to be materially different than values reflected in prior fund net asset values could cause investors to lose confidence in us which could in turn result in difficulty in raising additional funds see risk factors  risks related to our company  valuation methodologies for certain assets in our funds can involve subjective judgments and the fair value of assets established pursuant to such methodologies may be incorrect which could result in the misstatement of fund performance and accrued performance fees   compensation and distributions payable to carlyle partners   compensation attributable to our senior carlyle professionals has historically been accounted for as distributions from equity rather than as employee compensation we have historically recognized a distribution from capital and distribution payable to our individual senior carlyle professionals when services are rendered and carried interest allocations are earned any unpaid distributions which reflect our obligation to those senior carlyle professionals are presented as due to senior carlyle professionals in our combined and consolidated balance sheets upon completion of our reorganization and related offering we will account for compensation attributable to our senior carlyle professionals as an expense in our statement of operations accordingly this will have the effect of increasing compensation expense relative to what has historically been recorded in our financial statements   equitybased compensation   upon completion of our reorganization and related offering we will implement equitybased compensation arrangements that will require senior carlyle professionals and other employees to vest ownership of their equity interests over future service periods this will result in compensation charges over future periods under us gaap in determining the aggregate fair value of any award grants we will need to make judgments among others as to the grant date and estimated forfeiture rates each of these elements particularly the forfeiture assumptions used in valuing our equity awards are subject to significant judgment and variability and the impact of changes in such elements on equitybased compensation expense could be material   intangible assets and goodwill   our intangible assets consist of acquired contractual rights to earn future fee income including management and advisory fees and acquired trademarks finitelived intangible assets are amortized over their estimated useful lives and are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the asset may not be recoverable    goodwill represents the excess of cost over the identifiable net assets of businesses acquired and is recorded in the functional currency of the acquired entity goodwill is recognized as an asset and is reviewed for impairment annually as of october  st  and between annual tests when events and circumstances indicate that impairment may have occurred   recent and pending accounting pronouncements   in may  the fasb amended its guidance for fair value measurements and disclosures to converge us gaap and international financial reporting standards ifrs the amended guidance included in asu  amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in us gaap is effective for us for our interim reporting period beginning after december   the amended guidance is generally clarifying in nature but does change certain existing measurement principles in asc  and requires additional disclosure about fair value measurements and unobservable inputs we have not completed our assessment of the impact of this amended guidance but do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements   in june  the fasb amended its guidance on the presentation of comprehensive income this guidance eliminates the option to report other comprehensive income and its components in the consolidated statement of changes in equity an entity may elect to present items of net income and other comprehensive income in one continuous statement referred to as the statement of comprehensive income or in two separate but consecutive statements each component of net income and of other comprehensive income needs to be displayed under either alternative in december  the fasb issued a final standard to defer the new requirement to present components of reclassifications of other comprehensive income on the face of the income statement this guidance is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after december   we adopted this guidance as of january   and the adoption did not have a material impact on our financial statements   in september  the fasb amended its guidance for testing goodwill for impairment by allowing an entity to use a qualitative approach to test goodwill for impairment the amended guidance included in asu  testing goodwill for impairment is effective for us for our annual reporting period beginning after december   the amended guidance is intended to reduce complexity by allowing an entity the option to make a qualitative evaluation about the likelihood of goodwill impairment to determine whether it should calculate the fair value of a reporting unit we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements   in december  the fasb amended its guidance for offsetting financial instruments the amended guidance included in asu  balance sheet topic  disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities is effective for us for our annual reporting period beginning on or after january   the amended guidance requires additional disclosure about netting arrangements to enable financial statement users to evaluate the effect or potential effect of such arrangements on an entitys financial position we do not expect the adoption to have a material impact on our financial statements   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk   our primary exposure to market risk is related to our role as general partner or investment advisor to our investment funds and the sensitivities to movements in the fair value of their investments including the effect on management fees performance fees and investment income   although our investment funds share many common themes each of our alternative asset management asset classes runs its own investment and risk management processes subject to our overall risk tolerance and philosophy the investment process of our investment funds involves a comprehensive due diligence approach including review of reputation of shareholders and management

more operating executives and senior investment professionals associated with that particular fund once an investment in a portfolio company has been made our fund teams closely monitor the performance of the portfolio company generally through frequent contact with management and the receipt of financial and management reports   effect on fund management fees   management fees will only be directly affected by shortterm changes in market conditions to the extent they are based on nav or represent permanent impairments of value these management fees will be increased or reduced in direct proportion to the effect of changes in the market value of our investments in the related funds the proportion of our management fees that are based on nav is dependent on the number and types of investment funds in existence and the current stage of each funds life cycle for the year ended december   approximately  of our fund management fees were based on the nav of the applicable funds   effect on performance fees   performance fees reflect revenue primarily from carried interest on our carry funds and incentive fees from our hedge funds in our discussion of key financial measures and critical accounting policies we disclose that performance fees are recognized upon appreciation of the valuation of our funds investments above certain return hurdles and are based upon the amount that would be due to carlyle at each reporting date as if the funds were liquidated at their thencurrent fair values changes in the fair value of the funds investments may materially impact performance fees depending upon the respective funds performance to date as compared to its hurdle rate and the related carry waterfall the following table summarizes the incremental impact including

currencies nonus dollar denominated assets and liabilities are translated at yearend rates of exchange and the combined and consolidated statements of operations accounts are translated at rates of exchange in effect throughout the year additionally a portion of our management fees are denominated in nonus dollar currencies we estimate that as of december   if the us dollar strengthened  against all foreign currencies the impact on our consolidated results of operations for the year then ended would be as follows a fund management fees would decrease by  million b performance fees would decrease by  million and c investment income would decrease by  million   interest rate risk   we have obligations under our term loan facility that accrue interest at variable rates interest rate changes may therefore affect the amount of interest payments future earnings and cash flows   we are subject to interest rate risk associated with our variable rate debt financing to manage this risk we entered into an interest rate swap in march  to fix the interest rate on approximately  of the  million in term loan borrowings at  the interest rate swap had an initial notional balance of  million a current balance of  million as of december   and amortizes through august   the swaps maturity date as the related term loan borrowings are repaid this instrument was designated as a cash flow hedge and remains in place after the amendment of the senior secured credit facility the interest rate swap continues to be designated as a cash flow hedge   in december  we entered into a second interest rate swap with an initial notional balance of  million to fix the interest rate at  on the remaining term loan borrowings not hedged by the march  interest rate swap this interest rate swap matures on september   which coincides with the maturity of the term loan this instrument has been designated as a cash flow hedge   based on our debt obligations payable and our interest rate swaps as of december   we estimate that interest expense relating to variable rates would increase by approximately  million on an annual basis in the event interest rates were to increase by one percentage point   credit risk   certain of our investment funds hold derivative instruments that contain an element of risk in the event that the counterparties are unable to meet the terms of such agreements we minimize our risk exposure by limiting the counterparties with which we enter into contracts to banks and investment banks who meet established credit and capital guidelines we do not expect any counterparty to default on its obligations and therefore do not expect to incur any loss due to counterparty default      unaudited pro forma financial information   the following unaudited condensed combined and consolidated pro forma statement of operations for the year ended december   and the unaudited condensed combined and consolidated pro forma balance sheet as of december   are based upon the historical financial statements included elsewhere in this prospectus and the historical financial statements of the business acquisitions defined below these pro forma financial statements present our consolidated results of operations and financial position giving pro forma effect to the business acquisitions the reorganization and offering transactions described under organizational structure and the other transactions described below as if such transactions had been completed as of january   with respect to the unaudited condensed combined and consolidated pro forma statement of operations for the year ended december   and as of december   with respect to the unaudited condensed combined and consolidated pro forma balance sheet the pro forma adjustments are based on available information and upon assumptions that our management believes are reasonable in order to reflect on a pro forma basis the impact of these transactions on the historical combined and consolidated financial information of carlyle group the adjustments are described in the notes to the unaudited condensed combined and consolidated pro forma statement of operations and the unaudited condensed combined and consolidated pro forma balance sheet   carlyle group is considered our predecessor for accounting purposes and its combined and consolidated financial statements will be our historical financial statements following the completion of the reorganization and this offering because the existing owners of the parent entities control the entities that comprise carlyle group before and after the reorganization we will account for the transaction among these owners interests in our business as part of the reorganization as a transfer of interests under common control accordingly we will carry forward unchanged the value of these owners interests in the assets and liabilities recognized in carlyle groups combined and consolidated financial statements into our consolidated financial statements   the pro forma adjustments in the business acquisitions column give effect to the following transactions       the acquisition by carlyle group in july  of a  equity interest in alpinvest one of the worlds largest investors in private equity which advises a global private equity and mezzanine fund of funds program and related coinvestment and secondary activities       the acquisition by carlyle group in july  of a  interest in esg an emerging markets equities and macroeconomic strategies investment manager   since the acquisitions of alpinvest and esg were completed in july  the impact of these transactions is fully reflected in the historical carlyle group combined and consolidated balance sheet as of december   and therefore no adjustments are necessary to the unaudited pro forma balance sheet as of december   also the results of operations of alpinvest and esg for the period from july   through december   are reflected in the historical carlyle group combined and consolidated statement of operations and therefore the pro forma adjustment to the unaudited condensed combined and consolidated pro forma statement of operations reflects the results of operations of alpinvest and esg for the period from january   through june     the acquisitions of alpinvest and esg are collectively hereinafter referred to as the business acquisitions the pro forma adjustments for the business acquisitions are based on the historical financial statements of the business acquisitions presented under us gaap and include assumptions that we believe are reasonable the pro forma adjustments do not reflect any operating efficiencies or cost savings that we may achieve any additional expenses that may be incurred with respect to operating the combined company or the costs of integration that the combined company may incur the pro forma adjustments give effect to events that are i directly attributable to the    business acquisitions ii factually supportable and iii expected to have a continuing impact on the combined results of the companies   the pro forma adjustments in the reorganization and other adjustments column principally give effect to certain of the reorganization and offering transactions described under organizational structure including       the restructuring of certain beneficial interests in investments in or alongside our funds that were funded by certain existing and former owners of the parent entities indirectly through the parent entities such that the parent entities have i distributed a portion of these interests so that they are held directly by such persons and are no longer consolidated in our financial statements and ii restructured the remainder of these interests so that they are reflected as noncontrolling interests in our financial statements       the redemption in march  using borrowings on the revolving credit facility of our existing senior secured credit facility of the remaining  million aggregate principal amount of the subordinated notes as a result of this redemption and the preceding redemption in october  of  million aggregate principal amount of the subordinated notes all of the subordinated notes have been fully redeemed       the restructuring of certain carried interest rights allocated to retired senior carlyle professionals so that such carried interest rights will be reflected as noncontrolling interests in our financial statements our retired senior carlyle professionals who have existing carried interests rights through their ownership in the parent entities did not participate in the transactions described in reorganization and offering transactions under organizational structure the carried interest rights held by these individuals have been restructured such that they have exchanged their existing carried interest rights through their ownership interests in the parent entities for an equivalent amount of carried interest rights in the general partners of our funds the individuals maintain the same carried interest rights before and after this restructuring and no consideration in any form is being provided to them       the reallocation of carried interest to senior carlyle professionals and other individuals who manage our carry funds such that the allocation to these individuals will be approximately  of all carried interest on a blended average basis with the exception of the riverstone funds where carlyle will retain essentially all of the carry to which we are entitled under our arrangements for those funds       an adjustment to reflect compensation attributable to our senior carlyle professionals as compensation expense rather than as distributions from equity as well as an adjustment to reclassify the liability for amounts owed to our senior carlyle professionals from due to carlyle partners to accrued compensation and benefits and       a provision for corporate income taxes on the income of the carlyle group lps whollyowned subsidiaries that will be taxable for us income tax purposes which we refer to as the corporate taxpayers   the pro forma adjustments in the offering adjustments column principally give effect to certain of the reorganization and offering transactions described under organizational structure including       a distribution that our parent entities have made to their owners of previously undistributed earnings totaling  million       an adjustment to reflect compensation expense related to the issuance and vesting of carlyle holdings partnership units as part of the carlyle holdings formation          an adjustment to reflect compensation expense related to the grant and vesting of the deferred restricted common units of the carlyle group lp and the phantom deferred restricted common units which were granted to our employees at the time of this offering       the issuance of  common units in this offering at an initial public offering price of  per common unit less estimated underwriting discounts and the payment of offering expenses by carlyle holdings       the purchase by the carlyle group lps whollyowned subsidiaries of newlyissued carlyle holdings partnership units for cash with the proceeds from this offering and       the application by carlyle holdings of a portion of the proceeds from this offering to repay outstanding indebtedness as described in use of proceeds   the pro forma adjustments in the adjustments for noncontrolling interests column relate to an adjustment to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities representing the carlyle holdings partnership units held by our existing owners after this offering prior to the completion of this offering our existing owners will contribute all of their interests in the parent entities to carlyle holdings in exchange for an equivalent fair value of carlyle holdings partnership units the carlyle holdings partnership units held by the existing owners will be reflected as noncontrolling interests in carlyle holdings in the combined and consolidated financial statements of the carlyle group lp   as described in greater detail under certain relationships and related person transactions  tax receivable agreement we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with our existing owners that provides for the payment by the corporate taxpayers to our existing owners of  of the amount of cash savings if any in us federal state and local income tax or franchise tax that the corporate taxpayers realize as a result of the exchange by the limited partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships for the carlyle group lp common units and the resulting increases in tax basis and of certain other tax benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement no such exchanges or other tax benefits have been assumed in the unaudited pro forma financial information and therefore no pro forma adjustment related to the tax receivable agreement is necessary   as a public company we will be

related to these steps and among other things additional directors and officers liability insurance director fees reporting requirements of the sec transfer agent fees hiring additional accounting legal and administrative personnel increased auditing and legal fees and similar expenses we have not included any pro forma adjustments relating to these costs   the unaudited condensed pro forma

million of these interests at december   were distributed so that they are held directly by such persons and are no longer consolidated in our financial statements and approximately  million of these interests at december   will be restructured so that they will be reported as noncontrolling interests in our financial statements the combined effect is a  million reduction to our members equity          historically these beneficial interests were funded through capital contributions to the parent entities which were then invested into the respective fund accordingly in the historical financial statements of carlyle group these beneficial interests were included in the captions investments and accrued performance fees due from affiliates and other receivables net and members equity on the carlyle group balance sheet and investment incomelosses on such interests were included in investment income loss interest and other income and net income attributable to carlyle group on the carlyle group statement of operations          for the beneficial interests that were distributed that will be held directly by such persons a pro forma adjustment has been recorded to decrease investments due from affiliates and members equity as such interests will be distributed from the parent entities to the beneficial owners included in the distributed beneficial interests were  million of interests in our clos that are included in our consolidated funds in the carlyle group historical combined and consolidated financial statements these investments in the form of debt securities issued by the clo or equity interests in the clo had been eliminated against the related liability or equity recorded by the consolidated clo for these interests in consolidated clos the pro forma adjustment results in increases to loans payable of consolidated funds and equity appropriated for consolidated funds as the aforementioned elimination is no longer applicable after the debt securities or equity interests are held directly by the beneficial owner and a decrease to members equity to reflect the distribution of the interest          for the restructured beneficial interests that will be reflected as noncontrolling interests totaling  million at december   a pro forma adjustment has been recorded to decrease members equity and increase noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities as such interests have been distributed from the parent entities to a legal entity that is not consolidated by carlyle holdings the underlying investment asset related to those interests continues to be held by a consolidated subsidiary of carlyle holdings and the beneficial interests held by the nonconsolidated legal entity are interests directly in the consolidated subsidiary               the pro forma adjustments are based on the carrying amounts of these beneficial interests in the historical financial statements the following table summarizes the pro forma

                                              subsequent to the completion of the reorganization we will account for the restructured beneficial interests as investments and accrued performance fees and noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and the distributed beneficial interests associated with consolidated clos as loans payable of consolidated funds and equity appropriated for consolidated funds there will be no ongoing accounting for the other distributed beneficial interests after the reorganization is complete     b  reflects the redemption in march  of the remaining  million aggregate principal amount of the subordinated loan payable to affiliate for a redemption price of  million there was no accrued interest liability at december   on the subordinated loan payable to affiliate the redemption was funded through borrowings on the revolving credit facility of carlyle groups existing senior secured credit facility this transaction resulted in a nonrecurring gain of  million representing the difference between the fair value of the subordinated notes at december   of  million and the redemption value of  million as a result of this redemption and the preceding redemption in october  of  million aggregate principal amount of the subordinated notes all of the subordinated notes have been fully redeemed     c  reflects the reclassification of amounts owed to senior carlyle professionals to accrued compensation and benefits prior to the reorganization and this offering the entities that comprise carlyle group have been partnerships or limited liability companies and our senior carlyle professionals were part of the ownership group of those entities in the historical financial statements the liability to senior carlyle professionals for amounts owed to them primarily compensation and performance fee related compensation was reported separately from compensation amounts owed to other carlyle employees subsequent to the reorganization the liability for compensation amounts owed to senior carlyle professionals and other carlyle employees will be aggregated on our balance sheet     d  reflects the reallocation of carried interest to senior carlyle professionals and other individuals who manage our carry funds such that the allocation to these individuals will be approximately  of all carried interest on a blended average basis with the exception of the riverstone funds where carlyle will retain essentially all of the carry to which we are entitled under our arrangements for those funds as part of the reorganization our senior carlyle professionals and other individuals who manage our carry funds will contribute to carlyle      holdings a portion of the equity interests they own in the general partners of our existing carry funds in exchange for an equivalent fair value of carlyle holdings partnership units          historically these allocations of carried interest were accounted for as compensatory profit sharing arrangements this adjustment reduces accrued compensation as of december   and increases members equity to reflect the elimination of the compensation liability through the issuance of carlyle holdings partnership units in the exchange as of december   the compensation liability related to this exchange was  million the fair value of the carlyle holdings partnership units issued in this transaction will exceed the carrying value of the liability resulting in a loss on the exchange of  million as the loss on the exchange represents a material nonrecurring charge it has been excluded from the unaudited condensed combined and consolidated pro forma statement of operations for the year ended december   the pro forma increase to members equity related to the issuance of the carlyle holdings partnership units less the decrease to members equity for the loss on the exchange results in a net pro forma increase to members equity of  million the amounts for this adjustment have been derived from our historical results   subsequent to the completion of the reorganization and this offering we will continue to account for the remaining equity interests that our senior carlyle professionals and other individuals who manage our carry funds own in the general partners of our existing carry funds as compensatory profit sharing arrangements     e  reflects the restructuring of ownership of certain carried interest rights allocated to retired senior carlyle professionals so that such carried interest rights will be reflected as noncontrolling interests our retired senior carlyle professionals who have existing carried interests rights through their ownership in the parent entities did not participate in the transactions described in reorganization and offering transactions under organizational structure the carried interest rights held by these individuals have been restructured such that they have exchanged their existing carried interest rights through their ownership interests in the parent entities for an equivalent amount of carried interest rights directly in the consolidated general partners of our funds the individuals maintain the same carried interest rights before and after this restructuring and no consideration in any form is being provided to them historically these interests were reflected within members equity on the carlyle group balance sheet as these interests existed through the individuals ownership interests in the parent entities and the income attributable to these carried interest rights was included in net income attributable to carlyle group on the carlyle group statement of operations because their interests were part of the controlling interest in carlyle group the amounts for this adjustment have been derived from our historical results at december   the carrying value of these restructured carried interest rights was approximately  million this adjustment has been recorded to reclassify this balance from members equity to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities   subsequent to the completion of the reorganization we will account for the carried interest rights allocated to retired senior carlyle professionals as noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities      offering adjustments     a  reflects net proceeds of  million from this offering through the issuance of  common units at an initial public offering price of  per common unit less estimated underwriting discounts of  million with a corresponding increase to members equity the net cash

existing owners will exchange their interests in the parent entities and general partners for an equivalent fair value of carlyle holdings partnership units each existing owner will receive a number of carlyle holdings partnership units that is based on hisher individual interest in the parent entities and general partners but in each case the individual will receive an equal number of

from us we will directly and indirectly own  of the outstanding carlyle holdings partnership units upon the completion of this offering and the balance of the outstanding carlyle holdings partnership units will be owned by the existing owners   we account for this portion of the reorganization as a change in a parents ownership interest while retaining control accordingly we account for the cost

the controlling interest represents alpinvest for the alpinvest consolidated historical financial statements and esg for the esg consolidated historical financial statements      reorganization and other adjustments     a  this adjustment reflects the restructuring of certain beneficial interests in investments in or alongside our funds including a note receivable that were funded by certain existing and formers owners of the parent entities indirectly through the parent entities as part of the reorganization certain interests have been distributed so that they are held directly by such persons and are no longer consolidated in our financial statements and certain other interests have been restructured so that they will be reported as noncontrolling interests               historically these beneficial interests were funded through capital contributions to the parent entities which were then invested into the respective fund accordingly in the historical financial statements of carlyle group these beneficial interests were included in the captions investments and accrued performance fees due from affiliates and other receivables net and members equity on the carlyle group balance sheet and investment incomelosses on such interests were included in investment income loss interest and other income and net income attributable to carlyle group on the carlyle group statement of operations          for the beneficial interests that were distributed so that will be held directly by such persons a pro forma adjustment has been recorded to eliminate the historical investment income associated with the investments with a corresponding decrease to net income attributable to carlyle group as they are no longer investments of carlyle holdings included in the distributed beneficial interests were certain interests in our clos that are included in our consolidated funds in the carlyle group historical combined and consolidated financial statements the investment incomeloss on those interests had been eliminated against the related gainloss recorded by the consolidated fund for these interests in consolidated clos the pro forma adjustment results in an adjustment to net investment gains losses of consolidated funds as the aforementioned elimination is no longer applicable after the interest is held directly by the beneficial owner          for the beneficial interests that will be reflected as noncontrolling interests a pro forma adjustment has been recorded to reclassify the income attributable to the restructured interests to income attributable to noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities from income attributable to carlyle group the underlying investment related to those interests continues to be held by a consolidated subsidiary of carlyle holdings and the beneficial interests are interests directly in the consolidated subsidiary          the amounts for these adjustments were derived based on historical financial results the following table summarizes the pro forma impact for the restructured beneficial interests

we will account for the restructured beneficial interests as noncontrolling interests in consolidated entities and the distributed beneficial interests associated with consolidated clos as net

changes to compensation and benefits expenses associated with historical payments to our senior carlyle professionals attributable to compensation and benefits and the reallocation of carried interest in our carry funds that are currently held by our senior carlyle professionals and other carlyle employees also included in this        adjustment is the change in the fair value of the liability associated with acquisitionrelated contingent consideration that is payable to senior carlyle professionals based on the fulfillment of performance conditions the effects of these items on our unaudited condensed combined and consolidated pro forma statement of operations is as follows dollars in millions             compensation and benefits attributable to senior carlyle professionals       performance fee related compensation attributable to senior carlyle professionals        fair value adjustment to contingent consideration liability        performance fee related compensation expense adjustment due to carried interest reallocation                 total                      reflects an adjustment to record base salary annual bonus and benefit expenses attributable to our senior carlyle professionals as compensation expense additionally performance fee related compensation attributable to our senior carlyle professionals is included in this pro forma adjustment prior to the reorganization and this offering the entities that comprise carlyle group have been partnerships or limited liability companies accordingly all payments to our senior carlyle professionals generally have been accounted for as distributions from members equity rather than as compensation expenses following this offering we intend to account for compensation payments to our senior carlyle professionals as compensation expenses amounts have been derived based upon our historical results and the pro forma adjustments for the business acquisitions and do not reflect the assumed acquisition by carlyle holdings of the additional allocations of carried interest in our carry funds that are currently held by our senior carlyle professionals see  below    reflects an adjustment to record the change in the fair value of the liability associated with contingent consideration related to the esg and claren road acquisitions that is payable to senior carlyle professionals based on the fulfillment of performance conditions these payments are not contingent upon the senior carlyle professional being employed by carlyle at the time that the performance conditions are met historically the change in the fair value of this liability was recorded within members equity as the amounts are obligations payable to senior carlyle professionals following this offering we intend to account for this liability in a manner similar to all other acquisitionrelated contingent consideration the change in fair value of this liability will be recorded within other nonoperating expenses the fair value of the contingent consideration was based on probabilityweighted discounted cash flow models    in order to better align the interests of our senior carlyle professionals and the other individuals who manage our carry funds with our own interests and with those of the investors in these funds such individuals are allocated directly a portion of the carried interest in our carry funds prior to the reorganization the level of such allocations vary by fund but generally are at least  of the carried interests in the fund as part of the reorganization there will be a reallocation of carried interest to senior carlyle professionals and other individuals who manage our carry funds such that the allocation to these individuals will be approximately  of all carried interest on a blended average basis with the exception of the riverstone funds where carlyle will retain essentially all of the carry to which we are entitled under our arrangements for those funds our senior carlyle professionals and other individuals who manage our carry funds will contribute to carlyle holdings a portion of the equity interests they own in the general partners of our existing carry funds in exchange for an equivalent fair value of carlyle holdings partnership units no compensation is associated with this exchange as the individuals are receiving an equivalent fair value of carlyle holdings partnership units for the fair value of the carried interest rights that they are contributing   historically these allocations of carried interest were accounted for as performance fee compensation expense for our carlyle employees and as distributions from members equity for our senior carlyle professionals this adjustment reduces the performance fee related compensation expense associated with the reallocation of carried interest the amounts have been derived from our historical results   excluded from this pro forma adjustment is a nonrecurring charge of approximately  million the fair value of the carlyle holdings interests issued in this transaction exceeds the carrying value of the compensation liability resulting in a nonrecurring charge of  million associated with this transaction   subsequent to the completion of the reorganization and this offering we will account for the remaining equity interests that our senior carlyle professionals and other individuals who manage our carry funds own in the general partners of our existing carry funds as performance fee compensation expense     c  reflects the elimination of all

loan payable to affiliate in march  the parent entities redeemed the remaining  million aggregate principal amount of the subordinated loan payable to affiliate for  million as a result of the redemptions in october  and march  all of the subordinated notes have been fully redeemed accordingly interest expense of  million and fair value adjustments of  million for the year ended december

at an average interest rate of      d  we have historically operated as a group of partnerships for us federal income tax purposes and for certain entities located outside the united states corporate entities for foreign income tax purposes because most of the entities in our consolidated group are passthrough entities for us federal income tax purposes our profits and losses are generally allocated to the partners who are individually responsible for reporting such amounts and we are not taxed at the entity level based on applicable foreign state and local tax laws we record a provision for income taxes for certain entities accordingly the income tax provisions shown on carlyle groups historical combined and consolidated statement of operations of  million for the year ended december   primarily consisted of the district of columbia and foreign corporate income taxes   following the transactions described under organizational structure and this offering the carlyle holdings partnerships and their subsidiaries will continue to operate as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes and for certain entities located outside the united states corporate entities for foreign income tax purposes accordingly several entities will continue to be subject to the district of columbia franchise tax and the new york city unincorporated business income tax ubt and nonus entities will continue to be subject to corporate income taxes in jurisdictions in which they operate in in addition certain newly formed whollyowned subsidiaries of the carlyle group lp will be subject to entitylevel corporate income taxes as a result of our new corporate structure we will record an additional provision for corporate income taxes that will reflect our current and

necessary     e  reflects the historical basis of partnership interests in subsidiaries of the parent entities that the existing owners are retaining certain retired senior carlyle professionals will retain their interests in our carried interest entities for these individuals their carried interests rights will be restructured such that they will exchange their preexisting carried interest rights through their ownership interests in the parent entities for an equivalent amount of carried interest rights directly in the consolidated general partners of our funds historically these interests were reflected within members equity on the carlyle group balance sheet as these interests existed through the individuals ownership interests in the parent entities and the income attributable to these carried interests rights were included in net income attributable to carlyle group on the carlyle group statement of operations because their interests were part of the controlling interest in carlyle group as their carried interest rights will no longer be held through a parent of carlyle group directly or indirectly after this exchange this adjustment reclassifies the income attributable

its anchor clients are two large dutch pension funds which were the founders and previous shareholders of the company      the following chart presents the aum by asset class of our fund of funds

historical management team who are our employees will continue to exercise independent investment authority without involvement by other carlyle personnel we will observe substantial restrictions on the ability of carlyle personnel other than alpinvests existing management team to access investment information or engage in daytoday participation in the alpinvest investment business including a restriction that alpinvest investment decisions be made and maintained without involvement by other carlyle personnel accordingly we will have a reduced ability to identify or respond to investment and other operational issues that may arise within the alpinvest business relative to other carlyle operations see risk factors  risks related to our business operations  our fund of funds solutions business is subject to additional risks   investment approach   corporate private equity   the investment approach of our private equity teams is generally characterized as follows       consistent and disciplined investment process   we believe our successful investment track record is the result in part of a consistent and disciplined application of our investment process investment opportunities for our corporate private equity funds are initially sourced and evaluated by one or more of our deal teams each investment opportunity of our private equity funds must first pass an approval process that involves initial approvals from a fund head or cofund heads interim update meetings that frequently include operating executives as well as our chief investment officer william e conway jr and a due diligence review our due diligence approach typically incorporates meetings with management company facility visits discussions with industry analysts and consultants and an indepth examination of financial results and projections this transaction review process places a special emphasis on among other considerations the reputation of a target companys shareholders and management the companys size and sensitivity of cash flow generation the business sector and competitive risks the portfolio fit exit risks and other key factors highlighted by the deal team an investment opportunity must secure final approval from the investment committee of the applicable investment fund the investment committee approval process involves a detailed overview of the transaction and investment thesis business risk factors and diligence issues as well as financial models       industryfocused   we have adopted an industryfocused approach to investing we have particular industry expertise in aerospace defense and government services consumer and retail financial services healthcare industrial technology and business services telecommunications and media and transportation as a result we believe that our indepth knowledge of specific industries improves our ability to source and create transactions conduct effective and more informed due diligence develop strong relationships with management teams and use contacts and relationships within such industries to identify potential buyers as part of a coherent exit strategy as the firm has expanded to include teams in europe asia japan south america subsaharan africa and mena the industry groups have also grown and reach across even more geographies disciplines and funds       variable deal sizes   our teams are staffed not only to effectively pursue large transactions but also other transactions of varying sizes we often invest in smaller companies and this has allowed us to obtain greater diversity across our entire portfolio on an overall basis we believe that having the resources to complete investments of varying sizes provides our funds        with the ability to enhance their investment returns while providing for prudent industry geographic and size diversification       control and influence oriented   our corporate private equity funds other than our growth funds and our funds focused on emerging markets typically acquire either alone or as part of a consortium control of companies in leveraged buyout transactions additionally we seek to obtain board representation and typically appoint our investment professionals and operating executives to represent us on the board of a company in which we invest where our funds either alone or as part of a consortium are not the controlling investor we typically subject to applicable regulatory requirements acquire significant voting and other rights with a view to securing influence over conduct of the business       driving value creation   our corporate private equity teams seek to make investments in portfolio companies in which our particular strengths and resources including industry expertise extensive local presence across the globe and deep business relationships may be employed to their best advantage typically as part of a corporate private equity investment carlyles investment teams will develop and execute a customized value creation thesis that underpins the projected investment return for the company the value creation plan is developed during a thorough due diligence effort and draws on the deep resources available across our global platform specifically relying on       reach   our global team and global presence that enables us to support international expansion efforts and global supply chain initiatives       expertise   our investment professionals and our specialists dedicated to nine industry sectors who provide extensive sectorspecific knowledge and local market expertise       insight   our  operating executives primarily deeply experienced former ceos who work with our investment teams during due diligence provide boardlevel governance and support and advise our portfolio company ceos and our extensive pool of consultants and advisors who provide specialist expertise to support specific value creation initiatives       data   our investment portfolio which includes over  active portfolio companies that range across diverse industries geographies asset classes and investment strategies serves as an economic leading indicator and provides us with advanced market intelligence   a value creation thesis typically focuses on a combination of i international expansion through organic initiatives and acquisitions ii operational improvements which often include supply chain efficiencies lean process improvements and six sigma initiatives iii business growth initiatives via new product launches rd efforts as well as acquisitions or newmarket entrance and iv supporting and supplementing senior management capabilities with our broad network and organized global ceo forums progress against the initial investment thesis is reviewed each quarter by our founders sector vicechairmen and other senior investment professionals as part of our quarterly portfolio reviews and quarterly valuation processes       pursuing best exit alternatives   in determining when to exit an investment our private equity teams consider whether a portfolio company has achieved its objectives the financial returns and the appropriate timing in industry cycles and company development to strive for the optimal value senior members of the funds investment committee must approve all exit decisions from inception through december   our corporate private equity funds have invested approximately  billion in  transactions and we have fully realized  of these investments        real assets   our real assets business includes investments in the energy and renewable resources sectors and in infrastructure assets companies and projects as well as our real estate investments the investment approach of the teams advising the energy and renewable resources and infrastructure funds is similar to that of our corporate private equity funds with certain additional objectives for example our infrastructure investment team pursues partnerships with public and private operators of infrastructure assets which seek to generate stable longterm returns with riverstone we have often pursued investments in buyout growth capital and strategic joint ventures with management teams seeking to build companies in the energy and renewable resources sector   the investment approach of our real estate teams is generally characterized as follows       pursue an opportunistic strategy   in general our real estate funds have focused on single asset transactions using an opportunistic real estate investment strategy we follow this approach because we believe that pursuing single assets enables us to better underwrite the factors that contribute to the fundamental value of each property mitigate concentration risk establish appropriate assetbyasset capital structures and maintain governance over major propertylevel decisions in addition direct ownership of assets typically enables us to effectively employ an active asset management approach and reduce financing and operating risk while increasing the visibility of factors that affect the overall returns of the investment we evaluate the risk and return factors that are inherent in each specific property situation we believe we have an indepth understanding of the key factors affecting real property markets flows of domestic and crossborder capital and macroeconomic trends which allow us to identify analyze and evaluate potential investments quickly and creatively often in connection with complex transactions       seek out strong joint venture partners or managers   where appropriate we seek out joint venture partners or managers with significant operational expertise for each joint venture we design structures and terms that provide situationally appropriate incentives often including for example the subordination of the joint venture partners equity and profits interest to that of a fund claw back provisions

endeavor to establish market presence in our target geographies where we have a history of operating in our local markets and benefit from extensive longterm relationships with developers corporate real estate owners institutional investors and private owners such relationships have resulted in our ability to source investments on a direct negotiated basis we generally seek to avoid situations

dispositions the asset management teams work closely with the other real estate professionals to effectively formulate and implement strategic management plans            manage the exit of investments   we believe that exit management is as important as traditional asset management in order to take full advantage of the typically short windows of opportunity created by temporary imbalances in capital market forces that affect real estate in determining when to exit an investment our real estate teams consider whether an investment has fulfilled its strategic plan the depth of the market and generally prevailing industry conditions   from inception through december   our real assets funds have invested more than  billion in  transactions and we have fully realized  of these investments   global market strategies   the investment approach of our global market strategies carry funds is generally characterized as follows       source investment opportunities   our global

performance our global market strategies teams seek to structure investments with strong financial covenants frequent reporting requirements and board representation if possible through board observation rights or a board seat our global market strategies teams have historically provided a consultative interactive approach to equity sponsors and management partners as part of the overall

returns absent broad market movements            unique actionable idea generation   the public markets are thoroughly analyzed by the numerous competitors in asset management however due to technical factors or general investor sentiment securities can become over or undervalued quickly relative to their intrinsic value our hedge fund managers separate their research teams into industry and geography specific analysts in order to develop indepth coverage on companies and sectors to generate proprietary research with actionable alphagenerating ideas as prices evolve       strong risk

chart presents the name acronym total capital commitments in the case of our carry and structured credit funds and fund of funds vehicles assets under management in the case of our hedge funds and vintage year of the active funds in each of our segments as of december   we present total capital commitments as opposed to assets under management for our closedend investment funds because we believe this metric provides the most useful information regarding the relative size and scale of such funds in the case of our hedge funds which are openended and accordingly do not have permanent committed capital we believe the most useful metric regarding relative size and scale is assets under management     capital raising and investor services   since inception we have raised approximately  billion in capital excluding acquisitions we have successfully and repeatedly raised longterm nonredeemable capital commitments to new and successor private funds despite the recent challenges in the fundraising markets from december   through december   we had closings for commitments totaling approximately  billion across  funds and related coinvestment vehicles as well as net inflows to our hedge funds   our diverse and sophisticated investor base includes more than  active carry fund investors located in  countries included among our many longstanding fund investors are pension funds sovereign wealth funds insurance companies and high net worth individuals in the united states and around the world including significant institutional investors in asia and the middle      east we have also been a leader in the industry by forging strategic relationships with large institutional investors such as calpers which completed a minority investment in our business in  and mubadala which made minority investments in our business in  and  both calpers and mubadala have also historically been significant investors in our funds we have also devoted substantial resources to creating comprehensive and timely investor reports which is increasingly important to our investor base   we work for our fund investors and continuously seek to strengthen and expand our relationships with our fund investors we have a dedicated inhouse lp relations group which includes  geographically focused investor relations professionals with extensive investor relations and fundraising experience supported by  product and client segment specialists and support staff operating on a global basis and drawing upon a worldwide network of relationships we strive to secure a firstmover advantage with key investors often by establishing a local presence and providing a broad and diverse range of investment options   our lp relations professionals are in constant dialogue with our fund investors which enables us to monitor client preferences and tailor future fund offerings to meet investor demand as of december   approximately  of commitments to our active carry funds by dollar amount were from investors who are committed to more than one active carry fund and approximately  of commitments to our active carry funds by dollar amount were from investors who are committed to more than five active carry funds of the approximately  of commitments to our active carry funds from investors that are not committed to more than one active carry fund the majority approximately  by dollar amount of these commitments are in the newest generation of funds we believe the loyalty of our investor base as evidenced by our substantial number of multifund investors enhances our ability to raise successor funds in existing strategies   the chart below shows the percentage of capital committed by investors to our active carry funds in billions segmented by the number of active carry funds in which the investors were committed as of december   and december   respectively for example as of december    of our capital was provided by investors who had committed capital to more than  active carry funds as of december   that percentage had grown to more than  of our committed capital to active carry funds as of december    of the capital of our active carry funds was provided by investors who were committed to six or more active carry funds as of december   that percentage had grown to approximately  of the committed capital of our active carry funds      our larger investors those with  million or more of aggregate capital commitments to our active carry funds are on average invested in over seven active carry funds    of capital commitments from multifund investors     the charts below present total commitments to our active carry funds by geography and source of commitment each as of december         we believe that there is a substantial opportunity for growth in investor allocations to the alternative investment sector as the significant capital invested in the sector during  is returned to investors and as certain categories of alternative investors such as pension funds seek higher investment returns to close the gap between their assets and projected liabilities we believe we are well positioned to capitalize on this sector growth due to the breadth of our investor relationships the diversity of our product offerings and our track record of investment performance   we have a team of over  investor services professionals worldwide the investor services group performs a range of functions to support our investment teams and our lp relations group including informing investors on an ongoing basis about the performance of carlyle investments this group provides an important control function ensures that transactions are structured pursuant      to the partnership agreements and assists in regulatory

group also works closely with each funds lifecycle from fund formation and investments to portfolio monitoring and fund liquidation we maintain an internal legal and compliance team which includes  professionals and a government relations group with a presence around the globe which includes  professionals we intend to continue to build and invest in our legal regulatory and compliance functions to enable our investment teams to better serve our investors   structure and operation of our investment funds   we conduct the sponsorship and management of our carry funds and other investment vehicles primarily through a partnership structure in which limited partnerships organized by us accept commitments andor funds for investment from institutional investors and high net worth individuals each investment fund that is a limited partnership or partnership fund has a general partner that is responsible for the management and administration of the funds affairs and makes all policy and investment decisions relating to the conduct of the investment funds business the limited partners of the partnership funds take no part in the conduct or control of the business of such funds have no right or authority to act for or bind such funds and have no influence over the voting or disposition of the securities or other assets held by such funds although such limited partners often have the right to remove the general partner or cause an early liquidation by simple majority vote as discussed below in the case of our separately managed accounts the investor rather than us may control the asset or investment vehicle that holds or has custody of the investments we advise the vehicle to make   each investment fund and in the case of our separately managed accounts the client engages an investment adviser carlyle investment management llc cim serves as an investment adviser for most of our funds and is registered under the advisers act our investment advisers or one of their affiliates are entitled to a management fee from each investment fund for which they serve as investment advisers for a discussion of the management fees to which our investment advisers are entitled across our various types of investment funds please see  incentive arrangements  fee structure below   the investment funds themselves do not register as investment companies under the  act in reliance on section c or section d thereof or typically in the case of funds formed prior to  section c thereof section c of the  act exempts from the  acts registration requirements investment funds privately placed in the united states whose securities are owned exclusively by persons who at the time of acquisition of such securities are qualified purchasers as defined under the  act section c of the  act exempts from the  acts registration requirements privately placed investment funds whose securities are beneficially owned by not more than  persons in addition under certain current interpretations of the sec section d of the  act exempts from registration any nonus investment fund all of whose outstanding securities are beneficially owned either by nonus residents or by us residents that are qualified purchasers and purchase their interests in a private placement   the governing agreements of substantially all of our investment funds provide that subject to certain conditions thirdparty investors in those funds have the right to remove the general partner of the fund or to accelerate the liquidation date of the investment fund without cause by a simple vote of a majority in interest based on capital commitments of the investors in addition the governing agreements of many of our investment funds generally require investors in those funds to vote to continue the investment period by a vote of a simple majority in interest based on capital commitments of the investors in the event that certain key persons in our investment funds for example messrs conway daniello and rubenstein in the case of our private equity funds do not provide the specified time commitment to the fund or our firm or cease to hold a specified percentage of the economic interests in the general partner or the investment adviser      our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles are closedended funds in a closedended fund structure once an investor makes an investment the investor is generally not able to withdraw or redeem its interest except in very limited circumstances furthermore each limited partnership contains restrictions on an investors ability to transfer its interest in the fund in the few openended funds we advise investors are usually lockedup for a period of time after which they may generally redeem their interests on a quarterly basis   with respect to our carry funds investors generally agree to fund their commitment over a period of time for our private equity funds the commitment period generally runs until the earlier of i the sixth anniversary of the initial closing date or the fifth anniversary of the final closing date of the fund ii the date the general partner cancels such obligation due to changes in applicable laws or when at least a significant portion which may range between  and  of the capital commitments to the fund have been invested committed or reserved for investments iii the date a supermajority in interest based on capital commitments of investors vote to terminate the commitment period or iv the failure of certain key persons to devote a specified amount of time to such fund or carlyle or to hold a specified percentage of the economic interests in the general partner or the investment adviser following the termination of the commitment period an investor generally will be released from any further obligation with respect to its undrawn capital commitment except to the extent necessary to pay partnership expenses and management fees complete investments with respect to transactions entered into prior to the end of the commitment period and make followon investments in existing companies generally an investors obligation to fund followon investments extends for a period of three years following the end of the commitment period provided that an investor is generally not required to fund more than a certain percentage generally  to  of such investors capital commitment in such followon investments   investors in the latest generation of our real estate funds generally commit to fund their investment for a period of three asia five europe or four united states years from the final closing date provided that the general partner may unilaterally extend such expiration date for one year and may extend it for another year with the consent of a majority of the limited partners or the investment advisory committee for that fund investors in the latest generation of our real estate funds are also obligated to continue to make capital contributions with respect to followon investments and to repay indebtedness for a period of four years after the original expiration date of the commitment period as well as to fund partnership expenses and management fees during such extension   the term of each of the corporate private equity and real assets funds generally will end  years from the initial closing date or in some cases from the final closing date but such termination date may be earlier in certain limited circumstances or later if extended by the general partner in many instances with the consent of a majority in interest based on capital commitments of the investors or the investment advisory committee for successive oneyear periods typically up to a maximum of two years   incentive arrangements  fee structure   fund management fees   the investment adviser of each of our carry funds generally receives an annual management fee that ranges from  to  of the investment fund or vehicles capital commitments during the investment period following the expiration or termination of the investment of such fund the management fees generally stepdown to between  and  of contributions for unrealized investments the investment advisor of our fund of funds vehicles receives an annual management fee from such fund of funds vehicles that generally ranges from  to  on the fund or vehicles capital commitments during the first two to five years of the investment period and  to  on the lower of cost of the capital invested or fair value of the capital invested thereafter the investment advisor of our hedge funds receives management fees that range from  to  of nav per year the management fees that we receive from our carry funds are payable on a regular basis typically semiannually in advance in the contractually prescribed amounts noted above the investment adviser of each of our structured credit funds generally receives an annual management fee of       to  of assets per annum with respect to claren road esg and alpinvest we retain a specified percentage of the management fees based on our ownership in the management companies of  in the case of claren road and esg and  in the case of alpinvest the management fees received by our claren road and esg funds have similar characteristics except that such funds often afford investors increased liquidity through annual semiannual or quarterly withdrawal or redemption rights following the expiration of a specified period of time when capital may not be withdrawn typically between one and three years and the amount of management fees to which the investment adviser is entitled with respect thereto will proportionately increase as the net asset value of each investors capital account grows and will proportionately decrease as the net asset value of each investors capital account decreases   the general partners or investment advisers to our carry funds receive customary transaction fees upon consummation of many of our funds acquisition transactions receive monitoring fees from many of their portfolio companies following acquisition and may from time to time receive other fees in connection with their activities the ongoing monitoring fees which they receive are generally calculated as a percentage of a specified financial metric of a particular portfolio company the transaction fees which they receive are generally calculated as a percentage that generally range up to  and may exceed  in certain circumstances of the total enterprise value of the acquired entity the management fees charged to limited partner investors are reduced by  to  of such transaction fees and certain other fees that are received by the general partners and their affiliates   performance fees   the general partner of each of our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles also receives carried interest from the carry fund or fund of funds vehicles carried interest entitles the general partner to a special residual allocation of profit on thirdparty capital in the case of our carry funds carried interest is generally calculated on a realized gain basis and each general partner is generally entitled to a carried interest equal to  or  to  in the case of most of our fund of funds vehicles of the net realized profit generally taking into account unrealized losses generated by thirdparty capital invested in such fund net realized profit or loss is not netted between or among funds our senior carlyle professionals and other personnel who work in these operations also own interests in the general partners of our carry funds and we allocate a portion of any carried interest that we earn to these individuals in order to better align their interests with our own and with those of the investors in the funds for most carry funds the carried interest is subject to an annual preferred limited partner return of  or  subject to a catchup allocation to the general partner if as a result of diminished performance of later investments in the life of a carry fund or fund of funds vehicles the carry fund or fund of funds vehicles does not achieve investment returns that in most cases exceed the preferred return threshold or in almost all cases the general partner receives in excess of  or  to  in the case of most of our fund of funds vehicles of the net profits on thirdparty capital over the life of the fund we will be obligated to repay the amount by which the carried interest that was previously distributed to us exceeds amounts to which we are ultimately entitled this obligation which is known as a giveback obligation operates with respect to a given carry funds own net investment performance only and is typically capped at the after tax amount of carried interest received by the general partner each recipient of carried interest distributions is individually responsible for his or her proportionate share of any giveback obligation however we guarantee the full amount of such giveback obligation our ability to generate carried interest is an important element of our business and carried interest has historically accounted for a significant portion of our income   the timing of receipt of carried interest in respect of investments of our carry funds is dictated by the terms of the partnership agreements that govern such funds which generally allow for carried interest distributions in respect of an investment upon a realization event after satisfaction of obligations relating to the return of capital any realized losses applicable fees and expenses and the applicable annual preferred limited partner return distributions to eligible senior carlyle professionals in respect of such carried interest are generally made shortly thereafter although carlyle has rarely been obligated to pay giveback the giveback obligation if any in respect of      previously realized carried interest is generally determined and due upon the winding up or liquidation of a carry fund pursuant to the terms of the funds partnership agreement   in addition to the carried interest from our carry funds we are also entitled to receive incentive fees or allocations from certain of our global market strategies funds when the return on aum exceeds previous calendaryear ending or dateofinvestment highwater marks our hedge funds generally pay annual incentive fees or allocations equal to  of the funds profits for the year subject to a highwater mark the highwater mark is the highest historical nav attributable to a fund investors account on which incentive fees were paid and means that we will not earn incentive fees with respect to such fund investor for a year if the nav of such investors account at the end of the year is lower that year than any prior year nav or the nav at the date of such fund investors investment generally excluding any contributions and redemptions for purposes of calculating nav we recognize the incentive fees from our hedge funds as they are earned in these arrangements incentive fees are recognized when the performance benchmark has been achieved and are included in performance fees in our combined and consolidated statements of operations these incentive fees are a component of performance fees in our combined and consolidated financial statements and are treated as accrued until paid to us   under our arrangements with the historical owners and management team of alpinvest such persons are allocated all carried interest in respect of the historical investments and commitments to our fund of funds vehicles that existed as of december    of the carried interest in respect of commitments from the historical owners of alpinvest for the period between  and  and  of the carried interest in respect of all other commitments including all future commitments from third parties   as noted above in connection with raising new funds or securing additional investments in existing funds we negotiate terms for such funds and investments with existing and potential investors the outcome of such negotiations could result in our agreement to terms that are materially less favorable to us than for prior funds we have advised or funds advised by our competitors see risk factors  risks related to our business operations  our investors in future funds may negotiate to pay us lower management fees and the economic terms of our future funds may be less favorable to us than those of our existing funds which could adversely affect our revenues   capital invested in and alongside our investment funds   to further align our interests with those of investors in our investment funds we have invested our own capital and that of our senior carlyle professionals in and alongside the investment funds we sponsor and advise in addition certain affiliates of our senior carlyle professionals including friends and family members are permitted subject to certain restrictions to invest alongside the investment funds we sponsor and advise a portion of the proceeds from this offering may be used to fund our general partner capital commitments to our investment funds minimum general partner capital commitments to our investment funds are determined separately with respect to each investment fund in addition we may from time to time exercise our right to purchase additional interests in our investment funds that become available in the ordinary course of their operations see managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for more information regarding our minimum general partner capital commitments to our funds our general partner capital commitments are funded with cash and not with carried interest or through a management fee waiver program   investors in many of our carry funds and fund of funds vehicles also generally receive the opportunity to make additional coinvestments with the investment funds coinvestments are investments arranged by us that are made by our limited partner investors and some other investors in some instances in portfolio companies or other assets generally on substantially the same terms and conditions as those acquired by the applicable fund in certain cases such coinvestments may involve additional fees or carried interest carlyle and its employees and officers have the right to coinvest with each of the investment funds on a dealbydeal basis typically in an amount up to  of the investment      opportunity on top of our base commitment many of these coinvestments are made on an unpromoted basis meaning we do not earn management fees or carried interest in respect of such investments   corporate citizenship   we are committed to the principle that building a better business means investing responsibly in september  carlyle developed a set of responsible investment guidelines that consider the environmental social and governance implications of certain investments we make these guidelines were integral to shaping the corporate social responsibility guidelines later adopted by the members of the private equity growth capital council we have worked to integrate these guidelines into our investment decisionmaking process for controlling corporate investments we are also educating portfolio companies in which we have a controlling interest on the guidelines and encouraging them to review the guidelines at the board level on an annual basis we were the first global alternative asset management firm to release a corporate citizenship report which catalogues and describes our corporate citizenship efforts including our responsible investment policy and practices and those of our portfolio companies   building on the investment principles carlyle has established a working relationship with the edf through this partnership and in collaboration with the payne firm an international environmental consulting firm carlyle and edf jointly developed a new due diligence framework for the alternative asset management sector called the ecovaluscreen this framework goes beyond the traditional focus of risk mitigation during the due diligence process by identifying opportunities for operational enhancements that will lead to better environmental and financial performance during the early stages of the investment process this process enables carlyle professionals to more effectively evaluate the operations of a target company identify the most promising environmental management opportunities and incorporate them into the postinvestment management governance and reporting plans of our portfolio companies   we are also a member of the british venture capital association and seek to ensure that our ukbased portfolio companies are compliant on a voluntary basis with the walker guidelines for disclosure and transparency when such companies become subject to these guidelines further we are also a member of the bundesverband deutscher kapitalbeteiligungsgesellschaften the bvk the german private equity and venture capital trade association we believe that we are compliant with the bvk guidelines for disclosure and transparency and seek to ensure that our german portfolio companies comply with these guidelines when they required to do so   information technology   information technology is essential for carlyle to conduct investment activities manage internal administration activities and connect a global enterprise as part of our technology strategy and governance processes we develop and routinely refine our technology architecture to leverage solutions that will best serve the needs of our investors our systems data network and infrastructure are continuously monitored and administered by formal controls and risk management processes that also help protect the data and privacy of our employees and investors our business continuity plan ensures that all critical business functions continue in an orderly manner in the event of an emergency   competition   as a global alternative asset manager we compete with a broad array of regional and global organizations for both investors and investment opportunities generally our competition varies across business lines geographies and financial markets we believe that our competition for investors is based primarily on investment performance business relationships the quality of services provided to investors reputation and brand recognition pricing and the relative attractiveness of the particular opportunity in which a particular fund intends to invest we believe      that competition for investment opportunities varies across business lines but is generally based on industry expertise and potential for valueadd pricing terms and the structure of a proposed investment and certainty of execution   we generally compete with sponsors of public and private investment funds across all of our segments within our corporate private equity segment we also compete with business development companies and operating companies acting as strategic acquirers in our global market strategies segment we compete with hedge funds and other clo issuers in our real assets segment we also compete with real estate development companies in addition to these traditional competitors within the global alternative asset management industry we have increasingly faced competition from local and regional firms financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds in the various countries in which we invest this trend has been especially apparent in emerging markets where local firms tend to have more established relationships with the companies in which we are attempting to invest these competitors often fall into one of the aforementioned categories but in some cases may represent new types of investors including high net worth individuals family offices and statesponsored entities   some of the entities that we compete with as an alternative asset manager are substantially larger and have greater financial technical marketing and other resources and more personnel than we do several of our competitors also have recently raised or are expected to raise significant amounts of capital and many of them have investment objectives similar to us which may create additional competition for investment opportunities some of these competitors may also have a lower cost of capital and access to funding sources that are not available to us which may create competitive disadvantages for us when sourcing investment opportunities in addition some of these competitors may have higher risk tolerances different risk assessments or lower return thresholds which could allow them to consider a wider range of investments and to bid more aggressively than us for investments strategic buyers may also be able to achieve synergistic cost savings or revenue enhancements with respect to a targeted portfolio company which may provide them with a competitive advantage in bidding for such investments   employees   we believe that one of the strengths and principal reasons for our success is the quality and dedication of our people as of december   we employed approximately  individuals including more than  investment professionals located in  offices across six continents   regulatory and compliance matters   united states   our businesses as well as the financial services industry generally are subject to extensive regulation in the united states and elsewhere the sec and other regulators around the globe have in recent years significantly increased their regulatory activities with respect to alternative asset management firms certain of our businesses are subject to compliance with laws and regulations of us federal and state governments nonus governments their respective agencies andor various selfregulatory organizations or exchanges and any failure to comply with these regulations could expose us to liability andor reputational damage our businesses have operated for many years within a legal framework that requires our being able to monitor and comply with a broad range of legal and regulatory developments that affect our activities however additional legislation changes in rules promulgated by regulators or changes in the interpretation or enforcement of existing laws and rules either in the united states or elsewhere may directly affect our mode of operation and profitability   certain of our subsidiaries are registered as investment advisers with the sec registered investment advisers are subject to the requirements and regulations of the advisers act such requirements relate to among other things fiduciary duties to advisory clients maintaining an effective compliance program solicitation agreements conflicts of interest recordkeeping and      reporting requirements disclosure requirements limitations on agency cross and principal transactions between an advisor and advisory clients and general antifraud prohibitions in addition our investment advisers are subject to routine periodic examinations by the staff of the sec as a result of prior examinations certain additional policies and procedures have been put into place in response to the secs recommendations but no material changes to our investment advisers operations have been made our investment advisers also have not been subject to any regulatory or disciplinary actions by the sec in addition if in the future we were to sponsor a registered investment company under the  act such registered investment company and our subsidiary that serves as its investment adviser would be subject to the  act and the rules thereunder which among other things regulate the relationship between a registered investment company and its investment adviser and prohibit or severely restrict principal transactions and joint transactions   tcg securities llc the affiliate entity through which we conduct marketing and fundraising activities is registered as a limited purpose brokerdealer with the sec and the state

organization of the firm qualifications of associated persons officers and directors net capital and customer protection rules books and records and financial statements and reporting in particular as a result of its registered status our brokerdealer is subject to the secs uniform net capital rule rule c which specifies both the minimum level of net capital a brokerdealer must maintain relative to the scope of its business activities and net capital liquidity parameters the sec and finra require compliance with key financial responsibility rules including maintenance of adequate funds to meet expenses and contractual obligations as well as early warning rules that compel notice to the regulators via accelerated financial reporting anytime a firms capital falls below the minimum required level the uniform net capital rule limits the amount of qualifying subordinated debt that is treated as equity to a specific percentage under the debttoequity ratio test and further limits the withdrawal of equity capital which is subject to specific notice provisions finally compliance with net capital rules may also limit a firms ability to expand its operations particularly to those activities that require the use of capital   in connection with our acquisition on july   of esg and emerging sovereign partners llc esp which operate together as an emerging markets equities and

to the recipients continued service as a director in addition each director will be reimbursed for reasonable outofpocket expenses incurred in connection with such service   executive compensation   compensation discussion and analysis   compensation philosophy   our business as an alternative asset management firm is dependent on the services of our named executive officers and other key employees among other things we depend on their ability to find select and execute investments oversee and improve portfolio company operations find and develop relationships with fund investors and other sources of capital and provide other services essential to our success therefore it is important that our key employees are compensated in a manner that motivates them to excel and encourages them to remain with our firm   our compensation policy has three primary objectives  establish a clear relationship between performance and compensation  align longterm incentives with our fund investors and common unitholders and  comply with applicable laws and regulations   we believe that the key to achieving these objectives is an organized unbiased approach that is well understood responsive to changes in the industry and the general labor market and above all flexible and timely we seek to pursue these objectives to the extent that our financial situation and other factors permit   our senior carlyle professionals and other key employees invest a significant amount of their own capital in or alongside the funds we advise these investments are funded with cash and not with deferral of management or incentive fees in addition these individuals may be allocated a portion of the carried interest or incentive fees payable in respect of our investment funds we believe that this approach of seeking to align the interests of our key employees with those of the investors in our funds has been a key contributor to our strong performance and growth we also believe that continued equity ownership by our named executive officers once we are a public company will result in significant alignment of their interests with those of our common unitholders   our chairman daniel a daniello and our two cochief executive officers william e conway jr and david m rubenstein are our founders and coprincipal executive officers we refer to our founders together with glenn a youngkin our chief operating officer adena t friedman our chief financial officer and jeffrey w ferguson our general counsel as our named executive officers mr youngkin served as our interim principal financial officer from october  until march  effective on march   adena t friedman became our principal financial officer      with the exception of our employment agreement with ms friedman described below under  employment agreement with ms friedman we do not have employment agreements with any of our executive officers our founders have entered into noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements with us described below under  summary compensation table  founders noncompetition and nonsolicitation agreements and are also subject to certain limitations on cash compensation pursuant to commitments made to calpers and mubadala described below under  compensation elements  annual cash bonuses   compensation elements   the primary elements of our compensation program are base salary annual cash bonuses and longterm incentives such as the ownership of carried interest we believe that the elements of compensation for our named executive officers serve the primary objectives of our compensation program however we intend to periodically review the compensation of our named executive officers and we may make changes to the compensation structure relating to one or more named executive officers based on the outcome of such reviews from time to time following this offering compensation decisions and those regarding the allocation of carried interest to our senior carlyle professionals and other employees will continue to be made by our founders and other senior carlyle professionals and not by our independent directors   base salary   for  each of our named executive officers was paid an annual salary of  we believe that the base salary of our named executive officers should typically not be the most significant component of total compensation our founders determined that this amount was a sufficient minimum base salary for our named executive officers and decided that it should be the same for all named executive officers   annual cash bonuses   for  our named executive officers were awarded cash bonuses part of which were paid in december  and the balance of which were paid in march  the amounts of these bonuses were  for each of our founders  for mr youngkin  for ms friedman and  for mr ferguson the discretionary bonuses to our named executive officers were recommended by mr daniello and were approved by all three of our founders the subjective factors that contributed to the determination of the bonus amounts included an assessment of the performance of carlyle and the investments of the funds that we advise the contributions of the named executive officer to our development and success during  and the named executive officers tenure at his or her level more specifically in assessing mr conways performance and individual contribution we considered his service as the firms chief investment officer leadership of the investment process and decisions by our corporate private equity and global market strategies segments which executed a significant number of successful investments in  and his work in overseeing the management of the existing investment portfolio during this period in assessing mr daniellos performance and individual contribution we considered his service as the chief investment officer for our real assets funds and his role in overseeing all administrative operations of our firm in assessing mr rubensteins performance and individual contribution we considered his oversight of our investor relations team and the capital commitments to our funds that were raised during the year and his leadership on the strategic direction of the firm in assessing mr youngkins performance and individual contribution we considered his significant efforts in leading the expansion of our investment platform through acquisitions oversight of our business on a global basis and his role as interim chief financial officer in assessing ms friedmans performance and individual contribution we considered her strategic role in leading and expanding the capabilities of our finance and accounting functions during  her contributions in expanding the platform and capabilities of our information technology function as well as her strategic leadership to the founders and senior management across the firm finally in assessing mr fergusons performance and individual contributions we considered his oversight of our global legal and compliance functions as well as the tax department and his role with respect to the strategic initiatives undertaken by the firm ms friedman was guaranteed a minimum bonus of  pursuant to our contractual arrangements with her the amounts of the annual bonuses paid to our founders were limited to  pursuant to a commitment that we      made to calpers at the time of their investment in our firm in  calpers sought this limitation to ensure that the interests of our founders would be aligned with their own when mubadala later invested in our firm in  they sought and received the same commitment   carried interest   the general partners of our carry funds typically receive a special residual allocation of income which we refer to as a carried interest from our investment funds if investors in such funds achieve a specified threshold return while the parent entities own controlling equity interests in these fund general partners our senior carlyle professionals and other personnel who work in these operations directly own a portion of the carried interest in these entities in order to better align their interests with our own and with those of the investors in these funds following the reorganization described in ownership structure these individuals will own approximately  of any carried interest in respect of investments made by our carry funds with the exception of our energy and renewable resources funds where we will retain essentially all of the carry to which we are entitled under our arrangements with riverstone pursuant to commitments we made to calpers and mubadala at the times of those institutions investments in our firm our founders own all of their equity interests in our firm through their ownership interests in the parent entities and accordingly do not own carried interest at the fund level but instead benefit together with our other equity owners from the carried interest and other income that is retained by the firm through our founders ownership interests in the parent entities in addition we generally seek to concentrate the direct ownership of carried interest in respect of each carry fund among those of our professionals who directly work with that fund so as to align their interests with those of our fund investors and of our firm accordingly ms friedman like our founders does not receive allocations of direct carried interest ownership at the fund level while mr youngkin has previously received allocations of direct carried interest ownership at the fund level in respect of buyout funds that invest in transactions in the united states europe and emerging markets as a result of his work at various times with those fund operations he has ceased to receive such allocations in respect of any such funds formed subsequent to the time he assumed a firmwide executive role in  similarly while mr ferguson has previously received allocations of direct carried interest ownership at the fund level in respect of buyout funds that invest in transactions in the united states as a result of his work with those fund operations in view of his firmwide role as our general counsel he ceased to receive such allocations in    carried interest if any in respect of any particular investment is only paid in cash when the underlying investment is realized to the extent any giveback obligation is triggered carried interest previously distributed by the fund would need to be returned to such fund our professionals who receive direct allocations of carried interest at the fund level are personally subject to the giveback obligation pursuant to which they may be required to repay carried interest previously distributed to them thereby reducing the amount of cash received by such recipients for any such year because the amount of carried interest payable is directly tied to the realized performance of the underlying investments we believe this fosters a strong alignment of interests among the investors in those funds and the professionals who are allocated direct carried interest and thus will indirectly benefit our unitholders   the percentage of carried interest owned at the fund level by individual professionals varies by year by investment fund and with respect to each carry fund by investment ownership of carried interest by senior carlyle professionals and other personnel at the fund level is also subject to a range of vesting schedules vesting depends on continued employment over specified periods of time and serves as an employment retention mechanism and enhances the alignment of interests between the owner of a carried interest allocation and the firm and the limited partners in our investment funds in addition under the arrangements that have historically prevailed prior to this offering if any of the named executive officers other than the founders were to have ceased to provide services to carlyle prior to the time an investment in a carry fund were realized such named executive officer would forfeit  of his or her entitlement to any distributions from the parent entities sourced from carried interest from such investment   postipo equity compensation expense   as discussed under organizational structure at the time of this offering our existing owners will contribute to the carlyle holdings partnerships equity interests      in our business in exchange for partnership units of carlyle holdings all of the carlyle holdings partnership units received by our founders calpers and mubadala as part of the reorganization are fully vested all of the carlyle holdings partnership units received by our other existing owners in exchange for their interests in carried interest owned at the fund level relating to investments made by our carry funds prior to the date of reorganization will be fully vested of the remaining carlyle holdings partnership units received as part of the reorganization by our other existing owners  are fully vested and  are not vested and with specified exceptions will be subject to forfeiture if the employee ceases to be employed by us prior to vesting see  vesting minimum retained ownership requirement and transfer restrictions accordingly following this offering we will recognize expense for

compensation paid or accrued by us for services rendered in all capacities by our named executive officers during the fiscal year ended december     pursuant to applicable accounting principles for financial statement reporting purposes we have historically recorded salary and bonus payments to our senior carlyle professionals including our named executive officers as distributions in respect of their equity ownership interests and not as compensation expense however following this offering the salary and bonus payments to our senior carlyle professionals including our named executive officers will be reflected as compensation expense in our financial statements and we have reflected these amounts in the applicable columns of the summary compensation table below even though they are not recorded as compensation expense in our historical financial statements   similarly for those of our named executive officers that own direct carried interest allocations at the fund level we have reported in the all other compensation column amounts that represent an amount of compensation expense positive or negative that would have been recorded by us on an accrual basis in respect of such direct carried interest allocations had we applied the accounting treatment for the periods presented below that will apply upon the effectiveness of this offering these amounts do not reflect actual cash carried interest distributions to our named executive officers this expense may be negative in the event of a reversal of previously accrued carried interest due to negative adjustments in

or less than the amounts indicated in the summary compensation table and are not determinable at this time   for each of our named executive officers other than our founders we have also reported in

reorganization   prior to this offering we have completed a series of transactions in connection with the reorganization described in organizational structure whereby among other things our existing owners including our inside directors and executive officers have contributed their interests in the parent entities and certain equity interests they own in the general partners of our existing carry funds to the carlyle holdings partnerships in exchange for carlyle holdings partnership units in addition certain existing and former owners of the parent entities including our inside directors and executive officers have a beneficial interest in investments in or alongside our funds that were funded by such persons indirectly through the parent entities in order to minimize the extent of thirdparty ownership interests in firm assets prior to the completion of the offering we have i distributed a portion of these interests approximately  million as of december   to the beneficial owners so that they are held directly by such persons and are no longer consolidated in our financial statements and ii restructured the remainder of these interests approximately  million as of december   so that they are reflected as noncontrolling interests in our financial statements   in addition prior to the date of this offering the parent entities have also made a cash distribution of previously undistributed earnings to their owners totaling  million   tax receivable agreement   limited partners of the carlyle holdings partnerships subject to the vesting and minimum retained ownership requirements and transfer restrictions applicable to such limited partners as set forth in the partnership agreements of the carlyle holdings partnerships may on a quarterly basis from and after the first anniversary of the date of the closing of this offering subject to the terms of the exchange agreement exchange their carlyle holdings partnership units for the carlyle group lp common units on a oneforone basis in addition subject to certain requirements calpers will generally be permitted to exchange carlyle holdings partnership units for common units from and after the closing of this offering and mubadala will generally be entitled to exchange carlyle holdings partnerships units for common units following the first anniversary of the closing of this offering any common units received by mubadala and calpers in any such exchange during the applicable restricted periods described in common units eligible for future sale  lockup arrangements  mubadala transfer restrictions and common units eligible for future sale  lockup arrangements  calpers transfer restrictions respectively would be subject to the restrictions described in such sections a carlyle holdings limited partner must exchange one partnership unit in each of the three carlyle holdings partnerships to effect an exchange for a common unit carlyle holdings i lp intends to make an election under section  of the code effective for each taxable year in which an exchange of partnership units for common units occurs which is expected to result in increases to the tax basis of the assets of carlyle holdings at the time of an exchange of partnership units the exchanges are expected to result in increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of carlyle holdings these increases in tax basis may reduce the amount of tax that certain of our subsidiaries including carlyle holdings i gp inc which we refer to as together with any successors thereto the corporate taxpayers would otherwise be required to pay in the future these increases in tax basis may also decrease gains or increase losses on future dispositions of certain capital assets to the extent tax basis is allocated to those capital assets the irs may challenge all or part of the tax basis increase and increased deductions and a court could sustain such a challenge   we have entered into a tax receivable agreement with our existing owners that provides for the payment by the corporate taxpayers to our existing owners of  of the amount of cash tax savings if any in us federal state and local income tax or foreign or franchise tax that the corporate      taxpayers realize or are deemed to realize in the case of an early termination payment by the corporate taxpayers or a change in control as discussed below as a result of increases in tax basis and certain other tax benefits related to our entering into the tax receivable agreement including tax benefits attributable to payments under the tax receivable agreement this payment obligation is an obligation of the corporate taxpayers and not of carlyle holdings the corporate taxpayers expect to benefit from the remaining  of cash tax savings if any in income tax they realize for purposes of the tax receivable agreement the cash tax savings in income tax will be computed by comparing the actual income tax liability of the corporate taxpayers calculated with certain assumptions to the amount of such taxes that the corporate taxpayers would have been required to pay had there been no increase to the tax basis of the assets of carlyle holdings as a result of the exchanges and had the corporate taxpayers not entered into the tax receivable agreement the term of the tax receivable agreement will commence upon consummation of this offering and will continue until all such tax benefits have been utilized or expired unless the corporate taxpayers exercise their right to terminate the tax receivable agreement for an amount based on the agreed payments remaining to be made under the agreement as described in more detail below or the corporate taxpayers breach any of their material obligations under the tax receivable agreement in which case all obligations generally will be accelerated and due as if the corporate taxpayers had exercised their right to terminate the tax receivable agreement estimating the amount of payments that may be made under the tax receivable agreement is by its nature imprecise insofar as the calculation of amounts payable depends on a variety of factors the actual increase in tax basis as well as the amount and timing of any payments under the tax receivable agreement will vary depending upon a number of factors including       the timing of exchanges   for instance the increase in any tax deductions will vary depending on the fair value which may fluctuate over time of the depreciable or amortizable assets of carlyle holdings at the time of each exchange       the price of our common units at the time of the exchange   the increase in any tax deductions as well as the tax basis increase in other assets of carlyle holdings is directly proportional to the price of our common units at the time of the exchange       the extent to which such exchanges are taxable   if an exchange is not taxable for any reason increased deductions will not be available and       the amount and timing of our income   the corporate taxpayers will be required to pay  of the cash tax savings as and when realized if any if the corporate taxpayers do not have taxable income the corporate taxpayers are not required absent a change of control or other circumstances requiring an early termination payment to make payments under the tax receivable agreement for that taxable year because no cash tax savings will have been realized however any cash tax savings that do not result in realized benefits in a given tax year will likely generate tax attributes that may be utilized to generate benefits in previous or future tax years the utilization of such tax attributes will result in payments under the tax receivables agreement   we anticipate that we will account for the effects of these increases in tax basis and associated payments under the tax receivable agreement arising from future exchanges as follows       we will record an increase in deferred tax assets for the estimated income tax effects of the increases in tax basis based on enacted federal and state tax rates at the date of the exchange       to the extent we estimate that we will not realize the full benefit represented by the deferred tax asset based on an analysis that will consider among other things our expectation of future earnings we will reduce the deferred tax asset with a valuation allowance and       we will record  of the estimated realizable tax benefit which is the recorded deferred tax asset less any recorded valuation allowance as an increase to the liability due under the tax receivable agreement and the remaining  of the estimated realizable tax benefit as an increase to partners capital        all of the effects of changes in any of our estimates after the date of the exchange will be included in net income similarly the effect of subsequent changes in the enacted tax rates will be included in net income   we expect that as a result of the size of the increases in the tax basis of the tangible and intangible assets of carlyle holdings the payments that we may make under the tax receivable agreement will be substantial there may be a material negative effect on our liquidity if as a result of timing discrepancies or otherwise the payments under the tax receivable agreement exceed the actual cash tax savings that the corporate taxpayers realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement andor distributions to the corporate taxpayers by carlyle holdings are not sufficient to permit the corporate taxpayers to make payments under the tax receivable agreement after they have paid taxes late payments under the tax receivable agreement generally will accrue interest at an uncapped rate equal to libor plus  basis points the payments under the tax receivable agreement are not conditioned upon our existing owners continued ownership of us   in addition the tax receivable agreement provides that upon certain changes of control the corporate taxpayers or their successors obligations with respect to exchanged or acquired units whether exchanged or acquired before or after such transaction would be based on certain assumptions including that the corporate taxpayers would have sufficient taxable income to fully utilize the deductions arising from the increased tax deductions and tax basis and other benefits related to entering into the tax receivable agreement   furthermore the corporate taxpayers may elect to terminate the tax receivable agreement early by making an immediate payment equal to the present value of the anticipated future cash tax savings in determining such anticipated future cash tax savings the tax receivable agreement includes several assumptions including i that any carlyle holdings partnership units that have not been exchanged are deemed exchanged for the market value of the common units at the time of termination ii the corporate taxpayers will have sufficient taxable income in each future taxable year to fully realize all potential tax savings iii the tax rates for future years will be those specified in the law as in effect at the time of termination and iv certain nonamortizable assets are deemed disposed of within specified time periods in addition the present value of such anticipated future cash tax savings are discounted at a rate equal to libor plus  basis points assuming that the market value a common unit were to be equal to the initial public offering price per common unit in this offering and that libor were to be  we estimate that the aggregate amount of these termination payments would be approximately  million if the corporate taxpayers were to exercise their termination right immediately following this offering   as a result of the change in control provisions and the early termination right the corporate taxpayers could be required to make payments under the tax receivable agreement that are greater than or less than the specified percentage of the actual cash tax savings that the corporate taxpayers realize in respect of the tax attributes subject to the tax receivable agreement in these situations our obligations under the tax receivable agreement could have a substantial negative impact on our liquidity   decisions made by our existing owners in the course of running our business may influence the timing and amount of payments that are received by an exchanging or selling existing owner under the tax receivable agreement for example the earlier disposition of assets following an exchange or acquisition transaction generally will accelerate payments under the tax receivable agreement and increase the present value of such payments and the disposition of assets before an exchange or acquisition transaction will increase an existing owners tax liability without giving rise to any rights of an existing owner to receive payments under the tax receivable agreement   payments under the tax receivable agreement will be based on the tax reporting positions that we will determine the corporate taxpayers will not be reimbursed for any payments previously made under the tax receivable agreement if a tax basis increase is successfully challenged by the irs      as a result in certain circumstances payments could be made under the tax receivable agreement in excess of the corporate taxpayers cash tax savings   in the event that the carlyle group lp or any of its whollyowned subsidiaries become taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes these entities will also be obligated to make payments under the tax receivable agreement on the same basis and to the same extent as the corporate taxpayers   registration rights agreements   we will enter into one or more registration rights agreements with our existing owners other than calpers and mubadala pursuant to which we will grant them their affiliates and certain of their transferees the right under certain circumstances and subject to certain restrictions to require us to register under the securities act common units delivered in exchange for carlyle holdings partnership units or common units

between our general partner or its affiliates including each partys respective owners on the one hand and our partnership its subsidiaries or our limited partners on the other hand   whenever a potential conflict arises between our general partner or its affiliates or associates on the one hand and us our subsidiaries or any other partner on the other hand our general partner will resolve that conflict our partnership agreement contains provisions that eliminate the fiduciary duties that otherwise would be owed by our general partner to our common unitholders and the partnership at law or in equity accordingly our general partner will only be subject to the contractual duties set forth in our partnership agreement and to the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing our partnership agreement also limits the liability of our general partner and restricts the remedies available to common unitholders for actions taken that without those limitations might constitute breaches of duty including fiduciary duties   under our partnership agreement our general partner will not be in breach of its obligations under the partnership agreement or its duties to us or our common unitholders if the resolution of the conflict is       approved by the conflicts committee although our general partner is not obligated to seek such approval       approved by the vote of a majority of the voting power of our voting units excluding any voting units owned by our general partner and any of its affiliates although our general partner is not obligated to seek such approval or       approved by our general partner in good faith as determined under the partnership agreement   our general partner may but is not required to seek the approval of such resolution from the conflicts committee or the holders of our voting units if our general partner does not seek approval from the conflicts committee or the holders of our voting units any resolution or course of action taken by it with respect to the conflict of interest shall be conclusively deemed approved by us and our partners and not a breach of our partnership agreement or any duty including any fiduciary duties unless our general partner subjectively believes that the resolution or course of action is opposed to the best interests of the partnership in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner or us or any other person bound by the partnership agreement the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of providing that the general partner subjectively believed that such resolution or course of action was opposed to the best interests of the partnership unless the resolution of a conflict is specifically provided for in our partnership agreement our general partner or the conflicts committee may consider any factors it determines in good faith to consider when resolving a conflict   the three bullet points above establish the procedures by which conflict of interest situations are to be resolved pursuant to our partnership agreement these procedures benefit our general partner by providing our general partner with significant flexibility with respect to its ability to make decisions and pursue actions involving conflicts of interest given the significant flexibility afforded our general partner to resolve conflicts of interest  including that our general partner has the right to determine not to seek the approval of the common unitholders with respect to the resolution of such conflicts  the general partner may resolve conflicts of interest pursuant to the partnership agreement in a manner that common unitholders may not believe to be in their or in our best interests neither our common unitholders nor we will have any recourse against our general partner if our general partner satisfies one of the standards described in the three bullet points above      in addition to the provisions relating to conflicts of interest our partnership agreement contains provisions that waive or consent to conduct by our general partner and its affiliates that might otherwise raise issues about compliance with fiduciary duties or other applicable law for example our partnership agreement provides that when our general partner in its capacity as our general partner is permitted to or required to make a decision in its sole discretion or discretion or pursuant to any provision of our partnership agreement not subject to an express standard of good faith then our general partner will not be subject to any fiduciary duty and will be entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it desires including its own interests and will have no duty or obligation fiduciary or otherwise to give any consideration to any interest of or factors affecting us or any limited partners and will not be subject to any different standards imposed by the partnership agreement or otherwise existing at law in equity or otherwise these modifications of fiduciary duties are expressly permitted by delaware law hence we and our common unitholders will only have recourse and be able to seek remedies against our general partner if our general partner breaches its obligations pursuant to our partnership agreement unless our general partner breaches its obligations pursuant to our partnership agreement we and our common unitholders will not have any recourse against our general partner even if our general partner were to act in a manner that was inconsistent with traditional fiduciary duties furthermore even if there has been a breach of the obligations set forth in our partnership agreement our partnership agreement provides that our general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable to us or our common unitholders for errors of judgment or for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that the general partner or its officers and directors acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct these modifications are detrimental to the common unitholders because they restrict the remedies available to common unitholders for actions that without those limitations might constitute breaches of duty including fiduciary duty   potential conflicts   conflicts of interest could arise in the situations described below among others   actions taken by our general partner may affect the amount of cash flow from operations to our common unitholders   the amount of cash that is available for distribution to our common unitholders is affected by decisions of our general partner regarding such matters as       the amount and timing of cash expenditures including those relating to compensation       the amount and timing of investments and dispositions       levels of indebtedness       tax matters       levels of reserves and       issuances of additional partnership securities   in addition borrowings by our partnership and our affiliates do not constitute a breach of any duty owed by our general partner to our common unitholders our partnership agreement provides that we and our subsidiaries may borrow funds from our general partner and its affiliates on terms agreed to by our general partner in good faith under our partnership agreement those borrowings conclusively will be deemed to be in good faith and not a breach of our partnership agreement or any duty of the general partner if  they are approved by the conflicts committee of our general partner or by the vote of a majority of the voting power of our voting units excluding any voting units held by our general partner or any of its affiliates in accordance with the terms of the partnership agreement or  they are otherwise approved by our general partner in good faith as determined under the partnership agreement account the totality of the relationships between the      parties involved including other transactions that may be or have been particularly favorable or advantageous to us   we will reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for expenses   we will reimburse our general partner and its affiliates for all costs incurred in managing and operating us and our partnership agreement provides that our general partner will determine the expenses that are allocable to us   our general partner intends to limit its liability regarding our obligations   our general partner intends to limit its liability under contractual arrangements so that the other party has recourse only to our assets and not against our general partner its assets or its owners our partnership agreement provides that any action taken by our general partner to limit its liability or our liability is not a breach of our general partners fiduciary duties even if we could have obtained more favorable terms without the limitation on liability the limitation on our general partners liability does not constitute a waiver of compliance with us federal securities laws that would be void under section  of the securities act   our common unitholders will have no right to enforce obligations of our general partner and its affiliates under agreements with us   any agreements between us on the one hand and our general partner and its affiliates on the other will not grant to the common unitholders separate and apart from us the right to enforce the obligations of our general partner and its affiliates in our favor   contracts between us on the one hand and our general partner and its affiliates on the other will not be the result of armslength negotiations   our partnership agreement allows our general partner to determine in its sole discretion any amounts to reimburse itself or its affiliates for any costs or expenses incurred in connection with our activities our general partner may also enter into additional contractual arrangements with any of its affiliates on our behalf neither the partnership agreement nor any of the other agreements contracts and arrangements between us on the one hand and our general partner and its affiliates on the other are or will be the result of armslength negotiations our general partner will determine the terms of any of these transactions entered into after this offering on terms that it agrees to in good faith as determined under our partnership agreement our general partner and its affiliates will have no obligation to permit us to use any facilities or assets of our general partner and its affiliates except as may be provided in contracts entered into specifically dealing with that use there will not be any obligation of our general partner and its affiliates to enter into any contracts of this kind   our common units are subject to our general partners limited call right   our general partner may exercise its right to call and purchase common units as provided in our partnership agreement or assign this right to one of its affiliates or to us our general partner may use its own discretion free of fiduciary duty restrictions in determining whether to exercise this right as a result a common unitholder may have his common units purchased from him at an undesirable time or price see material provisions of the carlyle group lp partnership agreement  limited call right   we may choose not to retain separate counsel for ourselves or for the holders of common units   attorneys independent accountants and others who will perform services for us are selected by our general partner or the conflicts committee and may perform services for our general partner and its affiliates we are not required to retain separate counsel for ourselves or the holders of our common units in the event of a conflict of interest between our general partner and its affiliates on the one hand and us or the holders of our common units on the other      our general partners affiliates may compete with us   the partnership agreement provides that our general partner will be restricted from engaging in any business activities other than activities incidental to its ownership of interests in us the partnership agreement does not prohibit affiliates of the general partner including its owners from engaging in other business or activities including those that might compete directly with us   certain of our subsidiaries have obligations to investors in our investment funds and may have obligations to other third parties that may conflict with your interests   our subsidiaries that serve as the general partners of our investment funds have certain duties and obligations to those funds and their investors and some of our subsidiaries may have contractual duties to other third parties as a result we expect to regularly take actions with respect to the allocation of investments among our investment funds including funds that have different fee structures the purchase or sale of investments in our investment funds the structuring of investment transactions for those funds the advice we provide or otherwise in a manner consistent with such duties and obligations in addition directors and officers of our general partner our senior carlyle professionals operating executives and other professionals have made personal investments in and alongside a variety of our investment funds which may result in conflicts of interest among investors in our funds or our common unitholders regarding investment decisions for these funds some of these actions might at the same time adversely affect our nearterm results of operations or cash flow   us federal income tax considerations of our partners may conflict with your interests   because our partners hold their carlyle holdings partnership units directly or through entities that are not subject to corporate income taxation and the carlyle group lp holds carlyle holdings partnership units through whollyowned subsidiaries at least one of which is subject to taxation as a corporation in the united states conflicts may arise between our partners and the carlyle group lp relating to the selection and structuring of investments or other matters our limited partners will be deemed to expressly acknowledge that our general partner is under no obligation to consider the separate interests of our limited partners including among other things the tax consequences to limited partners in deciding whether to cause us to take or decline to take any actions   fiduciary duties   duties owed to common unitholders by our general partner are prescribed by law and our partnership agreement the delaware limited partnership act provides that delaware limited partnerships may in their partnership agreements expand restrict or eliminate the duties including fiduciary duties otherwise owed by a general partner to limited partners and the partnership   our partnership agreement contains provisions that eliminate the fiduciary duties that otherwise would be owed by our general partner to our common unitholders and the partnership at law or in equity accordingly our general partner will only be subject to the contractual duties set forth in our partnership agreement and to the implied contractual covenant of good faith and fair dealing we have adopted these modifications to allow our general partner and its affiliates to engage in transactions with us that might otherwise be prohibited by statelaw fiduciary duty standards and to take into account the interests of other parties in addition to our interests and the interests of the common unitholders when resolving conflicts of interest without these modifications the general partners ability to make decisions involving conflicts of interest would be restricted these modifications are detrimental to the common unitholders because they restrict the remedies available to common unitholders for actions that without those limitations might constitute breaches of duty including a fiduciary duty as described below and they permit our general      partner to take into account its own interests and the interests of third parties in addition to our interests and the interests of the common unitholders when resolving conflicts of interest   the following is a summary of the duties owed by our general partner to the limited partners under our partnership agreement as compared to the default fiduciary duty standards that otherwise would be owed by our general partner to the limited partners at law or in equity   state law fiduciary duty standards fiduciary duties are generally considered to include an obligation to act in good faith and with due care and loyalty in the absence of a provision in a partnership agreement providing otherwise the duty of care would generally require a general partner to inform itself prior to making a business decision of all material information reasonably available to it in the absence of a provision in a partnership agreement providing otherwise the duty of loyalty would generally prohibit a general partner of a delaware limited partnership from taking any action or engaging in any transaction that is not fair to and in the best interests of the partnership where a conflict of interest is present   partnership agreement modified standards general   our partnership agreement contains provisions that waive duties of or consent to conduct by our general partner and its affiliates that might otherwise raise issues about compliance with fiduciary duties or applicable law for example our partnership agreement provides that when our general partner in its capacity as our general partner is permitted to or required to make a decision in its sole discretion or pursuant to any provision of our partnership agreement not subject to an express standard of good faith then our general partner will not be subject to any fiduciary duty and will be entitled to consider only such interests and factors as it desires including its own interests and will have no duty or obligation fiduciary or otherwise to give any consideration to any factors affecting us or any limited partners including our common unitholders and will not be subject to any different standards imposed by the partnership agreement or otherwise existing of law in equity or otherwise in addition when our general partner is acting in its individual capacity as opposed to in its capacity as our general partner it may act without any fiduciary obligation to us or the common unitholders whatsoever these standards reduce the obligations to which our general partner would otherwise be held   in addition to the other more specific provisions limiting the obligations of our general partner our partnership agreement further provides that our general partner and its officers and directors will not be liable to us our limited partners including our common unitholders or assignees for errors of judgment or for any acts or omissions unless there has been a final and nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that our general partner or its      officers and directors acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct   special provisions regarding affiliated transactions   our partnership agreement generally provides that affiliated transactions and resolutions of conflicts of interest not approved by a vote of holders of voting units excluding voting units owned by the general partner and its affiliates and that are not approved by the conflicts committee of the board of directors of our general partner will conclusively be deemed approved by the partnership and all partners and will not constitute a breach of our partnership agreement or of any duty including any fiduciary duty existing at law in equity or otherwise unless our general partner subjectively believes that the resolution or course of action in respect of such conflict of interest is opposed to the best interests of the partnership   in any proceeding brought by or on behalf of any limited partner including our common unitholders or our partnership or any other person bound by our partnership agreement the person bringing or prosecuting such proceeding will have the burden of proving that the general partner subjectively believed that such resolution or course of action was opposed to the best interests of the partnership these standards reduce the obligations to which our general partner would otherwise be held   rights and remedies of common unitholders restricted by modified standards the delaware limited partnership act generally provides that a limited partner may institute legal action on behalf of the partnership to recover damages from a thirdparty where a general partner has refused to institute the action or where an effort to cause a general partner to do so is not likely to succeed in addition the statutory or case law of some jurisdictions may permit a limited partner to institute legal action on behalf of himself and all other similarly situated limited partners to recover damages from a general partner for violations of its fiduciary duties to the limited partners   by holding our common units each common unitholder will automatically agree to be bound by the provisions in our partnership agreement including the provisions discussed above  this is in accordance with the policy of the delaware limited partnership act favoring the principle of freedom of contract and the enforceability of partnership agreements the failure of a common unitholder to sign our partnership agreement does not render our partnership agreement unenforceable against that person   we have agreed to indemnify our general partner any departing general partner any person who is or was a tax matters partner officer or director of our general partner or any departing general partner any officer or directors of our general partner or any departing general partner who is or was serving at the request of our general partner as an officer director employee member partner tax matters partner agent fiduciary or trustee of another person any person who is named in the registration statement of which this prospectus forms a part as

indemnification unless there has been a final and nonappealable judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction determining that these persons acted in bad faith or engaged in fraud or willful misconduct we have also agreed to provide this indemnification for criminal proceedings thus our general partner could be indemnified for its negligent acts if it met the requirements set forth above to the extent these provisions purport to include indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act in the opinion of the sec such indemnification is contrary to public policy and therefore unenforceable see material provisions of the carlyle group lp partnership agreement  indemnification        description of common units   common units   our common units represent limited

might otherwise constitute a breach of duty see conflicts of interest and fiduciary responsibilities carlyle group management llc is whollyowned by our senior carlyle professionals see management  composition of the board of directors after this offering our common unitholders have only limited voting rights on matters affecting our business and therefore have limited ability to influence managements decisions regarding our business the voting rights of our common unitholders are limited as set forth in our partnership agreement and in the delaware limited partnership act for example our general partner may generally make amendments to our partnership agreement or certificate of limited partnership without the approval of any common unitholder as set forth under  amendment of

the provisions of our partnership agreement his her or its liability under the delaware limited partnership act will be limited subject to possible exceptions to the amount of capital he she or it is obligated to contribute to us for his her or its common units plus his her or its share of any undistributed profits and assets plus his her or its obligation to make other payments that will be provided for in our partnership agreement if it were determined however that the right or exercise of the right by the limited partners as a group       to elect the directors of our general partner in limited circumstances       to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or       to take other action under our partnership agreement   constituted participation in the control of our business for the purposes of the delaware limited partnership act then our limited partners could be held personally liable for our obligations under the laws of delaware to the same extent as our general partner this liability would extend to persons who transact business with us who reasonably believe that the limited partner is a general partner neither our partnership agreement nor the delaware limited partnership act specifically provides for legal recourse against our general partner if a limited partner were to lose limited liability through any fault of our general partner while this does not mean that a limited partner could not seek legal recourse we know of no precedent for this type of a claim in delaware case law the limitation on our general partners liability does not constitute a waiver of compliance with us federal securities laws that would be void under section  of the securities act   under the delaware limited partnership act a limited partnership may not make a distribution to a partner if after the distribution all liabilities of the limited partnership other than liabilities to partners on account of their partnership interests and liabilities for which the recourse of creditors is limited to specific property of the partnership would exceed the fair value of the assets of the limited partnership for the purpose of determining the fair value of the assets of a limited partnership the delaware limited partnership act provides that the fair value of property subject to liability for which recourse of creditors is limited will be included in the assets of the limited partnership only to the extent that the fair value of that property exceeds the nonrecourse liability the delaware limited partnership act provides that a limited partner who receives a distribution and knew at the time of the distribution that the distribution was in violation of the delaware limited partnership act will be liable to the limited partnership for the amount of the distribution for three years from the date of the distribution under the delaware limited partnership act a substituted limited partner of a limited partnership is liable for the obligations of his assignor to make contributions to the partnership except that such person is not obligated for liabilities unknown to him at the time he became a limited partner and that could not be ascertained from the partnership agreement   moreover if it were determined that we were conducting business in any state without compliance with the applicable limited partnership statute or that the right or exercise of the right by the limited partners as a group to elect the directors of our general partner to approve some amendments to our partnership agreement or to take other action under our partnership agreement constituted participation in the control of our business for purposes of the statutes of any relevant jurisdiction then the limited partners could be held personally liable for our obligations under the law of that jurisdiction to the same extent as our general partner under the circumstances we intend to operate in a manner that our general partner considers reasonable and necessary or appropriate to preserve the limited liability of the limited partners        issuance of additional securities   our partnership agreement authorizes us to issue an unlimited number of

information about us        material us federal tax considerations   this summary discusses the material us federal income tax considerations related to the purchase ownership and disposition of our common units as of the date hereof for purposes of this discussion references to carlyle we our and us mean only the carlyle group lp and not its subsidiaries except as otherwise indicated this summary is based on provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended on the regulations promulgated thereunder and on published administrative rulings and pronouncements of the irs and judicial decisions all of which are subject to change or differing interpretations at any time possibly with retroactive effect this discussion is necessarily general and may not apply to all categories of investors some of which such as banks or other financial institutions real estate investment trusts investors who are deemed to own  or more of our common units persons holding common units as part of a hedging integrated or conversion transaction or straddle traders in securities that elect to use a marktomarket method of accounting for their securities holdings charitable remainder unit trusts common trust funds insurance companies persons liable for the alternative minimum tax dealers and other investors that do not own their common units as capital assets may be subject to special rules taxexempt organizations and mutual funds are discussed separately below in addition except to the extent provided below this discussion does not address any aspect of state local or nonus tax law the actual tax consequences of the purchase and ownership of common units will vary depending on your circumstances this discussion to the extent that it states matters of us federal tax law or legal conclusions and subject to the qualifications herein represents the opinion of simpson thacher  bartlett llp such opinion is based in part on facts described in this prospectus and on various other factual assumptions representations and determinations any alteration or incorrectness of such facts assumptions representations or determinations could adversely affect such opinion however opinions of counsel are not binding upon the irs or any court and the irs may challenge the conclusions herein and a court may sustain such a challenge   for purposes of this discussion a us holder is a beneficial holder of a common unit that is for us federal income tax purposes  an individual citizen or resident of the united states  a corporation or other entity treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes created or organized in or under the laws of the united states any state thereof or the district of columbia  an estate the income of which is subject to us federal income taxation regardless of its source or  a trust which either a is subject to the primary supervision of a court within the united states and one or more united states persons have the authority to control all substantial decisions of the trust or b has a valid election in effect under applicable treasury regulations to be treated as a united states person a nonus holder is a holder other than a partnership that is not a us holder   if a partnership holds common units the tax treatment of a partner in the partnership generally will depend upon the status of the partner and the activities of the partnership if you are a partner of a partnership holding our common units you should consult your tax advisors this discussion does not constitute tax advice and is not intended to be a substitute for tax planning   prospective holders of common units should consult their own tax advisors concerning the us federal state and local income tax and estate tax consequences in their particular situations of the purchase ownership and disposition of a common unit as well as any consequences under the laws of any other taxing jurisdiction   taxation of our partnership and the carlyle holdings partnerships   subject to the discussion set forth in the next paragraph an entity that is treated as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes is not a taxable entity and incurs no us federal income tax liability instead each partner is required to take into account its allocable share of items of income gain loss and deduction of the partnership in computing its us federal income tax liability regardless of whether or not cash distributions are then made investors in this offering will      become limited partners of the carlyle group lp distributions of cash by a partnership to a partner are generally not taxable unless the amount of cash distributed to a partner is in excess of the partners adjusted basis in its partnership interest   an entity that would otherwise be classified as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes may nonetheless be taxable as a corporation if it is a publicly traded partnership unless an exception applies an entity that would otherwise be classified as a partnership is a publicly traded partnership if i interests in the partnership are traded on an established securities market or ii interests in the partnership are readily tradable on a secondary market or the substantial equivalent thereof we will be publicly traded however an exception to taxation as a corporation referred to as the qualifying income exception exists if at least  of such partnerships gross income for every taxable year consists of qualifying income and the partnership is not required to register under the  act qualifying income includes certain interest income dividends real property rents gains from the sale or other disposition of real property and any gain from the sale or disposition of a capital asset or other property held for the production of income that otherwise constitutes qualifying income qualifying income does not generally include fees paid in respect of services   we expect that allocations of carried interest from investments in stock and securities of corporations will typically consist of qualifying income because such allocations will generally consist of gain from the sale or disposition of a capital asset interest and dividends income in respect of management advisory and incentive fees as well as income allocations from our interest in investments in businesses conducted in noncorporate form such as partnerships or llcs will typically not constitute qualifying income we intend to hold investments that generate nonqualifying income separately from our investments that generate qualifying income which include allocations of carried interest from investments in stock and securities of corporations we intend to hold investments that earn nonqualifying fee income such as management fees incentive fees and advisory fees through entities classified as corporations for us federal income tax purposes including carlyle holdings i gp inc and carlyle holdings iii gp lp distributions received from such corporations will generally constitute qualifying income   our general partner will adopt a set of investment policies and procedures that will govern the types of investments we can make and income we can earn including structuring certain investments through entities classified as corporations for us federal income tax purposes to ensure that we will meet the qualifying income exception in each taxable year it is the opinion of simpson thacher  bartlett llp that we will be treated as a partnership and not as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes based on certain assumptions and factual statements and representations made by us including statements and representations as to the manner in which we intend to manage our affairs the composition of our income and that our general partner will ensure that we comply with the investment policies and procedures put in place to ensure that we meet the qualifying income exception in each taxable year however this opinion is based solely on current law and does not take into account any proposed or potential changes in law which may be enacted with retroactive effect moreover opinions of counsel are not binding upon the irs or any court and the irs may challenge this conclusion and a court may sustain such a challenge   if we fail to meet the qualifying income exception other than a failure that is determined by the irs to be inadvertent and that is cured within a reasonable time after discovery or if we are required to register under the  act we will be treated as if we had transferred all of our assets subject to liabilities to a newly formed corporation on the first day of the year in which we fail to meet the qualifying income exception in return for stock in that corporation and then distributed the stock to the holders of common units in liquidation of their interests in us this deemed contribution and liquidation should generally be taxfree to holders so long as we do not have liabilities in excess of the tax basis of our assets at that time thereafter we would be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes      if we were treated as a corporation in any taxable year either as a result of a failure to meet the qualifying income exception or otherwise our items of income gain loss and deduction would be reflected only on our tax return rather than being passed through to holders of common units and we would be subject to us corporate income tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates thereby materially reducing the amount of cash available for distribution to holders of our common units distributions made to holders of our common units would be treated as either taxable dividend income which may be eligible for reduced rates of taxation to the extent of our current or accumulated earnings and profits or in the absence of earnings and profits as a nontaxable return of capital to the extent of the holders tax basis in the common units or as taxable capital gain after the holders basis is reduced to zero in addition in the case of nonus holders income that we receive with respect to investments may be subject to a higher rate of us withholding tax accordingly treatment as a corporation could materially reduce a holders aftertax return and thus could result in a substantial reduction of the value of the common units   if at the end of any taxable year we fail to meet the qualifying income exception we may still qualify as a partnership if we are entitled to relief under the internal revenue code for an inadvertent termination of partnership status this relief will be available if i the failure is cured within a reasonable time after discovery ii the failure is determined by the irs to be inadvertent and iii we agree to make such adjustments including adjustments with respect to our partners or to pay such amounts as are required by the irs it is not possible to state whether we would be entitled to this relief in any or all circumstances it also is not clear under the internal revenue code whether this relief is available for our first taxable year as a publicly traded partnership if this relief provision is inapplicable to a particular set of circumstances involving us we will not qualify as a partnership for federal income tax purposes even if this relief provision applies and we retain our partnership status we or the holders of our common units during the failure period will be required to pay such amounts as are determined by the irs   the remainder of this section assumes that we and the carlyle holdings partnerships will be treated as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes   taxation of carlyle holdings i gp inc   carlyle holdings i gp inc is taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes and therefore as the holder of carlyle holdings i gp incs common stock we will not be taxed directly on earnings of entities we hold through carlyle holdings i gp inc distributions of cash or other property that carlyle holdings i gp inc pays to us will constitute dividends for us federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from its current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under us federal income tax principles if the amount of a distribution by carlyle holdings i gp inc exceeds its current and accumulated earnings and profits such excess will be treated as a taxfree return of capital to the extent of our tax basis in carlyle holdings i gp incs common stock and thereafter will be treated as a capital gain we expect to hold certain of our entities that are expected to generate income that is not qualifying income for purposes of the qualifying income exception through carlyle holdings i gp inc which is a corporation for us federal income tax purposes so that income in respect of such investments will be paid to us as distributions from carlyle holdings i gp inc that will constitute qualifying income   carlyle holdings i gp inc will incur us federal income taxes on its proportionate share of any net taxable income of carlyle holdings i lp in accordance with its partnership agreement we will cause carlyle holdings i lp to distribute cash on a pro rata basis to holders of its units that is carlyle holdings i gp inc and our existing owners in an amount at least equal to the maximum tax liabilities arising from their ownership of such units if any      taxation of carlyle holdings ii gp llc   as a single member limited liability company that has not elected to be treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes carlyle holdings ii gp llc will be treated as an entity disregarded as a separate entity from us accordingly all the assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit of carlyle holdings ii gp llc will be treated as our assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit   we anticipate that carlyle holdings ii gp llc will invest directly or indirectly in a variety of assets and otherwise engage in activities and derive income that is consistent with the qualifying income exception discussed above   taxation of carlyle holdings iii gp lp   carlyle holdings iii gp lp is a whollyowned société en commandite organized in québec carlyle holdings iii gp lp is taxable as a foreign corporation for us federal income tax purposes distributions of cash or other property that carlyle holdings iii gp lp pays to us will constitute dividends for us federal income tax purposes to the extent paid from its current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined under us federal income tax principles if the amount of a distribution by carlyle holdings iii gp lp exceeds its current and accumulated earnings and profits such excess will be treated as a taxfree return of capital to the extent of our tax basis in carlyle holdings iii gp lps common stock and thereafter will be treated as a capital gain income realized by carlyle holdings iii gp lp will not be subject to us federal income tax to the extent it has a foreign source and is not treated as eci carlyle holdings iii gp lp is expected to be operated so as not to produce eci its assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit will not be treated as our assets liabilities and items of income deduction and credit we expect to hold certain of our entities that are expected to generate income that is not qualifying income for purposes of the qualifying income exception through carlyle holdings iii gp lp which is a corporation for us federal income tax purposes so that income in respect of such entities will be paid to us as distributions from carlyle holdings iii gp lp that will constitute qualifying income   personal holding companies   carlyle holdings i gp inc could be subject to additional us federal income tax on a portion of its income if it is determined to be a personal holding company or phc for us federal income tax purposes subject to certain exceptions a us corporation generally will be classified as a phc for us federal income tax purposes in a given taxable year if i at any time during the last half of such taxable year five or fewer individuals without regard to their citizenship or residency and including as individuals for this purpose certain entities such as certain taxexempt organizations and pension funds own or are deemed to own pursuant to certain constructive ownership rules more than  of the stock of the corporation by value and ii at least  of the corporations adjusted ordinary gross income as determined for us federal income tax purposes for such taxable year consists of phc income which includes among other things dividends interest royalties annuities and under certain circumstances rents the phc rules do not apply to nonus corporations   due to applicable attribution rules it is likely that five or fewer individuals or taxexempt organizations will be treated as owning actually or constructively more than  of the value of units in carlyle holdings i gp inc consequently carlyle holdings i gp inc could be or become a phc depending on whether it fails the phc gross income test if as a factual matter the income of carlyle holdings i gp inc fails the phc gross income test it will be a phc certain aspects of the gross income test cannot be predicted with certainty thus no assurance can be given that carlyle holdings i gp inc will not become a phc following this offering or in the future   if carlyle holdings i gp inc is or were to become a phc in a given taxable year it would be subject to an additional  phc tax on its undistributed phc income which generally includes the      companys taxable income subject to certain adjustments for taxable years beginning after december   the phc tax rate on undistributed phc income will be equal to the highest marginal rate on ordinary income applicable to individuals if carlyle holdings i gp inc were to become a phc and had significant amounts of undistributed phc income the amount of phc tax could be material in that event distribution of such income would generally reduce the phc income subject to tax   certain state local and nonus tax matters   we and our subsidiaries may be subject to state local or nonus taxation in various jurisdictions including those in which we or they transact business own property or reside for example we and our subsidiaries may be subject to new york city andor district of columbia unincorporated business tax we may be required to file tax returns in some or all of those jurisdictions the state local or nonus tax treatment of us and our common unitholders may not conform to the us federal income tax treatment discussed herein we will pay nonus taxes and dispositions of foreign property or operations involving or investments in foreign property may give rise to nonus income or other tax liability in amounts that could be substantial any nonus taxes incurred by us may not pass through to common unitholders as a credit against their us federal income tax liability   consequences to us holders of common units   the following is a summary of the material us federal income tax consequences that will apply to you if you are a us holder of common units   for us federal income tax purposes your allocable share of our recognized items of income gain loss deduction or credit and our allocable share of those items of carlyle holdings will be determined by the limited partnership agreements for our partnership and carlyle holdings if such allocations have substantial economic effect or are determined to be in accordance with your interest in our partnership we believe that for us federal income tax purposes such allocations will be given effect as being in accordance with your interest in the carlyle group lp and our general partner intends to prepare tax returns based on such allocations if the irs successfully challenges the allocations made pursuant to the limited partnership agreements the resulting allocations for us federal income tax purposes might be less favorable than the allocations set forth in the limited partnership agreements   with respect to us holders who are individuals certain dividends paid by a corporation including certain qualified foreign corporations to us and that are allocable to such us holders prior to january   may be subject to reduced rates of taxation a qualified foreign corporation includes a foreign corporation that is eligible for the benefits of specified income tax treaties with the united states in addition a foreign corporation is treated as a qualified corporation on shares that are readily tradable on an established securities market in the united states we do not expect that carlyle holdings iii gp lp will be a qualified foreign corporation for purposes of the reduced rates of taxation on dividends among other exceptions a us holder who is an individual will not be eligible for reduced rates of taxation on any dividend if the payer is a pfic as defined below in the taxable year in which such dividend is paid or in the preceding taxable year or on any income required to be reported by the us holder as a result of a qef election as defined below that is attributable to a dividend received by an entity that is a pfic and in which the fund holds a direct or indirect interest prospective investors should consult their own tax advisors regarding the application of the foregoing rules to their particular circumstances   we may derive taxable income from an investment that is not matched by a corresponding distribution of cash this could occur for example if we used cash to make an investment or to reduce debt instead of distributing profits in addition special provisions of the internal revenue code may be applicable to certain of our investments and may affect the timing of our income      requiring us and consequently you to recognize taxable income before we or you receive cash attributable to such income accordingly it is possible that your us federal income tax liability with respect to your allocable share of our income for a particular taxable year could exceed any cash distribution you receive for the year thus giving rise to an outofpocket tax liability for you   basis   you will have an initial tax basis for your common unit equal to the amount you paid for the common unit plus your share under the partnership tax rules of our liabilities if any that basis will be increased by your share of our income and by increases in your share of our liabilities if any that basis will be decreased but not below zero by distributions from us by your share of our losses and by any decrease in your share of our liabilities   holders who purchase common units in separate transactions must combine the basis of those units and maintain a single adjusted tax basis for all those units upon a sale or other disposition of less than all of the common units a portion of that tax basis must be allocated to the common units sold   limits on deductions for losses and expenses   your deduction of your share of our losses will be limited to your tax basis in your common units and if you are an individual or a corporate holder that is subject to the at risk rules to the amount for which you are considered to be at risk with respect to our activities if that is less than your tax basis in general you will be at risk to the extent of your tax basis in your common units reduced by  the portion of that basis attributable to your share of our liabilities for which you will not be personally liable and  any amount of money you borrow to acquire or hold your common units if the lender of those borrowed funds owns an interest in us is related to you or can look only to the common units for repayment your at risk amount generally will increase by your allocable share of our income and gain and decrease by cash distributions to you and your allocable share of losses and deductions you must recapture losses deducted in previous years to the extent that distributions cause your at risk amount to be less than zero at the end of any taxable year losses disallowed or recaptured as a result of these limitations will carry forward and will be allowable to the extent that your tax basis or at risk amount whichever is the limiting factor subsequently increases any excess loss above that gain previously suspended by the at risk or basis limitations may no longer be used   we do not expect to generate income or losses from passive activities for purposes of section  of the internal revenue code accordingly income allocated to you by us may not be offset by your section  passive losses and losses allocated to you generally may not be used to offset your section  passive income in addition other provisions of the internal revenue code may limit or disallow any deduction for losses by you or deductions associated with certain assets of the partnership in certain cases including potentially section  of the internal revenue code you should consult with your tax advisors regarding their limitations on the deductibility of losses under applicable sections of the internal revenue code   limitations on deductibility of organizational expenses and syndication fees   in general neither we nor any us holder may deduct organizational or syndication expenses an election may be made by our partnership to amortize organizational expenses over a year period syndication fees which would include any sales or placement fees or commissions or underwriting discount payable to third parties must be capitalized and cannot be amortized or otherwise deducted   limitations on interest deductions   your share of our interest expense is likely to be treated as investment interest expense if you are a noncorporate us holder the deductibility of investment interest expense is generally      limited to the amount of your net investment income your share of our dividend and interest income will be treated as investment income although qualified dividend income subject to reduced rates of tax in the hands of an individual will only be treated as investment income if you elect to treat such dividend as ordinary income not subject to reduced rates of tax in addition state and local tax laws may disallow deductions for your share of our interest expense   the computation of your investment interest expense will take into account interest on any margin account borrowing or other loan incurred to purchase a common unit net investment income includes gross income from property held for investment and amounts treated as portfolio income such as dividends and interest under the passive loss rules less deductible expenses other than interest directly connected with the production of investment income but generally does not include gains attributable to the disposition of property held for investment for this purpose any longterm capital gain or qualifying dividend income that is taxable at longterm capital gain rates is excluded from net investment income unless the us holder elects to pay tax on such gain or dividend income at ordinary income rates   deductibility of partnership investment expenditures by individual partners and by trusts and estates   subject to certain exceptions all miscellaneous itemized deductions of an individual taxpayer and certain of such deductions of an estate or trust are deductible only to the extent that such deductions exceed  of the taxpayers adjusted gross income moreover for taxable years beginning on or after january   the otherwise allowable itemized deductions of individuals whose gross income exceeds an applicable threshold amount are subject to reduction by an amount equal to the lesser of   of the excess of the individuals adjusted gross income over the threshold amount or   of the amount of the itemized deductions the operating expenses of carlyle holdings including the management fee and management fees paid with respect to private funds advised by carlyle to the extent these private funds are treated as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes may be treated as miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the foregoing rule alternatively it is possible that we will be required to capitalize the management fees accordingly if you are a noncorporate us holder you should consult your tax advisors with respect to the application of these limitations   treatment of distributions   distributions of cash by us will not be taxable to you to the extent of your adjusted tax basis described above in your common units any cash distributions in excess of your adjusted tax basis will be considered to be gain from the sale or exchange of common units described below under current laws such gain would be treated as capital gain and would be longterm capital gain if your holding period for your common units exceeds one year subject to certain exceptions described below a reduction in your allocable share of our liabilities and certain distributions of marketable securities by us are treated similar to cash distributions for us federal income tax purposes   sale or exchange of common units   you will recognize gain or loss on a sale of common units equal to the difference if any between the amount realized and your tax basis in the common units sold your amount realized will be measured by the sum of the cash or the fair market value of other property received plus your share under the partnership tax rules of our liabilities if any your adjusted tax basis will be adjusted for this purpose by your allocable share of our income or loss for the year of such sale or other disposition   gain or loss recognized by you on the sale or exchange of a common unit generally will be taxable as capital gain or loss and will be longterm capital gain or loss if all of the common units you hold were held for more than one year on the date of such sale or exchange assuming we have      not made an election referred to as a qef election to treat our interest in a pfic as a qualified electing fund or qef gain attributable to such investment in a pfic would be taxable as ordinary income and would be subject to an interest charge see  passive foreign investment companies in addition certain gain attributable to our investment in a controlled foreign corporation or cfc may be characterized as ordinary income and certain gain attributable to unrealized receivables or inventory items would be characterized as ordinary income rather than capital gain for example if we hold debt acquired at a market discount accrued market discount on such debt would be treated as unrealized receivables the deductibility of capital losses is subject to limitations   holders who purchase units at different times and intend to sell all or a portion of the units within a year of their most recent purchase are urged to consult their tax advisors regarding the application of certain split holding period rules to them and the treatment of any gain or loss as longterm or shortterm capital gain or loss   foreign tax credit limitations   you generally will be entitled to a foreign tax credit with respect to your allocable share of creditable foreign taxes paid on our income and gains complex rules may depending on your particular circumstances limit the availability or use of foreign tax credits gains from the sale of our investments may be treated as us source gains consequently you may not be able to use the foreign tax credit arising from any foreign taxes imposed on such gains unless such credit can be applied subject to applicable limitations against tax due on other income treated as derived from foreign sources certain losses that we incur may be treated as foreign source losses which could reduce the amount of foreign tax credits otherwise available   section  election   we currently do not intend to make the election permitted by section  of the internal revenue code with respect to us or carlyle holdings ii lp carlyle holdings i lp and carlyle holdings iii lp currently intend to make such an election the election if made is irrevocable without the consent of the irs and would generally require the electing partnership to adjust the tax basis in its assets or inside basis attributable to a transferee of interests in the electing partnership under section b of the internal revenue code to reflect the purchase price of such interests paid by the transferee if carlyle holdings i lp or carlyle holdings iii lp makes a section  election as intended then carlyle holdings i gp inc and carlyle holdings iii gp lp respectively would be required to adjust the basis in their assets attributable to interests in carlyle holding i lp acquired by carlyle holdings i gp inc and interests in carlyle holdings iii lp acquired by carlyle holdings iii gp lp from the limited partners of carlyle holdings i lp and carlyle holdings iii lp pursuant to the exchange agreement described under certain relationships and related person transactions  exchange agreement if as intended we do not make the section  election with respect to us no similar adjustment to basis in assets owned directly or indirectly by us attributable to common units acquired by transferees would be made because we own our interests in carlyle holdings i lp indirectly through carlyle holdings i gp inc a corporation for us federal income tax purposes and our interests in carlyle holdings iii lp indirectly though carlyle holdings iii gp lp a corporation for us federal income tax purposes there will be no adjustment to the inside basis for a transferee of common units in respect of carlyle holdings i lp or carlyle holdings iii lp regardless of whether a section  election is made in respect of us or those partnerships   if no section  election is made by us and carlyle holdings ii lp there will be no adjustment for the transferee of common units even if the purchase price of those common units is higher than the common units share of the aggregate tax basis of our assets or the assets of carlyle holdings ii lp immediately prior to the transfer in that case on a sale of any such asset gain allocable to the transferee would include builtin gain allocable to the transferee at the time of the      transfer which builtin gain would otherwise generally be eliminated if we and carlyle holdings ii lp had made a section  election   even assuming no section  election is made if common units are transferred at a time when we had a substantial builtin loss inherent in our assets we would be obligated to reduce the tax basis in the portion of such assets attributable to such common units   the calculations under section  of the internal revenue code are complex we will make them on the basis of assumptions as to the value of our assets and other matters   uniformity of common units   because we cannot match transferors and transferees of common units we will adopt depreciation amortization and other tax accounting positions that may not conform with all aspects of existing treasury regulations a successful irs challenge to those positions could adversely affect the amount of tax benefits available to our common unitholders it also could affect the timing of these tax benefits or the amount of gain on the sale of common units and could have a negative impact on the value of our common units or result in audits of and adjustments to our common unitholders tax returns   foreign currency gain or loss   our functional currency will be the us dollar and our income or loss will be calculated in us dollars it is likely that we will recognize foreign currency gain or loss with respect to transactions involving nonus dollar currencies in general foreign currency gain or loss is treated as ordinary income or loss you should consult your tax advisor with respect to the tax treatment of foreign currency gain or loss   passive foreign investment companies   you may be subject to special rules applicable to indirect investments in foreign corporations including an investment in a pfic carlyle holdings i gp inc will be subject to rules similar to those described below with respect to any pfics owned directly or indirectly by it   a pfic is defined as any foreign corporation with respect to which either   or more of the gross income for a taxable year is passive income as defined in section  of the internal revenue code and the regulations promulgated thereunder or   or more of its assets in any taxable year generally based on the quarterly average of the value of its assets produce passive income there are no minimum stock ownership requirements for pfics once a corporation qualifies as a pfic it is subject to certain exceptions always treated as a pfic regardless of whether it satisfies either of the qualification tests in subsequent years any gain on disposition of stock of a pfic as well as income realized on certain excess distributions by the pfic is treated as though realized ratably over the shorter of your holding period of common units or our holding period for the pfic such gain or income is taxable as ordinary income and as discussed above dividends paid by a pfic to an individual will not be eligible for the reduced rates of taxation that are available for certain qualifying dividends in addition an interest charge would be imposed on you based on the tax deferred from prior years   although it may not always be possible we expect to make a qef election where possible with respect to each entity treated as a pfic to treat such nonus entity as a qef in the first year we hold shares in such entity however we expect that in many circumstances we may not have access to information necessary to make a qef election because for example one of our investment funds may hold minority interests directly or indirectly in an entity over which we have no control a qef election is effective for our taxable year for which the election is made and all subsequent taxable years and may not be revoked without the consent of the irs if we make a qef election under the internal revenue code with respect to our interest in a pfic in lieu of the foregoing treatment we      would be required to include in income each year a portion of the ordinary earnings and net capital gains of the qef called qef inclusions even if not distributed to us thus holders may be required to report taxable income as a result of qef inclusions without corresponding receipts of cash however a holder may elect to defer until the occurrence of certain events payment of the us federal income tax attributable to qef inclusions for which no current distributions are received but will be required to pay interest on the deferred tax computed by using the statutory rate of interest applicable to an extension of time for payment of tax however net losses if any of a nonus entity owned through carlyle holdings ii gp llc that is treated as a pfic will not pass through to us or to holders and may not be carried back or forward in computing such pfics ordinary earnings and net capital gain in other taxable years consequently holders may over time be taxed on amounts that as an economic matter exceed our net profits our tax basis in the shares of such nonus entities and a holders basis in our common units will be increased to reflect qef inclusions no portion of the qef inclusion attributable to ordinary income will be eligible for reduced rates of taxation applicable to qualified dividend income of individual us holders amounts included as qef inclusions with respect to direct and indirect investments generally will not be taxed again when distributed you should consult your tax advisors as to the manner in which qef inclusions affect your allocable share of our income and your basis in your common units   alternatively in the case of a pfic that is a publiclytraded foreign portfolio company we may make an election to mark to market the stock of such foreign portfolio company on an annual basis pursuant to such an election you would include in each year as ordinary income the excess if any of the fair market value of such stock over its adjusted basis at the end of the taxable year you may treat as ordinary loss any excess of the adjusted basis of the stock over its fair market value at the end of the year but only to the extent of the net amount previously included in income as a result of the election in prior years   when making investment or other decisions we will consider whether an investment will be a pfic and the tax consequences related thereto we may make certain investments including for instance investments in specialized investment funds or investments in funds of funds through nonus corporate subsidiaries of the carlyle holdings partnerships or through other nonus corporations such entities may be a pfics for us federal income tax purposes in addition certain of our investments could be in pfics thus we can make no assurance that some of our investments will not be treated as held through a pfic or as interests in pfics or that such pfics will be eligible for the mark to market election or that as to any such pfics we will be able to make qef elections   if we do not make a qef election with respect to a pfic section  of the internal revenue code will treat all gain on a disposition by us of shares of such entity gain on the disposition of common units by a holder at a time when we own shares of such entity as well as certain other defined excess distributions as if the gain or excess distribution were ordinary income earned ratably over the shorter of the period during which the holder held its common units or the period during which we held our shares in such entity for gain and excess distributions allocated to prior years i the tax rate will be the highest in effect for that taxable year and ii the tax will be payable generally without regard to offsets from deductions losses and expenses holders will also be subject to an interest charge for any deferred tax no portion of this ordinary income will be eligible for the favorable tax rate applicable to qualified dividend income for individual us persons   controlled foreign corporations   a nonus entity will be treated as a cfc if it is treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes and if more than  of i the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the nonus entity entitled to vote or ii the total value of the stock of the nonus entity is owned by us shareholders on any day during the taxable year of such nonus entity for purposes of this discussion a us shareholder with respect to a nonus entity means a us person that owns  or more of the total combined voting power of all classes of stock of the nonus entity entitled to vote      when making investment or other decisions we will consider whether an investment will be a cfc and the consequences related thereto if we are a us shareholder in a nonus entity that is treated as a cfc each common unitholder may be required to include in income its allocable share of the cfcs subpart f income reported by us subpart f income generally includes dividends interest net gain from the sale or disposition of securities nonactively managed rents fees for services provided to certain related persons and certain other generally passive types of income the aggregate subpart f income inclusions in any taxable year relating to a particular cfc are limited to such entitys current earnings and profits these inclusions are treated as ordinary income whether or not such inclusions are attributable to net capital gains thus an investor may be required to report as ordinary income its allocable share of the cfcs subpart f income reported by us without corresponding receipts of cash and may not benefit from capital gain treatment with respect to the portion of our earnings if any attributable to net capital gains of the cfc   the tax basis of our shares of such nonus entity and a holders tax basis in our common units will be increased to reflect any required subpart f income inclusions such income will be treated as income from sources within the united states for certain foreign tax credit purposes to the extent derived by the cfc from us sources such income will not be eligible for the reduced rate of tax applicable to qualified dividend income for individual us persons see  consequences to us holders of common units amounts included as such income with respect to direct and indirect investments generally will not be taxable again when distributed   regardless of whether any cfc has subpart f income any gain allocated to you from our disposition of stock in a cfc will be treated as ordinary income to the extent of your allocable share of the current andor accumulated earnings and profits of the cfc in this regard earnings would not include any amounts previously taxed pursuant to the cfc rules however net losses if any of a nonus entity owned by us that is treated as a cfc will not pass through to you moreover a portion of your gain from the sale or exchange of your common units may be treated as ordinary income any portion of any gain from the sale or exchange of a common unit that is attributable to a cfc may be treated as an unrealized receivable taxable as ordinary income see  sale or exchange of common units   if a nonus entity held by us is classified as both a cfc and a pfic during the time we are a us shareholder of such nonus entity a holder will be required to include amounts in income with respect to such nonus entity pursuant to this subheading and the consequences described under the subheading passive foreign investment companies above will not apply if our ownership percentage in a nonus entity changes such that we are not a us shareholder with respect to such nonus entity then common unitholders may be subject to the pfic rules the interaction of these rules is complex and prospective holders are urged to consult their tax advisors in this regard   it is expected that carlyle holdings iii gp lp will be a cfc subject to the above rules and as such each common unitholder that is a us person will be required to include in income its allocable share of carlyle holdings iii gp lps subpart f income reported by us   investment structure   to manage our affairs so as to meet the qualifying income exception for the publicly traded partnership rules discussed above and comply with certain requirements in our limited partnership agreement we may need to structure certain investments through an entity classified as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes however because our common unitholders will be located in numerous taxing jurisdictions no assurances can be given that any such investment structure will be beneficial to all our common unitholders to the same extent and may even impose additional tax burdens on some of our common unitholders as discussed above if the entity were a nonus corporation it may be considered a cfc or a pfic if the entity were a us corporation it would be subject to us federal income tax on its operating income including any gain recognized      on its disposal of its investments in addition if the investment involves us real estate gain recognized on disposition would generally be subject to such tax whether the corporation is a us or a nonus corporation   taxes in other state local and nonus jurisdictions   in addition to us federal income tax consequences you may be subject to potential us state and local taxes because of an investment in us in the us state or locality in which you are a resident for tax purposes or in which we have investments or activities you may also be subject to tax return filing obligations and income franchise or other taxes including withholding taxes in state local or nonus jurisdictions in which we invest or in which entities in which we own interests conduct activities or derive income income or gains from investments held by us may be subject to withholding or other taxes in jurisdictions outside the united states subject to the possibility of reduction under applicable income tax treaties if you wish to claim the benefit of an applicable income tax treaty you may be required to submit information to tax authorities in such jurisdictions you should consult your own tax advisors regarding the us state local and nonus tax consequences of an investment in us   transferortransferee allocations   in general our taxable income and losses will be determined and apportioned among investors using conventions we regard as consistent with applicable law as a result if you transfer your common units you may be allocated income gain loss and deduction realized by us after the date of transfer similarly a transferee may be allocated income gain loss and deduction realized by us prior to the date of the transferees acquisition of our common units   although section  of the internal revenue code generally provides guidelines for allocations of items of partnership income and deductions between transferors and transferees of partnership interests it is not clear that our allocation method complies with its requirements if our convention were not permitted the irs might contend that our taxable income or losses must be reallocated among the investors if such a contention were sustained your respective tax liabilities would be adjusted to your possible detriment our general partner is authorized to revise our method of allocation between transferors and transferees as well as among investors whose interests otherwise vary during a taxable period   us federal estate taxes   if common units are included in the gross estate of a us citizen or resident for us federal estate tax purposes then a us federal estate tax might be payable in connection with the death of such person prospective individual us holders should consult their own tax advisors concerning the potential us federal estate tax consequences with respect to our common units   us taxation of taxexempt us holders of common units   a holder of common units that is a taxexempt organization for us federal income tax purposes and therefore generally exempt from us federal income taxation may nevertheless be subject to unrelated business income tax or ubti to the extent if any that its allocable share of our income consists of ubti a taxexempt partner of a partnership that regularly engages in a trade or business which is unrelated to the exempt function of the taxexempt partner must include in computing its ubti its pro rata share whether or not distributed of such partnerships gross income derived from such unrelated trade or business moreover a taxexempt partner of a partnership could be treated as earning ubti to the extent that such partnership derives income from debtfinanced property or if the partnership interest itself is debt financed debtfinanced property means property held to produce income with respect to which there is acquisition indebtedness that is indebtedness incurred in acquiring or holding property      while we do not expect to generate significant amounts of ubti for taxexempt holders of our common units as a result of direct investments in operating businesses certain of our investments may be treated as debtfinanced investments which may give rise to debtfinanced ubti accordingly no assurance can be given that we will not generate ubti currently or in the future and subject to the qualifying income rules described under material us federal tax considerations  taxation of our partnership and the carlyle holdings partnerships we are under no obligation to minimize ubti taxexempt us holders of common units should consult with their own tax advisors regarding all aspects of ubti   investments by us mutual funds   us mutual funds that are treated as regulated investment companies or rics for us federal income tax purposes are required among other things to meet an annual  gross income and a quarterly  asset value test under section b of the internal revenue code to maintain their favorable us federal income tax status the treatment of an investment by a ric in common units for purposes of these tests will depend on whether we are treated as a qualifying publicly traded partnership if our partnership is so treated then the common units themselves are the relevant assets for purposes of the  asset value test and the net income from the common units is the relevant gross income for purposes of the  gross income test rics may not invest greater than  of their assets in one or more qualifying publicly traded partnerships all income derived from a qualifying publicly traded partnership is considered qualifying income for purposes of the ric  gross income test above however if we are not treated as a qualifying publicly traded partnership for purposes of the ric rules then the relevant assets for the ric asset test will be the rics allocable share of the underlying assets held by us and the relevant gross income for the ric income test will be the rics allocable share of the underlying gross income earned by us whether we will qualify as a qualifying publicly traded partnership depends on the exact nature of our future investments but it is likely that we will not be treated as a qualifying publicly traded partnership in addition as discussed above under  consequences to us holders of common units we may derive taxable income from an investment that is not matched by a corresponding cash distribution accordingly a ric investing in our common units may recognize income for us federal income tax purposes without receiving cash with which to make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the distribution requirements under section  and  of the internal revenue code for avoiding income and excise taxes rics should consult their own tax advisors about the us tax consequences of an investment in common units   consequences to nonus holders of common units   us income tax consequences   in light of our intended investment activities we generally do not expect to be treated as engaged in a us trade or business or to generate significant amounts of eci for nonus holders of our common units however there can be no assurance that we will not generate eci currently or in the future and subject to the qualifying income rules described under material us federal tax considerations  taxation of our partnership and the carlyle holdings partnerships we are under no obligation to minimize eci moreover there can be no assurance that the irs will not successfully assert that we are engaged in a us trade or business such that some portion of our income is properly treated as eci if a nonus holder were treated as being engaged in a us trade or business in any year because of an investment in our common units in such year such nonus holder generally would be  subject to withholding by us on any actual distributions  required to file a us federal income tax return for such year reporting its allocable share if any of income or loss effectively connected with such trade or business including certain income from us sources not related to the carlyle group lp and  required to pay us federal income tax at regular us federal income tax rates on any such income moreover a corporate nonus holder might be subject to a us branch profits tax on its allocable share of our eci any amount so withheld would be creditable against such nonus holders      us federal income tax liability and such nonus holder could claim a refund to the extent that the amount withheld exceeded such nonus holders us federal income tax liability for the taxable year finally if we were treated as being engaged in a us trade or business a portion of any gain recognized by a holder who is a nonus holder on the sale or exchange of its common units could be treated for us federal income tax purposes as eci and hence such nonus holder could be subject to us federal income tax on the sale or exchange of our common units   generally under the foreign investment in real property tax act of  firpta provisions of the internal revenue code nonus persons are subject to us federal income tax in the same manner as us persons on any gain realized on the disposition of an interest other than an interest solely as a creditor in us real property an interest in us real property includes stock in a us corporation except for certain stock of publicly traded us corporations if interests in us real property constitute  or more by value of the sum of the corporations assets used in a trade or business its us real property interests and its interests in real property located outside the united states a united states real property holding corporation or usrphc the firpta tax applies if a nonus person is a holder of an interest in a partnership that realizes gain in respect of an interest in us real property or an interest in a usrphc we may from time to time make certain investments other than direct investments in us real property for example through one of our investment funds held by carlyle holdings ii gp llc that could constitute investments in us real property or usrphcs if we make such investments each nonus holder will be subject to us federal income tax under firpta on such holders allocable share of any gain we realize on the disposition of a firpta interest and will be subject to the tax return filing requirements regarding eci discussed above   although each nonus holder is required to provide an irs form w we may not be able to provide complete information related to the tax status of our investors to carlyle holdings for purposes of obtaining reduced rates of withholding on behalf of our investors accordingly to the extent we receive dividends from a us corporation through carlyle holdings and its investment vehicles your allocable share of distributions of such dividend income will be subject to us withholding tax at a  rate unless relevant tax status information is provided distributions to you may also be subject to withholding to the extent they are attributable to the sale of a us real property interest or if the distribution is otherwise considered fixed or determinable annual or periodic income under the internal revenue code provided that an exemption from or a reduced rate of such withholding may apply if certain tax status information is provided if such information is not provided and you would not be subject to us tax based on your tax status or are eligible for a reduced rate of us withholding you may need to take additional steps to receive a credit or refund of any excess withholding tax paid on your account which may include the filing of a nonresident us income tax return with the irs among other limitations if you reside in a treaty jurisdiction which does not treat our partnership as a passthrough entity you may not be eligible to receive a refund or credit of excess us withholding taxes paid on your account you should consult your tax advisors regarding the treatment of us withholding taxes   special rules may apply in the case of a nonus holder that  has an office or fixed place of business in the us  is present in the us for  days or more in a taxable year or  is a former citizen of the us a foreign insurance company that is treated as holding a partnership interests in us in connection with their us business a pfic or a corporation that accumulates earnings to avoid us federal income tax you should consult your tax advisors regarding the application of these special rules   us federal estate tax consequences   the us federal estate tax treatment of our common units with regards to the estate of a noncitizen who is not a resident of the united states is not entirely clear if our common units are includable in the us gross estate of such person then a us federal estate tax might be payable in connection with the death of such person prospective individual nonus holders who are      noncitizens and not residents of the united states should consult their own tax advisors concerning the potential us federal estate tax consequences with regard to our units   administrative matters   taxable year   we currently intend to use the calendar year as our taxable year for us federal income tax purposes under certain circumstances which we currently believe are unlikely to apply a taxable year other than the calendar year may be required for such purposes   tax matters partner   our general partner will act as our tax matters partner as the tax matters partner the general partner will have the authority subject to certain restrictions to act on our behalf in connection with any administrative or judicial review of our items of income gain loss deduction or credit   information returns   we have agreed to furnish to you as soon as reasonably practicable after the close of each calendar year tax information including schedule k which describes on a us dollar basis your share of our income gain loss and deduction for our preceding taxable year although we currently intend to distribute schedule ks on or around  days after the end of our fiscal year it may require longer than  days after the end of our fiscal year to obtain the requisite information from all lowertier entities so that ks may be prepared for us consequently holders of common units who are us taxpayers should anticipate that they may need to file annually with the irs and certain states a request for an extension past april  or the otherwise applicable due date of their income tax return for the taxable year in addition each partner will be required to report for all tax purposes consistently with the information provided by us for the taxable year   in preparing this information we will use various accounting and reporting conventions some of which have been mentioned in the previous discussion to determine your share of income gain loss and deduction the irs may successfully contend that certain of these reporting conventions are impermissible which could result in an adjustment to your income or loss   we may be audited by the irs adjustments resulting from an irs audit may require you to adjust a prior years tax liability and possibly may result in an audit of your own tax return any audit of your tax return could result in adjustments not related to our tax returns as well as those related to our tax returns   tax shelter regulations   if we were to engage in a reportable transaction we and possibly you and others would be required to make a detailed disclosure of the transaction to the irs in accordance with recently issued regulations governing tax shelters and other potentially taxmotivated transactions a transaction may be a reportable transaction based upon any of several factors including the fact that it is a type of tax avoidance transaction publicly identified by the irs as a listed transaction or that it produces certain kinds of losses in excess of  million an investment in us may be considered a reportable transaction if for example we recognize certain significant losses in the future in certain circumstances a common unitholder who disposes of an interest in a transaction resulting in the recognition by such holder of significant losses in excess of certain threshold amounts may be obligated to disclose its participation in such transaction our participation in a reportable transaction also could increase the likelihood that our us federal income tax information return and possibly your tax return would be audited by the irs certain of these rules are currently unclear and it is possible that they may be applicable in situations other than significant loss transactions      moreover if we were to participate in a reportable transaction with a significant purpose to avoid or evade tax or in any listed transaction you may be subject to i significant accuracyrelated penalties with a broad scope ii for those persons otherwise entitled to deduct interest on federal tax deficiencies nondeductibility of interest on any resulting tax liability and iii in the case of a listed transaction an extended statute of limitations   common unitholders should consult their tax advisors concerning any possible disclosure obligation under the regulations governing tax shelters with respect to the dispositions of their interests in us   constructive termination   subject to the electing large partnership rules described below we will be considered to have been terminated for us federal income tax purposes if there is a sale or exchange of  or more of the total interests in our capital and profits within a month period   our termination would result in the close of our taxable year for all holders of common units in the case of a holder reporting on a taxable year other than a fiscal year ending on our yearend the closing of our taxable year may result in more than  months of our taxable income or loss being includable in the holders taxable income for the year of termination we would be required to make new tax elections after a termination including a new tax election under section  of the internal revenue code a termination could also result in penalties if we were unable to determine that the termination had occurred moreover a termination might either accelerate the application of or subject us to any tax legislation enacted before the termination   elective procedures for large partnerships   the internal revenue code allows large partnerships to elect streamlined procedures for income tax reporting this election would reduce the number of items that must be separately stated on the schedules k that are issued to the common unitholders and such schedules k would have to be provided to common unitholders on or before the first march  following the close of each taxable year in addition this election would prevent us from suffering a technical termination which would close our taxable year if within a month period there is a sale or exchange of  percent or more of our total interests it is possible we might make such an election if eligible if we make such election irs audit adjustments will flow through to holders of the common units for the year in which the adjustments take effect rather than the holders of common units in the year to which the adjustment relates in addition we rather than the holders of the common units individually generally will be liable for any interest and penalties that result from an audit adjustment   treatment of amounts withheld   if we are required to withhold any us tax on distributions made to any common unitholder we may pay such withheld amount to the irs that payment if made will be treated as a distribution of cash to the common unitholder with respect to whom the payment was made and will reduce the amount of cash to which such common unitholder would otherwise be entitled   withholding and backup withholding   for each calendar year we will report to you and the irs the amount of distributions we made to you and the amount of us federal income tax if any that we withheld on those distributions the proper application to us of rules for withholding under section  of the internal revenue code applicable to certain dividends interest and similar items is unclear because the documentation we receive may not properly reflect the identities of partners at any particular time in light of possible sales of common units we may overwithhold or underwithhold with respect to a particular holder of common units for example we may impose withholding remit that amount to the irs and thus reduce the amount of a distribution paid to a nonus holder it may      turn out however the corresponding amount of our income was not properly allocable to such holder and the withholding should have been less than the actual withholding such holder would be entitled to a credit against the holders us tax liability for all withholding including any such excess withholding but if the withholding exceeded the holders us tax liability the holder would have to apply for a refund to obtain the benefit of the excess withholding similarly we may fail to withhold on a distribution and it may turn out the corresponding income was properly allocable to a nonus holder and withholding should have been imposed in that event we intend to pay the underwithheld amount to the irs and we may treat such underwithholding as an expense that will be borne by all partners on a pro rata basis since we may be unable to allocate any such excess withholding tax cost to the relevant nonus holder   under the backup withholding rules you may be subject to backup withholding tax at the applicable rate currently  with respect to distributions paid unless  you are a corporation or come within another exempt category and demonstrate this fact when required or  you provide a taxpayer identification number certify as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding tax and otherwise comply with the applicable requirements of the backup withholding tax rules if you are an exempt holder you should indicate your exempt status on a properly completed irs form w a nonus holder may qualify as an exempt recipient by submitting a properly completed irs form wben backup withholding is not an additional tax the amount of any backup withholding from a payment to you will be allowed as a credit against your us federal income tax liability and may entitle you to a refund   if you do not timely provide us or the clearing agent or other intermediary as appropriate with irs form w or w as applicable or such form is not properly completed we may become subject to us backup withholding taxes in excess of what would have been imposed had we received certifications from all investors such excess us backup withholding taxes may be treated by us as an expense that will be borne by all investors on a pro rata basis since we may be unable to allocate any such excess withholding tax cost to the holders that failed to timely provide the proper us tax certifications   additional withholding requirements   under recently enacted legislation as well as preliminary guidance in the form of proposed regulations and other administrative guidance the relevant withholding agent may be required to withhold  of any interest dividends and other fixed or determinable annual or periodical gains profits and income from sources within the united states paid after december   or gross proceeds from the sale of any property of a type which can produce interest or dividends from sources within the united states paid after december   to i a foreign financial institution for which purposes includes foreign brokerdealers clearing organizations investment companies hedge funds and certain other investment entities unless such foreign financial institution agrees to verify report and disclose its us accountholders and meets certain other specified requirements or ii a nonfinancial foreign entity that is a beneficial owner of the payment unless such entity certifies that it does not have any substantial us owners or provides the name address and taxpayer identification number of each substantial us owner and such entity meets certain other specified requirements or otherwise qualifies for an exemption from this withholding non us and us holders are encouraged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the possible implications of this proposed legislation on their investment in our common units   nominee reporting   persons who hold an interest in our partnership as a nominee for another person are required to furnish to us   a the name address and taxpayer identification number of the beneficial owner and the nominee      b whether the beneficial owner is  a person that is not a us person  a foreign government an international organization or any whollyowned agency or instrumentality of either of the foregoing or  a taxexempt entity   c the amount and description of common units held acquired or transferred for the beneficial owner and   d specific information including the dates of acquisitions and transfers means of acquisitions and transfers and acquisition cost for purchases as well as the amount of net proceeds from sales   brokers and financial institutions are required to furnish additional information including whether they are us persons and specific information on common units they acquire hold or transfer for their own account a penalty of  per failure up to a maximum of  per calendar year is imposed by the internal revenue code for failure to report that information to us the nominee is required to supply the beneficial owner of the common units with the information furnished to us   new legislation or administrative or judicial action   the us federal income tax treatment of common unitholders depends in some instances on determinations of fact and interpretations of complex provisions of us federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available   the rules dealing with us federal income taxation are constantly under review by persons involved in the legislative process the irs and the us treasury department frequently resulting in revised interpretations of established concepts statutory changes revisions to regulations and other modifications and interpretations no assurance can be given as to whether or in what form any proposals affecting us or our common unitholders will be enacted the irs pays close attention to the proper application of tax laws to partnerships the present us federal income tax treatment of an investment in our common units may be modified by administrative legislative or judicial interpretation at any time and any such action may affect investments and commitments previously made changes to the us federal income tax laws and interpretations thereof could make it more difficult or impossible to meet the qualifying income exception for us to be treated as a partnership that is not taxable as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes affect or cause us to change our investments and commitments affect the tax considerations of an investment in us change the character or treatment of portions of our income including for instance the treatment of carried interest as ordinary income rather than capital gain and adversely affect an investment in our common units see risk factors  risks related to us taxation  our structure involves complex provisions of us federal income tax law for which no clear precedent or authority may be available our structure also is subject to potential legislative judicial or administrative change and differing interpretations possibly on a retroactive basis and risk factors  risks related to our company although not enacted the us congress has considered legislation that would have i in some cases after a tenyear transition period precluded us from qualifying as a partnership for us federal income tax purposes or required us to hold carried interest through taxable subsidiary corporations and ii taxed certain income and gains at increased rates if any similar legislation were to be enacted and apply to us the after tax income and gain related to our business as well as our distributions to you and the market price of our common units could be reduced in addition statutory changes revisions to regulations and other modifications and interpretations with respect to the tax laws of the states and other jurisdictions in which we operate could result in us or our common unitholders having to pay additional taxes our organizational documents and agreements permit the board of directors to modify the amended and restated operating agreement from time to time without the consent of the common unitholders in order to address certain changes in us federal and state income tax regulations legislation or interpretation in some circumstances such revisions could have a material adverse impact on some or all of our common unitholders      the foregoing discussion is not intended as a substitute for careful tax planning the tax matters relating to carlyle and its unitholders are complex and are subject to varying interpretations moreover the meaning and impact of tax laws and of proposed changes will vary with the particular circumstances of each prospective unitholder prospective unitholders should consult their tax advisors with respect to the federal state local and other tax consequences of any investment in the common units        certain erisa considerations   the following is a summary of certain considerations associated with the purchase of our common units by i employee benefit plans that are subject to title i of the us employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa ii plans that are subject to section  of the us internal revenue code of  as amended the code and iii entities whose underlying assets are considered to include plan assets of such employee benefit plans and plans each of the foregoing described in clauses i ii and ii being referred to as an erisa plan   in considering whether to invest the assets of any erisa plan in the common units a fiduciary of an erisa plan should determine among other things whether the investment is in accordance with the documents and instruments governing such plan and the applicable provisions of erisa the code or any provisions of similar law as defined below relating to a fiduciarys duties to such erisa plan including without limitation the prudence diversification delegation of control and prohibited transaction provisions of erisa the code and any similar law   prohibited transaction issues   erisa and section  of the code prohibit erisa plans from engaging in specified transactions involving plan assets with persons or entities who are parties in interest within the meaning of erisa or disqualified persons within the meaning of section  of the code unless an exemption is available a party in interest or disqualified person who engaged in a nonexempt prohibited transaction may be subject to excise taxes and other penalties and liabilities under erisa and the code in addition the fiduciary of the erisa plan that engaged in such a nonexempt prohibited transaction may be subject to penalties and liabilities under erisa and the code   whether or not our underlying assets were deemed to include plan assets as described below the acquisition of our common units by an erisa plan with respect to which we are considered a party in interest or a disqualified person may constitute or result in a direct or indirect prohibited transaction under section  of erisa andor section  of the code unless the investment is acquired and is held in accordance with an applicable statutory class or individual prohibited transaction exemption in this regard the us department of labor the dol has issued prohibited transaction class exemptions or ptces that may apply to the acquisition and holding of the common units or any interest therein these class exemptions include without limitation ptce  respecting transactions determined by independent qualified professional asset managers ptce  respecting insurance company pooled separate accounts ptce  respecting bank collective investment funds ptce  respecting life insurance company general accounts and ptce  respecting transactions determined by inhouse asset managers although there can be no assurance that all of the conditions of any such exemptions will be satisfied   plan asset issues   erisa and the regulations the plan asset regulations promulgated under erisa by the dol generally provide that when an erisa plan acquires an equity interest in an entity that is neither a publiclyoffered security nor a security issued by an investment company registered under the  act the erisa plans assets include both the equity interests and an undivided interest in each of the underlying assets of the entity unless it is established either that less than  of the total value of each class of equity interests in the entity is held by benefit plan investors as defined in section  of erisa the  test or that the entity is an operating company as defined in the plan asset regulations there can be no assurance that we will satisfy the  test and it is not anticipated that we will qualify as an operating company or register as an investment company under the  act it is anticipated that the common units offered hereunder will qualify for the exemption for a publiclyoffered security although no assurances can be given in this regard      for purposes of the plan asset regulations a publicly offered security is a security that is a freely transferable b part of a class of securities that is widely held and c i sold to the erisa plan as part of an offering of securities to the public pursuant to an effective registration statement under the securities act of  and the class of securities to which such security is a part is registered under the securities exchange act of  within  days after the end of the fiscal year of the issuer during which the offering of such securities to the public has occurred or ii is part of a class of securities that is registered under section  of the exchange act we intend to effect such a registration under the securities act and securities exchange act the plan asset regulations provide that a security is widely held only if it is part of a class of securities that is owned by  or more investors independent of the issuer and one another a security will not fail to be widely held because the number of independent investors falls below  subsequent to the initial offering thereof as a result of events beyond the control of the issuer the plan asset regulations provide that whether a security is freely transferable is a factual question to be determined on the basis of all the relevant facts and circumstances it is anticipated that our common units to be sold in this offering will be widely held and freely transferable although no assurances can be given in this regard   if our assets were deemed to be plan assets under erisa this would result among other things in i the application of the prudence and other fiduciary responsibility standards of erisa to investments made by us and ii the possibility that certain transactions in which we might seek to engage could constitute prohibited transactions under erisa   governmental plans certain church plans and nonunited states plans such plans together with erisa plans referred to herein as plans while not subject to the fiduciary responsibility or prohibited transaction provisions of title i of erisa or section  of the code may nevertheless be subject to other federal state local nonus or other laws or regulations that are substantially similar to the foregoing provisions of erisa or the code collectively referred to herein as similar laws   representation   because of the foregoing the common units should not be purchased or held by any person investing plan assets of any plan unless the purchase and holding will not constitute a nonexempt prohibited transaction under title i of erisa or section  of the code or a similar violation of any applicable similar laws accordingly by its acquisition of common units or any interest therein each purchaser will be deemed to have represented and warranted that either i no portion of the assets used to purchase or hold the common units or any interest therein constitutes the assets of any plan or ii the purchase and holding of the common units and any interest therein will not result in a nonexempt prohibited transaction under title i of erisa or section  of the code or a similar violation of any applicable similar laws   each plan fiduciary or

entities vies including certain clos for which the company is deemed to be the primary beneficiary consolidation of these entities is a requirement under us gaap all significant interentity transactions and balances have been eliminated   for entities that are determined to be vies the company consolidates those entities where it is deemed to be the primary beneficiary pursuant to revised consolidation rules that became effective january   an entity is determined to be the primary beneficiary if it holds a controlling financial interest a controlling financial interest is defined as a the power to direct the activities of a vie that most significantly impact the entitys business and b the obligation to absorb losses of the entity or the right to receive benefits from the entity that could potentially be significant to the vie the revised consolidation rules require an analysis to a determine whether an entity in which the company holds a variable interest is a vie and b whether the companys involvement through holding interests directly or indirectly in the entity or contractually through other variable interests eg management and performance related fees would give it a controlling financial interest in evaluating whether the company is the primary beneficiary the company evaluates its economic interests in the entity held either directly or indirectly by the company the consolidation analysis is generally performed qualitatively this analysis which requires judgment is performed at each reporting date   in february  accounting standards update asu no  amendments for certain investment funds was issued this asu defers the application of the revised consolidation rules for a reporting enterprises interest in an entity if certain conditions are met including if the entity has the attributes of an investment company and is not a securitization or assetbacked financing entity an entity that qualifies for the deferral will continue to be assessed for consolidation under the overall guidance on vies before its amendment and other applicable consolidation guidance   beginning january   the company was required to consolidate  clos which are investment vehicles created for the sole purpose of issuing collateralized loan instruments upon consolidation the company elected the fair value option for eligible liabilities to mitigate accounting mismatches between the carrying value of the assets and liabilities upon adoption of the provisions of the revised consolidation guidance the company recorded a

those management fees have been eliminated as intercompany transactions at december   the company held  million of investments in these clos which represents its maximum risk of loss the companys

fees based upon the amount that would be due pursuant to the fund partnership agreement at each period end as if the funds were terminated at that date accordingly the amount recognized as unrealized performance fees reflects the companys share of the gains and losses of the associated funds underlying investments measured at their thencurrent fair values   carried interest is ultimately realized when i an underlying investment is profitably disposed of ii the funds cumulative returns are in excess of the preferred return and iii the company has decided to collect carry rather than

marketplace including the existence and transparency of transactions between market participants financial instruments with readily available quoted prices or for which fair value can be measured from quoted prices in active markets will generally have a higher degree of market price observability and a lesser degree of judgment applied in determining fair value   financial instruments measured and reported at fair value are classified and disclosed based on the observability of inputs used in the determination of fair values as follows   level i   inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices available in active markets for identical instruments as of the reporting date the type of financial instruments included in level i include unrestricted securities including equities and derivatives listed in active markets the company does not adjust the quoted price for these instruments even in situations where the company holds a large position and a sale could reasonably impact the quoted price   level ii   inputs to the valuation methodology are other than quoted prices in active markets which are either directly or indirectly observable as of the reporting date the type of f   carlyle group   notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements  continued   financial instruments in this category includes less liquid and restricted securities listed in active markets securities traded in other than active markets government and agency securities and certain overthecounter derivatives where the fair value is based on observable inputs investments in hedge funds are classified in this category when their net asset value is redeemable without significant restriction   level iii   inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to overall fair value measurement the inputs into the determination of fair value require significant management judgment or estimation financial instruments that are included in this category include investments in privatelyheld entities noninvestment grade residual interests in securitizations collateralized loan obligations and certain overthecounter derivatives where the fair value is based on unobservable inputs investments in fund of funds are generally included in this category   in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases the determination of which category within the fair value hierarchy is appropriate for any given financial instrument is based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires judgment and considers factors specific to the financial instrument   in certain cases debt and equity securities are valued on the basis of prices from an orderly transaction between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services in determining the value of a particular investment pricing services may use certain information with respect to transactions in such investments quotations from dealers pricing matrices market transactions in comparable investments and various relationships between investments   in the absence of observable market prices the company values its investments using valuation methodologies applied on a consistent basis for some investments little market activity may exist managements determination of fair value is then based on the best information available in the circumstances and may incorporate managements own assumptions and involves a significant degree of judgment taking into consideration a combination of internal and external factors including the appropriate risk adjustments for nonperformance and liquidity risks investments for which market prices are not observable include private investments in the equity of operating companies real estate properties and certain debt positions the valuation technique for each of these investments is described below   corporate private equity investments   the fair values of corporate private equity investments are determined by reference to projected net earnings earnings before interest taxes depreciation and amortization ebitda the discounted cash flow method public market or private transactions valuations for comparable companies and other measures which in many cases are unaudited at the time received valuations may be derived by reference to observable valuation measures for comparable companies or transactions eg multiplying a key performance metric of the investee company such as ebitda by a relevant valuation multiple observed in the range of comparable companies or transactions adjusted by management for differences between the investment and the referenced comparables and in some instances by reference to option pricing models or other similar models certain fund investments in the companys real assets global market strategies and fund of funds solutions segments are comparable to corporate private equity and are valued in accordance with these policies f   carlyle group   notes to the combined and consolidated financial statements  continued   real estate investments   the fair values of real estate investments are determined by considering projected operating cash flows sales of comparable assets if any and replacement costs among other measures the methods used to estimate the fair value of real estate investments include the discounted cash flow method andor capitalization rates cap rates analysis valuations may be derived by reference to observable valuation measures for comparable assets eg multiplying a key performance metric of the investee asset such as net operating income by a relevant cap rate observed in the range of comparable transactions adjusted by management for differences between the investment and the referenced comparables and in some instances by reference to pricing models or other similar methods additionally where applicable projected distributable cash flow through debt maturity will also be considered in support of the investments carrying value   creditoriented investments   the fair values of creditoriented investments are generally determined on the basis of prices between market participants provided by reputable dealers or pricing services specifically for investments in distressed debt and corporate loans and bonds the fair values are generally determined by valuations of comparable investments in some instances the company may utilize other valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow method   clo investments and clo loans payable   the company has elected the fair value option to measure the loans payable of the clos at fair value subsequent to the date of initial adoption of the new consolidation rules as the company has determined that measurement of the loans payable and preferred shares issued by the clos at fair value better correlates with the value of the assets held by the clos which are held to provide the cash flows for the note obligations the investments of the clos are also carried at fair value   the fair values of the clo loan and bond assets were primarily based on quotations from reputable dealers or relevant pricing services in situations where valuation quotations are unavailable the assets are valued based on similar securities market index changes and other factors the fair values of the clo loans payable and the clo structured asset positions were determined based on both discounted cash flow analyses and thirdparty quotes those analyses considered the position size liquidity current financial condition of the clos the thirdparty financing environment reinvestment rates recovery lags discount rates and default forecasts and is compared to broker quotations from market makers and third party dealers generally the bonds and loans in the clos are not actively traded and are classified as level iii   the company corroborates quotations from pricing services either with other available pricing data or with its own models   fund investments   the companys investments in funds are valued based on its proportionate share of the net assets provided by the third party general partners of the underlying fund partnerships based on the most recent available information which is typically a lag of up to  days the terms of the investments generally preclude the ability to redeem the investment distributions from these investments will be received as the underlying assets in the funds are liquidated the timing of which cannot be readily determined f   carlyle group
