of equity financing use this calculator to get a better understanding of different potential outcomes when investing through a convertible note this is a simplified calculation exact equity provided through a convertible note will depend on the conversion mechanics used in the note offering as well as the terms provided in the future equity offering how much equity will i potentially own when investing through a convertible note how much do you plan to invest how much capital is being raised by the business what do you expect the valuation to be at the businesss next round of financing what discount to the valuation to the valuation above do you expect to receive          we have assumed investors will accrue interest on their convertible notes at an  rate over  months for this analysis calculate you would receive of the ownership in your company if converted to equity in this scenario if the amount was not converted the full investment amount plus interest   would become due and payable after two years convertible note basics a convertible note is an investment structure that allows a company to take on funding in exchange for equity at a later date at the time of the investment the funds are considered debt but at some date in the future those funds  any accrued interest convert to equity a discount is typically included in a convertible note that provides investors equity at a cheaper price than what equity is being offered at at the time of conversion this discount compensates the investors for investing at an earlier date if the notes have not been converted to equity by the maturity date often  to  months the debt plus interest is due and payable to investors a convertible note can be a good tool for a company to raise funds to help bridge to a larger equity offering to occur at a later date for companies that are early with respect to customer and revenue traction it can be difficult to set the valuation of the business a convertible note does not require a valuation to be set offering a simpler transaction structure to close a smaller amount of funding the company should then be able to more quickly close and deploy the capital to

right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose

results and you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions times or days of the week and even demographics what determines my ad position bing ads is a payperclick ppc advertising system you bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads we auction those spaces you are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want so if you bid on the keyword shoe you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on shoe you determine how much you are willing to bid your ad position is based on several things including how closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched relevance how your bid compares to other bids in the bing ads auction how strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked clickthrough rate the stronger you are in these areas the better your chances of winning the top ad
