forth in section c and that if implemented the substitutions would not raise any of the concerns that congress intended to address when the  act was amended to include this provision applicants state that each substitution protects the contract owners who have contract value allocated to an existing portfolio by providing replacement portfolios with substantially similar investment objectives

substitutions are not of the type that section  was designed to prevent because they will not result in costly forced redemption nor will they affect other aspects of the contracts in addition the proposed substitutions will not adversely affect any features or riders under the contracts because none of the features or riders have any investment restrictions accordingly no contract owner will

investment objectives principal investment strategies and principle risks as described in their prospectuses that are substantially similar to the corresponding existing portfolios to make those replacement portfolios appropriate candidates as substitutes  information for each existing portfolio and replacement portfolio including investment objectives principal investment strategies principal risks and comparative performance history can be found in the application  applicants state that in selecting the replacement portfolios commonwealth sought to simplify fund lineups while reducing costs and maintaining a highquality menu of investment options that would offer a similar diversity of investment options after the proposed substitutions as is currently available under the contracts contract owners with contract value allocated to the subaccounts of the existing portfolios will have lower or equal net annual operating expenses immediately after the proposed substitutions as before the proposed substitutions with respect to all of the proposed substitutions the combined management fee and rule b fees paid by the replacement portfolio are the same or lower than those of the corresponding existing portfolio the application sets forth the fees and expenses of each existing portfolio and its corresponding replacement portfolio in greater detail  applicants represent that as of the substitution date defined below the separate accounts will redeem shares of the existing portfolios for cash or inkind redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times  each substitution will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the replacement portfolios in conformity with section c of the  act and rule c thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the section  applicants the substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any contracts held by affected contract owners   the section  applicants state that because the substitutions will occur at relative net asset value and the fees and charges under the contracts will not change as a result of the substitutions the benefits offered by the guarantees under the contracts will be the same immediately before and after the substitutions the section  applicants also state that what effect the substitutions may have on the value of the benefits offered by the contract guarantees would depend among other things on the relative future performance of the existing portfolios and replacement portfolios which the section  applicants cannot predict nevertheless the section  applicants note that at the time of the substitutions the contracts will offer a comparable variety of investment options with as broad a range of riskreturn characteristics   contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed substitutions the obligations of the section  applicants and the rights of the affected contract owners under the contracts of affected contract owners will not be altered in any way commonwealth andor its affiliates will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the substitutions including legal and accounting expenses any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses no fees or charges will be assessed to the affected contract owners to effect the substitutions the proposed substitutions will not cause the contract fees and charges currently being paid by contract owners to be greater after the proposed substitution than before the proposed substitution in addition the substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected contract owners in connection with their contracts and no tax liability will arise for contract owners as a result of the substitutions  the section  applicants agree that for a period of two years following the implementation of the proposed substitution the substitution date and for those contracts with assets allocated to the existing portfolio on the substitution date commonwealth or an affiliate thereof other than the trust will reimburse on the last business day of each fiscal quarter the contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable replacement portfolio to the extent that the replacement portfolios net annual operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements for such period exceeds on an annualized basis the net annual operating expenses of the page  existing portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date of the most recently filed application commonwealth will not increase the contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the contracts for a period of at least two years following the substitution date  from the date the presubstitution notice defined below through  days following the substitution date contract owners may make at least one transfer of contract value from the subaccount investing in an existing portfolio before the substitution or the replacement portfolio after the substitution to any other available subaccount under the contract without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations further on the substitution date contract values attributable to investments in each existing portfolio will be transferred to the corresponding replacement portfolio without charge and without being subject to any transfer limitations moreover commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the contracts including limitations on the future number of transfers for a period beginning at least  days before the substitution date through at least  days following the substitution date  at least  days prior to the substitution date contract owners will be notified via prospectus supplements that the section  applicants received or expect to receive commission approval of the applicable proposed substitutions and of the anticipated substitution date the presubstitution notice presubstitution notices sent to contract owners will be filed with the commission pursuant to rule  under the  act the presubstitution notice will advise contract owners that from the date of the presubstitution notice through the date  days after the substitutions contract owners may make at least one transfer of contract value from the subaccounts investing in the existing portfolios before the substitutions or the replacement portfolios after the substitutions to any other available subaccount without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations among other information the notice will inform affected contract owners that that except as described in the disruptive transfers or market timing provisions of the relevant prospectus commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the contracts to impose restrictions on transfers among the subaccounts under the contracts including limitations on the future number of transfers through at least  days after the substitution date additionally all affected contract owners will be sent prospectuses of the applicable replacement portfolios at least  days before the substitution date  in addition to the supplements distributed to the contract owners within five business days after the substitution date contract owners whose assets are allocated to a replacement portfolio as part of the proposed substitutions will be sent a written notice each a confirmation informing them that the substitutions were carried out as previously notified the confirmation also will restate the information set forth in the presubstitution notice the confirmation will also reflect the values of the contract owners positions in the existing portfolio before the substitution and the replacement portfolio after the substitution legal analysis  the section  applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section c of the  act approving the proposed substitutions section c of the  act prohibits any depositor or trustee of a unit investment trust that invests exclusively in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without the approval of the commission section c provides that such approval shall be granted by order from the commission if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of the  act  the section  applicants submit that the substitutions meet the standards set forth in section c and that if implemented the substitutions would not raise any of the concerns that congress intended to address when the  act was amended to include this provision applicants state that each substitution protects the contract owners who have contract value allocated to an existing portfolio by providing replacement portfolios with substantially similar investment objectives strategies and risks and providing contract owners with investment options that would have total and net annual operating expense ratios that are lower than or equal to their corresponding investment options before the substitutions  commonwealth has reserved the right under the contracts to substitute shares of another underlying fund for one of the current funds offered as an investment option under the contracts the contracts and the contracts prospectuses disclose this right  the section  applicants submit that the ultimate effect of the proposed substitutions will be to streamline and simplify the investment lineups that are available to contract owners while reducing expenses and continuing to provide contract owners with a wide array of investment options the section  applicants state that the proposed substitutions will not reduce in any manner the nature or quality of the available investment options and the proposed substitutions also will permit commonwealth to present information to its contract owners in a simpler and more concise manner the section  applicants also state it is anticipated that after the proposed substitutions contract owners will be provided with disclosure documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available investment options under the contracts the section  applicants also assert that the proposed substitutions are not of the type that section  was designed to prevent because they will not result in costly forced redemption nor will they affect other aspects of the contracts in addition the proposed substitutions will not adversely affect any features or riders under the contracts because none of the features or riders have any investment restrictions accordingly no contract owner will involuntarily lose his or her features or riders as a result of any proposed substitution moreover the section  applicants will offer contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty other than those necessary to implement policies and procedures designed to detect and deter disruptive transfer and other market timing activity that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date of the presubstitution notice which supplement will be delivered to the contract owners at least thirty  days before the substitution date and ending no earlier than thirty  days after the substitution date the proposed substitutions are also unlike the type of substitution that section c was designed to prevent in that the substitutions have no impact on other aspects of the contracts  the section  applicants request an order under section b exempting them from the provisions of section a to the extent necessary to permit the section  applicants to carry out some or all of the proposed substitutions the section  page  applicants state that because the proposed substitutions may be effected in whole or in part by means of inkind redemptions and purchases the proposed substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated persons  section a of the  act in relevant part prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such person acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company section a of the  act generally prohibits the persons described above acting as principals from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company  the section  applicants state that the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the existing portfolios to the separate accounts immediately thereafter the separate accounts would purchase shares of the replacement portfolios with the portfolio securities received from the existing portfolios accordingly the section  applicants provide that to the extent commonwealth and the existing portfolios and commonwealth and the replacement portfolios are deemed to be affiliated persons of one another under section a or section a of the  act it is conceivable that this aspect of the proposed substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by section a accordingly the section  applicants have determined to seek relief from section a  the section  applicants submit that the terms of the proposed inkind purchases of shares of the replacement portfolios by the separate accounts including the consideration to be paid and received as described in the application are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the section  applicants submit that the terms of the proposed inkind transactions including the considered to be paid to each existing portfolio and received by each replacement portfolio involved are reasonable fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in rule a under the  act the proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of section c of the  act and rule c thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the section  applicants the substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any contract held by the affected contract owners the substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected contract owners in connection with their contracts and no tax liability will arise for contract owners as a result of the substitutions the fees and charges under the contracts will not increase because of the substitutions even though the separate accounts commonwealth and the trust may not rely on rule a  the section

prospectuses that are substantially similar to the corresponding existing portfolios to make those replacement portfolios appropriate candidates as substitutes  information for each existing portfolio and replacement portfolio including investment objectives principal investment strategies principal risks and comparative performance history can be found in the application  applicants state that in selecting the replacement portfolios commonwealth sought to simplify fund lineups while reducing costs and maintaining a highquality menu of investment options that would offer a similar diversity of investment options after the proposed substitutions as is currently available under the contracts contract owners with contract value allocated to the subaccounts of the existing portfolios will have lower or equal net annual operating expenses immediately after the proposed substitutions as before the proposed substitutions with respect to all of the proposed substitutions the combined management fee and rule b fees paid by the replacement portfolio are the same or lower than those of the corresponding existing portfolio the application sets forth the fees and expenses of each existing portfolio and its corresponding replacement portfolio in greater detail  applicants represent that as of the substitution date defined below the separate accounts will redeem shares of the existing portfolios for cash or inkind redemption requests and purchase orders will be placed simultaneously so that contract values will remain fully invested at all times  each substitution will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the replacement portfolios in conformity with section c of the  act and rule c thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the section  applicants the substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any contracts held by affected contract owners  contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed substitutions the obligations of the section  applicants and the rights of the affected contract owners under the contracts of affected contract owners will not be altered in any way commonwealth andor its affiliates will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the substitutions including legal and accounting expenses any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses no fees or charges will be assessed to the affected contract owners to effect the substitutions the proposed substitutions will not cause the contract fees and charges currently being paid by contract owners to be greater after the proposed substitution than before the proposed substitution in addition the substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected contract owners in connection with their contracts and no tax liability will arise for contract owners as a result of the substitutions  the section  applicants agree that for a period of two years following the implementation of the proposed substitution the “substitution date” and for those contracts with assets allocated to the existing portfolio on the substitution date commonwealth or an affiliate thereof other than the trust will reimburse on the last business day of each fiscal quarter the contract owners whose subaccounts invest in the applicable replacement portfolio to the extent that the replacement portfolios net annual operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements for such period exceeds on an annualized basis the net annual operating expenses of the start printed page existing portfolio for the most recent fiscal year preceding the date of the most recently filed application commonwealth will not increase the contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of the contracts for a period of at least two years following the substitution date  from the date the presubstitution notice defined below through  days following the substitution date contract owners may make at least one transfer of contract value from the subaccount investing in an existing portfolio before the substitution or the replacement portfolio after the substitution to any other available subaccount under the contract without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations further on the substitution date contract values attributable to investments in each existing portfolio will be transferred to the corresponding replacement portfolio without charge and without being subject to any transfer limitations moreover commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the contracts including limitations on the future number of transfers for a period beginning at least  days before the substitution date through at least  days following the substitution date  at least  days prior to the substitution date contract owners will be notified via prospectus supplements that the section  applicants received or expect to receive commission approval of the applicable proposed substitutions and of the anticipated substitution date the “presubstitution notice” presubstitution notices sent to contract owners will be filed with the commission pursuant to rule  under the  act the presubstitution notice will advise contract owners that from the date of the presubstitution notice through the date  days after the substitutions contract owners may make at least one transfer of contract value from the subaccounts investing in the existing portfolios before the substitutions or the replacement portfolios after the substitutions to any other available subaccount without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations among other information the notice will inform affected contract owners that that except as described in the disruptive transfers or market timing provisions of the relevant prospectus commonwealth will not exercise any rights reserved under the contracts to impose restrictions on transfers among the subaccounts under the contracts including limitations on the future number of transfers through at least  days after the substitution date additionally all affected contract owners will be sent prospectuses of the applicable replacement portfolios at least  days before the substitution date  in addition to the supplements distributed to the contract owners within five business days after the substitution date contract owners whose assets are allocated to a replacement portfolio as part of the proposed substitutions will be sent a written notice each a “confirmation” informing them that the substitutions were carried out as previously notified the confirmation also will restate the information set forth in the presubstitution notice the confirmation will also reflect the values of the contract owners positions in the existing portfolio before the substitution and the replacement portfolio after the substitution legal analysis  the section  applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section c of the  act approving the proposed substitutions section c of the  act prohibits any depositor or trustee of a unit investment trust that invests exclusively in the securities of a single issuer from substituting the securities of another issuer without the approval of the commission section c provides that such approval shall be granted by order from the commission if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes of the  act  the section  applicants submit that the substitutions meet the standards set forth in section c and that if implemented the substitutions would not raise any of the concerns that congress intended to address when the  act was amended to include this provision applicants state that each substitution protects the contract owners who have contract value allocated to an existing portfolio by providing replacement portfolios with substantially similar investment objectives strategies and risks and providing contract owners with investment options that would have total and net annual operating expense ratios that are lower than or equal to their corresponding investment options before the substitutions  commonwealth has reserved the right under the contracts to substitute shares of another underlying fund for one of the current funds offered as an investment option under the contracts the contracts and the contracts prospectuses disclose this right  the section  applicants submit that the ultimate effect of the proposed substitutions will be to streamline and simplify the investment lineups that are available to contract owners while reducing expenses and continuing to provide contract owners with a wide array of investment options the section  applicants state that the proposed substitutions will not reduce in any manner the nature or quality of the available investment options and the proposed substitutions also will permit commonwealth to present information to its contract owners in a simpler and more concise manner the section  applicants also state it is anticipated that after the proposed substitutions contract owners will be provided with disclosure documents that contain a simpler presentation of the available investment options under the contracts the section  applicants also assert that the proposed substitutions are not of the type that section  was designed to prevent because they will not result in costly forced redemption nor will they affect other aspects of the contracts in addition the proposed substitutions will not adversely affect any features or riders under the contracts because none of the features or riders have any investment restrictions accordingly no contract owner will involuntarily lose his or her features or riders as a result of any proposed substitution moreover the section  applicants will offer contract owners the opportunity to transfer amounts out of the affected subaccounts without any cost or other penalty other than those necessary to implement policies and procedures designed to detect and deter disruptive transfer and other “market timing” activity that may otherwise have been imposed for a period beginning on the date of the presubstitution notice which supplement will be delivered to the contract owners at least thirty  days before the substitution date and ending no earlier than thirty  days after the substitution date the proposed substitutions are also unlike the type of substitution that section c was designed to prevent in that the substitutions have no impact on other aspects of the contracts  the section  applicants request an order under section b exempting them from the provisions of section a to the extent necessary to permit the section  applicants to carry out some or all of the proposed substitutions the section  start printed page applicants state that because the proposed substitutions may be effected in whole or in part by means of inkind redemptions and purchases the proposed substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated persons  section a of the  act in relevant part prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such person acting as principal from knowingly selling any security or other property to that company section a of the  act generally prohibits the persons described above acting as principals from knowingly purchasing any security or other property from the registered investment company  the section  applicants state that the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the existing portfolios to the separate accounts immediately thereafter the separate accounts would purchase shares of the replacement portfolios with the portfolio securities received from the existing portfolios accordingly the section  applicants provide that to the extent commonwealth and the existing portfolios and commonwealth and the replacement portfolios are deemed to be affiliated persons of one another under section a or section a of the  act it is conceivable that this aspect of the proposed substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by section a accordingly the section  applicants have determined to seek relief from section a  the section  applicants submit that the terms of the proposed inkind purchases of shares of the replacement portfolios by the separate accounts including the consideration to be paid and received as described in the application are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the section  applicants submit that the terms of the proposed inkind transactions including the considered to be paid to each existing portfolio and received by each replacement portfolio involved are reasonable fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in rule a under the  act the proposed transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of section c of the  act and rule c thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the section  applicants the substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any contract held by the affected contract owners the substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected contract owners in connection with their contracts and no tax liability will arise for contract owners as a result of the substitutions the fees and charges under the contracts will not increase because of the substitutions even though the separate accounts commonwealth and the trust may not rely on rule a the section  applicants believe that the rules conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons  the section  applicants also submit that the proposed inkind purchases by the separate accounts are consistent with the policies of the trust and the replacement portfolios as provided in the trusts registration statement and reports filed under the  act finally the section  applicants submit that the proposed substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the  act applicants conditions the section  applicants and global atlantic as applicable agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  the substitutions will not be effected unless commonwealth determines that i the contracts allow the substitution of shares of registered openend investment companies in the manner contemplated by the application ii the substitutions can be consummated as described in the application under applicable insurance laws and iii any regulatory requirements in each jurisdiction where the contracts are qualified for sale have been complied with to the extent necessary to complete the substitutions  after the substitution date global atlantic will not change a subadviser add a new subadviser or otherwise rely on the manager of managers order as defined in the application or any replacement order from the commission with respect to any replacement portfolio without first obtaining shareholder approval of the change in subadviser the new subadviser or the replacement portfolios ability to rely on the manager of managers order or any replacement order from the commission  commonwealth or an affiliate thereof other than the trust will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the substitutions including legal and accounting expenses any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses no fees or charges will be assessed to the affected contract owners to effect the substitutions the proposed substitutions will not cause the contract fees and charges currently being paid by contract owners to be greater after the proposed substitution than before the proposed substitution  the substitutions will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the replacement portfolios in conformity with section c of the  act and rule c thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the section  applicants the substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any contracts held by affected contract owners  the substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected contract owners in connection with their contracts and no tax liability will arise for contract owners as a result of the substitutions  the obligations of the section  applicants and the rights of the affected contract owners under the contracts of affected contract owners will not be altered in any way  affected contract owners will be permitted to make at least one transfer of contract value from the subaccount investing in the existing portfolio before the substitution date or the replacement portfolio after the substitution date to any other available investment option under the contract without charge for a period beginning at least  days before the substitution date through at least  days following the substitution date except as described in any market timingshortterm trading provisions of the relevant prospectus the section  applicants will not exercise any rights reserved under the contracts to impose restrictions on transfers between the subaccounts under the contracts including limitations on the future number of transfers for a period beginning at least  days before the substitution date through at least  days following the substitution date  all affected contract owners will be notified at least  days before the substitution date about i the intended substitution of existing portfolios with the replacement portfolios ii the intended substitution date and iii information with respect to transfers as set forth in condition  start printed page above in addition the section  applicants will also deliver to affected contract owners at least thirty days before the substitution date a prospectus for each applicable replacement portfolio  the section  applicants will deliver to each affected contract owner within five business days of the substitution date a written confirmation which will include i a confirmation that the substitutions were carried out as previously notified ii a restatement of the

brief overview of the more significant aspects of the policy the remainder of this prospectus offers a more complete presentation of the topics presented here and will help you better understand the product however the policy together with its attached application constitutes the entire agreement between you and the company the policy is a life insurance contract with death benefits policy value and other features traditionally associated with life insurance the policy is variable because the policy value will increase or decrease depending on the investment experience of the subaccounts of the separate account under some circumstances the death benefit may vary with the investment experience of the subaccounts unlike traditional insurance policies the policy has no fixed schedule for payments within limits you may make payments of any amount and frequency while you may establish a schedule of payments planned payments the policy will not necessarily lapse if you fail to make planned payments and making planned payments will not guarantee that the policy will remain in force what are the policys benefits while the policy is in force it will provide  life insurance coverage on the named insured  policy value  surrender rights and partial withdrawal rights  loan privileges other benefits previously available through the policy included  waiver of premium rider  this rider

the separate account and b provides a guaranteed net death benefit what are the policys risks there are certain risks associated with the policy  there is no guaranteed minimum policy value the value of a policy will vary up or down to reflect the investment experience of allocations to the subaccounts and the fixed rates of interest earned by allocations to the general account the policy value will also be adjusted for other factors including the amount of charges imposed the policy will terminate if policy value is insufficient to cover certain monthly charges plus loan interest accrued or if outstanding loans exceed the policy value less surrender charges the policies are unsuitable as shortterm savings vehicles  the policy value may decrease to the point where the policy will lapse

is not designed for use by individuals professional market timing organizations or other entities that engage in shortterm trading frequent transfers programmed transfers or transfers that are large in relation to the total assets of an underlying fund collectively disruptive trading these activities may require the underlying fund to maintain undesirable large cash positions or frequently buy or sell portfolio securities such transfers may dilute the value of the underlying funds shares interfere with the efficient management of the underlying funds portfolio and increase brokerage and administrative costs of the underlying funds as a result disruptive trading may adversely affect an underlying funds ability to invest effectively in accordance with its investment objectives and policies and may harm other policy owners in order to protect our policy owners and the underlying funds from potentially harmful trading activity we utilize certain policies and procedures that are designed to detect and prevent disruptive trading among the underlying funds the disruptive trading procedures our disruptive trading procedures consider certain factors in order to identify disruptive trading activity including the following  the number of transfers made over a period of time  the length of time between transfers  whether the transfers follow a pattern that appears to be designed to take advantage of short term market fluctuations particularly within certain underlying funds  the dollar amounts requested for transfers and  whether the transfers are part of a group of transfers made by a third party on behalf of several individual policy owners and  the investment objectives andor size of the underlying funds we may increase our monitoring of policy owners who engage in what we perceive to be disruptive trading including investigating the transfer patterns within multiple contracts owned by the same policy owners we will also investigate any patterns of disruptive trading identified by the underlying funds that may not have been captured by our disruptive trading procedures our disruptive trading procedures may vary from subaccount to subaccount the disruptive trading procedures limit the number of transfers a policy owner may make during a given period limit the number of times a policy owner may transfer into particular funds during a given period and place restrictions as to the time or means of transfers for example transfer instructions are required by a certain daily time cutoff among other things in certain states the disruptive trading procedures apply dollar or percentage limitations rather than restrictions on the number of transfers subject to the terms of the policy the company reserves the right to impose without prior notice additional or alternate restrictions on allocations and transfers that it determines in its sole discretion will disadvantage or potentially hurt the rights or interests of other policy owners or other holders of the underlying funds in addition some of the underlying funds have reserved the right to temporarily or permanently refuse payments or transfer requests from the company if in the

procedures consistently without special arrangement waiver or exception however the companys ability to detect and deter disruptive trading and to consistently apply the disruptive trading procedures may be limited by operational systems and technological limitations policy owners seeking to engage in such transfer activities may employ a variety of strategies to avoid detection because identifying disruptive trading involves judgments that are inherently subjective the company cannot provide assurances that its disruptive trading procedures will detect every policy owner who engages in disruptive trading in addition the terms of some contracts previously issued by the company historical practices or actions litigation or certain regulatory restrictions may limit the companys ability to apply transfer or other restrictions if we are unable to detect disruptive trading or are unable to restrict disruptive trading because of contract provisions you may experience dilution in the value of your underlying fund shares there may be increased brokerage and administrative costs within the underlying funds which may result in lower longterm returns for your investments additionally because other insurance companies andor retirement plans may invest in the underlying funds we cannot guarantee that the underlying funds will not suffer harm from disruptive trading within the variable contracts issued by other insurance companies or among investment options available to retirement plan participants under rules recently adopted by the securities and exchange commission effective april   we will be required to  enter into a written agreement with each underlying fund or its principal underwriter that will obligate us to provide to the underlying fund

the general account plus  the value of the accumulation units in the subaccounts the policy value is used in determining the surrender value the policy value less any debt and applicable surrender charges there is no guaranteed minimum policy value because the policy value on any date depends upon a number of variables it cannot be predetermined the policy value and the surrender value will reflect the frequency and amount of net premiums paid interest credited to accumulations in the general account the investment performance of the chosen subaccounts any partial withdrawals any loans any loan repayments any loan interest paid or credited and any charges assessed in connection with the policy calculation of policy value the policy value is determined first on the date of issue and thereafter on each valuation date on the date of issue the policy value will be the net premiums received plus any interest earned during the underwriting period when premiums are held in the general account before being transferred to the separate account less any monthly deductions due on each valuation date after the date of issue the policy value will be  the aggregate of the values in each of the subaccounts on the valuation date determined for each subaccount by multiplying the value of an accumulation unit in that subaccount on that date by the number of such accumulations units allocated to the policy plus  the value in the general account including any amounts transferred to the general account as collateral with respect to a loan thus the policy value is determined by multiplying the number of accumulation units in each subaccount by the value of the applicable accumulation units on the particular valuation date adding the products and adding the amount of the accumulations in the general account if any the accumulation unit each net premium is allocated to the subaccounts selected by you allocations to the subaccounts are credited to the policy in the form

company is deducting the monthly deduction or other charges from a subaccount each such deduction will result in cancellation of a number of accumulation units equal in value to the amount deducted the dollar value of an accumulation unit of each subaccount varies from valuation date to valuation date based on the investment experience of that subaccount that experience in turn will reflect the investment performance expenses and charges of the respective underlying fund the value of an accumulation unit was set at  on the first valuation date for each subaccount the dollar value of an accumulation unit on a given valuation date is determined by multiplying the dollar value of the corresponding accumulation unit as of the immediately preceding valuation date by the appropriate net investment factor valuation dates currently occur on each day on which the new york stock exchange is open for trading and on such other days other than a day during which no payment partial withdrawal or surrender of a policy is received when there is a sufficient degree of trading in an underlying funds securities such that the current net asset value of the subaccounts may be affected materially net investment factor the net investment factor measures the investment performance of a subaccount of the separate account during the valuation period just ended the net investment factor for each subaccount is equal to  plus the number arrived at by dividing a by b and subtracting c and d from the result where a is the investment income of that subaccount for the valuation period plus capital gains realized or unrealized credited during the valuation period minus capital losses realized or unrealized charged during the valuation period adjusted for provisions made for taxes if any b is the value of that subaccounts assets at the beginning of the valuation period c is a charge for each day in the valuation period equal on an annual basis to  of the daily net asset value of that subaccount for mortality and expense risks this charge may be increased or decreased by the company but may not exceed  and d is the separate account administrative charge for each day in the valuation period equal on an annual basis to  of the daily net asset value of that subaccount the administrative charge may be increased or decreased by the company but may not exceed  this charge is

throughout the policys duration other charges apply only if you choose options under the policy what charges are deducted from payments currently a deduction of  of premiums for state and local premium taxes and federal taxes imposed for deferred acquisition costs dac taxes is made from each premium payment the premium payment less the tax expense charge equals the net premium the total charge is a combined state and local premium tax deduction of  of premiums and a dac tax deduction of  of premiums while the premium tax is deducted from each premium payment some jurisdictions may not impose premium taxes premium taxes vary from state to state ranging from zero to  and the  rate attributable to premiums for state and local premium taxes approximates the average expenses to commonwealth annuity associated with the premium taxes the charge may be higher or lower than the actual premium tax imposed by the applicable jurisdiction however commonwealth annuity does not expect to make a profit from this charge the  rate attributable to premiums for dac taxes approximates the companys expenses in paying federal taxes for deferred acquisition costs associated with the policy the company reserves the right to increase or decrease the dac tax charge to reflect changes in the companys expenses for premium taxes and dac taxes what is the monthly deduction prior to the final premium payment date a monthly deduction from the policy value will be made to cover a charge for the cost of insurance a charge for any optional insurance benefits added by rider and a monthly administrative charge the cost of insurance charge and the monthly administrative charge are discussed below the monthly deduction on or following the effective date of a requested increase in the face amount also will include a  administrative charge for the increase prior to the final premium payment date the monthly deduction will be deducted as of each monthly payment date commencing with the date of issue of the policy it will be allocated to one subaccount according to your instructions or if no allocation is specified the company will make a prorata allocation if the subaccount you specify does not have sufficient funds to cover the monthly deduction the company will deduct the charge for that month as if no specification were made if however on subsequent monthly payment dates there is sufficient policy value in the subaccount you specified the monthly deduction will be deducted from that subaccount no monthly deductions will be made on or after the final premium payment date cost of insurance this charge is designed to compensate the company for the anticipated cost of providing death proceeds to beneficiaries of those insureds who die prior to the final premium payment date the cost of insurance is determined on a monthly basis and is determined separately for the initial face amount for each subsequent increase in the face amount and for riders because the cost of insurance depends upon a number of variables it can vary from month to month  paposth page of tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust th calculation of the charge  if you select sum insured option  the monthly cost of insurance charge for the initial face amount generally will equal the applicable cost of insurance rate multiplied by the initial face amount if you select sum insured option  however the applicable cost of insurance rate will be multiplied by the initial face amount less the policy value minus charges for rider benefits at the beginning of the policy month thus the cost of insurance charge may be greater for policyowners who have selected sum insured option  than for those who have selected sum insured option  assuming the same face amount in each case and assuming that the guideline minimum sum insured is not in effect in other words since the sum insured under option  remains constant while the sum insured under option  varies with the policy value any policy value increases will reduce the insurance charge under option  but not under option  increases  if you select sum insured option  the monthly insurance charge for each increase in face amount other than an increase caused by a change in sum insured option will be equal to the cost of insurance rate applicable to that increase multiplied by the increase in the face amount if you select sum insured option  the applicable cost of insurance rate will be multiplied by the increase in the face amount reduced by any policy value minus rider charges in excess of the initial face amount at the beginning of the policy month effect of the guideline minimum sum insured if the guideline minimum sum insured is in effect under either option a monthly cost of insurance charge also will be calculated for that additional portion of the sum insured that is required to comply with the guideline rules this charge will be calculated by  multiplying the cost of insurance rate applicable to the initial face amount times the guideline minimum sum insured policy value times the applicable percentage minus  the greater of the face amount or the policy value if you selected sum insured option  or  the face amount plus the policy value if you selected sum insured option  when the guideline minimum sum insured is in effect the cost of insurance charge for the initial face amount and for any increases will be calculated as set forth above the monthly cost of insurance charge also will be adjusted for any decreases in the face amount cost of insurance rates cost of insurance rates are based on male female or a blended unisex rate table age and premium class of the insured the effective date of an increase or date of rider as applicable the amount of premiums paid less debt any partial withdrawals and withdrawal charges risk classification and the incentive funding discount if applicable for those policies issued on a unisex basis in certain states or in certain cases sexdistinct rates do not apply the cost of insurance rates are determined at the beginning of each policy year for the initial face amount the cost of insurance rates for an increase in the face amount or rider are determined annually on the anniversary of the effective date of each increase or rider the cost of insurance rates generally increase as the insureds age increases the actual monthly cost of insurance rates will be based on the companys expectations as to future mortality experience they will not however be greater than the guaranteed cost of insurance rates set forth in the policy these guaranteed rates are based on the  commissioners standard ordinary mortality tables smoker or nonsmoker mortality table b for unisex policies and the insureds sex and age the tables used for this

the company currently places insureds into preferred premium classes standard premium classes and substandard premium classes in an otherwise identical policy an insured in the preferred premium class will have a lower cost of insurance than an insured in a standard premium class who in turn will have a lower cost of insurance than an insured in a substandard premium class with a higher mortality risk premium classes also are divided into two categories smokers and nonsmokers nonsmoking insureds will incur lower cost of insurance rates than insureds who are classified as smokers but who are otherwise in the same premium class any insured with an age at issuance under  will be classified initially as regular or substandard the insured then will be classified as a smoker at age  unless the insured provides satisfactory evidence that the insured is a nonsmoker the company will provide notice to you of the opportunity for the insured to be classified as a nonsmoker when the insured reaches age  the cost of insurance rate is determined separately for the initial face amount and for the amount of any increase in the face amount for each increase in the face amount you request at a time when the insured is in a less favorable premium class than previously a correspondingly higher cost of insurance rate will apply only to that portion of the insurance amount at risk for the increase for the initial face amount and any prior increases the company will use the premium class previously applicable on the other hand if the insureds premium class improves on an increase the lower cost of insurance rate generally will apply to the entire insurance amount at risk monthly administrative charge prior to the final premium payment date a monthly administrative charge of  per month will be deducted from the policy value this charge will be used to compensate the company for expenses incurred in the administration of the policy and will compensate the company for firstyear underwriting and other startup expenses incurred in connection with the policy these expenses include the cost of processing applications conducting medical examinations determining insurability and the insureds premium class and establishing policy records the company does not expect to derive a profit from these charges what charges are made against or reflected in the assets of the separate account the company assesses each subaccount with a charge for mortality and expense risks assumed by the company and a charge for administrative expenses of the separate account mortality and expense risk charge the company currently makes a charge on an annual basis of  of the daily net asset value in each subaccount this charge is for the mortality risk and expense risk which the company assumes in relation to the variable portion of the policy the total charges may be increased or decreased by the board of directors of the company once each year subject to compliance with applicable state and federal requirements but it may not exceed  on an annual basis the mortality risk assumed by the company is that insureds may live for a shorter time than anticipated and that the company therefore will pay an aggregate amount of death proceeds greater than anticipated the expense risk assumed is that the expenses incurred in issuing and administering the policy will exceed the amounts realized from the administrative charges provided in the policy if the charge for mortality and expense risks is not sufficient to cover actual mortality experience and expenses the company will absorb the losses if costs are less than the amounts provided the difference will be a profit to the company to the extent this charge results in a current profit to the company such profit will be

no change in your policy value as a result of the conversion but the number of your units and the corresponding unit values will change fund expenses because the subaccounts purchase shares of the funds the value of the accumulation units of the subaccounts will reflect the investment advisory fee and other expenses incurred by the funds the prospectuses and statements of additional information of the funds contain additional information concerning such fees and expenses currently no charges are made against the subaccounts for federal or state income taxes should the company determine that taxes will be imposed the company may make deductions from the subaccount to pay such taxes see federal tax considerations the imposition of such taxes would result in a reduction of the policy value in the subaccounts how is the surrender charge calculated the policy provides for a contingent surrender charge a separate surrender charge is calculated upon the issuance of the policy and for each increase in the face amount a surrender charge may be deducted if you request a full surrender of the policy or a decrease in the face amount the surrender charge is comprised of a contingent deferred administrative charge and a contingent deferred sales charge the contingent deferred administrative charge compensates the company for expenses incurred in administering the policy the contingent deferred sales charge compensates the company for expenses relating to the distribution of the policy including agents commissions advertising and the printing of the prospectus and sales literature the duration of the surrender charge is  years from the date of issue or from the effective date of any increase in the face amount for issue ages  through  grading down to  years for issue ages  and above the maximum surrender charge calculated upon issuance of the policy is equal to the sum of a plus b where a is a deferred administrative charge equal to  per thousand dollars of the initial face

in the maximum surrender charge will reduce the deferred sales charge and the deferred administrative charge proportionately in accordance with limitations under state insurance regulations the amount of the surrender charge will not exceed a specified amount per  of increase as is true for the initial face amount a is a deferred administrative charge and b is a deferred sales charge the maximum surrender charge for the increase continues in a level amount for  policy months and reduces by  or more per month depending on age thereafter maximum surrender charge during first two policy years  if you surrender the policy during the first two policy years following the date of issue before making premium payments associated with the initial face amount which are at least equal to one guideline annual premium the deferred administrative charge will be  per thousand dollars of the initial face amount as described above but the deferred sales charge will not exceed  of premiums received up to one guideline annual premium plus  of premiums received in excess of one guideline annual premium but less than the maximum number of guideline annual premiums subject to the deferred sales charge separate surrender charge for each face amount increase  a separate surrender charge will apply to and is calculated for each increase in the face amount the surrender charge for the

time of increase from  for ages  through  to  for age  reduced charge during first two years following increase  during the first two policy years following an increase in the face amount before making premium payments associated with the increase in the face amount which are at least equal to one guideline annual premium the deferred administrative charge will be  per thousand dollars of the

associated with the increase up to one guideline annual premium for the increase plus  of premiums associated with the increase in excess of one guideline annual premium but less than the maximum number of guideline annual premiums for the increase subject to the deferred sales charge see how is the surrender charge calculated the premiums associated with the increase are determined as described below additional premium payments may not be required to fund a requested increase in the face amount therefore a special rule which is based on relative guideline annual premium payments applies to allocate a portion of the existing policy value to the increase and to allocate subsequent premium payments between the initial policy and the increase for example suppose the guideline annual premium is equal to  before an increase and is equal to  as a result of the increase the policy value on the effective date of the increase would be allocated   to the initial face amount and  to the increase all future premiums also would be allocated  to the initial face amount and  to the increase thus existing policy value associated with the increase will equal the portion of the policy value allocated to the increase on the effective date of the increase before any deductions are made premiums associated with the increase will equal the portion of the premium payments actually made on or after the effective date of the increase which are allocated to the increase see the statement of additional information for examples illustrating the calculation of the maximum surrender charge for the initial face amount and for any increases as well as for the surrender charge based on actual premiums paid or associated with any increases

amount and multiplying the result by the surrender charge if more than one surrender charge is in effect ie pursuant to one or more increases in the face amount of a policy the surrender charge will be applied in the following order  the most recent increase  the next most recent increases successively and  the initial face amount where a decrease causes a partial reduction in an increase or in the initial face amount a proportionate share of the surrender charge for that increase or for the initial face amount will be deducted what charges apply to a partial withdrawal partial withdrawals of surrender value may be made after the first policy year the minimum withdrawal is  under option  the face amount is reduced by the amount of the partial withdrawal and a partial withdrawal will not be allowed if it would reduce the face amount below  a transaction charge which is the smaller of  of the amount withdrawn or  will be assessed on each partial withdrawal to reimburse the company for the cost of processing the withdrawal the company does not expect to make a profit on this charge the transaction fee applies to all partial withdrawals including a withdrawal without a surrender charge a partial withdrawal charge also may be deducted from the policy value for each partial withdrawal you may withdraw an amount equal to  of the policy value on the date the written withdrawal request is received by the company less the total of any prior withdrawals in that policy year which were not subject to the partial withdrawal charge without incurring a partial withdrawal charge any partial withdrawal in excess of this amount excess withdrawal will be subject to the partial withdrawal charge the partial withdrawal charge is equal to  of the excess withdrawal up to the amount of the surrender charges on the date of withdrawal this right is not cumulative from policy year to policy year for example if only  of policy value were withdrawn in policy year two the amount you could withdraw in subsequent policy years would not be increased by the amount you did not withdraw in the second policy year the policys outstanding surrender charge will be reduced by the amount of the

time legislation is proposed which if passed could significantly adversely and possibly retroactively affect the taxation of the policy no representation is made regarding the likelihood of continuation of current federal income tax laws or of current interpretations by the irs moreover no attempt has been made to consider any applicable state or other tax laws it should be recognized that the following summary of federal income tax aspects of amounts received under the policy is not exhaustive does not purport to cover all situations and is not intended as tax advice specifically the discussion below does not address certain tax provisions that may be applicable if the policyowner is a corporation or the trustee of an employee benefit plan a qualified tax adviser always should be consulted with regard to the application of law to individual circumstances how are the company and the separate account taxed the company is taxed as a life insurance company under subchapter l of the code and files a consolidated tax return with its parent and affiliates the company does not expect to incur any income tax upon the earnings or realized capital gains attributable to the separate account based on this no charge is made for federal income taxes which may be attributable to the separate account periodically the company will review the question of a charge to the separate account for federal income taxes such a charge may be made in future years for any federal income taxes incurred by the company this might become necessary if the tax treatment of the company ultimately is determined to be other than what the company believes it to be if there are changes made in the federal income tax treatment of variable life insurance at the company level or if there is a change in the companys tax status any such charge would be designed to cover the federal income taxes attributable to the investment results of the separate account under current laws the company also may incur state and local taxes in addition to premium taxes in several states at present these taxes are not significant if there is a material change in applicable state or local tax laws charges may be made for such taxes paid or reserves for such taxes attributable to the separate account how are the policies taxed the company believes that the policy described in this prospectus will be considered a

the insurance amount at risk if a policy qualifies as life insurance under section  of the code  the death proceeds are excludable from the gross income of the beneficiary and  any increase in the policy value is not taxable until received by the policyowner or the policyowners designee however if a policy fails to qualify as life insurance under section  the policy will not provide most of the

issued any guidance on whether loans with the attributes of a preferred loan should be treated differently than a nonpreferred loan this lack of specific guidance makes the tax treatment of preferred

amounts contributed by salary reduction but not the earnings on such amounts even though a distribution may be permitted under these rules eg for hardship or after separation from service it may

announced that the regulations do not provide guidance concerning circumstances in which investor control of the separate account investments may cause an investor to be treated as the owner of the separate account the treasury department also stated that future guidance would be issued regarding the extent that owners could direct subaccount investments without being treated as owners of the underlying assets of the separate account your rights under this policy are different than those described by the irs in rulings in which it found that contract owners were not owners of separate account assets for example you have the choice to allocate premiums and policy values among more investment options in addition you may be able to transfer among investment options more frequently than in such rulings these differences could result in you being treated as the owner of the separate account if this occurs income and gain from the separate account assets would be includible in your gross income the company does not know what standards will be set forth in any regulations or rulings which the treasury department may issue it is possible that future standards announced by the

that pursuant to their trading strategy of transferring money from money market accounts to international equity accounts and back again to money market accounts they have been able to consistently obtain relatively risk free returns of between  to  annually plaintiffs claim that they would have been able to continue to maintain such returns on the account values of their annuity contracts over

february   the court issued a ruling which as confirmed by the court at a status conference on april   precludes plaintiffs from claiming any damages accruing beyond july   thg on behalf of the company continues to vigorously defend this matter and regards plaintiffs claims for lost trading profits as being speculative and in any case subject to an obligation to mitigate damages further in

a policy with a  face amount will generally have a sum insured equal to  because the sum insured must be equal to or greater than  of policy value however if at any time the policy value exceeds  the sum insured will exceed the  face amount in this example each additional dollar of policy value above  will increase the sum insured by  for example a policy with a policy value of  will have a guideline minimum sum insured of   x  policy value of  will produce a guideline minimum sum insured of   x  and policy value of  will produce a guideline minimum sum insured of   x  similarly so long

insured from that point on because the policy value will be added to the new specified face amount the sum insured will vary with the policy value under option  the insurance amount at risk always will equal the face amount unless the guideline minimum sum insured is in effect the cost of insurance also may be higher or lower than it otherwise would have been without the change in sum insured option change from option  to option  if the sum insured option is changed from option  to option  the face amount will be increased to equal the sum insured which would have been payable under option  on the effective date of the change ie the face amount immediately prior to the change plus the policy value on the date of the change the amount of the sum insured will not be altered at the time of the change the change in option however will affect the determination of the sum insured from that point on since the policy value no longer will be added to the face amount in determining the sum insured the sum insured will equal the new face amount or if higher the guideline minimum sum insured the cost of insurance may be higher or lower than it otherwise would have been since any increases or decreases in policy value will reduce or increase respectively the insurance amount at risk under option  assuming a positive net investment return with respect to any amounts in the separate account changing the sum insured option from option  to option  will reduce the insurance amount at risk and therefore the cost of insurance charge for all subsequent monthly deductions compared to what such charge would have been if no such change were made a change in sum insured option may result in total premiums paid exceeding the thencurrent maximum premium limitation determined by irs
