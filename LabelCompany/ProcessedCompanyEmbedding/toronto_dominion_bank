houses the corporate offices of tdbfg td tower in vancouver td in markham ontario the origins of the torontodominion bank lie in the efforts of a group of businessmen in the province of canada west as ontario was called between  and  involved in the buying milling and marketing of grain they were determined to create a financial institution to meet their specific needs in banking insurance and commodities exchange the group submitted its first petition for the incorporation of the millers merchants and farmers bank of canada west in  to the legislature of the province of canada which rejected the request however on march   their application for a charter for the bank of toronto with an authorized capital of £ was granted in july  the bank of toronto opened its offices at  church street toronto with a staff of three and immediately began development of a provincial network of branches in  it opened its first branch outside of ontario in montreal the bank of toronto established itself as an efficient profitable but essentially conservative bank through the th century it maintained a very high reserve against its capital and enjoyed the highest share price of any bank in canada growth was very slow and deliberate with a few new branches opened in emerging regional centres core customers remained farmers merchants and processors of farm products millers brewers distillers in  a group of entrepreneurs and professionals under the leadership of james austin launched the dominion bank to join the bank of toronto in the ontario market they were dedicated to creating a new institution conducive to the general prosperity of that section of the country like the bank of toronto the dominion bank was a cautious institution selecting its customers carefully serving them well and duly prospering with them in the words of the official history it also created a network of branches and in  became the first canadian bank to have two branches in one city–toronto with the maturing of the canadian economy and the opening of northern ontario and the west in the s and s the banks became more aggressive in loans to resource industries utilities and manufacturing in  the dominion bank opened its first western branch in winnipeg and two years later the bank of toronto opened a branch in the british columbia mining town of rossland in the first decade of the twentieth century the banks rapidly expanded their branch networks in central canada and across the west to mark their rise as significant national institutions the dominion bank moved into a large new head office building at the corner of king and yonge streets in toronto in  and the toronto bank followed with another landmark head office at king and bay street in  world war i brought new challenges for the two banks when they were called upon to finance war expenditures and to support the innovation of war bonds marketed to the general public half the staff of the two banks served in the armed forces except for some contraction in the western provinces due to drought the decade following the war was one of expansion and increasing profitability due to resource development and industrial expansion both banks weathered the storm of depression in the s without great difficulty despite a decline in earnings like all canadian banks they endured criticism of their credit policies and resisted the creation of a central bank to control the money supply and advise on fiscal policy ultimately the bank of canada was established in  and by  private banks were ordered to remove their currency from circulation the coming of world war ii involved the banks once again in the marketing of war bonds and in participation in the control of foreign exchange rationing and other financial war measures approximately  staff or almost half the total entered the armed forces the bank of toronto and dominion bank emerged from the war in  stronger than ever with assets more than doubled since  with the postwar boom they became more active in business lending and in the penetration of new markets however they quickly realized that the costs of expansion and competition with much larger rivals made their objectives difficult to realize neither bank had engaged in acquisitions or mergers in order to grow but both determined that a union with a bank of equal size would place them in a much stronger position to take advantage of the opportunities of the postwar economy in  negotiations began between the bank of toronto and the dominion bank and by the end of the year an amalgamation agreement was reached in their brief to the minister of finance the banks stated it is more burdensome for a small bank to keep pace with the development of our country than for a large bank with the result that the effective growth and comparative influence of smaller banks will probably in the future decline in comparison with that of the larger bankscitation needed canadas minister of finance announced november   that he would accept the amalgamation and shareholders were asked for their approval this was forthcoming in december and on february   the bank of toronto and the dominion bank became the torontodominion bank the first years of the new bank were dedicated to the demands of amalgamating the two predecessors institutions of roughly equal size but with different strengths and unique corporate cultures the new institution combined head office functions consolidated branches and established a new regional organization an aggressive program of branch modernization and expansion extended tds presence in its traditional markets and took it into new territory in the maritime provinces and on the natural resource frontier the new bank established its identity through an active public relations campaign focused on customer service – the best in banking service the banks first slogan evolved into the highly successful the bank where people make the difference the competitive banking environment and the need for effective integration of two administrations led the bank to reassess and modernize business practices and methods through the second half of the s management streamlined procedures introduced new technology and emphasized the human resources function as the bank placed increased weight on customer service and product knowledge the banks emergence as a forwardlooking institution was highlighted by the announcement in  that it would have a new and very highprofile head office in downtown toronto the torontodominion centre designed by mies van der rohe the leading architect of the day would include the tallest building in canada it would revolutionize both the skyline of toronto and the public perception of td by the s the bank solidified its domestic base and established its credentials as a major institution it began to look beyond its traditional spheres of operation and to explore the international scene and opportunities domestic and foreign for large scale project financing it developed a network of us representative offices partnerships with global merchant banks and venture capital operations heralding a new commitment to independent and syndicated project financing in  the bank undertook the financing of the massive anvil leadzincsilver mining operation in yukon the construction of the rainbow crude oil pipeline in alberta and resource development ventures in ireland the bank offered the first debentures in canadian banking history on may   the bank act of  ushered in a period of enormous change on the canadian financial scene for the first time banks were permitted to charge more than sixpercent interest on loans encouraging a new emphasis on personal and specialized consumer loans more significantly banks could now make mortgage loans on real estate and the mortgage loan portfolio quickly gained enormous significance by the close of the s the banks customer base had become more diverse and new products and services were launched almost daily the visa card made its appearance as chargex and mutual funds were marketed for the first time in addition the options for product and service delivery were greatly expanded thanks to computer and communications technology an online savings system was introduced in toronto in  and ten years later the green machine appeared as the first fullservice automatic teller machine atm or abm automatic banking machine – the general term within canadian banking greatly enhancing the customer service capabilities of the bank to establish a modern and popular brand the corporation introduced a new logo and adopted an official td green in  in the same period television and radio advertising were utilized for the first time in order to promote the new range of products the bank kept in step with the times on other fronts as well it encouraged women to move into management roles and appointed the first female bank manager in  little more than a decade later more than  of all management trainees were women international operations which had gained in importance in the late s became a major focus of the bank after  it launched new subsidiaries in the united kingdom united states and the middle east in  td became first canadian bank to make a substantial investment in commercial banking in hong kong and by the end of the decade tds role in international lending and money market trading was supported by operations in almost every corner of the globe following upon the success of the toronto td centre the bank was active in financing retail and commercial real estate projects across canada it was a partner in the toronto eaton centre and participated in such major developments as the pacific centre in vancouver edmonton centre td square in calgary and the td tower in halifax the bank easily weathered the economic downturn of the early s showing consistent revenue increases from  to  by the late s however the bank was caught up in the debt crisis in the developing world caused by the recession and the dramatic rise in interest rates significant loan losses were reported in  and while the bank participated actively in debt restructuring initiatives it also committed itself to more conservative lending practices despite the difficult economic conditions and the negative impact on earnings the s and early s saw many positive developments deregulation began to eliminate the barriers between the various elements of the financial sector particularly with the

houses the corporate offices of tdbfg td tower in vancouver td in markham ontario the origins of the torontodominion bank lie in the efforts of a group of businessmen in the province of canada west as ontario was called between  and  involved in the buying milling and marketing of grain they were determined to create a financial institution to meet their specific needs in banking insurance and commodities exchange the group submitted its first petition for the incorporation of the millers merchants and farmers bank of canada west in  to the legislature of the province of canada which rejected the request however on march   their application for a charter for the bank of toronto with an authorized capital of £ was granted in july  the bank of toronto opened its offices at  church street toronto with a staff of three and immediately began development of a provincial network of branches in  it opened its first branch outside of ontario in montreal the bank of toronto established itself as an efficient profitable but essentially conservative bank through the th century it maintained a very high reserve against its capital and enjoyed the highest share price of any bank in canada growth was very slow and deliberate with a few new branches opened in emerging regional centres core customers remained farmers merchants and processors of farm products millers brewers distillers in  a group of entrepreneurs and professionals under the leadership of james austin launched the dominion bank to join the bank of toronto in the ontario market they were dedicated to creating a new institution conducive to the general prosperity of that section of the country like the bank of toronto the dominion bank was a cautious institution selecting its customers carefully serving them well and duly prospering with them in the words of the official history it also created a network of branches and in  became the first canadian bank to have two branches in one city–toronto with the maturing of the canadian economy and the opening of northern ontario and the west in the s and s the banks became more aggressive in loans to resource industries utilities and manufacturing in  the dominion bank opened its first western branch in winnipeg and two years later the bank of toronto opened a branch in the british columbia mining town of rossland in the first decade of the twentieth century the banks rapidly expanded their branch networks in central canada and across the west to mark their rise as significant national institutions the dominion bank moved into a large new head office building at the corner of king and yonge streets in toronto in  and the toronto bank followed with another landmark head office at king and bay street in  world war i brought new challenges for the two banks when they were called upon to finance war expenditures and to support the innovation of war bonds marketed to the general public half the staff of the two banks served in the armed forces except for some contraction in the western provinces due to drought the decade following the war was one of expansion and increasing profitability due to resource development and industrial expansion both banks weathered the storm of depression in the s without great difficulty despite a decline in earnings like all canadian banks they endured criticism of their credit policies and resisted the creation of a central bank to control the money supply and advise on fiscal policy ultimately the bank of canada was established in  and by  private banks were ordered to remove their currency from circulation the coming of world war ii involved the banks once again in the marketing of war bonds and in participation in the control of foreign exchange rationing and other financial war measures approximately  staff or almost half the total entered the armed forces the bank of toronto and dominion bank emerged from the war in  stronger than ever with assets more than doubled since  with the postwar boom they became more active in business lending and in the penetration of new markets however they quickly realized that the costs of expansion and competition with much larger rivals made their objectives difficult to realize neither bank had engaged in acquisitions or mergers in order to grow but both determined that a union with a bank of equal size would place them in a much stronger position to take advantage of the opportunities of the postwar economy in  negotiations began between the bank of toronto and the dominion bank and by the end of the year an amalgamation agreement was reached in their brief to the minister of finance the banks stated it is more burdensome for a small bank to keep pace with the development of our country than for a large bank with the result that the effective growth and comparative influence of smaller banks will probably in the future decline in comparison with that of the larger bankscitation needed canadas minister of finance announced november   that he would accept the amalgamation and shareholders were asked for their approval this was forthcoming in december and on february   the bank of toronto and the dominion bank became the torontodominion bank the first years of the new bank were dedicated to the demands of amalgamating the two predecessors institutions of roughly equal size but with different strengths and unique corporate cultures the new institution combined head office functions consolidated branches and established a new regional organization an aggressive program of branch modernization and expansion extended tds presence in its traditional markets and took it into new territory in the maritime provinces and on the natural resource frontier the new bank established its identity through an active public relations campaign focused on customer service – the best in banking service the banks first slogan evolved into the highly successful the bank where people make the difference the competitive banking environment and the need for effective integration of two administrations led the bank to reassess and modernize business practices and methods through the second half of the s management streamlined procedures introduced new technology and emphasized the human resources function as the bank placed increased weight on customer service and product knowledge the banks emergence as a forwardlooking institution was highlighted by the announcement in  that it would have a new and very highprofile head office in downtown toronto the torontodominion centre designed by mies van der rohe the leading architect of the day would include the tallest building in canada it would revolutionize both the skyline of toronto and the public perception of td by the s the bank solidified its domestic base and established its credentials as a major institution it began to look beyond its traditional spheres of operation and to explore the international scene and opportunities domestic and foreign for large scale project financing it developed a network of us representative offices partnerships with global merchant banks and venture capital operations heralding a new commitment to independent and syndicated project financing in  the bank undertook the financing of the massive anvil leadzincsilver mining operation in yukon the

toronto td centre the bank was active in financing retail and commercial real estate projects across canada it was a partner in the toronto eaton centre and participated in such major developments as the pacific centre in vancouver edmonton centre td square in calgary and the td tower in halifax the bank easily weathered the economic downturn of the early s showing consistent revenue increases

houses the corporate offices of tdbfg td tower in vancouver td in markham ontario the origins of the torontodominion bank lie in the efforts of a group of businessmen in the province of canada west as ontario was called between  and  involved in the buying milling and marketing of grain they were determined to create a financial institution to meet their specific needs in banking insurance and commodities exchange the group submitted its first petition for the incorporation of the millers merchants and farmers bank of canada west in  to the legislature of the province of canada which rejected the request however on march   their application for a charter for the bank of toronto with an authorized capital of £ was granted in july  the bank of toronto opened its offices at  church street toronto with a staff of three and immediately began development of a provincial network of branches in  it opened its first branch outside of ontario in montreal the bank of toronto established itself as an efficient profitable but essentially conservative bank through the th century it maintained a very high reserve against its capital and enjoyed the highest share price of any bank in canada growth was very slow and deliberate with a few new branches opened in emerging regional centres core customers remained farmers merchants and processors of farm products millers brewers distillers in  a group of entrepreneurs and professionals under the leadership of james austin launched the dominion bank to join the bank of toronto in the ontario market they were dedicated to creating a new institution conducive to the general prosperity of that section of the country like the bank of toronto the dominion bank was a cautious institution selecting its customers carefully serving them well and duly prospering with them in the words of the official history it also created a network of branches and in  became the first canadian bank to have two branches in one city–toronto with the maturing of the canadian economy and the opening of northern ontario and the west in the s and s the banks became more aggressive in loans to resource industries utilities and manufacturing in  the dominion bank opened its first western branch in winnipeg and two years later the bank of toronto opened a branch in the british columbia mining town of rossland in the first decade of the twentieth century the banks rapidly expanded their branch networks in central canada and across the west to mark their rise as significant national institutions the dominion bank moved into a large new head office building at the corner of king and yonge streets in toronto in  and the toronto bank followed with another landmark head office at king and bay street in  world war i brought new challenges for the two banks when they were called upon to finance war expenditures and to support the innovation of war bonds marketed to the general public half the staff of the two banks served in the armed forces except for some contraction in the western provinces due to drought the decade following the war was one of expansion and increasing profitability due to resource development and industrial expansion both banks weathered the storm of depression in the s without great difficulty despite a decline in earnings like all canadian banks they endured criticism of their credit policies and resisted the creation of a central bank to control the money supply and advise on fiscal policy ultimately the bank of canada was established in  and by  private banks were ordered to remove their currency from circulation the coming of world war ii involved the banks once again in the marketing of war bonds and in participation in the control of foreign exchange rationing and other financial war measures approximately  staff or almost half the total entered the armed forces the bank of toronto and dominion bank emerged from the war in  stronger than ever with assets more than doubled since  with the postwar boom they became more active in business lending and in the penetration of new markets however they quickly realized that the costs of expansion and competition with much larger rivals made their objectives difficult to realize neither bank had engaged in acquisitions or mergers in order to grow but both determined that a union with a bank of equal size would place them in a much stronger position to take advantage of the opportunities of the postwar economy in  negotiations began between the bank of toronto and the dominion bank and by the end of the year an amalgamation agreement was reached in their brief to the minister of finance the banks stated it is more burdensome for a small bank to keep pace with the development of our country than for a large bank with the result that the effective growth and comparative influence of smaller banks will probably in the future decline in comparison with that of the larger bankscitation needed canadas minister of finance announced november   that he would accept the amalgamation and shareholders were asked for their approval this was forthcoming in december and on february   the bank of toronto and the dominion bank became the torontodominion bank the first years of the new bank were dedicated to the demands of amalgamating the two predecessors institutions of roughly equal size but with different strengths and unique corporate cultures the new institution combined head office functions consolidated branches and established a new regional organization an aggressive program of branch modernization and expansion extended tds presence in its traditional markets and took it into new territory in the maritime provinces and on the natural resource frontier the new bank established its identity through an active public relations campaign focused on customer service – the best in banking service the banks first slogan evolved into the highly successful the bank where people make the difference the competitive banking environment and the need for effective integration of two administrations led the bank to reassess and modernize business practices and methods through the second half of the s management streamlined procedures introduced new technology and emphasized the human resources function as the bank placed increased weight on customer service and product knowledge the banks emergence as a forwardlooking institution was highlighted by the announcement in  that it would have a new and very highprofile head office in downtown toronto the torontodominion centre designed by mies van der rohe the leading architect of the day would include the tallest building in canada it would revolutionize both the skyline of toronto and the public perception of td by the s the bank solidified its domestic base and established its credentials as a major institution it began to look beyond its traditional spheres of operation and to explore the international scene and opportunities domestic and foreign for large scale project financing it developed a network of us representative offices partnerships with global merchant banks and venture capital operations heralding a new commitment to independent and syndicated project financing in  the bank undertook the financing of the massive anvil leadzincsilver mining operation in yukon the

toronto td centre the bank was active in financing retail and commercial real estate projects across canada it was a partner in the toronto eaton centre and participated in such major developments as the pacific centre in vancouver edmonton centre td square in calgary and the td tower in halifax the bank easily weathered the economic downturn of the early s showing consistent revenue increases

houses the corporate offices of tdbfg td tower in vancouver td in markham ontario the origins of the torontodominion bank lie in the efforts of a group of businessmen in the province of canada west as ontario was called between  and  involved in the buying milling and marketing of grain they were determined to create a financial institution to meet their specific needs in banking insurance and commodities exchange the group submitted its first petition for the incorporation of the millers merchants and farmers bank of canada west in  to the legislature of the province of canada which rejected the request however on march   their application for a charter for the bank of toronto with an authorized capital of £ was granted in july  the bank of toronto opened its offices at  church street toronto with a staff of three and immediately began development of a provincial network of branches in  it opened its first branch outside of ontario in montreal the bank of toronto established itself as an efficient profitable but essentially conservative bank through the th century it maintained a very high reserve against its capital and enjoyed the highest share price of any bank in canada growth was very slow and deliberate with a few new branches opened in emerging regional centres core customers remained farmers merchants and processors of farm products millers brewers distillers in  a group of entrepreneurs and professionals under the leadership of james austin launched the dominion bank to join the bank of toronto in the ontario market they were dedicated to creating a new institution conducive to the general prosperity of that section of the country like the bank of toronto the dominion bank was a cautious institution selecting its customers carefully serving them well and duly prospering with them in the words of the official history it also created a network of branches and in  became the first canadian bank to have two branches in one city–toronto with the maturing of the canadian economy and the opening of northern ontario and the west in the s and s the banks became more aggressive in loans to resource industries utilities and manufacturing in  the dominion bank opened its first western branch in winnipeg and two years later the bank of toronto opened a branch in the british columbia mining town of rossland in the first decade of the twentieth century the banks rapidly expanded their branch networks in central canada and across the west to mark their rise as significant national institutions the dominion bank moved into a large new head office building at the corner of king and yonge streets in toronto in  and the toronto bank followed with another landmark head office at king and bay street in  world war i brought new challenges for the two banks when they were called upon to finance war expenditures and to support the innovation of war bonds marketed to the general public half the staff of the two banks served in the armed forces except for some contraction in the western provinces due to drought the decade following the war was one of expansion and increasing profitability due to resource development and industrial expansion both banks weathered the storm of depression in the s without great difficulty despite a decline in earnings like all canadian banks they endured criticism of their credit policies and resisted the creation of a central bank to control the money supply and advise on fiscal policy ultimately the bank of canada was established in  and by  private banks were ordered to remove their currency from circulation the coming of world war ii involved the banks once again in the marketing of war bonds and in participation in the control of foreign exchange rationing and other financial war measures approximately  staff or almost half the total entered the armed forces the bank of toronto and dominion bank emerged from the war in  stronger than ever with assets more than doubled since  with the postwar boom they became more active in business lending and in the penetration of new markets however they quickly realized that the costs of expansion and competition with much larger rivals made their objectives difficult to realize neither bank had engaged in acquisitions or mergers in order to grow but both determined that a union with a bank of equal size would place them in a much stronger position to take advantage of the opportunities of the postwar economy in  negotiations began between the bank of toronto and the dominion bank and by the end of the year an amalgamation agreement was reached in their brief to the minister of finance the banks stated it is more burdensome for a small bank to keep pace with the development of our country than for a large bank with the result that the effective growth and comparative influence of smaller banks will probably in the future decline in comparison with that of the larger bankscitation needed canadas minister of finance announced november   that he would accept the amalgamation and shareholders were asked for their approval this was forthcoming in december and on february   the bank of toronto and the dominion bank became the torontodominion bank the first years of the new bank were dedicated to the demands of amalgamating the two predecessors institutions of roughly equal size but with different strengths and unique corporate cultures the new institution combined head office functions consolidated branches and established a new regional organization an aggressive program of branch modernization and expansion extended tds presence in its traditional markets and took it into new territory in the maritime provinces and on the natural resource frontier the new bank established its identity through an active public relations campaign focused on customer service – the best in banking service the banks first slogan evolved into the highly successful the bank where people make the difference the competitive banking environment and the need for effective integration of two administrations led the bank to reassess and modernize business practices and methods through the second half of the s management streamlined procedures introduced new technology and emphasized the human resources function as the bank placed increased weight on customer service and product knowledge the banks emergence as a forwardlooking institution was highlighted by the announcement in  that it would have a new and very highprofile head office in downtown toronto the torontodominion centre designed by mies van der rohe the leading architect of the day would include the tallest building in canada it would revolutionize both the skyline of toronto and the public perception of td by the s the bank solidified its domestic base and established its credentials as a major institution it began to look beyond its traditional spheres of operation and to explore the international scene and opportunities domestic and foreign for large scale project financing it developed a network of us representative offices partnerships with global merchant banks and venture capital operations heralding a new commitment to independent and syndicated project financing in  the bank undertook the financing of the massive anvil leadzincsilver mining operation in yukon the

toronto td centre the bank was active in financing retail and commercial real estate projects across canada it was a partner in the toronto eaton centre and participated in such major developments as the pacific centre in vancouver edmonton centre td square in calgary and the td tower in halifax the bank easily weathered the economic downturn of the early s showing consistent revenue increases

operations in october  historyedit the torontodominion centre td canada trust tower in downtown toronto that houses the corporate offices of tdbfg td tower in vancouver td in markham ontario the origins of the torontodominion bank lie in the efforts of a group of businessmen in the province of canada west as ontario was called between  and  involved in the buying milling and marketing of grain they were determined to create a financial institution to meet their specific needs in banking insurance and commodities exchange the group submitted its first petition for the incorporation of the millers merchants and farmers bank of canada west in  to the legislature of the province of canada which rejected the request however on march   their application for a charter for the bank of toronto with an authorized capital of £ was granted in july  the bank of toronto opened its offices at  church street toronto with a staff of three and immediately began development of a provincial network of branches in  it opened its first branch outside of ontario in montreal the bank of toronto established itself as an efficient profitable but essentially conservative bank through the th century it maintained a very high reserve against its capital and enjoyed the highest share price of any bank in canada growth was very slow and deliberate with a few new branches opened in emerging regional centres core customers remained farmers merchants and processors of farm products millers brewers distillers in  a group of entrepreneurs and professionals under the leadership of james austin launched the dominion bank to join the bank of toronto in the ontario market they were dedicated to creating a new institution conducive to the general prosperity of that section of the country like the bank of toronto the dominion bank was a cautious institution selecting its customers carefully serving them well and duly prospering with them in the words of the official history it also created a network of branches and in  became the first canadian bank to have two branches in one city–toronto with the maturing of the canadian economy and the opening of northern ontario and the west in the s and s the banks became more aggressive in loans to resource industries utilities and manufacturing in  the dominion bank opened its first western branch in winnipeg and two years later the bank of toronto opened a branch in the british columbia mining town of rossland in the first decade of the twentieth century the banks rapidly expanded their branch networks in central canada and across the west to mark their rise as significant national institutions the dominion bank moved into a large new head office building at the corner of king and yonge streets in toronto in  and the toronto bank followed with another landmark head office at king and bay street in  world war i brought new challenges for the two banks when they were called upon to finance war expenditures and to support the innovation of war bonds marketed to the general public half the staff of the two banks served in the armed forces except for some contraction in the western provinces due to drought the decade following the war was one of expansion and increasing profitability due to resource development and industrial expansion both banks weathered the storm of depression in the s without great difficulty despite a decline in earnings like all canadian banks they endured criticism of their credit policies and resisted the creation of a central bank to control the money supply and advise on fiscal policy ultimately the bank of canada was established in  and by  private banks were ordered to remove their currency from circulation the coming of world war ii involved the banks once again in the marketing of war bonds and in participation in the control of foreign exchange rationing and other financial war measures approximately  staff or almost half the total entered the armed forces the bank of toronto and dominion bank emerged from the war in  stronger than ever with assets more than doubled since  with the postwar boom they became more active in business lending and in the penetration of new markets however they quickly realized that the costs of expansion and competition with much larger rivals made their objectives difficult to realize neither bank had engaged in acquisitions or mergers in order to grow but both determined that a union with a bank of equal size would place them in a much stronger position to take advantage of the opportunities of the postwar economy in  negotiations began between the bank of toronto and the dominion bank and by the end of the year an amalgamation agreement was reached in their brief to the minister of finance the banks stated it is more burdensome for a small bank to keep pace with the development of our country than for a large bank with the result that the effective growth and comparative influence of smaller banks will probably in the future decline in comparison with that of the larger bankscitation needed canadas minister of finance announced november   that he would accept the amalgamation and shareholders were asked for their approval this was forthcoming in december and on february   the bank of toronto and the dominion bank became the torontodominion bank the first years of the new bank were dedicated to the demands of amalgamating the two predecessors institutions of roughly equal size but with different strengths and unique corporate cultures the new institution combined head office functions consolidated branches and established a new regional organization an aggressive program of branch modernization and expansion extended tds presence in its traditional markets and took it into new territory in the maritime provinces and on the natural resource frontier the new bank established its identity through an active public relations campaign focused on customer service – the best in banking service the banks first slogan evolved into the highly successful the bank where people make the difference the competitive banking environment and the need for effective integration of two administrations led the bank to reassess and modernize business practices and methods through the second half of the s management streamlined procedures introduced new technology and emphasized the human resources function as the bank placed increased weight on customer service and product knowledge the banks emergence as a forwardlooking institution was highlighted by the announcement in  that it would have a new and very highprofile head office in downtown toronto the torontodominion centre designed by mies van der rohe the leading architect of the day would include the tallest building in canada it would revolutionize both the skyline of toronto and the public perception of td by the s the bank solidified its domestic base and established its credentials as a major institution it began to look beyond its traditional spheres of operation and to explore the international scene and opportunities domestic and foreign for large scale project financing it developed a network of us representative offices partnerships with global merchant banks and venture capital operations heralding a new commitment to independent and syndicated project financing in  the bank

to charge more than sixpercent interest on loans encouraging a new emphasis on personal and specialized consumer loans more significantly banks could now make mortgage loans on real estate and the mortgage loan portfolio quickly gained enormous significance by the close of the s the banks customer base had become more diverse and new products and services were launched almost daily the visa

canada it was a partner in the toronto eaton centre and participated in such major developments as the pacific centre in vancouver edmonton centre td square in calgary and the td tower in halifax the
