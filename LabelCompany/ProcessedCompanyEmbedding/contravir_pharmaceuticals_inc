presentation at easl highlights contravirs tenofovir exalidex txl antiviral activity in hepatitis b hbv patients   edison nj april    contravir pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq ctrv a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies today announced new data demonstrating clinical antiviral activity as well as safety and pharmacokinetic pk data of tenofovir exalidex txl txl is the companys proprietary liver targeting prodrug of the antiviral agent tenofovir for treating chronic hepatitis b virus hbv designed to offer equal or better hbv viral load reductions at doses lower than viread ®  tdf a commercially available tenofovir prodrug contravir is also focusing on optimizing drug delivery of txl to improve bioavailability and enhance its pharmacological activity   the data were presented today at the international liver congress ilc  the annual meeting of the european association for the study of the liver easl in amsterdam the netherlands notably data from the presentation pharmacokinetics safety and antiviral activity of txl a novel prodrug of tenofovir administered as ascending multiple doses to healthy volunteers and hbvinfected subjects was chosen to be included in the best of viral hepatitis at ilc debrief recording where professor fabien zoulim and professor heiner wedemeyer will provide overviews on the latest in viral hepatitis research and patient management   dr tawesak tanwandee associate professor of medicine and head of the division of gastroenterology in the department of medicine at siriraj hospital mahidol university in bangkok thailand and colleagues conducted a trial in which they evaluated the effects of multiple ascending oral doses of txl in healthy volunteers as well as a second trial performed in hbv patients   the first trial a phase b study enrolled  healthy volunteers assigned to one of five sequential ascending txl dosing cohorts     and  mg where participants were randomized  to receive either txl or placebo for  days   the second phase a trial evaluated the effects of multiple ascending oral doses of txl    and  mg in a proofofconcept poc trial involving four cohorts of  hbvinfected subjects randomized  to receive either txl or viread ®  for  days   interim data in the poc study have demonstrated that a mg dose of txl resulted in a mean hbv viral load log   iuml    mean  sd compared to the mean viral load from a mg dose of viread ®  log   iuml    after  days of treatment the reduction in viral load persisted for up to one month after cessation of treatment   these observed reductions in hbv viral load in patients support the further development of txl as a promising new treatment for managing patients with chronic hepatitis b virus said dr tanwandee the lead investigator of both trials continued development of txl is also supported by the wide safety margin observed as well as by its pharmacokinetic profile indicating dose linearity      the data demonstrated that txl at all doses tested resulted in substantially lower systemic circulating levels of tenofovir in the blood compared to viread ®  these results demonstrate the potential for txl to reduce the risk of bone and kidneyrelated toxicities associated with viread ®    there were no serious adverse events aes or discontinuations due to aes and other safety parameters eg electrocardiograms vital signs safety laboratory results showed no patterns clusters or relationship to the txl dose   we now have clinical evidence that demonstrates    mg of txl achieves viral load reductions that are similar to viread ®  that is dosed at  mg these reductions in viral load were accomplished with our firstgeneration formulation we continue to enhance txl by optimizing this firstgeneration product to further enhance drug delivery commented james sapirstein chief executive officer at contravir with our early proofofconcept principle now complete we believe that our secondgeneration formulated txl will give comparable reduction in viral load at lower doses compared to the doses of txl reported in the present study   about txl   tenofovir exalidex txl is a highly potent prodrug of the successful antiviral drug tenofovir its novel livertargeting structure results in decreased circulating levels of tenofovir lowering systemic exposure and thereby reducing the potential for renal side effects contravir previously completed a phase b doseescalation trial of txl in healthy volunteers in which participants were treated at doses up to  mg per day for  days in this trial txl displayed an excellent safety tolerability and drug distribution profile based on the agents bestinclass potential contravir believes txl can become the cornerstone of a curative combination therapy for hepatitis b   txl is a trademark of contravir pharmaceuticals inc   about contravir pharmaceuticals   contravir is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies with a specific focus on developing a potentially curative therapy for hepatitis b virus hbv the company is developing two novel antihbv compounds with complementary mechanisms of action one compound txl is an analog of the antiviral drug viread ®  tenofovir disoproxil fumerate and is currently in phase a of development txl has demonstrated the potential for low oncedaily dosing and a low systemic exposure thereby potentially reducing renal and bone side effects crv the other antihbv compound is a nextgeneration cyclophilin inhibitor with a unique structure that increases its potency and selective index against hbv contravir is also developing valnivudine an orally available nucleoside analogue prodrug valnivudine is currently in phase  for the treatment of herpes zoster in addition to direct antiviral activity phase  data suggest that valnivudine has the potential to reduce the incidence of

vzv the same virus that causes chickenpox based on recent research and publications we estimate that there are over four million cases of shingles in the us europe and japan each year of which more than half occur in the us the symptoms associated with shingles generally include localized lesions and pain in many cases the patient may first notice localized prodomal pain however the first recognizable symptom of shingles is generally lesions that will continue to form for a week or two these lesions generally follow the path of nerves that emanate from the spinal cord around the torso thoracic however the infection is also commonly found on the face neck lower back and in certain cases systemically within several weeks the lesions in the infected areas will typically begin to heal and these dermatological symptoms generally will resolve within a month or less in rare instances lesions may never appear but pain will be present reactivation of varicella zoster virus vzv shingles pain the pain associated with an episode of shingles is attributed to both the damage caused to the affected nerves by the replication of vzv and the inflammatory response associated with the infection pain symptoms are commonly described as a burning sensation with bouts of stabbing and shooting pain often set off by contact with the infected area the majority of shingles patients experience such pain for several weeks in connection with their active infection referred to as acute pain for many patients shinglesassociated pain does not resolve when the lesions heal and the inflammation subsides but rather continues for months or possibly years persistent shinglesassociated pain that lasts more than three to four weeks is referred to as subacute pain or neuralgia shinglesassociated pain that persists more than three months is generally referred to as phn which is the most common and clinically relevant complication of shingles approximately  of all shingles patients experience phn although the incidence of phn is more prevalent in patients over  years of age previous studies have established that additional risk factors for phn include greater acute pain

biopharmaceutical company recently presented data demonstrating the synergistic antiviral activity by two drug candidates for treatment of hepatitis b viral hbv infection this news created such expectation in the investment community and the financial forums that the company could successfully close an underwritten public offering in this piece we will provide some information about this offering and its price reaction as well as some information about the products source drug candidates the company has three candidates txl valnivudine and crv txl is an oral drug made of tenofovir it is considered a product which “is developed to improve the characteristics of  drugs like better efficacy lower pill burden improved safety…“ this drug is in a phase a proof concept study the company licensed txl from chimerix in exchange of  preferred shares valued at  million in  during september  the seller decided to convert them and obtained  million shares we appreciate this decision since chimerix with deep knowledge of the candidate still believes in the future of the product tenofovir disoproxil crv is a drug candidate under development for the treatment of hbv infection the company acquired the drug through a merger with ciclofilin pharmaceuticals inc the product targets enzymes called “cyclophilins” that play a key role in the hbv life cycle additionally the other candidate valnivudine which is an oral drug for the treatment of herpes zoster has completed the phase  already and is waiting for the next and last trial with the fda recent developments the most recent development was announced on april   the company presented data demonstrating the synergistic antiviral activity of the two products txl and crv at the international liver congress®  the annual meeting of the european association for the study of the liver easl in amsterdam the netherlands robert foster contravir’s chief scientific officer stated the following in the congress “the two easl posters support contravir’s strategy of combining two drug candidates with distinct and complementary modes of action an approach that may halt or slow the progression of chronic hepatitis b virus we are especially gratified to be included in one of the easl poster tours as the selection reflects the easl scientific programme committee’s recognition of crv as an antiviral compound with a promising clinical profile and a novel mode of action” source this news seems to be very important for the company as just two days later it could announce a public offering of securities the bookrunning manager was canaccord genuity inc and the offering was closed very rapidly ” contravir is offering  shares of its common stock and warrants to purchase  shares of its common stock at a combined offering price of  all the shares and warrants are being offered by contravir the warrants will be exercisable for a period of five years from the issuance date at an exercise price of  per share” source the demand for the stock seems to be high because the offering was rapidly closed this is very positive in addition the share price did not fall while the bookrunner was working on the sale the share price maintained the price level of  before and after the closing of the offering thus investors seem to like the stock and believe on the commercialization of its candidates institutional holders we appreciated finding the following respected funds among the shareholders holder shares date reported  out value vanguard group inc the  dec     hightower advisors llc  dec     tiaacref

brokers such as jp morgan morgan stanley as well as some hedge funds and mutual funds like vanguard hightower  tiaacref geode and teachers advisors the fact that the big boys invested in this company means that the company passed the due diligence of the funds and its managers believe that the company offers an interesting riskreward ratio our subscribers know it very well since we always say it in internal mails always follow the big firms in this case we also saw that insiders bought at prices above the current share price this is very positive because if we buy now we may be hitting a

company’s share price lost some value in the process due to share dilution but the company is still able to obtain funds from investors with new offerings in our opinion some of its candidates are close to phase  so the time will come soon if the drugs can be commercialized if the trials are positive the shareholders who believed in the company will make interesting returns thanks to their

preparing to enter indenabling studies based on strong preclinical data crv belongs to a known drug class of cyclophilin inhibitors derived from cyclosporine a and was designed specifically to optimize potency and selectivity against hbv crv works by disrupting certain host mechanisms that are “hijacked” by hbv as it replicates within liver cells it is expected to be effective against all hbv genotypes due to the fact that it interrupts more than one point in the viral life cycle that are common in all hbv subtypes potential advantages of crv bestinclass potency and selective index against hbv interrupts hbv at multiple points limiting replication and potential resistance blocks hbv entry into liver cells and suppresses hbsag and hbeag in vitro reduces hbv dna without toxicity prevents liver fibrosis in vivo hepatitis b hepatitis b an infectious disease caused by the hepatitis b virus “hbv” affects the liver and occurs in both acute and chronic modalities patients who test positive for hbsag an hbv surface protein antigen for more than six months are said to be chronic and are at risk of developing liver disease the virus is transmitted by exposure to infectious blood or bodily fluid but is preventable by vaccination currently there are about  million chronic hbv patients worldwide and  reported hbvrelated deaths in  the united states is the largest individual market with the highest absolute growth rate of hbv patients at around  through  and around  growth in much of europe individuals with chronic hepatitis b are significantly more prone to developing cirrhosis of the liver and liver cancer  of all chronic hepatitis b patients develop these complications and individuals with chronic hepatitis b are  times more likely to develop liver cancer than noninfected individuals the limited efficacy of treatments for liver cancer and low survival rate  mean that any treatment targeted at suppressing hbv replication before these complications arise is important to increase longevity learn more about chronic hepatitis b  hepatitis b virus opportunity the safety and antiviral activity of crv is built on a robust set of clinical data from chemicallyrelated cyclophilin inhibitors naturally occurring cyclosporine a has been used for more than  years in the field of organ transplant due to its immunosuppressive properties and cyclophilin inhibitors such as alisporovir developed by debiopharm and acquired by novartis achieved clinical safety and efficacy against hepatitis c virus crv has undergone extensive medicinal chemistry to shed its immunosuppressive activity and optimize its potency and target selectivity which dramatically increases its therapeutic window for treating hepatitis b crv inhibits hbv replication by simultaneously blocking several specific interactions of hbv proteins with host cell cyclophilins which the virus uses to propagate infection and avoid detection by the cell’s natural antiviral mechanisms there is also evidence that it blocks the entry of hbv into cells stimulates an interferonmediated antiviral immune response and directly reduces inflammation and fibrosis a major contributor to cirrhosis and development of liver cancer in chronic hepatitis b patients crv has a clearly distinct and complementary mechanism of action as compared to contravir’s clinical stage hbv drug txl™ which the company believes can act as a cornerstone molecule for a future combination hbv curative treatment us sales of approved hbv drugs  preclinical study data in vitro and in vivo studies showed that crv has good oral bioavailability and a significant first pass effect which concentrates the drug in the liver it was shown to effectively inhibit entry of hbv into liver cells via direct interaction with the ntcp receptor cyclophilinindependent which may represent another mechanism by which crv may reduce chronic infection within cells it significantly reduced or eliminated the productionsecretion of hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag and envelope antigen hbeag as well as hbv dna and cccdna crv also reduced liver hbv dna in a transgenic mouse model of viral replication without significant toxicity further animal studies confirmed a strong safety profile for crv and highlighted the ability of crv to reduce liver damage preventing the development of fibrosis by  in a mouse model of nash nonalcoholic steatohepatitis this result is important considering that longterm liver damage resulting from chronic hbv infection is what ultimately drives mortality for many patients liver hbv dna in mouse model of viral replication get important news and updates by email subscribe   contravir pharmaceuticals  disclaimer  terms of use management team – contravir

famcyclovir and valacyclovir the fda approved drug for treating shingles moreover fv has been shown to have a more rapid onset of antiviral activity in preclinical models and may fully inhibit the replication of vzv more rapidly than these drugs at significantly lower concentration levels phase  trials of fv in volunteers were successfully completed as well as a phase  clinical trial in

targets hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag april   hbsag is a key protein produced by the hepatitis b virus high levels of hbsag are predictive of disease progression crv potently inhibits the interaction between cyclophilin and hbsag edison nj april   globe newswire  contravir pharmaceuticals inc nasdaqctrv a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies today provided new insights into the mechanism of action moa of its hepatitis b virus hbvoptimized cyclophilin inhibitor crv new studies show that crv potently blocks the interaction between hepatitis b surface antigen hbsag a key hbv protein and cyclophilin a an important cellular protein this new information could explain previous findings that crv reduces hbsag in many experimental systems high levels of hbsag in hbvinfected patients is a predictor for progression of disease including liver fibrosis cirrhosis and cancer the findings further elucidate the moa of crv and support contravir’s strategy of providing a “functional cure” where hbv remains suppressed following the completion of drug treatment contravir’s approach to achieving this goal is to combine drugs with complementary moas  txl™ tenofovir exalidex prodrug the backbone of the company’s drug portfolio works by lowering infectious virus in the blood crv complements the activity of txl by targeting hbsag which may enhance the likelihood that the patient’s immune system will disable hbv or its viral products “the goal of hbv drug research is to eradicate the virus so that patients no longer have to worry about the longterm consequences of infection” commented robert foster pharmd phd contravir’s chief scientific officer “our finding that crv targets hepatitis b surface antigen is promising because reducing or eradicating surface antigen is considered an important step in combating hbv combination therapy with crv and tenofovir exalidex with their distinct and complementary modes of action may halt or slow the progression of chronic hepatitis b virus and may bring us closer to a functional cure of this devastating disease” the current studies conducted by philippe gallay phd at the scripps research institute expand upon the previously reported findings that crv also targets the interaction between cyclophilin and another key hbv protein called hbx together these results highlight the central role of cyclophilins in hbv infection and the potential of crv to disrupt key viral activities about contravir pharmaceuticals contravir is a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development and commercialization of targeted antiviral therapies with a specific focus on developing a potentially curative therapy for hepatitis b virus hbv the company is developing two novel antihbv compounds with complementary mechanisms of action one compound txl™ formerly cmx is a highly potent analog of the successful antiviral drug viread® tenofovir disoproxil fumerate and is currently in phase a of development txl™ has demonstrated the potential for low oncedaily dosing and decreased systemic exposure compared to tenofovir thereby potentially reducing renal and bone side effects crv the other antihbv compound is a nextgeneration cyclophilin inhibitor with a unique structure that increases its potency and selective index against hbv contravir is also developing fv an orally available nucleoside analogue prodrug fv is currently in phase  for the treatment of herpes zoster in addition to direct antiviral activity phase  data suggest that fv has the potential to
