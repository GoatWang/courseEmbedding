environment often means saving money too—and many improvements pay back quicker than you might think here are some tips dont delay fixing a leaky faucet the sierra club the nations largest environmental organization tells us that ignoring a leak can waste up to three gallons of water a day or  gallons a year replace your old kitchen faucet with a model that utilizes a ceramic disc cartridge youll enjoy leakfree performance and save water too dont put your replacement off because you think you cant afford a new faucet after extensive testing consumer reports found that many lower cost faucets from reputable manufacturers offered durability and performance that equaled premium products go low flow government regulations mandate a faucet flow rate of  gpm gallons per minute or less however new faucets with lowflow aerators feature a  gpm or lower rate without sacrificing functionality if you dont want to replace your faucet its usually quite easy to replace just the aerator the benefits of quality go ahead invest in that betterquality faucet youll get the look you really want while saving on future replacement and repair expense plus youre doing the planet a favor by putting less trash in landfills it may not seem like much but environmentalists often say that living greener is all about changing our attitudes and taking small steps that add up a greener

collections of bathroom faucets so that you can match your bathroom sink faucets to your bathtub and shower faucet sets and everything in between—even the small things like diverters and bidet faucets have coordinating finishes and styles with other bath fixtures some bath fixtures inevitably will outlast others either in terms of their lifespan or style homeowners often replace showerheads handshowers and shower arms more often than other bathroom faucets so be sure to choose a finish for your bathtub faucets and fillers shower faucets and shower systems that will be easy to match with the rest of the fixtures in your bath decorating your bath with standard finishes and styles not only makes it easier to update your bath but is better for your home resale value too safety first if you have or plan to have children or elderly living in your home or you plan on aging in your home consider installing valves that allow for more control over the water temperature as we tend to lose sensitivity to heat as we age many valves come with an antiscalding feature check your local building codes it may even be required in your area look for pressure balancing valves or thermostatic valves that have this extra safety precaution pressure balancing valves use just one handle to control both volume and temperature with a dial or setscrew to set the stoppoint for the handle rotation to adjust the maximum ratio of hot to cold water these valves react to changes in water pressure and compensate to maintain a consistent temperature deltas monitor series moens moentrol and positemp series and grohes grohsafe are examples of pressure balance valves thermostatic valves use two handles one to control volume and one to control temperature thermostatic valves react to water temperature rather than pressure to regulate the temperature  a wax element inside the valve expands or contracts in reaction to heat when the water supply exceeds the maximum set temperature the element expands to reduce the flow of hot water allowing more cold into the mix thermostatic valves give more direct control over the output temperature without adjusting the setting on your water heater examples of thermostatic valves are ecostat by hansgrohe iodigital and exacttemp by moen grohtherm by grohe and tempassure by delta bidets have faucets too although bidet popularity is on the rise bidet faucets are a bit more limited when it comes to availability of styles and finishes so you may want to start with your bidet faucets when taking on your bath design and coordinate the rest of your bathroom faucets and fixtures from there learn more about how to choose your bathroom sink faucet or bathtub faucets showerheads and shower systems follow us departments bathroom kitchen décor
