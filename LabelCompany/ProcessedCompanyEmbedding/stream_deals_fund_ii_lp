intelligence technology got a qualitative leap top scientists of the world completed the most ambitious project of human being the global artificial intelligence assembly known as gaiagaia is build on the cloud she connects all devices from cell phones on the hand to satellites in the space gaia collects all information from which kind of hamburger you like last week to all the stock deals in past  years then analyses the mass data by assembling computing resources all over the world and finally calculate the ultimate solution for every human being for the common people gaia will tell he or she what to do for every minute to eat which food or read which article it is not an order but people always find that by following gaias suggestion it always benefits most for the army gaia play as the commander she can calculate the best move for each soldier on the field at the same time and finally lead them to victory without anyone woundednot like in hollywood movies gaia did not build skynet to eliminate human or build her drone army to conquer the world followed by the first principle in her source code help but not replace human gaia served human well but the real conflict come from human them self many people realized that because of gaia human do not think any more and finally abandoned their freedom at the beginning it is just some kind of idealism but when ai let more and more people lose their job it became rebellion most of them are elites in the past but become useless when ai came no fund manager is useless because ai always give the best financing solution gaia can command soldiers directly through the hologlass so officers are not needed even the scientists who make gaia are not escaped a scientific ai study matrix can do all the lifetime work of a professor but only in an hourfinally those elites in the past decided to fight against gaia but soon they found all devices and weapons are controlled by gaia cameras and drones spreads everywhere in cities human forces even had no place to hide so they banished themselves to abandoned industrial cities they rebuild factories using the technologies of s which seems to be out dated but gaia can not connect to they reactive tanks and attack helicopters in the steel cemetery rebuild battleships of ww some report said that they even rebuild the space shuttle platform at last they build up a settlement and their armies without gaias control they called themselves steel alliancenow the war between gaia and steel alliance is inevitable no matter which side you are good luck commander system

facebook chases tv’s  billion stash with its own video series by lucas shaw lucasshaw more stories by lucas shaw and sarah frier sarahfrier more stories by sarah frier june    am edt video tab on site said to be pushed back to later this year company said to fund some ‘hero’ shows with sixfigure budgets with the  billion tv advertising market in its sights facebook inc is starting to bankroll the creation of video series that will begin to appear on the world’s largest social network later this yearfacebook is closing deals for its first batch of shows including two that the hollywood reporter unveiled earlier this week  reality competition series “last state standing” and a second season of comedy “loosely exactly nicole” which first appeared on mtv the shows will be available via a new video tab on facebook that hasn’t been releasedby funding a slate of original programs facebook hopes to entice more production companies to upload premium video which facebook will then use to siphon advertising dollars away from television the lucrative advertising market inspires tv networks to create hundreds of shows and newer media companies teenagers and aspiring filmmakers to upload billions of hours of video a day to youtube snapchat and other online portals facebook isn’t trying to compete with the highest end of that market  paid services netflix hbo and showtime it has its sights set on cable networks and advertisingsupported online services with young viewers“funding video is a way for facebook to figure out its greater advertising program” said matthew segal chief executive officer of attn a digital media company that publishes video to facebook “it’s clear they want to be a bigger player in the space they want to eclipse tv” read more a bloomberg intelligence midyear report on internet companiesfacebook has been hosting video for a few years and two years ago began sharing advertising revenue with some companies that uploaded clips while many of those companies found large audiences on the social network few generated enough advertising revenue to treat facebook as a primary distribution outlet for highend videofacebook executives have compared funding original videos to priming the pump at an oilfield giving creators a financial incentive to upload more video get a taste of the large audiences they can attract and come back for more facebook has paid celebrities to use its live video feature and encouraged tv networks and movie studios to stream live events and trailers on the social network for free promotion facebooks money machine targets tv ad dollars facebook is funding two kinds of programs  a handful of more expensive series from established tv producers that will take a few months to produce hero shows they are called and a bunch of shorter cheaper videos from publishers like vox media inc and buzzfeed inc called spotlight shows all shows will be episodic and designed to spur conversation among facebook usersfor the hero shows facebook is willing to spend a couple hundred thousand dollars an episode according to people familiar with the matter budgets that compare favorably with many cable networks the shows will be exclusive to facebook which has expressed a desire for programs that appeal to young women think “pretty little liars” or “the bachelor” said the people who asked not to be identified discussing private informationfor spotlight shows facebook is giving publishers a minimum guarantee of  to  an episode up front and will have exclusive rights to the program for a period of time before the videos can be made available elsewhere the people said facebook will share advertising revenue with the publishers who can start to sell their own advertisements after a brief periodfacebook has been assembling a team of executives to shepherd its entree into hollywood starting with ricky van veen cofounder of comedy site college humor the company has since hired netflix inc executive sarah madigan to acquire video programs and former mtv executive mina lefevre to oversee the development of new shows now van veen is looking to hire a head of unscripted development to work under lefevre people familiar with the matter saidfacebook’s interest in funding video tantalizes hollywood where producers drool at the thought of another deeppocketed patron alongside fellow tech giants amazoncom inc apple inc and alphabet inc other new players like verizon communications inc have had a harder time often committing less money to less ambitious showswith  billion people checking their news feed every month facebook reaches more people than any tv network “not only do nearly  percent of people under  have an account but they are spending over  minutes a month on facebook” said attn’s segalyet some elements of facebook’s video strategy are still uncertain according to employees and partners facebook hasn’t detailed how advertisements will be displayed on the programming it’s funding and has yet to show many of its partners a demo of its new video tab which is also called spotlight publishers and producers are eager for facebook to create a new destination for video since most users don’t watch clips in the news feed for more than a minute or two“getting people past  seconds is still a challenge” segal saidthe debut of spotlight was supposed to be earlier this year was later pushed to june and may now not happen until the fall the people said facebook had successfully bid to host a live stream of singer katy perry around the debut of her new album but had to forfeit the rights due to the delay of spotlight they said the fourday event witness worldwide aired on youtube last weekend exclusive insights on technology around the world get fully charged from bloomberg technology sign up facebook is also developing a second tab that will be devoted to the more highend programming the people said facebook prefers not to put details of the video product in writing and will only discuss it by phone according to people who have dealt with the company facebook has also rankled some potential partners by insisting on selling advertising itself and inserting ads into the middle of live broadcasts the people saidfacebook has a small staff handling original programming not enough to manage a robust operation facebook would rather share money from advertising sales than pay for content in the long term“the sustainable model is some sort of revenue sharing” fidji simo facebook’s head of video product said in an interview “the goal is really to get a lot of different partners to come to facebook share their content and find success it’s very hard to find that over the long term by funding”that approach appeals to companies uploading shortform videos but it may not make sense to highend creators accustomed to large budgets tv networks typically pay a licensing fee for a show and then keep revenue from the ads they sell the studios still often retain the right to sell the program overseas or sell reruns to other networks which benefits writers and actors as welllive sports an area of growing interest to facebook is also very expensive facebook has added live feeds of baseball games and soccer matches through deals with different leagues and previously pursued the rights to stream thursday night football games for now leagues are using facebook to test how many viewers they can reach on the site they also hope early experiments will convince facebook to spend big on future rights before its here its on the
