gallery mike devlin is in his third season as the texan offensive line coach and he used the offseason program to help develop two things he believes are crucial to a teams success competition and depth there are at least  linemen wholl be competing at training camp in west virginia including returning starters players acquired during the offseason and others activated from injured lists ideally when youre building an offensive line you always want to keep churning the back end and that way it creates depth and competition devlin said and hopefully the cream rises to the top and youre always getting better since ive been here this is the first year where we have all this depth and competition and all these little battles that no ones seeing thats going to make us better overall

begins up front last season the texans finished eighth in rushing and th in sacks allowed per pass play but they were th in offense th in passing and tied for th in points primarily because of issues
