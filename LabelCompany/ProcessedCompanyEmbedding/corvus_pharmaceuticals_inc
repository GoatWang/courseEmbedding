adenosine aa receptor it is designed to block the action of adenosine that is produced by tumors cpi will enter a phase b study in early  in collaboration with genentech this study will evaluate cpi as a single agent and in combination with the investigational agent atezolizumab an antipdl antibody adenosine production inhibitor a monoclonal anticd antibody corvus has developed a humanized anticd monoclonal antibody the antibody binds to the enzyme cd and has been shown to block its catalytic activity inhibiting adenosine production by tumor cells we have initiated indenabling studies for the development of this antibody in potential clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer adenosine ab antagonist we are evaluating several orally administered antagonists that are selective for an alternate adenosine receptor known as ab we believe that targeting ab may be important for patients with certain types of cancer we expect to conduct studies similar to those we have conducted with cpi in order to select a clinical development candidate interleukin ilinducible t cell kinase itk inhibitors we are developing orally administered and covalent inhibitors of itk itk is an enzyme that is expressed predominantly in tcells and is homologous to the target of ibrutinib btk an approved treatment for patients with certain bcell cancers we believe inhibiting itk may be of therapeutic

focused on the development and commercialization of novel immunooncology therapies that are designed to harness the immune system to attack cancer cells since we began operations in november  we have built a pipeline of four immunooncology programs three of which focus on the adenosinecancer axis to modulate an immune response our lead product candidate cpi is an oral small molecule antagonist of the aa receptor for adenosine an immune checkpoint in january  we began enrolling patients in a large expansion cohort trial for cpi this phase b clinical trial is designed to examine safety tolerability biomarkers and preliminary efficacy of cpi in several solid tumor types both as a single agent and in combination with genentech incs investigational cancer immunotherapy tecentriq® atezolizumab a fully humanized investigational monoclonal antibody targeting pdl in november  we completed enrollment of  patients in the first step of the phase b clinical trial which was designed to determine the optimal dose of cpi as both a single agent therapy and in combination with tecentriq atezolizumab for use in the cohort expansion component of the trial the expansion cohort portion of the trial is now enrolling patients with different types of solid tumors at  leading medical centers in the us australia and canada the other product and development candidates in our pipeline also continue to advance we have chosen a lead development candidate for our second program an anticd monoclonal antibody cpx that inhibits the production of adenosine cpx is currently in ind enabling studies and we plan to initiate a phase  clinical trial in early  in addition in  we selected a development candidate for our itk program and are currently conducting indenabling studies we also plan to initiate a phase  clinical trial for this candidate in  we expect to select a development candidate for our other program a small molecule antagonist of the ab receptor for adenosine in  we believe the breadth and status of our pipeline demonstrates our management teams expertise in understanding and developing immunooncology assets as well as in identifying product candidates that can be inlicensed and further developed internally to treat many types of cancer we hold worldwide rights to all of our product candidates   immunooncology therapies that stimulate or enhance immune responses to tumors are a new and emerging approach with several potential benefits over existing therapies first the immune system exhibits immunologic diversity and selectivity which enables it to respond selectively to a large number of potential targets second once triggered the immune response can be amplified offering the potential to enhance the efficacy of treatment third once activated the immune system possesses immunologic memory potentially providing for a durable and longlasting response some of the most successful types of immunooncology therapies are immune checkpoint inhibitors immune checkpoints are signaling molecules produced by or expressed on immune cells that act to shut down or block an immune response in a healthy person these checkpoints function to limit an immune response to ensure that the immune system does not overreact which could lead to excessive inflammation and tissue damage as occurs in patients with autoimmune diseases or allergies tumor cells have evolved to activate these checkpoints to shield the tumor from immune response attacks but studies have shown that immune checkpoint inhibitors can counter these tumorprotective measures and unleash the immune systems cancerdestroying properties   the fda has approved agents that target specific immune checkpoints including antibodies against the cytotoxic tlymphocyteassociated antigen ctla programmed death  pd receptors and programmed death receptorligand  pdl these antibodies represent the first immune checkpoint inhibitors to demonstrate effectiveness in the clinic and preclinical data suggest that there are many other immune checkpoints or targets that may be modulated to promote the activation of a patients antitumor immune system    table of contents   since we began operations in november  we have built a pipeline of four immunooncology programs three of our programs are aimed at disabling cancers ability to subvert immune attack by inhibiting adenosine in the tumor microenvironment or by blocking its production by tumors adenosine activates an immune checkpoint the adenosine aa receptor that is used by the body to limit inflammation and immune responses adenosine accomplishes this by interacting with the aa and ab receptors expressed on several cells of the immune system including tcells natural killer nk cells macrophages dendritic cells and myeloid derived suppressor cells as well as other cells we are developing small molecules that selectively inhibit the binding of adenosine to either aa receptors or to ab receptors we also are developing injectable monoclonal antibodies that block the production of adenosine by tumors by inhibiting the cell surface enzyme cd our fourth program is aimed at developing product candidates that regulate tcell activation and differentiation by inhibiting interleukin inducible kinase itk several of our product candidates are orally administered small molecules which may provide for easier administration and facilitate their use in combination with other anticancer agents our oral product candidates are designed to be rapidly eliminated from the body which in turn could reduce the potential for excessive toxicity when used in combination with other antibodybased checkpoint inhibitors   our immunooncology product candidate pipeline includes the following   cpi adenosine aa receptor antagonist     in february  we inlicensed patent rights and knowhow related to cpi and related molecules from vernalis rd limited vernalis where it was under development for treatment of parkinsons disease and other neurologic diseases vernalis and its corporate partner conducted two phase  clinical trials in healthy volunteers and one phase b clinical trial in patients with attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder adhd with an aggregate of approximately  healthy volunteers and patients dosed these trials provided early indications of a favorable safety profile and assessed pharmacokinetics oral bioavailability and receptor occupancy for cpi we conducted further testing in in vitro and in vivo models to evaluate cpis immuneenhancing and antitumor properties in these studies orally administered cpi inhibited tumor growth in multiple mouse models of cancer as a single agent in combination with antipd agents and in combination with antipdl agents   in october  we filed an investigational new drug ind application for cpi for treatment of several solid tumor types in january  we began enrolling patients in a large expansion cohort clinical trial for cpi this phase b clinical trial is designed to examine safety tolerability biomarkers and preliminary efficacy of cpi both as a single agent and in combination with tecentriq atezolizumab and includes patients with different types of solid tumors enrolled in diseasespecific cohorts   in november  we completed enrollment of the first step of the phase b clinical trial which was designed to determine the optimal dose for use in the diseasespecific expansion cohort component of the trial we also reported results of initial safety tolerability biomarkers and preliminary efficacy in december  we initiated the second step of the phase  b clinical trial with our optimal dose of cpi as both a single agent therapy and in combination with tecentriq atezolizumab this portion of the trial is now enrolling patients in ten disease specific cohorts five of the cohorts receive cpi as a single agent and five receive cpi in combination with tecentriq atezolizumab the cohorts include patients with nonsmall cell lung cancer malignant melanoma renal cell cancer triplenegative breast cancer and others bladder cancer prostate cancer and colorectal cancer with high mutation rates   the issued us patents that we inlicensed from vernalis are directed to the composition of matter of cpi and its method of use for treating disorders treatable by purine receptor blocking   the composition of matter patent covering cpi is expected to expire in the united states in july  excluding any patent term extension that may be available we hold an exclusive worldwide license under these patent rights and related knowhow including a limited right to grant sublicenses for all fields of use to develop manufacture and commercialize products containing certain adenosine receptor antagonists including cpi    table of contents   anticd adenosine production inhibitor     in december  we inlicensed from the scripps research institute scripps a mouse hybridoma clone expressing an antihuman cd antibody from which we have developed our lead product candidate cpx a humanized anticd monoclonal antibody we have further modified cpx to improve binding to cd and maximize its inhibition of catalytic activity cd is often found on lymphocytes tumors and other tissues and is believed to play an important role in tumor immune suppression by catalyzing the production of extracellular adenosine in preclinical in vitro studies our humanized monoclonal anticd antibody has been shown to inhibit the catalytic activity of cd resulting in the blocking of extracellular adenosine production by tumor cells which we believe could stimulate or enhance immune response to tumors in  we initiated indenabling studies for cpx for potential clinical trials in patients with advanced cancer and subject to the completion of such studies and the submission and acceptance by the fda of an ind we plan to begin a phase  clinical trial in early  we hold a nonexclusive worldwide license for all fields of use under scripps rights in a hybridoma clone expressing an anticd antibody and to progeny mutants or unmodified derivatives of such hybridoma and any antibodies expressed by such hybridoma in  we filed a patent application covering the composition of matter of cpx   adenosine ab receptor antagonist     we have inlicensed several selective and potent adenosine ab receptor antagonists from vernalis in addition we are synthesizing and have identified other ab receptor antagonists from our internal research program adenosine ab receptors have recently been found to play an important role in the immune response to tumors similar to adenosine aa receptors adenosine binds to adenosine ab receptors which leads to immunosuppression we intend to further develop our ab agents to improve potency selectivity pharmacokinetic behavior and immune enhancing properties we expect to conduct preclinical studies similar to those we have conducted for cpi in order to select a development candidate in  upon selection we intend to conduct further indenabling studies and potential phase  clinical trials we hold an exclusive worldwide license under certain vernalis patent rights and knowhow including a limited right to grant sublicenses for all fields of use to develop manufacture and commercialize products containing such compounds that have been developed using the intellectual property rights that we inlicense from vernalis   itk inhibitor     we are currently developing a series of selective covalent inhibitors of itk and are evaluating them in preclinical studies for potency safety and efficacy itk an enzyme that functions in tcell signaling and differentiation is expressed predominantly in tcells which are lymphocytes that play a vital role in immune responses one of the key survival mechanisms of tumors is believed to be the reprogramming of tcells to create an inflammatory environment that inhibits antitumor immune response and favors tumor growth we believe highly selective inhibitors of this enzyme will facilitate induction of tcell antitumor immunity and also may be useful in the treatment of tcell lymphomas in  we selected a lead development candidate for this program and initiated indenabling studies subject to the completion of such studies and the submission and acceptance by the fda of an ind we plan to advance the candidate into phase  clinical trials in cancer patients in  we have filed patent applications covering composition of matter and uses of our itk inhibitors and hold exclusive worldwide rights for all indications   corporate

table of contents   use of proceeds   we intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the securities as set forth in the applicable prospectus supplement    table of contents   ratio of earnings to fixed charges and preferred share dividends   our earnings have been inadequate to cover fixed charges and preference dividends the following table and footnotes thereto set forth the dollar amount of the deficiency to cover fixed charges for each of the years ended december    and  we have derived the deficiency of earnings to cover fixed charges and preference dividends from our historical financial statements the following should be read in conjunction with our financial statements including the notes thereto and the other financial information included or incorporated by reference herein see exhibit  hereto for additional detail regarding the computation of the deficiency of earnings to cover fixed charges and preference dividends       year ended december                     in thousands   ratio of earnings to fixed charges    na   na   na                           due to our losses for the years ended december    and  the ratio coverage was less than                          we would have needed to generate additional earnings of  million  million and  million respectively to cover our fixed charges for the years ended december    and  respectively   for the periods indicated above we had no outstanding shares of preferred stock with required dividend payments therefore the ratios of earnings to combined fixed charges and preferred stock dividends are identical to the ratios presented in the tables above    table of contents   description of capital stock   the following description of our capital stock is not complete and may not contain all the information you should consider before investing in our capital stock this description is summarized from and qualified in its entirety by reference to our certificate of incorporation which has been publicly filed with the sec see where you can find more information incorporation by reference   we have authorized under our certificate of incorporation  shares of common stock  par value per share and  shares of preferred stock  par value per share as of december   there were outstanding   ·                    shares of our common stock and   ·                   no shares of our preferred stock   common stock   voting rights   each holder of our common stock is entitled to one vote for each share on all matters submitted to a vote of the stockholders including the election of directors our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights in the election of directors in addition the affirmative vote of holders of   of the voting power of all of the thenoutstanding voting stock is required to take certain actions including amending certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation such as the provisions relating to amending our  bylaws the classified board of directors and director liability   dividends   subject to preferences that may be applicable to any thenoutstanding preferred stock holders of our common stock are entitled to receive dividends if any as may be declared from time to time by our board of directors out of legally available funds   liquidation   in the event of our liquidation dissolution or winding up holders of our common stock will be entitled to share ratably in the net assets legally available for distribution to stockholders after the payment of all of our debts and other liabilities and the satisfaction of any liquidation preference granted to the holders of any thenoutstanding shares of preferred stock   rights and preferences   holders of our common stock have no preemptive conversion subscription or other rights and there are no redemption or sinking fund provisions applicable to our common stock the rights preferences and privileges of the holders of our common stock are subject to and may be adversely affected by the rights of the holders of shares of any series of our preferred stock that we may designate in the future   fully paid and nonassessable   all of our outstanding shares of common stock are fully paid and nonassessable    table of contents   preferred stock   our board of directors has the authority without further action by our stockholders to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series and to fix the rights preferences privileges and restrictions thereof these rights preferences and privileges could include dividend rights conversion rights voting rights terms of redemption liquidation preferences sinking fund terms and the number of shares constituting any series or the designation of such series any or all of which may be greater than the rights of common stock the issuance of our preferred stock could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and the likelihood that such holders will receive dividend payments and payments upon our liquidation in addition the issuance of preferred stock could have the effect of delaying deferring or preventing a change in control of our company or other corporate action as of december   no shares of preferred stock were outstanding and we have no present plan to issue any shares of preferred stock   antitakeover effects of provisions of our certificate of incorporation our bylaws and delaware law   certain provisions of delaware law our certificate of incorporation and our  bylaws contain provisions that could make the following transactions more difficult acquisition of us by means of a tender offer acquisition of us by means of a proxy contest or otherwise or removal of our incumbent officers and directors it is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish or could deter transactions that stockholders may otherwise consider to be in their best interest or in our best interests including transactions that might result in a premium over the market price for our shares   these provisions summarized below are expected to discourage coercive takeover practices and inadequate takeover bids these provisions are also designed to encourage persons seeking to acquire control of us to first negotiate with our board of directors   delaware antitakeover statute   we are subject to section  of the delaware general corporation law the dgcl which prohibits persons deemed interested stockholders from engaging in a business combination with a publiclyheld delaware corporation for three  years following the date these persons become interested stockholders unless the business combination is or the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder was approved in a prescribed manner or another prescribed exception applies in general an interested stockholder is a person who together with affiliates and associates owns or within three years prior to the determination of interested stockholder status did own fifteen percent  or more of a corporations voting stock in general a business combination includes a merger asset or stock sale or other transaction resulting in a financial benefit to the interested stockholder the existence of this provision may have an antitakeover effect with respect to transactions not approved in advance by the board of directors such as discouraging takeover attempts that might result in a premium over the market price of our common stock   undesignated preferred stock   the ability to authorize undesignated preferred stock pursuant to our certificate of incorporation enables our board of directors to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of us these and other provisions may have the effect of deterring hostile takeovers or delaying changes in control or management of the company   special stockholder meetings   our  bylaws provide that a special meeting of stockholders may be called at any time by our board of directors but such special meetings may not be called by the stockholders or any other person or persons    table of contents   requirements for advance notification of stockholder nominations and proposals   our  bylaws establish advance notice procedures with respect to stockholder proposals and the nomination of candidates for election as directors other than nominations made by or at the direction of the board of directors or a committee of the board of directors   elimination of stockholder action by written consent   our certificate of incorporation eliminates the right of stockholders to act by written consent without a meeting   classified board election and removal of directors filling vacancies   our board of directors is divided into three  classes the directors in each class serve for a threeyear term one class being elected each year by our stockholders with staggered threeyear terms only one class of directors is elected at each annual meeting of our stockholders with the other classes continuing for the remainder of their respective threeyear terms because our stockholders do not have cumulative voting rights our stockholders holding a majority of the shares of common stock outstanding are able to elect all of our directors our certificate of incorporation provides for the removal of any of our directors only for cause and requires a stockholder vote by the holders of at least a   of the voting power of the thenoutstanding voting stock this system of electing and removing directors and filling vacancies may tend to discourage a third party from making a tender offer or otherwise attempting to obtain control of us because it generally makes it more difficult for stockholders to replace a majority of the directors   choice of forum   our certificate of incorporation and our  bylaws provide that the court of chancery of the state of delaware will be the exclusive forum for any derivative action or proceeding brought on our behalf any action asserting a claim of breach of fiduciary duty any action asserting a claim against us arising pursuant to the dgcl our certificate of incorporation or our  bylaws or any action asserting a claim against us that is governed by the internal affairs doctrine although our certificate of incorporation and  bylaws contain the choice of forum provision described above it is possible that a court could find that such a provision is inapplicable for a particular claim or action or that such provision is unenforceable   amendment of charter provisions   the amendment of any of the above provisions in our certificate of incorporation except for the provision making it possible for our board of directors to issue undesignated preferred stock or the amendment of any provision in our  bylaws other than by action of the board of directors requires approval by holders of at least   of the voting power of the thenoutstanding voting stock   the provisions of the dgcl our certificate of incorporation and our  bylaws could have the effect of discouraging others from attempting hostile takeovers and as a consequence they may also inhibit temporary fluctuations in the market price of our common stock that often result from actual or rumored hostile takeover attempts these provisions may also have the effect of preventing changes in our management it is possible that these provisions could make it more difficult to accomplish transactions that stockholders may otherwise deem to be in their best interests    table of contents   limitations on liability and indemnification matters   our certificate of incorporation contains provisions that limit the liability of our directors for monetary damages to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law consequently our directors are not personally liable to us or our stockholders for monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duties as directors except liability for   ·                   any breach of the directors duty of loyalty to us or our stockholders   ·                   any act or omission not in good faith or that involves intentional misconduct or a knowing violation of law   ·                   unlawful payments of dividends or unlawful stock repurchases or redemptions as provided in section  of the dgcl or   ·                   any transaction from which the director derived an improper personal benefit   each of our certificate of incorporation and  bylaws provide that we are required to indemnify our directors and officers in each case to the fullest extent permitted by delaware law our  bylaws also obligate us to advance expenses incurred by a director or officer in advance of the final disposition of any action or proceeding and permit us to secure insurance on behalf of any officer director employee or other agent for any liability arising out of his or her actions in that capacity regardless of whether we would otherwise be permitted to indemnify him or her under delaware law we have entered and expect to continue to enter into agreements to indemnify our directors executive officers and other employees as determined by our board of directors with specified exceptions these agreements provide for indemnification for related expenses including among other things attorneys fees judgments fines and settlement amounts incurred by any of these individuals in any action or proceeding we believe that these bylaw provisions and indemnification agreements are necessary to attract and retain qualified persons as directors and officers we also maintain directors and officers liability insurance   the limitation of liability and indemnification provisions in our certificate of incorporation and  bylaws may discourage stockholders from bringing a lawsuit against our directors and officers for breach of their fiduciary duty they may also reduce the likelihood of derivative litigation against our directors and officers even though an action if successful might benefit us and our stockholders further a stockholders investment may be adversely affected to the extent that we pay the costs of settlement and damages   the nasdaq global market listing   our common stock is listed on the nasdaq global market under the symbol crvs   transfer agent and registrar   the

on behalf of the depository trust company new york new york as depositary or dtc and registered in the name of cede  co the nominee of dtc unless and until it is exchanged for individual certificates evidencing securities under the limited circumstances described below a global security may not be transferred except as a whole by the depositary to its nominee or by the nominee to the depositary or by the depositary or its nominee to a successor depositary or to a nominee of the successor depositary   dtc has advised us that it is   ·                   a limitedpurpose trust company organized under the new york banking law   ·                   a banking organization within the meaning of the new york banking law   ·                   a member of the federal reserve system   ·                   a clearing corporation within the meaning of the new york uniform commercial code and   ·                   a clearing agency registered pursuant to the provisions of section a of the exchange act   dtc holds securities that its participants deposit with dtc dtc also facilitates the settlement among its participants of securities transactions such as transfers and pledges in deposited securities through electronic computerized bookentry changes in participants accounts thereby eliminating the need for physical movement of securities certificates direct participants in dtc include securities brokers and dealers including underwriters banks trust companies clearing corporations and other organizations dtc is a whollyowned subsidiary of the depository trust  clearing corporation or dtcc dtcc is the holding company for dtc national securities clearing corporation and fixed income clearing corporation all of which are registered clearing agencies dtcc is owned by the users of its regulated subsidiaries access to the dtc system is also available to others which we sometimes refer to as indirect participants that clear through or maintain a custodial relationship with a direct participant either directly or indirectly the rules applicable to dtc and its participants are on file with the sec   purchases of securities under the dtc system must be made by or through direct participants which will receive a credit for the securities on dtcs records the ownership interest of the actual purchaser of a security which we sometimes refer to as a beneficial owner is in turn recorded on the direct and indirect participants records beneficial owners of securities will not receive written confirmation from dtc of their purchases however beneficial owners are expected to receive written confirmations providing details of their transactions as well as periodic statements of their holdings from the direct or indirect participants through which they purchased securities transfers of ownership interests in global securities are to be accomplished by entries made on the books of participants acting on behalf of beneficial owners beneficial owners will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in the global securities except under the limited circumstances described below   to facilitate subsequent transfers all global securities deposited by direct participants with dtc will be registered in the name of dtcs partnership nominee cede  co or such other name as may be requested by an authorized representative of dtc the deposit of securities with dtc and their registration in the name of cede  co or such other nominee will not change the beneficial ownership of the securities dtc has no knowledge of the actual beneficial owners of the securities dtcs records reflect only the identity of the direct participants to whose accounts the securities are credited which may or may not be the beneficial owners the participants are responsible for keeping account of their holdings on behalf of their customers    table of contents   so long as the securities are in bookentry form you will receive payments and may transfer securities only through the facilities of the depositary and its direct and indirect participants we will maintain an office or agency in the location specified in the prospectus supplement for the applicable securities where notices and demands in respect of the securities and the indenture may be delivered to us and where certificated securities may be surrendered for payment registration of transfer or exchange   conveyance of notices and other communications by dtc to direct participants by direct participants to indirect participants and by direct participants and indirect participants to beneficial owners will be governed by arrangements among them subject to any legal requirements in effect from time to time   redemption notices will be sent to dtc if less than all of the securities of a particular series are being redeemed dtcs practice is to determine by lot the amount of the interest of each direct participant in the securities of such series to be redeemed   neither dtc nor cede  co or such other dtc nominee will consent or vote with respect to the securities under its usual procedures dtc will mail an omnibus proxy to us as soon as possible after the record date the omnibus proxy assigns the consenting or voting rights of cede  co to those direct participants to whose accounts the securities of such series are credited on the record date identified in a listing attached to the omnibus proxy   so long as securities are in bookentry form we will make payments on those securities to the depositary or its nominee as the registered owner of such securities by wire transfer of immediately available funds if securities are issued in definitive certificated form under the limited circumstances described below we will have the option of making payments by check mailed to the addresses of the persons entitled to payment or by wire transfer to bank accounts in the united states designated in writing to the applicable trustee or other designated party at least  days before the applicable payment date by the persons entitled to payment unless a shorter period is satisfactory to the applicable trustee or other designated party   redemption proceeds distributions and dividend payments on the securities will be made to cede  co or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of dtc dtcs practice is to credit direct participants accounts upon dtcs receipt of funds and corresponding detail information from us on the payment date in accordance with their respective holdings shown on dtc records payments by participants to beneficial owners will be governed by standing instructions and customary practices as is the case with securities held for the account of customers in bearer form or registered in street name  those payments will be the responsibility of participants and not of dtc or us subject to any statutory or regulatory requirements in effect from time to time payment of redemption proceeds distributions and dividend payments to cede  co or such other nominee as may be requested by an authorized representative of dtc is our responsibility disbursement of payments to direct participants is the responsibility of dtc and disbursement of payments to the beneficial owners is the responsibility of direct and indirect participants   except under the limited circumstances described below purchasers of securities will not be entitled to have securities registered in their names and will not receive physical delivery of securities accordingly each beneficial owner must rely on the procedures of dtc and its participants to exercise any rights under the securities and the indenture   the laws of some jurisdictions may require that some purchasers of securities take physical delivery of securities in definitive form those laws may impair the ability to transfer or pledge beneficial interests in securities   dtc may discontinue providing its services as securities depositary with respect to the securities at any time by giving reasonable notice to us under such circumstances in the event that a successor depositary is not obtained securities certificates are required to be printed and delivered    table of contents   as noted above beneficial owners of a particular series of securities generally will not receive certificates representing their ownership interests in those securities however if   ·                   dtc notifies us that it is unwilling or unable to continue as a depositary for the global security or securities representing such series of securities or if dtc ceases to be a clearing agency registered under the exchange act at a time when it is required to be registered and a successor depositary is not appointed within  days of the notification to us or of our becoming aware of dtcs ceasing to be so registered as the case may be   ·                   we determine in our sole discretion not to have such securities represented by one or more global securities or   ·                   an event of default has occurred and is continuing with respect to such series of securities we will prepare and deliver certificates for such securities in exchange for beneficial interests in the global securities any beneficial interest in a global security that is exchangeable under the circumstances described in the preceding sentence will be exchangeable for securities in definitive certificated form registered in the names that the depositary directs it is expected that these directions will be based upon directions received by the depositary from its participants with respect to ownership of beneficial interests in the global securities   we have obtained the
