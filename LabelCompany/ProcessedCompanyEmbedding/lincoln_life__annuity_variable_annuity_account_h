daily at the close of trading normally  pm new york time on each day the new york stock exchange is open valuation date on any date other than a valuation date the accumulation unit value and the annuity unit value will not change allocation of purchase payments purchase payments are placed into the vaas subaccounts each of which invests in shares of the class of its corresponding fund of the series according to your instructions the minimum amount of any purchase payment which can be put into any one subaccount is  upon allocation to a subaccount purchase payments are converted into accumulation units the number of accumulation units credited is determined by dividing the amount allocated to each subaccount by the value of an accumulation unit for that subaccount on the valuation date on which the purchase payment is received at our servicing office if received before  pm new york time if the purchase payment is received at or after  pm new york time we will use the accumulation unit value computed on the next valuation date please note if you submit your purchase payment to your agent other than through lincoln financial advisors corp we will not begin processing the purchase payment until we receive it from your agents brokerdealer the number of accumulation units determined in this way is not changed by any subsequent change in the value of an accumulation unit however the dollar value of an accumulation unit will vary depending not only upon how well the underlying funds investments perform but also upon the expenses of the vaa and the underlying funds valuation of accumulation units purchase payments allocated to the vaa are converted into accumulation units this is done by dividing each purchase payment by the value of an accumulation unit for the valuation period during which the purchase payment is allocated to the vaa the accumulation unit value for each subaccount was or will be established at the inception of the subaccount it may increase or decrease from valuation period to valuation period accumulation unit values are affected by investment performance of the funds expenses and deduction of certain charges the accumulation unit value for a subaccount for a later valuation period is determined as follows  the total value of the fund shares held in the subaccount is calculated by multiplying the number of fund shares owned by the subaccount at the beginning of the valuation period by the net asset value per share of the fund at the end of the valuation period and adding any dividend or other distribution of the fund if an exdividend date occurs during the valuation period minus  the liabilities of the subaccount at the end of the valuation period these liabilities include daily charges imposed on the subaccount and may include a charge or credit with respect to any taxes paid or reserved for by us that we determine result from the operations of the vaa and  the result of  is divided by the number of subaccount units outstanding at the beginning of the valuation period the daily charges imposed on a subaccount for any valuation period are equal to the daily mortality and expense risk charge and the daily administrative charge multiplied by the number of calendar days in the valuation period because a different daily charge is imposed for contracts with the egmdb than for those with the guarantee of principal each of the two types of contracts will have different corresponding accumulation unit values on any given day in certain circumstances and when permitted by law it may be prudent for us to use a different standard industry method for this calculation called the net investment factor method we will achieve substantially the same result using either method transfers between subaccounts on or before the annuity commencement date after the first thirty days from the effective date of your contract you may transfer all or a portion of your investment from one subaccount to another a transfer involves the surrender of accumulation units in one subaccount and the purchase of accumulation units in the other subaccount a transfer will be done using the

provides optional forms of payouts of annuities annuity options each of which is payable on a variable basis a fixed basis or a combination of both as you specify the contract provides that all or

less than  we have the right to reduce their frequency until the payouts are at least  each following are explanations of the annuity options available annuity options life annuity this option offers a periodic payout during the lifetime of the annuitant and ends with the last payout before the death of the annuitant this option offers the highest periodic payout since there is no guarantee of a minimum number of payouts or provision for a death benefit for beneficiaries however there is the risk under this option that the recipient would receive no payouts if the annuitant dies before the date set for the first payout only one payout if death occurs before the second scheduled payout and so on life annuity with guaranteed period this option guarantees periodic payouts during a designated period usually  or  years and then continues throughout the lifetime of the annuitant the designated period is selected by the contractowner joint life annuity this option offers a periodic payout during the joint lifetime of the annuitant and a designated joint annuitant the payouts continue during the lifetime of the survivor joint life annuity with guaranteed period this option guarantees periodic payouts during a designated period usually  or  years and continues during the joint lifetime of the annuitant and a designated joint annuitant the payouts continue during the lifetime of the survivor the designated period is selected by the contractowner joint life and twothirds survivor annuity this option provides a periodic payout during the joint lifetime of the annuitant and a designated joint annuitant when one of the joint annuitants dies the survivor receives two thirds of the periodic payout made when both were alive joint life and twothirds survivor annuity with guaranteed period this option provides a periodic payout during the joint lifetime of the annuitant and a joint annuitant when one of the joint annuitants dies the survivor receives two thirds of the periodic payout made when both were alive this option further provides that should one or both of the annuitants dies during the elected guaranteed period usually  or  years full benefit payment will continue for the rest of the guaranteed period unit refund life annuity this option offers a periodic payout during the lifetime of the annuitant with the guarantee that upon death a payout will be made of the value of the number of annuity units see variable annuity payouts equal to the excess if any of a the total amount applied under this option divided by the annuity unit value for the date payouts begin minus b the annuity units represented by each payout to the annuitant multiplied by the number of payouts paid before death the value of the number of annuity units is computed on the date the death claim is approved for payment by the servicing office life annuity with cash refund this option is only available for fixed annuity benefit payments payments will be made for the lifetime of the annuitant with the guarantee that upon death should a the total dollar amount applied to purchase this option be greater than b the fixed annuity benefit payment multiplied by the number of annuity benefit payments paid prior to death then a refund payment equal to the dollar amount of a minus b will be made under the annuity options listed above you may not make withdrawals other options with or without withdrawal features may be made available by us options are only available to the extent they are consistent with the requirements of the contract as well as sections s and a of the tax code if applicable a mortality and expense risk charge of  and the charge for administrative services of  will be assessed on all variable annuity payoutsincluding options that may be offered that do not have a life contingency and therefore no mortality risk variable annuity payouts variable annuity payouts will be determined using the contract value on the annuity commencement date less any applicable premium taxes the annuity tables contained in the contract the annuity option selected and the investment performance of the funds selected to determine the amount of payouts we make this calculation determine the dollar amount of the first periodic payout then credit the contract with a fixed number of annuity units equal to the first periodic payout divided by the annuity unit value and calculate the value of the annuity units each period thereafter  pnath�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th annuity payouts assume an investment return of   or  per year as applied to the applicable mortality table you must choose your assumed interest rate at the time you elect a variable annuity payout on the administrative form provided by lny the higher the assumed interest rate you choose the higher your initial annuity payment will be the amount of each payout after the initial payout will depend upon how the underlying funds perform relative to the assumed rate if the actual net investment rate annualized exceeds the assumed rate the payment will increase at a rate proportional to the amount of such excess conversely if the actual rate is less than the assumed rate annuity payments will decrease the higher the assumed interest rate the less likely future annuity payments are to increase or the payments will increase more slowly than if a lower assumed rate was used there is a more complete explanation of this calculation in the sai general information the guarantee of principal death benefit and the egmdb are not available after the annuity commencement date the annuity commencement date must be on or before the annuitants th birthday you may change the annuity commencement date change the annuity option or change the allocation of the investment among subaccounts up to  days before the scheduled annuity commencement date upon written notice to the servicing office you must give us at least  days notice before the date on which you want payouts to begin annuity payouts cannot commence within  months of the effective date of the contract if proceeds become available to a beneficiary in a lump sum the beneficiary may choose any annuity payout option unless you select another option the contract automatically provides for a life annuity with annuity payouts guaranteed for  years on a fixed variable or combination fixed and variable basis in proportion to the account allocations at the time of annuitization except when a joint life payout is required by law under any option providing for guaranteed period payouts the number of payouts which remain unpaid at the date of the annuitants death or surviving annuitants death in case of joint life annuity will be paid to your beneficiary as payouts become due after lny is in receipt of  proof satisfactory to lny of the death  written authorization for payment and  all claim forms fully completed federal tax matters introduction the federal income tax treatment of the contract is complex and sometimes uncertain the federal income tax rules may vary with your particular circumstances this discussion does not include all the federal income tax rules that may affect you and your contract this discussion also does not address other federal tax consequences including consequences of sales to foreign individuals or entities or state or local tax consequences associated with the contract as a result you should always consult a tax adviser about the application of tax rules to your individual situation nonqualified annuities this part of the discussion describes some of the federal income tax rules applicable to nonqualified annuities a nonqualified annuity is a contract not issued in connection with a qualified retirement plan such as an ira or a section b plan receiving special tax treatment under the tax code we may not offer nonqualified annuities for all of our annuity products tax deferral on earnings the federal income tax law generally does not tax any increase in your contract value until you receive a contract distribution however for this general rule to apply certain requirements must be satisfied  an individual must own the contract or the tax law must treat the contract as owned by an individual  the investments of the vaa must be adequately diversified in accordance with irs regulations  your right to choose particular investments for a contract must be limited  the annuity commencement date must not occur near the end of the annuitants life expectancy contracts not owned by an individual if a contract is owned by an entity rather than an individual the tax code generally does not treat it as an annuity contract for federal income tax purposes this means that the entity owning the contract pays tax currently on the excess of the contract value over the purchase payments for the contract examples of contracts where the owner pays current tax on the contracts earnings bonus credits and persistency credits are contracts issued to a corporation or a trust exceptions to this rule exist for example the tax code treats a contract as owned by an individual if the named owner is a trust or other entity that holds the contract as an agent for an individual however this exception does not apply in the case of any employer that owns a contract to provide deferred compensation for its employees investments in the vaa must be diversified for a contract to be treated as an annuity for federal income tax purposes the investments of the vaa must be adequately diversified irs regulations define standards for determining whether the investments of the vaa are adequately diversified if the vaa fails to comply with these diversification standards you could be required to pay tax currently on the excess of the  pnath�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�th contract value over the contract purchase payments although we do not control the investments of the under lying investment options we expect that the underlying investment options will comply with the irs regulations so that the vaa will be considered adequately diversified restrictions federal income tax law limits your right to choose particular investments for the contract because the irs has not issued guidance specifying those limits the limits are uncertain and your right to allocate contract values among the subaccounts may exceed those limits if so you would be treated as the owner of the assets of the vaa and thus subject to current taxation on the income bonus credits persistency credits and gains from those assets we do not know what limits may be set by the irs in any guidance that it may issue and whether any such limits will apply to existing contracts we reserve the right to modify the contract without your consent to try to prevent the tax law from considering you as the owner of the assets of the vaa loss of interest deduction after june   if a contract is issued to a taxpayer that is not an individual or if a contract is held for the benefit of an entity the entity will lose a portion of its deduction for otherwise deductible interest expenses age at which annuity payouts begin federal income tax rules do not expressly identify a particular age by which annuity payouts must begin how ever those rules do require that an annuity contract provide for amortization through annuity payouts of the contracts purchase payments bonus credits persistency credits and earnings if annuity payouts under the contract begin or are scheduled to begin on a date past the annuitants th birthday it is possible that the tax law will not treat the contract as an annuity for federal income tax purposes in that event you would be currently taxed on the excess of the contract value over the purchase payments of the contract tax treatment of payments we make no guarantees regarding the tax treatment of any contract or of any transaction involving a contract however the rest of this discussion assumes that your contract will be treated as an annuity for federal income tax purposes and that the tax law will not tax any increase in your contract value until there is a distribution from your contract taxation of withdrawals and surrenders you will pay tax on withdrawals to the extent your contract value exceeds your purchase payments in the contract this income and all other income from your contract is considered ordinary income and does not receive capital gains treatment a higher rate of tax is paid on ordinary income than on capital gains you will pay tax on a surrender to the extent the amount you receive exceeds your purchase payments in certain circumstances your purchase payments are reduced by amounts received from your contract that were not included in income taxation of annuity payouts the tax code imposes tax on a portion of each annuity payout at ordinary income tax rates and treats a portion as a nontaxable return of your purchase payments in the contract we will notify you annually of the taxable amount of your annuity payout once you have recovered the total amount of the purchase payment in the contract you will pay tax on the full amount of your annuity payouts if annuity payouts end because of the annuitants death and before the total amount in the contract have been distributed the amount not received will generally be deductible taxation of death benefits we may distribute amounts from your contract because of the death of a contractowner or an annuitant the tax treatment of these amounts depends on whether you or the annuitant dies before or after the annuity commencement date  death prior to the annuity commencement date  if the beneficiary receives death benefits under an annuity payout option they are taxed in the same manner as annuity payouts  if the beneficiary does not receive death benefits under an annuity payout option they are taxed in the same manner as a withdrawal  death after the annuity commencement date  if death benefits are received in accordance with the existing annuity payout option they are excludible from income if they do not exceed the purchase payments not yet distributed from the contract all annuity payouts in excess of the purchase payments not previously received are includible in income  if death benefits are received in a lump sum the tax law imposes tax on the amount of death benefits which exceeds the amount of purchase payments not previously received penalty taxes payable on withdrawals surrenders or annuity payouts the tax code may impose a  penalty tax on any distribution from your contract which you must include in your gross income the  penalty tax does not apply if one of several exceptions exists these exceptions include withdrawals surrenders or annuity payouts that  you receive on or after you reach age    you receive because you became disabled as defined in the tax law  pnast�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�st  a beneficiary receives on or after your death or  you receive as a series of substantially equal periodic payments for your life or life expectancy special rules if you own more than one annuity contract in certain circumstances you must combine some or all of the nonqualified annuity contracts you own in order to determine the amount of an annuity payout a surrender or a withdrawal that you must include in income for example if you purchase two or more deferred annuity contracts from the same life insurance company or its affiliates during any calendar year the tax code treats all such contracts as one contract treating two or more contracts as one contract could affect the amount of a surrender a withdrawal or an annuity payout that you must include in income and the amount that might be subject to the penalty tax described previously loans and assignments except for certain qualified contracts the tax code treats any amount received as a loan under your contract and any assignment or pledge or agreement to assign or pledge any portion of your contract value as a withdrawal of such amount or portion gifting a contract if you transfer ownership of your contract to a person other than your spouse or to your former spouse in cident to divorce and receive a payment less than your contracts value you will pay tax on your contract value to the extent it exceeds your purchase payments not previously received the new owners purchase payments in the contract would then be increased to reflect the amount included in income charges for a contracts death benefit your contract automatically includes a basic death benefit certain enhancements to the basic death benefit may also be available to you the cost of the basic death benefit and any enhancements to such death benefit are deducted from your contract it is possible that the tax law may treat all or a portion of the death benefit charge as a contract withdrawal qualified retirement plans we also designed the contracts for use in connection with certain types of retirement plans that receive favorable treatment under the tax code contracts issued to or in connection with a qualified retirement plan are called qualified contracts we issue contracts for use with various types of qualified plans the federal income tax rules applicable to those plans are complex and varied as a result this prospectus does not attempt to provide more than general information about the use of the contract with the various types of qualified plans persons planning to use the contract in connection with a qualified plan should obtain advice from a competent tax adviser types of qualified contracts and terms of contracts currently we issue contracts in connection with the following types of qualified plans  individual retirement accounts and annuities traditional iras  roth iras  traditional ira that is part of a simplified employee pension plan sep  simple k plans savings incentive matched plan for employees  b plans public school system and taxexempt organization annuity plans  a plans qualified corporate employee pension and profitsharing plans  a plans qualified annuity plans  hr  or keogh plans selfemployed individual plans  b plans deferred compensation plans for state and local governments and taxexempt organizations we may issue a contract for use with other types of qualified plans in the future we may not offer certain types of qualified plans for all of our annuity products we will amend contracts to be used with a qualified plan as generally necessary to conform to the tax law requirements for the type of plan however the rights of a person to any qualified plan benefits may be subject to the plans terms and conditions regardless of the contracts terms and conditions in addition we are not bound by the terms and conditions of qualified plans to the extent such terms and conditions contradict the contract unless we consent economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of  the economic growth and tax relief reconciliation act of  egtrra made a number of changes to the rules pertaining to qualified plans these changes became effective january   some changes that egtrra has introduced are the ability to move money from traditional iras to other qualified plans and from qualified plans to traditional iras increased contribution amounts to qualified plans and catchup contributions to iras it is important to note that while the contribution limits for federal tax purposes have increased applicable state law may not permit increased contributions to your iras or other qualified plans applicable state law may also limit your ability to move your funds among your various qualified plans  pnand�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�nd tax treatment of qualified contracts the federal income tax rules applicable to qualified plans and qualified contracts vary with the type of plan and contract for example  federal tax rules limit the amount of purchase payments that can be made and the tax deduction or exclusion that may be allowed for the purchase payments these limits vary depending on the type of qualified plan and the plan participants specific circumstances eg the participants compensation  under most qualified plans such as a traditional ira the owner must begin receiving payments from the contract minimum amounts by a certain age typically age   other qualified plans may allow the participant to take required distributions upon the later of reaching age   or retirement  loans are allowed under certain types of qualified plans but federal income tax rules prohibit loans under other types of qualified plans for example federal income tax rules permit loans under some section b plans but prohibit loans under traditional and roth iras if allowed loans are subject to a variety of limitations including restrictions as to the loan amount the loans duration the rate of interest and the manner of repayment your contract or plan may not permit loans tax treatment of payments the federal income tax rules generally include distributions from a qualified contract in the recipients income as ordinary income these taxable distributions will include purchase payments that were deductible or excludible from income thus under many qualified contracts the total amount received is included in income since a deduction or exclusion from income was taken for purchase payments there are exceptions for example you do not include amounts received from a roth ira in income if certain conditions are satisfied required minimum distributions under most qualified plans you must begin receiving payments from the contract minimum amounts by the later of age   or retirement you are required to take distributions from your traditional iras beginning in the year you reach age   if you own a roth ira you are not required to receive minimum distributions from your roth ira during your life failure to comply with the minimum distribution rules applicable to certain qualified plans such as traditional iras will result in the imposition of an excise tax this excise tax equals  of the amount by which a minimum required distribution exceeds the actual distribution from the qualified plan the irs has issued new proposed regulations concerning required minimum distributions the proposed regulations may impact the distribution method you have chosen and the amount of your distributions under new proposed regulations the presence of an enhanced death benefit may require you to take additional distributions please contact your tax adviser regarding any tax ramifications federal penalty taxes payable on distributions the tax code may impose a  penalty tax on a distribution from a qualified contract that must be included in income the tax code does not impose the penalty tax if one of several exceptions applies the exceptions vary depending on the type of qualified contract you purchase for example in the case of an ira exceptions provide that the penalty tax does not apply to a withdrawal surrender or annuity payout  received on or after the annuitant reaches age    received on or after the annuitants death or because of the annuitants disability as defined in the tax law  received as a series of substantially equal periodic payments for the annuitants life or life expectancy or  received as reimbursement for certain amounts paid for medical care these exceptions as well as certain others not described here generally apply to taxable distributions from other qualified plans however the specific requirements of the exception may vary transfers and direct rollovers as a result of egtrra you may be able to move funds between different types of qualified plans such as b and b governmental plans by means of a rollover or transfer you may be able to rollover or transfer amounts between qualified plans and traditional iras these rules do not apply to roth iras and b nongovernmental taxexempt plans there are special rules that apply to rollovers direct rollovers and transfers including rollovers or transfers of aftertax amounts if the applicable rules are not followed you may incur adverse federal income tax consequences including paying taxes which you might not otherwise have had to pay before we send a rollover distribution we will provide a notice explaining tax withholding requirements see federal income tax withholding we are not required to send you such notice for your ira you should always consult your tax adviser before you move or attempt to move any funds federal income tax withholding we will withhold and remit to the irs a part of the taxable portion of each distribution made under a contract unless you notify us prior to the distribution that tax is not to be withheld in certain circumstances federal income tax rules may require us to withhold tax at the  pnard�page�of�tocstpreviousnext↓bottomjust�rd time a withdrawal surrender or annuity payout is requested we will give you an explanation of the withholding requirements certain payments from your contract may be considered eligible rollover distributions even if such payments are not being rolled over such distributions may be subject to special tax withholding requirements the federal income tax withholding rules require that we withhold  of the eligible rollover distribution from the payment amount unless you elect to have the amount directly transferred to certain qualified plans or contracts the irs requires that tax be withheld even if you have requested otherwise such tax withholding requirements are generally applicable to a a or b hr  and b governmental plans and contracts used in connection with these types of plans tax status of lny under existing federal income tax laws lny does not pay tax on investment income and realized capital gains of the vaa lny does not expect that it will incur any federal income tax liability on the income and gains earned by the vaa therefore we do not impose a charge for federal income taxes if federal income tax law changes and we must pay tax on some or all of the income and gains earned by the vaa we may impose a charge against the vaa to pay the taxes changes in the law the above discussion is based on the tax code irs regulations and interpretations existing on the date of this prospectus however congress the irs and the courts may modify these authorities sometimes retroactively voting rights as required by law we will vote the series shares held in the vaa at meetings of the shareholders of the series the voting will be done according to the instructions of contractowners who have interests in any subaccounts which invest in classes of funds of the series if the  act

to do so the number of votes which you have the right to cast will be determined by applying your percentage interest in a subaccount to the total number of votes attributable to the subaccount in determining the number of votes fractional shares will be recognized series shares of a class held in a subaccount for which no timely instructions are received will be voted by us in proportion to the voting instructions which are received for all contracts participating in that subaccount voting instructions to abstain on any item to be voted on will be applied on a prorata basis to reduce the

dollar value of the contract on the annuity commencement date  the annuity tables contained in the contract  the type of annuity option selected and  the investment results of the funds selected in order to determine the amount of variable annuity payouts lny makes the following calculation first it determines the dollar amount of the first payout second it credits the contract with a fixed number of annuity units based on the amount of the first payout and third it calculates the value of the annuity units each period thereafter these steps are explained below the dollar amount of the first periodic variable annuity payout is determined by applying the total value of the accumulation units credited under the contract valued as of the annuity commencement date less any premium taxes to the annuity tables contained in the contract the first variable annuity payout will be paid  days after the annuity commencement date this day of the month will become the day on which all future annuity payouts will be paid amounts shown in the tables are based on the  table a individual annuity mortality tables modified with an assumed investment return at the rate of   or  per annum the first annuity payout is determined by multiplying the benefit per  of value shown in the contract tables by the number of thousands of dollars of value accumulated under the contract these annuity tables vary according to the form of annuity selected and the age of the annuitant at the annuity commencement date the assumed interest rate stated above is the measuring point for subsequent annuity payouts if the actual net investment rate annualized exceeds the assumed interest rate the payout will increase at a rate equal to the amount of such excess conversely if the actual rate is less than the assumed interest rate annuity payouts will decrease if the assumed rate of interest were to be increased annuity payouts would start at a higher level but would decrease more rapidly or increase more slowly lny will use sex distinct annuity tables in the contracts except for those contracts associated with employer sponsored plans and where prohibited by law at an annuity commencement date the contract is credited with annuity units for each subaccount on which variable annuity payouts are based the number of annuity units to be credited is determined by dividing the amount of the first periodic payout by the value of an annuity unit in each subaccount selected although the number of annuity units is fixed by this process the value of such units will vary with the value of the underlying fund the amount of the second and subsequent periodic payouts is determined by multiplying the contractowners fixed number of annuity units in each subaccount by the appropriate annuity unit value for the valuation date ending  days prior to the date that payout is due the value of each subaccounts annuity unit will be set initially at an arbitrary dollar amount the annuity unit value for each subaccount at the end of any valuation date is determined by multiplying the subaccount annuity unit value for the immediately preceding valuation date by the product of athe net investment factor of the subaccount for the valuation period for which the annuity unit value is being determined and ba factor to neutralize the assumed investment return in the annuity table the value of the annuity units is determined as of a valuation date  days prior to the payment date in order to permit calculation of amounts of annuity payouts and mailing of checks in advance of their

managing credit what is an annuity simply stated an annuity is a contract between you and an insurance company in which you pay a sum of money either in a lump sum or through periodic contributions and in return receive regular payments for life or for a stated period of time the money grows on a taxdeferred basis until you begin receiving it typically after age   annuities are especially appealing during your retirement years because they help offer protection against outliving your assets annuities are often confused with life insurance but they are not the same once an annuity is converted into payments annuitized it can provide a steady stream of income while you are alive a life insurance policy pays off upon your death and benefits your heirs annuities differ from cds and government bonds as well since they are not federally insured or guaranteed with an annuity you must depend on the financial strength of the insurance company insurance company financial strength is rated by various service companies such as am best or moodys you may want to consider only those insurance companies that carry an a or a rating there are two basic types of annuities fixed and variable fixed annuities fixed annuities can pay a fixed rate of interest for a certain period usually one to five years after the guarantee period is over your assets are automatically rolled over for a new time period at a new rate the new rate will have moved up or down depending on the general direction of interest rates most fixed annuities have a floor or guarantee below which your return will not drop this floor often tied to the treasury bill rate or other index lasts the life of the annuity in general a fixed annuity is characterized by taxdeferred fixed interest rates during the accumulation growth phase fixed payments during the income distribution phase return of principal the amount you invested guaranteed by the insurance company the ability for the insurance company to meet these obligations to policyholders are subject to sufficient capital liquidity cash flow and other resources of the insurance company riskreturn fixed annuities generally offer a lower return than variable annuities but also carry a lower level of risk there are several hybrids of fixed annuities to choose from including the market value adjusted annuity mva the single premium deferred annuity spda the cdtype annuity and the fixed index annuity variable annuities variable annuities are essentially an insurance contract combined with an investment product through a professionally managed subaccount similar to a mutual fund portfolio within your variable annuity you invest in stocks bonds or money market funds or a combination thereof depending on market fluctuations the performance of these investments will vary hence leading to a variable return on the annuity the insurance company does not guarantee a specified rate of return nor does it guarantee a return of the principal your return could potentially be higher than a fixed annuity but your risk is higher too in general a variable annuity is characterized by variable rates of return during the accumulation growth phase principal not guaranteed by the insurance company payments that vary depending on the performance of the underlying investment options death benefit most variable annuities provide a guaranteed death benefit this assures that the owners heirs will receive at least the sum of all premiums paid less any withdrawals more liberal guaranteed death benefits may be available an added risk protection is that variable annuity assets are held in a separate account of the insurance company thus the assets are more protected from the claims of the insurance companys creditors the separate account of a variable annuity is not a mutual fund while separate accounts may have a name similar to a mutual fund it is not the same pool of funds and will experience different performance than the mutual fund of the same or similar name in addition the financial ratings of the issuing insurance company do not apply to any nonguaranteed separate accounts the value of the separate accounts that are not guaranteed will fluctuate in response to the market changes and other factors at a glance fixed vs variable annuities fixed variable investors principal guaranteed by the insurance company not guaranteed but usually pays a minimum death benefit rate of return fixed minimum rate for life of contract additional interest credited periodically varies depending on portfolio performance investment options none investor has multiple choices investment risk insurer is at risk investor is at risk where assets held insurance company general account insurance company separate account so less exposure to companys creditors accessing your annuity for most tax types it is more advantageous not to take payments from an annuity until the age of   there are several ways your money can be returned to you lump sum regular monthly payments for a specified period of time or lifetime income for you and your spouse annuity payments vary depending on amount you have contributed your age length of time your money has been compounding rate of return on the portfolios if you dont need the income stream your annuity can provide it can pass to your beneficiaries outside the probate process although the proceeds will be taxable to them penalties and surrender charges taking payments from your annuity before age   can be expensive since the irs imposes a  penalty on the monies withdrawn in most cases due to the  irs penalty for money taken out before you reach age   most insurance companies allow you to withdraw up to  of your assets before they impose a surrender charge the combination of surrender charges and a possible  penalty means that you may want to view an annuity as a longterm investment × you are now leaving lincoln investment you are now leaving
