justice kennedy opinion of the court notice this opinion is subject to formal revision before publication in the preliminary print of the united states reports readers are requested to notify the reporter of decisions supreme court of the united states washington d c  of any typographical or other formal errors in order that corrections may be made before the preliminary print goes to press supreme court of the united states stoneridge investment partners llcpetitioner v scientificatlantainc et al on writ of certiorari to the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit january       justice kennedy delivered the opinion of the court     we consider the reach of the private right of action the court has found implied in §b of the securities exchange act of  8 stat 8 as amended  u s c §8jb and sec rule b–  cfr §b–  in this suit investors alleged losses after purchasing common stock they sought to impose liability on entities who acting both as customers and suppliers agreed to arrangements that allowed the investors’ company to mislead its auditor and issue a misleading financial statement affecting the stock price we conclude the implied right of action does not reach the customersupplier companies because the investors did not rely upon their statements or representations we affirm the judgment of the court of appeals i     this classaction suit by investors was filed against charter communications inc in the united states district court for the eastern district of missouri stoneridge investment partners llc a limited liability company organized under the laws of delaware was the lead plaintiff and is petitioner here     charter issued the financial statements and the securities in question it was a named defendant along with some of its executives and arthur andersen llp charter’s independent auditor during the period in question we are concerned though with two other defendants respondents here respondents are scientificatlanta inc and motorola inc they were suppliers and later customers of charter     for purposes of this proceeding we take these facts alleged by petitioner to be true charter a cable operator engaged in a variety of fraudulent practices so its quarterly reports would meet wall street expectations for cable subscriber growth and operating cash flow the fraud included misclassification of its customer base delayed reporting of terminated customers improper capitalization of costs that should have been shown as expenses and manipulation of the company’s billing cutoff dates to inflate reported revenues in late  charter executives realized that despite these efforts the company would miss projected operating cash flow numbers by  to  million to help meet the shortfall charter decided to alter its existing arrangements with respondents scientificatlanta and motorola petitioner’s theory as to whether arthur andersen was altogether misled or on the other hand knew the structure of the contract arrangements and was complicit to some degree is not clear at this stage of the case the point however is neither controlling nor significant for our present disposition and in our decision we assume it was misled     respondents supplied charter with the digital cable converter set top boxes that charter furnished to its customers charter arranged to overpay respondents  for each set top box it purchased until the end of the year with the understanding that respondents would return the overpayment by purchasing advertising from charter the transactions it is alleged had no economic substance but because charter would then record the advertising purchases as revenue and capitalize its purchase of the set top boxes in violation of generally accepted accounting principles the transactions would enable charter to fool its auditor into approving a financial statement showing it met projected revenue and operating cash flow numbers respondents agreed to the arrangement     so that arthur andersen would not discover the link between charter’s increased payments for the boxes and the advertising purchases the companies drafted documents to make it appear the transactions were unrelated and conducted in the ordinary course of business following a request from charter scientificatlanta sent documents to charter stating—falsely—that it had increased production costs it raised the price for set top boxes for the rest of  by  per box as for motorola in a written contract charter agreed to purchase from motorola a specific number of set top boxes and pay liquidated damages of  for each unit it did not take the contract was made with the expectation charter would fail to purchase all the units and pay motorola the liquidated damages     to return the additional money from the set top box sales scientificatlanta and motorola signed contracts with charter to purchase advertising time for a price higher than fair value the new set top box agreements were backdated to make it appear that they were negotiated a month before the advertising agreements the backdating was important to convey the impression that the negotiations were unconnected a point arthur andersen considered necessary for separate treatment of the transactions charter recorded the advertising payments to inflate revenue and operating cash flow by approximately  million the inflated number was shown on financial statements filed with the securities and exchange commission sec and reported to the public     respondents had no role in preparing or disseminating charter’s financial statements and their own financial statements booked the transactions as a wash under generally accepted accounting principles it is alleged respondents knew or were in reckless disregard of charter’s intention to use the transactions to inflate its revenues and knew the resulting financial statements issued by charter would be relied upon by research analysts and investors     petitioner filed a securities fraud class action on behalf of purchasers of charter stock alleging that by participating in the transactions respondents violated §b of the securities exchange act of  and sec rule b–     the district court granted respondents’ motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim on which relief can be granted the united states court of appeals for the eighth circuit affirmed in re charter communications inc securities litigation  f d 8  in its view the allegations did not show that respondents made misstatements relied upon by the public or that they violated a duty to disclose and on this premise it found no violation of §b by respondents id at  at most the court observed respondents had aided and abetted charter’s misstatement of its financial results but it noted there is no private right of action for aiding and abetting a §b violation see central bank of denver n a v first interstate bank of denver n a  u s     the court also affirmed the district court’s denial of petitioner’s motion to amend the complaint as the revised pleading would not change the court’s conclusion on the merits  f d at      decisions of the courts of appeals are in conflict respecting when if ever an injured investor may rely upon §b to recover from a party that neither makes a public misstatement nor violates a duty to disclose but does participate in a scheme to violate §b compare simpson v aol time warner inc  f d  ca  with regents of univ of cal v credit suisse first boston usa inc 8 f d  ca  we granted certiorari  u s   ii     section b of the securities exchange act makes it “unlawful for any person directly or indirectly by the use of any means or instrumentality of interstate commerce or of the mails or of any facility of any national securities exchange … to use or employ in connection with the purchase or sale of any security … any manipulative or deceptive device or contrivance in contravention of such rules and regulations as the commission may prescribe as necessary or appropriate in the public interest or for the protection of investors”  u s c §8j the sec pursuant to this section promulgated rule b– which makes it unlawful     “a to employ any device scheme or artifice to defraud     “b to make any untrue statement of a material fact or to omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made in the light of the circumstances under which they were made not misleading or     “c to engage in any act practice or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon any person “in connection with the purchase or sale of any security”  cfr §b– rule b– encompasses only conduct already prohibited by §b united states v o’hagan  u s     though the text of the securities exchange act does not provide for a private cause of action for §b violations the court has found a right of action implied in the words of the statute and its implementing regulation superintendent of ins of n y v bankers life  casualty co  u s   n    in a typical §b private action a plaintiff must prove  a material misrepresentation or omission by the defendant  scienter  a connection between the misrepresentation or omission and the purchase or sale of a security  reliance upon the misrepresentation or omission  economic loss and  loss causation see dura pharmaceuticals inc v broudo  u s  –       in central bank the court determined that §b liability did not extend to aiders and abettors the court found the scope of §b to be delimited by the text which makes no mention of aiding and abetting liability  u s at  the court doubted the implied §b action should extend to aiders and abettors when none of the express causes of action in the securities acts included that liability id at 8 it added the following “were we to allow the aiding and abetting action proposed in this case the defendant could be liable without any showing that the plaintiff relied upon the aider and abettor’s statements or actions see also chiarella v united states  u s   8  allowing plaintiffs to circumvent the reliance requirement would disregard the careful limits on b– recovery mandated by our earlier cases” ibid     the decision in central bank led to calls for congress to create an express cause of action for aiding and abetting within the securities exchange act thensec chairman arthur levitt testifying before the senate securities subcommittee cited central bank and recommended that aiding and abetting liability in private claims be established s hearing no – pp –  congress did not follow this course instead in § of the private securities litigation reform act of  pslra  stat  it directed prosecution of aiders and abettors by the sec  u s c §8te     the §b implied private right of action does not extend to aiders and abettors the conduct of a secondary actor must satisfy each of the elements or preconditions for liability and we consider whether the allegations here are sufficient to do so iii     the court of appeals concluded petitioner had not alleged that respondents engaged in a deceptive act within the reach of the §b private right of action noting that only misstatements omissions by one who has a duty to disclose and manipulative trading practices where “manipulative” is a term of art see eg santa fe industries inc v green  u s  –   are deceptive within the meaning of the rule  f d at  if this conclusion were read to suggest there must be a specific oral or written statement before there could be liability under §b or rule b– it would be erroneous conduct itself can be deceptive as respondents concede in this case moreover respondents’ course of conduct included both oral and written statements such as the backdated contracts agreed to by charter and respondents     a different interpretation of the holding from the court of appeals opinion is that the court was stating only that any deceptive statement or act respondents made was not actionable because it did not have the requisite proximate relation to the investors’ harm that conclusion is consistent with our own determination that respondents’ acts or statements were not relied upon by the investors and that as a result liability cannot be imposed upon respondents a     reliance by the plaintiff upon the defendant’s deceptive acts is an essential element of the §b private cause of action it ensures that for liability to arise the “requisite causal connection between a defendant’s misrepresentation and a plaintiff’s injury” exists as a predicate for liability basic inc v levinson 8 u s   88  see also affiliated ute citizens of utah v united states  u s    requiring “causation in fact” we have found a rebuttable presumption of reliance in two different circumstances first if there is an omission of a material fact by one with a duty to disclose the investor to whom the duty was owed need not provide specific proof of reliance id at – second under the fraudonthemarket doctrine reliance is presumed when the statements at issue become public the public information is reflected in the market price of the security then it can be assumed that an investor who buys or sells stock at the market price relies upon the statement basic supra at      neither presumption applies here respondents had no duty to disclose and their deceptive acts were not communicated to the public no member of the investing public had knowledge either actual or presumed of respondents’ deceptive acts during the relevant times petitioner as a result cannot show reliance upon any of respondents’ actions except in an indirect chain that we find too remote for liability b     invoking what some courts call “scheme liability” see eg in re enron corp securities derivative  “erisa” litigation  f supp d   sd tex  petitioner nonetheless seeks to impose liability on respondents even absent a public statement in our view this approach does not answer the objection that petitioner did not in fact rely upon respondents’ own deceptive conduct     liability is appropriate petitioner contends because respondents engaged in conduct with the purpose and effect of creating a false appearance of material fact to further a scheme to misrepresent charter’s revenue the argument is that the financial statement charter released to the public was a natural and expected consequence of respondents’ deceptive acts had respondents not assisted charter charter’s auditor would not have been fooled and the financial statement would have been a more accurate reflection of charter’s financial condition that causal link is sufficient petitioner argues to apply basic’s presumption of reliance to respondents’ acts see eg simpson  f d at – in re parmalat securities litigation  f supp d   sdny      in effect petitioner contends that in an efficient market investors rely not only upon the public statements relating to a security but also upon the transactions those statements reflect were this concept of reliance to be adopted the implied cause of action would reach the whole marketplace in which the issuing company does business and there is no authority for this rule     as stated above reliance is tied to causation leading to the inquiry whether respondents’ acts were immediate or remote to the injury in considering petitioner’s arguments we note §b provides that the deceptive act must be “in connection with the purchase or sale of any security”  u s c §8jb though this phrase in part defines the statute’s coverage rather than causation and so we do not evaluate the “in connection with” requirement of §b in this case the emphasis on a purchase or sale of securities does provide some insight into the deceptive acts that concerned the enacting congress see black securities commentary the second circuit’s approach to the ‘in connection with’ requirement of rule b–  brooklyn l rev   8 “while the ‘in connection with’ and causation requirements are analytically distinct they are related to each other and discussion of the first requirement may merge with discussion of the second” in all events we conclude respondents’ deceptive acts which were not disclosed to the investing public are too remote to satisfy the requirement of reliance it was charter not respondents that misled its auditor and filed fraudulent financial statements nothing respondents did made it necessary or inevitable for charter to record the transactions as it did     the petitioner invokes the private cause of action under §b and seeks to apply it beyond the securities markets—the realm of financing business—to purchase and supply contracts—the realm of ordinary business operations the latter realm is governed for the most part by state law it is true that if business operations are used as alleged here to affect securities markets the sec enforcement power may reach the culpable actors it is true as well that a dynamic free economy presupposes a high degree of integrity in all of its parts an integrity that must be underwritten by rules enforceable in fair independent accessible courts were the implied cause of action to be extended to the practices described here however there would be a risk that the federal power would be used to invite litigation beyond the immediate sphere of securities litigation and in areas already governed by functioning and effective statelaw guarantees our precedents counsel against this extension see marine bank v weaver  u s   8 “congress in enacting the securities laws did not intend to provide a broad federal remedy for all fraud” santa fe  u s at –8 “there may well be a need for uniform federal fiduciary standards …  but those standards should not be supplied by judicial extension of §b and rule b– to ‘cover the corporate universe’ ” quoting cary federalism and corporate law reflections upon delaware 8 yale l j    though §b is “not ‘limited to preserving the integrity of the securities markets’ ” bankers life  u s at  it does not reach all commercial transactions that are fraudulent and affect the price of a security in some attenuated way     these considerations answer as well the argument that if this were a commonlaw action for fraud there could be a finding of reliance even if the assumption is correct it is not controlling section b does not incorporate commonlaw fraud into federal law see eg sec v zandford  u s 8 8  “section b must not be construed so broadly as to convert every commonlaw fraud that happens to involve securities into a violation” central bank  u s at 8 “even assuming … a deeply rooted background of aiding and abetting tort liability it does not follow that congress intended to apply that kind of liability to the private causes of action in the securities acts” see also dura  u s at  just as §b “is surely badly strained when construed to provide a cause of action … to the world at large” blue chip stamps v manor drug stores  u s   n    it should not be interpreted to provide a private cause of action against the entire marketplace in which the issuing company operates     petitioner’s theory moreover would put an unsupportable interpretation on congress’ specific response to central bank in § of the pslra congress amended the securities laws to provide for limited coverage of aiders and abettors aiding and abetting liability is authorized in actions brought by the sec but not by private parties see  u s c §8te petitioner’s view of primary liability makes any aider and abettor liable under §b if he or she committed a deceptive act in the process of providing assistance reply brief for petitioner  n  tr of oral arg  were we to adopt this construction of §b it would revive in substance the implied cause of action against all aiders and abettors except those who committed no deceptive act in the process of facilitating the fraud and we would undermine congress’ determination that this class of defendants should be pursued by the sec and not by private litigants see alexander v sandoval  u s    “the express provision of one method of enforcing a substantive rule suggests that congress intended to preclude others” fda v brown  williamson tobacco corp  u s    “at the time a statute is enacted it may have a range of plausible meanings over time however subsequent acts can shape or focus those meanings” see also seatrain shipbuilding corp v shell oil co  u s   8 “while the views of subsequent congresses cannot override the unmistakable intent of the enacting one such views are entitled to significant weight and particularly so when the precise intent of the enacting congress is obscure” citations omitted     this is not a case in which congress has enacted a regulatory statute and then has accepted over a long period of time broad judicial authority to define substantive standards of conduct and liability cf leegin creative leather products inc v psks inc  u s    slip op at – and in accord with the nature of the cause of action at issue here we give weight to congress’ amendment to the act restoring aiding and abetting liability in certain cases but not others the amendment in our view supports the conclusion that there is no liability     the practical consequences of an expansion which the court has considered appropriate to examine in circumstances like these see virginia bankshares inc v sandberg  u s 8 –   blue chip  u s at  provide a further reason to reject petitioner’s approach in blue chip the court noted that extensive discovery and the potential for uncertainty and disruption in a lawsuit allow plaintiffs with weak claims to extort settlements from innocent companies id at – adoption of petitioner’s approach would expose a new class of defendants to these risks as noted in central bank contracting parties might find it necessary to protect against these threats raising the costs of doing business see  u s at 8 overseas firms with no other exposure to our securities laws could be deterred from doing business here see brief for organization for international investment et al as amici curiae – this in turn may raise the cost of being a publicly traded company under our law and shift securities offerings away from domestic capital markets brief for nasdaq stock market inc et al as amici curiae – c     the history of the §b private right and the careful approach the court has taken before proceeding without congressional direction provide further reasons to find no liability here the §b private cause of action is a judicial construct that congress did not enact in the text of the relevant statutes see lampf pleva lipkind prupis  petigrow v gilbertson  u s  8–   blue chip supra at  though the rule once may have been otherwise see j i case co v borak  u s  –   it is settled that there is an implied cause of action only if the underlying statute can be interpreted to disclose the intent to create one see eg alexander supra at – virginia bankshares supra at  touche ross  co v redington  u s     this is for good reason in the absence of congressional intentthe judiciary’s recognition of an implied private right of action “necessarily extends its authority to embrace a dispute congress has not assigned it to resolve this runs contrary to the established principle that ‘the jurisdiction of the federal courts is carefully guarded against expansion by judicial interpretation … ’ american fire  casualty co v finn  u s     and conflicts with the authority of congress under art iii to set the limits of federal jurisdiction” cannon v university of chicago  u s    powell j dissenting citations and footnote omitted the determination of who can seek a remedy has significant consequences for the reach of federal power see wilder v virginia hospital assn  u s 8  n   requirement of congressional intent “reflects a concern grounded in separation of powers that congress rather than the courts controls the availability of remedies for violations of statutes”     concerns with the judicial creation of a private cause of action caution against its expansion the decision to extend the cause of action is for congress not for us though it remains the law the §b private right should not be extended beyond its present boundaries see virginia bankshares supra at  “the breadth of the private right of action once recognized should not as a general matter grow beyond the scope congressionally intended” see also central bank supra at  determining that the scope of conduct prohibited is limited by the text of §b     this restraint is appropriate in light of the pslra which imposed heightened pleading requirements and a loss causation requirement upon “any private action” arising from the securities exchange act see  u s c §8u–b it is clear these requirements touch upon the implied right of action which is now a prominent feature of federal securities regulation see merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith inc v dabit  u s  8–8   dura  u s at – see also s rep no –8 p –  recognizing the §b implied cause of action and indicating the pslra was intended to have “congress … reassert its authority in this area” id at  indicating the pleading standards covered §b actions congress thus ratified the implied right of action after the court moved away from a broad willingness to imply private rights of action see merrill lynch pierce fenner  smith inc v curran  u s   and n  8 cf borak supra at  it is appropriate for us to assume that when §8u– was enacted congress accepted the §b private cause of action as then defined but chose to extend it no further iv     secondary actors are subject to criminal penalties see eg  u s c §8ff and civil enforcement by the sec see eg §8te the enforcement power is not toothless since september   sec enforcement actions have collected over  billion in disgorgement and penalties much of it for distribution to injured investors see sec  performance and accountability report p  httpwwwsecgovaboutsecparshtml as visited jan   and available in clerk of court’s case file and in this case both parties agree that criminal penalties are a strong deterrent see brief for respondents 8 reply brief for petitioner  in addition some state securities laws permit state authorities to seek fines and restitution from aiders and abettors see eg del code ann tit  §  all secondary actors furthermore are not necessarily immune from private suit the securities statutes provide an express private right of action against accountants and underwriters in certain circumstances see  u s c §k and the implied right of action in §b continues to cover secondary actors who commit primary violations central bank supra at      here respondents were acting in concert with charter in the ordinary course as suppliers and as matters then evolved in the not so ordinary course as customers unconventional as the arrangement was it took place in the marketplace for goods and services not in the investment sphere charter was free to do as it chose in preparing its books conferring with its auditor and preparing and then issuing its financial statements in these circumstances the investors cannot be said to have relied upon any of respondents’ deceptive acts in the decision to purchase or sell securities and as the requisite reliance cannot be shown respondents have no liability to petitioner under the implied right of action this conclusion is consistent with the narrow dimensions we must give to a right of action congress did not authorize when it first enacted the statute and did not expand when it revisited the law     the judgment of the court of appeals is affirmed and the case is remanded for further proceedings consistent with this opinion it is so ordered justice
