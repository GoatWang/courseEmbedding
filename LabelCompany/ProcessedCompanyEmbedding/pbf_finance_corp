additional mortgage insurance harp targets borrowers with loantovalue ltv ratios equal to or greater than  percent and who have limited delinquencies over the  months prior to refinancing significant changes have been made to harp since the program was first introduced for example in  the ltv ceiling was removed property appraisal requirements were waived in certain circumstances certain risk fees for borrowers selecting shorter amortization terms were eliminated and certain representations and warranties were waived in  the eligibility date was changed from the date the loan was acquired by fannie mae or freddie mac to the date on the note increasing the pool of eligible borrowers through harp you can get a lower interest rate which means less outofpocket costs each month get a shorter
