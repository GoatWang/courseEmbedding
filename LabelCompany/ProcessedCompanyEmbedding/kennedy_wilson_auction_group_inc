auctions financing frequently asked questions glossary why buy at auctions a winwin proposition for buyers and sellers real estate auctions provide great advantages for buyers and sellers for buyers they determine the purchase price also the auction’s open forum allows the buyer to know the true value of a property since they are seeing firsthand what others are willing to pay for sellers auctions accelerate the sales process and they have confidence knowing that buyers are prepared to buy how buyers benefit buyers determine the purchase price and can often save money buyers make smart investments because competitive bidding reveals true market price the buyer knows the seller is committed to sell buyers have the freedom to stop bidding at any time auctions eliminate uncertainty of long negotiation periods auctions reduce time to purchase property purchasing and closing dates are known buyers know they are competing on the same terms as all other buyers buyers receive comprehensive information on a property and available financing how sellers benefit property sells quickly reducing longterm carrying costs prequalified bidders come prepared to buy assurance that property will be sold at true market value property is viewed by the largest number of people that are in the market to buy creates competition among buyers requires potential buyers to prequalify for financing the seller knows exactly when the property will sell eliminates numerous and unscheduled showings oneday bidding replaces lengthy time consuming negotiations contact  s el camino drive
