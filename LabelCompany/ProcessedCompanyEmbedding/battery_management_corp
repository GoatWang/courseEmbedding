utilities manufacturing marine  offshore transportation materials medical battery management systems battery management systems are the brains behind battery packs they manage the output charging and discharging and provide notifications on the status of the battery pack they also provide critical safeguards to protect the batteries from damage loading the player  video transcript welcome to engineeringcoms series on the design of battery packs and battery management systems  in this video well take a look at battery management systems and look at what a battery management system is what it does and well also explore the individual components that typically make up a battery management system  a battery management system is essentially the “brain” of a battery pack it measures and reports crucial information for the operation of the battery and also also protects the battery from damage in a wide range of operating conditions  lets take a look at a battery management system to familiarize ourselves with its components  the single most important function that a battery management system performs is cell protection  lithium ion battery cells have two critical design issues if you overcharge them you can damage them and cause overheating and even explosion or flame so its important to have a battery management system to provide overvoltage protection  lithium ion cells can also be damaged if theyre discharged below a certain threshold approximately  percent of total capacity if the cells are discharged below this threshold their capacity can become permanently reduced  to ensure a batterys charge doesnt go above or below its limits a battery management system has a safeguard device called a dedicated lithiumion protector  every battery protection circuit has two electronic switches called mosfets mosfets are semiconductors used to switch electronic signals on or off in a circuit  a battery management system typically has a discharge mosfet and a charge mosfet  if the protector detects that the voltage across the cells exceeds a certain limit it will discontinue the charge by opening the charge mosfet chip once the charge has gone back down to a safe level then the switch will close again  similarly when a cell drains to a certain voltage the protector will cut off the discharge by opening the discharge mosfet  the second most important function performed by a battery management system is energy management  a good example of energy management is your laptop batterys power meter most laptops today are not only able to tell you how much charge is left in the battery but also what your rate of consumption is and how much time youll have left to use the device before the battery needs to be recharged so in practical terms energy management is very important in portable electronic devices  the key to energy management is coulomb counting for example if you have  people in a room and  people leave youre left with three if three more people enter you now have  people in the room if the room has a capacity of  people with  people inside its  full a battery management system tracks this capacity this state of charge is communicated to the user electronically through a digital bus called an sm bus or through a state of charge display where you press a button and an led display gives you an indication of the total charge in  increments  battery management systems for certain applications like the one for this handheld pointofsales terminal also include an embedded charger consisting of a control device an inductor which is an energy storage device and a discharger the control device manages the charging algorithm for lithiumion cells the ideal charging algorithm is constant current and constant voltage  a battery pack usually consists of several individual cells that work together in combination ideally all the cells in a battery pack should be kept at the same state of charge if the cells go out of balance individual cells can get stressed and lead to premature charge termination and a reduction in the overall cycle life of the battery the cell balancers of the battery management system shown here extend the life of the battery by preventing this imbalance of charge in individual cells from occurring  now that weve gone over the basic components of a battery management system and what they do in the other videos in the series we delve deeper by looking at battery pack design for different applications from large scale to small scale and well also take a look at the unique design challenges a battery pack designer faces like available space heat dissipation requirements and how form factor or “usability” of a device factors into battery pack design    battery management products vecture battery
