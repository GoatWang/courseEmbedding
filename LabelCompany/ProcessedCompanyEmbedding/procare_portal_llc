login search  market drivers when it comes to compensation management healthcare has many issues that need to be corrected healthcare is primed to reform payment models but lacks tools to effectively and appropriately transform simple is best except when its not organizations use less than ideal comp models because complex ones are too hard to calculate and assumed to be error prone what they fail to take into consideration is that even the simplest of models can be error prone you got it no you got it no payers think the system will deal with it systems think the payers will and the providers just know they are in for it providers and systems need tools that can drive and control these changes because no one else is going to do it for them its not about money it is about money the best way to incentivize change is to link it directly to compensation this way there are no conflicting motives  ie getting paid for production but going to meetings and being “required” to improve quality lagging again all other industries use software to manage compensation while healthcare’s is the most complex and still uses primarily excel lack of trust  lack of transparency providers do not get compensation data presented to them frequently enough or in the proper level of detail for them to trust it efficiency deal due diligence compensation planning contract negotiations are all time consuming and difficult to model only getting worse or better more complex models with more issues bundled payments are approaching and no system exists to store adjudicate and model those relationships they’re here the models to improve health outcome are being created but nothing else is being done to relate those deals to providers aco aco like shared savings condition based risk
