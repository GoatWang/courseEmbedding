products ecor® uses a variety of sustainable  recycled post‐industrial post‐consumer and agricultural by‐products and requires no adhesives in the wet forming process the resulting product is an extremely strong remarkably lightweight non‐toxic and versatile material with significant profit potential along with a host of positive economic social and environmental implications visit their website project executive summary noble environmental technologies net has developed a patented composite process to convert waste fibers into ecor® materials which are highly versatile durable and capable of being shaped and molded to any specificationthe ecor® brand is  recycled nontoxic and four times stronger than traditional fiberboard while weighing  less net is interested in developing ways for rapid growth to introduce this revolutionary technology into the market while providing a strong return to investors to assist net in analyzing the feasibility of the licensing model team ecorp used the san diego manufacturing plant as the beta test case to determine valuation we utilized projected sales and costs to determine the expected npv irr profitability index gross operations margin terminal value and payback ratios as a baseline should demand and sales meet expectations net has a very strong financial argument to manufacturers for a licensing model this was reflected with an npv in excess of  million and payback period of less than two years we then created several scenarios to determine the effect they would have on the financial projections the sensitivity analysis demonstrated that raw material price fluctuations do not have much effect on the overall value while demand price discounting and product types have a major influence we find that value per square
