it isnt beauty so to speak nor good talk necessarily its just it some women will stay in a mans memory if they once walk down the street in february  cosmopolitan published a twopart serial story in which glyn defined it that quality possessed by some which draws all others with its magnetic force with it you win all men if you are a woman and all women if you are a man it can be a quality of the mind as well as a physical attraction productionedit paramount pictures paid glyn  for the concept gave her a small part in the film as herself and gave her a story and adaptation credit hope loring louis d lighton and george marion jr titles wrote the screenplay and carl sandburg noted that glyns magazine story was not at all like the film not like it in any respect in the original version of the story the character with the magnetic personality was a male paramount producers suggested the character be female also the original female character ava cleveland was upper class whereas betty lou is working class nevertheless glyn was fully involved in the film adaptation and was very flexible about the transition clara bow on the marquee of a theater in kansas city showing it this is one of the first examples of a concept film as well as one of the earlier examples of product placement the concept of it is referred to throughout the film including the scene where glyn appears as herself and defines it for mr waltham cosmopolitan magazine is featured prominently in a scene where the character monty reads glyns story and introduces it to the audience stage actress dorothy tree had her first film role in a small uncredited part a young gary cooper was cast in a minor role as a newspaper reporter receptionedit it was a hit with audiences all over the united states breaking box office records critics praised the film especially its star as a joy to behold it turned clara bow from an up and coming movie actress into the biggest movie star of the s who in the process became a film legend as a result of it the term the it girl has since entered the cultural lexicon see alsoedit the house that shadows built  promotional film by paramount manic pixie dream girl
