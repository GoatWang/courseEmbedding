company the sec defines those companies as “any development stage company that is issuing a penny stock within the meaning of section a of the securities exchange act of  as amended the “exchange act” and that has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to merge with an unidentified company or companies” under sec rule b under the exchange act the company also qualifies as a “shell company” because it has no or nominal assets other than cash and no or nominal operations  many states have enacted statutes rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of “blank check” companies in their respective jurisdictions management has undertaken steps to have the company’s common stock traded on the otc market the market is illiquid there has been no trading of any significance and there can be no assurance that a trading market of any significance will develop or that there will be any depth to any such market that may develop management does not intend to undertake any significant efforts to cause a market to develop in our securities until we have successfully concluded a business combination the company is subject to the periodic reporting requirements of the exchange act under section d as a result of its registration statement on form s being declared effective by the sec and intends to comply with the periodic reporting requirements of the exchange act for so long as it is subject to those requirements   the accounting and reporting policies of the company conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and the company’s fiscal year end is may             note     summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “gaap” the accompanying interim unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles for interim financial information in accordance with article  of regulation sx accordingly they do not include all of the information and footnotes required by generally accepted accounting principles for complete financial statements while management of the company believes that the disclosures presented herein are adequate and not misleading these interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements and the footnotes thereto for the year ended may      use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements the estimates and judgments will also affect the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could materially differ from those estimates   cash and cash equivalents   the company considers highly liquid financial instruments purchased with a maturity of three months or less to be cash equivalents   the company’s bank accounts are deposited in insured institutions the funds are insured up to usd in hong kong insured institutions at may   the company’s bank deposits did not exceed the insured amounts   earnings per share   the company computes earnings loss per share in accordance with asc  “earnings per share” which requires presentation of both basic and diluted earnings per share on the face of the statement of operations basic earnings loss per share is computed by dividing net earnings loss available to common stockholders by the weighted average number of outstanding common shares during the period  diluted earnings loss per share gives effect to all dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period  dilutive earnings loss per share excludes all potential common shares if their effect is antidilutive the company has no potential dilutive instruments and therefore basic and diluted earnings loss per share are equal   commitments and contingencies   the company follows asc  “loss contingencies” to report accounting for contingencies  liabilities for loss contingencies arising from claims assessments litigation fines and penalties and other sources are recorded when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the assessment can be reasonably estimated  there were no commitments or contingencies at november   and may              prepaid expenses   prepaid expenses are cash paid amounts that represent costs incurred from which a service or benefit is expected to be derived in the future the future writeoff period of the incurred cost will normally be determined by the period of benefit covered by the prepayment when the period arrives to which a prepaid cost relates the costs will be treated as a period cost for the period in question normally such prepaid costs will be amortized based on the elapse of time   revenue recognition   the company will recognize revenue in accordance with accounting standards codification no  “revenue recognition” “asc” asc requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the selling price is fixed and determinable and  collectability is reasonably assured determination of criteria  and  are based on management’s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the selling prices of the products delivered and the collectability of those amounts provisions for discounts and rebates to customers estimated returns and allowances and other adjustments are provided for in the same period the related sales are recorded the company will defer any revenue for which the product has not been delivered or is subject to refund until such time that the company and the customer jointly determine that the product has been delivered or no refund will be required   fair value of financial instruments   the company applies the provisions of asc subtopic  “fair value measurements” “asc ” for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements  asc  also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements      fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date  when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability    asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  establishes three levels of inputs that may be used to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows     ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets     ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instruments     ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value   there were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of asc  as of november              stockbased compensation   the company recognizes stockbased compensation in accordance with asc topic  “stock compensation” which requires the measurement and recognition of compensation expense for all sharebased payment awards made to employees and directors including employee stock options and employee stock purchases related to an employee stock purchase plan based on the estimated fair values   recently issued accounting principles   revenue recognition   in may  the fasb issued accounting standards update  “revenue from contracts with customers” “asu ” this new standard will replace all current us gaap guidance on this topic and eliminate all industryspecific guidance the new revenue recognition standard provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is recognized the core principle is that a company should recognize revenue to correlate with the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration for which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services in july  the fasb voted to defer the effective date of asu  by one year while allowing a company to adopt the new revenue standard early but not before the original effective date as such the updated standard will be effective for the company in the first quarter of  with the option to adopt it in the first quarter of  the company has evaluated the effect on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures and concluded that the adoption of this asu is not expected to have a material impact on the company’s consolidated financial statements   liabilities   in february  fasb issued asu no  “consolidation topic  amendments to the consolidation analysis” the new consolidation standard changes the way reporting enterprises evaluate whether a they should consolidate limited partnerships and similar entities b fees paid to a decision maker or service provider are variable interests in a vie and c variable interests in a vie held by related parties of the reporting enterprise require the reporting enterprise to consolidate the vie the guidance is effective for public business entities for annual and interim periods in fiscal years beginning after december   early adoption is allowed including early adoption in an interim period a reporting entity may apply a modified retrospective approach by recording a cumulativeeffect adjustment to equity as of the beginning of the fiscal year of adoption or may apply the amendments retrospectively the company is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this guidance on the consolidated financial statements   financial instruments   in january  the fasb issued asu no  “financial instruments  overall subtopic  recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities” “asu ” the standard addresses certain aspects of recognition measurement presentation and disclosure of financial instruments asu  is effective for fiscal years and interim periods within those years beginning after december   and early adoption is not permitted accordingly the standard is effective for us on september   the company is currently evaluating the impact that the standard will have on the company’s consolidated financial statements   leases   in february  the fasb issued asu no  “leases topic ” “asu ” which provides guidance on lease amendments to the fasb accounting standard codification this asu will be effective for us beginning in may   the company is currently in the process of evaluating the impact of the adoption of asu  on the company’s consolidated financial statements   stockbased compensation   in march  the fasb issued asu  “compensation—stock compensation topic  improvements to employee sharebased payment accounting” “asu ” asu  changes how companies account for certain aspects of stockbased awards to employees including the accounting for income taxes forfeitures and statutory tax withholding requirements as well as classification in the statement of cash flows asu  is effective for us in the first quarter of  and earlier adoption is permitted we are still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on our consolidated financial statements and related disclosures            financial instruments  credit losses   in june  the fasb issued asu  “financial instruments  credit losses topic ” “asu ” the amendments in this update require a financial asset or a group of financial assets measured at amortized cost basis to be presented at the net amount expected to be collected the amendments broaden the information that an entity must consider in developing its expected credit loss estimate for assets measured either collectively or individually the use of forecasted information incorporates more timely information in the estimate of expected credit loss which will be more decision useful to users of the financial statements asu  is effective for the company for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years early adoption is allowed as of the fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years the company is still evaluating the effect that this guidance will have on the company’s consolidated financial statements and related disclosures   except for the asus above in the period from may   to november   the fasb has issued asu no  through asu  which are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption   note  – going concern   the company’s financial statements as of november   have been prepared using generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america applicable to a going concern which contemplates the realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the normal course of business the company has incurred a cumulative net loss of  and cash used in operating activities of  for the six months ended at november   these conditions raise substantial doubt about the ability of the company to continue as a going concern   in order to continue as a going concern the company will need among other things additional capital resources management’s plan is to obtain such resources for the company by obtaining capital from management and significant shareholders sufficient to meet its minimal operating expenses and seeking equity andor debt financing however management cannot provide any assurances that the company will be successful in accomplishing any of its plans these financial statements do not include any adjustments related to the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern   note  – prepaid expenses   the prepaid expense was the annual fee payment for the otc market the amount was  and  as of november   and may   respectively   note  – related parties transaction   in support of the company’s efforts and cash requirements it may rely on advances from related parties until such time that the company can support its operations or attains adequate financing through sales of its equity or traditional debt financing there is no formal written commitment for continued support by officers directors or shareholders amounts represent advances or amounts paid in satisfaction of liabilities the advances are considered temporary in nature and have not been formalized by a promissory note     as of november   and may   the amount due to shareholder was  and zero respectively the amount due to shareholder is noninterest bearing due upon demand and unsecured            note  – equity   on june     on a postsplit basis common shares at a price of  per share for total net proceeds of  were issued to the company’s sole officer and director   during the period from january  to april  the company issued   shares at a price of  for total proceeds of    on may   the board of directors of the company approved resolutions to i increase the authorized number of shares of common stock from  shares of  par value common stock to  shares of  par value common stock “increase in authorized” and ii effect a  forward split of the company’s authorized issued and outstanding shares of common stock at the later of such time as the directors should determine to make it effective or one day after the amendment to increase the number of the company’s authorized shares is filed with the nevada secretary of state “forward stock split” the increase in authorized and the forward stock split shall be sometimes referred to collectively as the “amendments” on that same date shareholders of the company holding  of the company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock signed consent resolutions approving the amendments   on june   the company filed an amendment to the company’s articles of incorporation with the nevada secretary of state to increase the authorized shares of the company’s common stock on june   the company filed a certificate of change with the nevada secretary of state to provide notice of the  forward split of the company’s common stock the forward stock split became effective on august   as a result of the forward stock split the number of the company’s issued and outstanding shares of common stock was increased from  to    note  – income tax   the company uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes in accordance with asc topic  “income taxes” under this method income tax expense is recognized for the amount of i taxes payable or refundable for the current year and ii deferred tax consequences of temporary differences resulting from matters that have been recognized in an entity’s financial statements or tax returns deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled   the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the results of operations in the period that includes the enactment date a valuation allowance is provided to reduce the deferred tax assets reported if based on the weight of the available positive and negative evidence it is more likely than not some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized   asc topic  clarifies the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes recognized in an enterprise’s financial statements and prescribes a recognition threshold and measurement attribute for the financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in a tax return asc topic  provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosure and transition there are no material uncertain tax positions for any of the reporting periods presented   as of november   the company in the united states had  in net operating loss carry forwards available to offset future taxable income federal net operating losses can generally be carried forward twenty years the company believes that it is more likely than not that these net accumulated operating losses will not be utilized in the future therefore the company has provided full valuation allowance for the deferred tax assets arising from the losses at us accordingly the company has no net deferred tax assets under the us entity   note  – subsequent events   management has evaluated subsequent events through the date these financial statements were available to be issued and based on their evaluation no events have occurred that would require disclosure            item   management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations    forward looking statement notice   certain statements made in this quarterly report on form q are “forwardlooking statements” within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of  in regard to the plans and objectives of management for future operations such statements involve known and unknown risks uncertainties and other factors that may cause actual results performance or achievements of savden group corp to be materially different from any future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements the forwardlooking statements included herein are based on current expectations that involve numerous risks and uncertainties the company’s plans and objectives are based in part on assumptions involving its ability to identify a target candidate to negotiate the terms of the acquisition of the target candidate and then to consummate the acquisition assumptions relating to the foregoing involve judgments with respect to among other things future economic competitive and market conditions and future business decisions all of which are difficult or impossible to predict accurately and many of which are beyond the control of the company although the company believes its assumptions underlying the forwardlooking statements are reasonable any of the assumptions could prove inaccurate and therefore there can be no assurance the forwardlooking statements included in this quarterly report will prove to be accurate in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forwardlooking statements included herein the inclusion of such information should not be regarded as a representation by the company or any other person that the objectives and plans of the company will be achieved   description of business   the company intends to investigate and if such investigation warrants acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publicly held corporation our principal business objective for the next twelve months and beyond such time will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a combination with a business rather than immediate shortterm earnings the company will not restrict our potential candidate target companies to any specific business or industry and thus may acquire any type of business although management has not restricted the geographical location of the target companies to china management believes that it is probable that the targets evaluated will be based in china or asia   the company currently does not engage in any business activities that provide cash flow  during the next twelve months we anticipate incurring costs related to   i filing periodic reports under the securities exchange act of  as amended and   ii investigating analyzing and consummating an acquisition   we believe we will be able to meet these costs through deferral of fees by certain service providers and additional amounts as necessary to be loaned to or invested in us by our stockholders management or other investors  there are no assurances that the company will be able to secure any additional funding as needed currently our ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon our ability to generate future profitable operations andor to obtain the necessary financing to meet our obligations and repay our liabilities arising from normal business operations when they come due  our ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on our ability to find a suitable target company and enter into a possible reverse merger with such company management’s plan includes obtaining additional funds by equity financing through a reverse merger transaction andor related party advances however there is no assurance of additional funding being available            the company may consider acquiring a business which has recently commenced operations is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets is seeking to develop a new product or service or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering   any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth including entities without established records of sales or earnings in that event we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies in addition we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks our management anticipates that it will likely be able to effect only one business combination due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective stockholders which is likely to occur as a result of our management’s plan to offer a controlling interest to a target business in order to achieve a taxfree reorganization this lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another   the company anticipates that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky  through information obtained from industry publications and professionals our management believes that there are numerous firms seeking the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation such perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded corporation include among other things facilitating or improving the terms on which additional equity financing may be obtained providing liquidity for the principals of and investors in a business creating a means for providing incentive stock options or similar benefits to key employees and offering greater flexibility in structuring acquisitions joint ventures and the like through the issuance of stock potentially available business combinations may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex  we do not currently intend to retain any entity to act as a “finder” to identify and analyze the merits of potential target businesses   results of operations   we have not generated any revenue to date and have incurred recurring losses since inception it is unlikely the company will have any revenues unless it is able to effect an acquisition or merger with an operating company of which there can be no assurance  our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and accordingly do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation we expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements we expect to raise additional capital through among other things the sale of equity or debt securities it is management’s assertion that these circumstances may hinder the company’s ability to continue as a going concern  the company’s plan of operation for the next twelve months shall be to continue its efforts to locate suitable acquisition candidates    the following table provides

liabilities of  as of may   which was comprised of accrued expenses the company can provide no assurance that it can continue to satisfy its cash requirements for at least the next twelve months   the following is a summary of the company’s cash flows provided by used in operating investing and financing activities for the six months ended november   and        six months ended november       six months ended november     net cash used in provided by operating activities           net cash used in investing activities               net cash provided by financing activities               net increase in cash and cash equivalents               the company has nominal assets and has generated no revenues since inception the company is also dependent upon the receipt of capital investment or other financing to fund its ongoing operations and to execute its business plan of seeking a combination with a private operating company in addition the company is dependent upon certain related parties to provide continued funding and capital resources if continued funding and capital resources are unavailable at reasonable terms the company may not be able to implement its

operations primarily from either advances from shareholders or the issuance of equity instruments for the six months november   net cash provided by financing activities was  for the amount due to shareholder for the six months november   net cash provided by financing activities was  from proceeds from the issuance of common stock     going concern consideration   there is substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern unless we are able to effect our business plan and raise funds necessary to continue operations the financial statements have been prepared “assuming that we will continue as a going concern” which contemplates that we will realize our assets and satisfy our liabilities and commitments in the ordinary course of business there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue as a going concern and the financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if we are unable to continue as a going concern   offbalance sheet arrangements   as of the date of this quarterly report the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the company’s financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors   contractual obligations   as a “smaller reporting company” as defined by item  of regulation sk the company is not required to provide this information    critical accounting policies and estimates   we prepare our condensed financial statements in conformity with gaap which requires management to make certain estimates and apply judgments we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience current trends and other factors that management believes to be important at the time the condensed financial statements are prepared on a regular basis we review our accounting policies and how they are applied and disclosed in our condensed financial statements   while we believe that the historical experience current trends and other factors considered support the preparation of our condensed financial statements in conformity with gaap actual results could differ from our estimates and such differences could be material   item   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk    as a “smaller reporting company” as defined by item  of regulation sk the company is not required to provide information required by this item            item   controls and procedures    evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures   under the supervision and with the participation of our then principal executive officer and principal financial officer chan wai lun we conducted an evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as such term is defined under rule ae and rule de promulgated under the securities exchange act of  as amended as of may   based on this evaluation mr chan wai lun concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were ineffective at such time to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports filed or submitted under the exchange act were recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the securities and exchange commission’s rules and forms our principal executive officer and principal financial officer also concluded that our disclosure controls which are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by us in the reports that we file or submit under the exchange act is accumulated and communicated to management were inappropriate to allow timely decisions regarding required disclosure   based on mr chan’s assessment he concluded that there were material weaknesses in its internal control over financial reporting as of may   based on the material weaknesses described below     ● because the company consists of one person who acts as the sole officer and director of the company there are limited controls over information processing     ● there is an inadequate segregation of duties consistent with control objectives as management is composed of only one person in order to remedy this situation we would need to hire additional staff to provide greater segregation of duties currently it is not feasible to hire additional staff to obtain optimal segregation of duties management will reassess this matter after the company completes a reverse merger or business combination to determine whether improvement in segregation of duty is feasible     ● the company does not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert and thus the company lacks the board oversight role within the financial reporting process     ● there is a lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions   the company utilizes a third party independent contractor for the preparation of its financial statements although the financial statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions the third party independent contractor is not involved in the day to day operations of the company and may not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reportingconsideration of certain transactions   as a result of this material weakness our management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of may   a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis a significant deficiency is a deficiency or a combination of deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting that is less severe than a material weakness yet important enough to merit attention by those responsible for oversight of the company’s financial reporting   in order to mitigate the foregoing material weakness we have engaged an outside accounting consultant with significant experience in the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap to assist us in the preparation of our financial statements to ensure that these financial statements are prepared in conformity to us gaap management believes that this will lessen the possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will occur and will increase the possibility that such a misstatement will be prevented or detected on a timely basis and we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of this action and make any changes that our management deems appropriate   we plan to rectify these deficiencies upon consummation of a business combination with an operating company when we expect to have sufficient resources so that a majority of the board will consist of independent board members and the number of personnel performing key functions in the company can be increased so that duties can be better segregated there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to accomplish these goals            evaluation of internal controls and procedures   management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as defined in rule af under the exchange act internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by or under the supervision of the company’s principal executive principal operating and principal financial officers or persons performing similar functions and effected by the company’s board of directors management and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america   the company’s internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that  pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the company’s assets  provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of the company’s management and directors and  provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of the company’s assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements   because of its inherent limitations internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate   our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting at may   in making this assessment management used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal control—integrated framework based on that assessment under those criteria management concluded that as of may   the company’s internal control over financial reporting was not effective   subsequent to the change in control that occurred in may  our sole officer and director considered our disclosure controls and procedures and concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures for the fiscal year ended may   were ineffective   mr dong yingzhi our sole officer and director considered our internal controls and procedures in connection with this report on form q and concluded that we continue to have material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting because we do not have an independent board of directors or audit committee or adequate segregation of duties since there is a single officer and director further we have no independent body to oversee our internal control over financial reporting the lack of segregation of duties is due to the limited nature and resources of the company    we plan to rectify these deficiencies upon consummation of a business combination with an operating company when we expect to have sufficient resources so that a majority of the board will consist of independent board members and the number of personnel performing key functions in the company can be increased so that duties can be better segregated there can be no assurance that we will have sufficient resources to accomplish these goals   this quarterly report does not include an attestation report of our registered public accounting firm regarding internal control over financial
