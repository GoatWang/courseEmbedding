sues claiming retaliation over misgivings in anthrax case by scott shaneapril   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story washington — when bruce e ivins an army microbiologist took a fatal overdose of tylenol in  the government declared that he had been responsible for the anthrax letter attacks of  which killed five people and set off a nationwide panic and closed the casenow a former senior fbi agent who ran the anthrax investigation for four years says that the bureau gathered “a staggering amount of exculpatory evidence” regarding dr ivins that remains secret the former agent richard l lambert who spent  years at the fbi says he believes it is possible that dr ivins was the anthrax mailer but he does not think prosecutors could have convicted him had he lived to face criminal chargesin a lawsuit filed in federal court in tennessee last thursday mr lambert accused the bureau of trying “to railroad the prosecution of ivins” and after his suicide creating “an elaborate perception management campaign” to bolster its claim that he was guilty mr lambert’s lawsuit accuses the bureau and the justice department of forcing his dismissal from a job as senior counterintelligence officer at the energy department’s lab in oak ridge tenn in retaliation for his dissent on the anthrax case advertisement continue reading the main story the anthrax letters were mailed to united states senators and news organizations in the weeks after the sept   terrorist attacks causing a huge and costly disruption in the postal system and the federal government members of congress and supreme court justices were forced from their offices while technicians in biohazard suits cleaned up the lethal anthrax powder decontamination costs nationwide exceeded  billion at least  people were sickened in addition to the five who died continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story the bureau’s investigation one of the longestrunning and most technically complex inquiries in its history has long been seen as troubled investigators initially lacked the forensic skills to analyze bioterrorist attacks for several years agents focused on a former army scientist and physician dr steven j hatfill who was subsequently cleared and given a  million settlement to resolve a lawsuit reviews by the national academy of sciences and the government accountability office faulted aspects of the fbi’s scientific work on the case photo the late bruce ivins in  when he was a microbiologist at fort detrick md credit sam yufrederick news post via assocaited press mr lambert who was himself criticized for pursuing dr hatfill for so long has now offered in his lawsuit and in an interview an insider’s view of what hampered the investigation“this case was hailed at the time as the most important case in the history of the fbi” mr lambert said “but it was difficult for me to get experienced investigators assigned to it”he said that the effort was understaffed and plagued by turnover and that  of  agents assigned to the case had no prior investigative experience senior bureau microbiologists were not made available and two phd microbiologists who were put on the case were then removed for an month arabic language program in israel fear of leaks led top officials to order the extreme compartmentalization of information with investigators often unable to compare notes and share findings with colleagues he saidmr lambert said he outlined the problems in a formal complaint in  to the fbi’s deputy director some of his accusations were later included in a report on the anthrax case by the cbs news program “ minutes” infuriating bureau leadersthe fbi which rarely comments on pending litigation did not respond to requests for comment on mr lambert’s claimsalthough the lethal letters contained notes expressing jihadist views investigators came to believe the mailer was an insider in the government’s biodefense labs they eventually matched the anthrax powder to a flask in dr ivins’s lab at fort detrick in maryland and began intense scrutiny of his life and work photo the police in frederick md spoke with a woman they identified as diane ivins the wife of bruce e ivins  at the couples home in frederick md in  credit rob carrassociated press they discovered electronic records that showed he had spent an unusual amount of time at night in his highsecurity lab in the periods before the two mailings of the anthrax letters they found that he had a pattern of sending letters and packages from remote locations under assumed names they uncovered emails in which he described serious mental problems advertisement continue reading the main story the investigators documented dr ivins’s obsession with a national sorority that had an office near the princeton nj mailbox where the letters were mailed they detected what they believed to be coded messages directed at colleagues hidden in the notes in the lettersas prosecutors prepared to charge him with the five murders in july  dr ivins  took his own life at home in frederick md days later at a news conference jeffrey a taylor then the united states attorney for the district of columbia said the authorities believed “that based on the evidence we had collected we could prove his guilt to a jury beyond a reasonable

large amount of evidence pointing away from dr ivins’s guilt that was never shared with the public or the news media had the case come to trial he said “i absolutely do not think they could have proved his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt” he declined to be specific saying that most of the information was protected by the privacy act and was unlikely to become public unless congress carried out its own inquiryafter retiring from the fbi in  mr lambert joined the energy department but an fbi ethics lawyer ruled that because mr lambert had to work with fbi agents in his new job he was violating a conflictofinterest law that forbade former federal employees from contacting previous colleagues for a year after they had left their government jobsthat ruling led to his dismissal mr lambert said and he has not been able to find work despite applying for more than  jobs his lawsuit asserts that several other former fbi agents were able to take identical intelligence jobs with the
