more particularly to a recipient centric messaging system and protocols used to implement the recipient centric messaging system over data networksdescription of the related artcommunication is fundamental to how humans function in social and business settings electronic devices are prominently used for communication over data networks a data network is a telecommunication network that allows electronic devices to exchange data with each other along network links or data connections that are established using either wired or wireless media the bestknown data network is the internet the internet has brought about a revolution in communication by enabling synchronous as well as asynchronous communicationone of the oldest forms of asynchronous communication is email which is particularly prevalent among first generation internet users and is often used as a preferred form of communication particularly at the workplace email is sender centric in that once a sender has a recipients address heshe can send any type of message or any number of messages to that recipient in email there is no way for the recipient to control the content of received messages eg attachments images etc email is very easy to access and there is no cost to send bulk messages but as a result lowquality content irrelevant andor inappropriate messages get sent which recipients are responsible for filtering out hence it has become a huge challenge for most of us to prioritize and focus on the emails that deserve our attention over the ones that dont since each of us has a limited amount of time and attention those of us who are unable to prioritize end up being less productive at work andor losing control of our worklife balance or end up missing on important messages that get misclassified as spamthere are numerous email clientapps and free email services available and many of them have sophisticated spam filtering techniques to help users with this deluge of email but they are still noisy furthermore even legitimate messages can be lost while filtering spam the simple mail transfer protocol smtp is the internet standard used to carry email in the process of transporting email messages between systems the smtp communicates delivery parameters using a message envelope that is separate from the message eg header and body itself although electronic mail servers and other mail transfer agents use smtp to send and receive mail messages userlevel client mail applications typically use smtp only for sending messages to a mail server for relaying for receiving messages client applications usually use protocols such as pop or imapalthough proprietary systems eg microsoft exchange and ibm notes and webmail systems eg outlookcom gmail and yahoo mail use their own nonstandard protocols to access mail box accounts on their own mail servers they use smtp when sending or receiving email from outside their own systems current email protocols and systems have no way of enforcing constraints on messages since the existing protocols eg smtp pop imap and mapi are optimized to make sending messages easy and any email system has to comply with these protocols in order to send or receive email from outside their own systems given the large number of existing implementations of email clients adding new protocols on top of the existing ones is very difficult the power of email is its ubiquity and the variety of email clients that one can use but this same variety makes it very challenging to change the email protocols once the email address is compromised to spammers the only solution is to change the email address at the same time people often make it hard to find their email address to avoid getting irrelevant messages which makes for the opposite challengeprofessional networks like linkedin allow users to freely message people within their own professional networks but impose restrictions on messaging people outside their network their business model is based on relaxing these restrictions by paying the third party a fee eg a subscription nowadays digital advertising has become pervasive it is embedded within websites within feeds of facebook linkedin twitter etc within news sites within videos on youtube and so on all of these advertisements are seeking your attention and your time and trying to influence you the third party run websites claim to provide you with free services eg free news articles free ways to store your photos and connect with your friends free videos and so on in return for your attention and your time almost all of the revenue generated from advertising is however typically kept by the company providing the service despite your contribution as a user by providing relevant content and your profile information that keeps other users interested in spending time on these websites many of these companies have become hugely profitable like facebook google and linkedinthe business model associated with such freeservices and advertising has recently come into question in terms of the negative implications it has for the future of society one book on the topic is “who owns the future” by jaron lanier he posits that the middle class is increasingly disenfranchised from online economies by convincing users to give away valuable information about themselves in exchange for free services firms can accrue large amounts of data at virtually no cost lanier calls these firms “siren servers” alluding to the sirens of ulysses instead of paying each individual for their contribution to the data pool the siren servers concentrate wealth in the hands of the few who control the data centersfurther since people are on multiple web sites and each site has their own communication system people need to manage their communication on multiple sites which leads to a fragmentation of time and attention for example an influential might get hundreds of messages per day across multiple communication channels with asks on his attention such as review requests speaking engagement requests etc and have full time staff to handle such requests many times messages might be lost if the influential did not check the message on the particular channel engineers might hear from recruiters more than ten times a week but many of these messages might go to an email address that they dont check oftendifferent people are likely to receive very different amounts of messages depending on where they live their income level their profile information etc job seekers might be open to receiving as many opportunities as possible a large number of people might receive very few messages omen might be open to receiving relevant messages on sites like quora but many of them are bombarded with inappropriate messages this is especially true if they have a photo on their profile where men send them dating requests etc accordingly there remain a need for a communication system that is i flexible and welldesigned and provides a single place to check and reply to messages from people outside their social network and ii addresses concerns and needs of a multitude of users across different segments in a way that they are comfortable with having a public communication addresssummaryin view of the foregoing an embodiment herein provides a method of communicating at least one message between a sender and a recipient using a communications protocol over a data network through a recipient centric messaging system the method includes a receiving communication preferences

executed by the processor may determine a reputation score for the sender based on feedback from the recipient on at least one of i a priority level of the first message ii whether the first message is properly classified by the sender or iii whether the message is offensive or inappropriate to the recipientthe reputation scoring module may further determine the reputation score for the sender based on an analysis of a message history of the sender using predefined rules based on at least one of a a number of messages sent by the sender to the recipient b fraction or percentage of messages marked as irrelevant messages by the recipient and c fraction or percentage of messages replied to by the recipientin yet another embodiment the reputation scoring module further determines the reputation score for the sender using a machine learning algorithm which analyzes a plurality of parameters selected from a group consisting of a a number of messages sent by the sender to one or more recipients b fraction or percentage of messages replied to by the one or more recipients c relevance ratings assigned to the messages by the one or more recipients d length of replies sent by the recipient or e sentiment analysis of the messagesin yet another embodiment the recipient centric messaging system includes a set of application programming interfaces and a protocol that specifies how the sender can send the messages and how the recipient can receive the messages over the recipient centric messaging system the protocol includes specific requirements for honoring the communications preferences the recipient centric messaging system displays the communications preferences of the recipient and enforces the sender to comply with the communications preferences in the application

andfig  a schematic diagram of computer architecture used in accordance with the embodiments hereindetailed description of preferred embodimentsthe examples used herein are intended merely to facilitate an understanding of ways in which the embodiments herein may be practiced and to further enable those of skill in the art to practice the embodiments herein accordingly the examples should not be construed as limiting the scope of the embodiments herein descriptions of wellknown components and processing techniques are omitted so as to not unnecessarily obscure the embodiments herein as mentioned there remains a need for a messaging system that is not sender centric and that provides more control to recipients directly the embodiments herein disclose a recipient centric messaging system and protocols used to implement the recipient centric messaging system over data networks the recipient can specify hisher communication preferences and the messaging system would require that the sender meet these requirements for the message to be delivered to the recipients inbox the recipient specifies the communication preferences that include computer interpretable constraints when the recipient creates or updates a profile on the recipient centric messaging system the computer interpretable constraints may include i a limit on a number of characters in the message ii a specification on whether images or attachments are allowed or not iii a compensation amount that is required for delivery of the message iv a threshold reputation score of the sender required for delivery of the message or v a volume of message traffic received by the recipient that are associated with a category of communication selected from the different categories of communications some requirements are automatically verified by the system but some of the requirements could be soft requirements that cant be verified by the system an example of a soft requirement is that the senders certify that they have met the recipient in person in this case the system relies on a reputation management solution to keep cheating to a minimum in another example the messaging system requests the sender to certify that the visible preferences are satisfied by the message before sending the message if the recipient reports that the sender has wrongly certified the visible preferences the messaging system may reduce privileges of the sender eg reduce the free messages provided to the recipient the messaging system may be sufficiently flexible and adaptable so that it may serve a variety of communitiesin one embodiment the recipient centric messaging system allows a limited number of free messages within a given time period if the sender and the recipient a share the same alma mater or b the sender and the recipient previously worked for the same employerthe embodiments disclose a recipient centric messaging system that can enforce recipient constraints around their preferences and provide compensation for their attention andor the ability to share their communication address freely without fear of spam and inappropriate content the recipient centric messaging may be optimized to allow people to communicate effectively with people outside of their social andor professional networks the recipient centric messaging system allows a user to have a public communication address that anyone can use to contact them it may also give the recipient controls to manage communication in a way that filters out spam and irrelevant messages while also optionally providing for an option for the sender to compensate them for their attentionas mentioned many communications systems today are “sendercentric” in that there is little additional burden put on the sender once they have obtained the recipients address eg email address phone  for sms etc when they send a message the message is automatically delivered to the recipients inbox it may then be up to the recipient to look at all received messages and make a decision to respond or delete as “junkmail” or up to the messaging service to automatically determine they are likely to be spam and put them in a special folder in the recipients inbox the recipient centric messaging systemis designed to be a “recipientcentric” system from the ground upthe recipient centric messaging system may include a  messaging system andor a group messaging system it may further include a many messaging systems for managing sponsored communications the sponsored communication is a direct connecting marketplace between buyers and sellers of attention the sponsored message with a minimum compensation amount to deliver the message to the buyer the sponsored message may include a a promotional content b an advertisement c a video associated with advertisement or promotion etc the messaging system provides a searchable public directory eg profile store of all users who have signed up with the service and the users may send or receive messages the system may require users to verify themselves using a variety of methods eg email phone  credit card associating to other social media accounts they own etc so that everybody on the system can have high confidence that they are messaging with the “said” individual versus someone else who might have setup a similar fake profile and might be an imposter the system provides an addresshandle egxyzcomjanereed that can be showcased on any public website a linkedin profile blogs etc so that interested senders may communicate with registered users the messaging system may also provide a small graphicsicon that can be shared freely and posted on various websitesas part of signingup for the messaging system service users specify andor setup their communications preferences for receiving messages the users may indicate the topics they are interested in whether they allow imagesattachments to be sent or not eg which is highly relevant to women recipients when getting messages from people they do not know size limits and whether any amount of money is paid with the message to compensate the recipient for his attention and time often the money sent may be minimal but even small amounts can greatly discourage senders of spam and inappropriate messages for more persistent spammers the system also allows for blacklisting senders the recipients communication preferences may optionally be specified as a logic formula with “and” “or′ “not” clauses among the possible constraints allowed by the systemfor the sender to send a message they may simply click on the messaging system addresshandle for the recipient the senders are taken to set of screens that show recipient preferences and a structured messageform that facilitates the senders to meet those requirements if the recipient has asked for monetary compensation then the sender needs to first add some money to their account with the messaging system using a credit card or service such as paypal or stripe and then attach the requested sum with the message the compensation to be attached to the message may be dynamically determined by system the sender may also need to solve a captcha code eg to prove they are human and not a machine sending bulk messages or any satisfy other such requirements specified by the messaging system once the sender meets all requirements specified by recipient the sender can send the message which will then be delivered to the recipientthe recipient centric messaging system will also provide the ability to users to specify categories of messages that they would be interested in receiving examples of such categories are personal messages requests for speaking engagements requests for book reviews requests to review a business plan career advice etc the recipient centric messaging system will make it easy for the sender to indicate the category of the message some of the categories are suggested by the system and some are created by the recipient categories allow for the recipient centric messaging system to add filters to categorize the mail that is received and also to select different payment options for different categories for example a recipient might want money when someone wants them to review a business plan but they might be open to giving career advice for free or to receive a message from someone that knows them the recipient centric messaging system will let the recipient create custom categories and set different payment options for each category the categories of communications may set up by the recipient based on a properties of senders or b properties of communicated content the recipient may specify different constraints for different categories of communicationssome of the recipients preferences can be enforced by the messaging system no attachments but some of them are softpreferences eg someone stating that they know the recipient even though they dont or selecting a message category of career advice in those cases the system may provide a feedback mechanism where the recipient can rate the sender for example mark their message as spam this lets the system take appropriate action like block future messages from them the preferences for each user may be stored as rules in the database and every client that can compose messages eg using web mobile web ios app android app or any client that uses the system apis retrieves these constraints and enforces them at the time of message creation the specific user experience used may depend on the device operating system etc the recipient centric messaging system includes a set of apis and a specific protocol for how a client can sendreceive messages over the system these protocols are unique because of the specific requirements around honoring recipient preferences the system may be a closed system so that only clients that use the system api are allowed to participate in the messaging system this allows the system to make guarantees on honoring recipient preferencesthe recipient is now assured that the messages in their inbox are much more likely to be relevant messages that will add value and are likely to be worth responding to the recipient may easily respond to the message in which case they will be credited with the money if money was associated with the message the messaging system may provide considerable flexibility on how money is handled since there may be many regulatory or ethical requirements to taking money when people message you the messaging system may also make it easy for recipients to return money to senders when or where appropriate or give some or all of money to charity of their choice etc also if the receiver chooses not to respond to a sent message eg for various reasons at some threshold time the messaging system will return the attached money to the senders accountthe proposed messaging system provides unprecedented control to recipient of messages not found in other messaging systems for example the recipient can decide if they are open to receiving anonymous messages in particular this is a desirable property for investigative reporters where they are open to receiving anonymous tips for their stories though most people may not find this feature attractivewhile there are numerous existing and emerging messaging systems and social networks and blogs in many ways email remains the most important place where you get notifications for example there may be an email sent by facebook to a user to indicate that somebody tagged himher on a picture or that somebody made a “connect” request on linkedin or sent you a message on linkedin or somebody tweeted to you on twitter and so on this is doubly ensured that everyone continuously monitors their email to learn about messages arriving on other communication channelsthe recipient centric messaging system is integrated with email so that some subsets of the features of the recipient centric messaging system can be accessed through email when the recipient receives a message from the sender the recipient centric messaging system may notify the recipient about the message by sending an email the notification system can be intelligent in the sense that it doesnt need to send a notification for every email but can send one notification for several emails and can also send a digest of new notifications to make it easy for the recipient to reply to specific messages the recipient centric messaging system may provide a unique communication address that is optimized to receive messages from peoplesenders you dont know and could have additional features to help with such messagesthe recipient centric messaging system includes features that could help with potentially introducing some recipient preferences in a nonautomatic way for example when the sender sends an emailmessage to the unique communication address of the recipient centric messaging system the sender receives an autoreply with a survey about what the emailmessage is about eg personal business etc with links to click for each choice this helps the sender classify the message for the recipient and also confirms that there is a real person sending the email with a valid email address since they have to verify the email a notification may be sent to the email along with the message but it may not have all the other features available to messages sent to the recipient centric messaging system eg like compensation amountthe messaging system may be integrated with email in the following ways i when a message arrives for the user from the messaging system the summary of the content or the full message if it is just text is sent to the user via email the email includes a special “reply” button embedded inside it while selecting the “reply” button the system may directly take you to that message within the system messaging client eg webclient on pcs or mobile client on ios and android for the userrecipient to compose and send the reply however the reply message is stored in the recipient centric messaging system  and not in an email client ii for messages that are textonly and where nospecial actionrestrictions are applicable for the reply eg as in survey messages entering a special “completion code” or that have reply length constraints and so on the messaging system may provide an option so that the user can reply to the message directly from an email client using the email client reply button and protocol in this case the email reply may go to a proxyserver and then flow through the messaging system eg so that all sender and recipient preferencesconstraints are respected so that any attached money is properly accounted forhowever the messaging system simplifies the users task of frequently switching between multiple messaging clients and interfaces iii beyond the “reply” button the messaging system may also include other “action” buttons the messaging system might optionally provide a “reject” button the reject button can be used to delete the message from the messaging system and make sure that the recipient is not credited any attached money as he made the decision not to reply pay attention to the message and iv the messaging system may also provide daily or weekly digests of activity or pending requests as email notifications to user this integration can help user to manage their flow of messages coming from the messaging system and ignore some of them during periods when the traffic over the messaging system network is highsome of the above exemplar integrations can be implemented through an emailsystem proxy service for the messaging system to email pathways the proxyservice translates the system messages into email and sends them to an appropriate users one or more registered email addresses for example the messaging system may decide i what summary to extract from the original system message ii what other htmlbuttons to add to the email message and iii what email address to send such composed messages to in one embodiment on the reverse pathway the proxyserver may receive the email from an emailservice parse the recipient within the messaging system parse the type of message what message this is in response to decide if any money transfers are required and then invoke the appropriate messaging system apis so that from an enduser perspective it appears that the messagereply was composed and generated within the messaging systemfurther the messaging system may determine and maintain a reputation score for each the senderrecipient in the system to be able to report senders who are frequent spammers and have an idea of responsive recipients in one embodiment the messaging system may report the spammy senders and the responsive recipients based on i what kind of message the sender sends to the recipients and ii how much time the recipient takes to respond to the senders message in addition the recipient centric messaging system may use the reputation score to decide if messages from the sender can be sent to the recipient it may also allow the recipient to specify that they only accept messages if the sender has a score greater than a threshold reputation score the reputation score may be calculated based on i analyzing a message history to identify a a number of messages sent by the sender b number of messages marked by the recipient as irrelevant messages eg spam andor c a number of replies sent by the recipient the message history may be analyzed by predefined rules ii various parameters that include a a number of messages sent by the sender b number of replies sent by the recipient c text contained in the messages d length of the replies sent by the recipient e time of a day eg  pm the message was sent f language used in the message various parameters analyzed by a machine learning algorithm andor iii sentiment analysis of the messages the reputation score may be used to incentivize or encourage the sender to send relevant messages to the recipients and to discourage irrelevant or inappropriate messagesthe messages may be ranked in the recipient inbox based on the reputation score and the compensation money attached with the messages the messaging system may allow the sender to send only paid messages eg messages with an attached compensation amount if the sender has a low reputation score the messaging system may show the reputation score of the recipient to the sender if the recipient has the high reputation scorein one embodiment another desirable property for the recipient centric messaging system is its ability to unify the numerous siloed messaging systems that users have today eg one to manage their messaging presence on quora another on yelp another on reddit etc this is because each of the above mentioned community sites builds in own custom messaging system to address the failures of email and alternative messaging systems but not in a broad general way as proposed here but the recipient centric messaging system  has ability to capture the webpage address on which the messaging system addresshandle is placed for example it will know whether the invocation of xyzcomjanereed was from a quora web page or from a yelp web page based on this knowledge the recipient centric messaging system may automatically taglabel the message that is sent with domainname of invoking site this may allow the inbox client to automatically separate out messages received from different communities making it easy for recipient to reply respecting the expected norms of the community in an embodimentthis is one exemplar of various dynamic labels that may be attached to messages based on context and environment eg another could be country of origin that can be used in message filtering algorithms for the recipient the system mailbox may indicate how many messages there are how much money is associated with the messages and with some indicator of the time required as well since the system has profiles for every sender in the system the mailbox can have a people centric view which shows profiles of the different senders and the amount of mail from each there are also other visualization options where one can see charts of your mail by source category etcthe messaging system may also support many messages the many messages option is most useful for group informational messages eg messaging all smallbusinessowners in a mall about a change in parking regulations or as a marketing tool eg messaging all restaurantowners in a zipcode about a new coffeemachine that has just been introduced however the messaging system ensures that the senders of such messages meet recipient preferences which may include enabling recipients to be compensated for their time and attention based on their preferencesthe recipient centric messaging system may include a target list generation module an attention criteria specifying module a compensation determination module a klout score determination module a communication preferences verification module an attention criteria verification module and a compensation crediting module the target list generation module is configured to generate a target list of a subset of registered users of the recipient based messaging system by searching or selecting the subset of registered users by the sender based on a plurality of desired attributes in an embodiment the desired attributes includes a i registered or dynamic location of a plurality of users ii profession of the plurality of users iii age and gender of the plurality of users andor iii identity of the plurality of users the plurality of users may be verified based on a a verified phone number a verified credit card number or a verified social media eg linkedin profilethe attention criteria specifying module is configured to specify the attention criteria required from the plurality of recipients for receiving the compensation for providing attention to the sponsored message the attention criteria may include a whether the sponsored message was opened or not b a minimum amount of time needs to be spend by the recipient where a sponsored message window forefront and visible to the recipient who received the sponsored message c whether the recipient interacted with the sponsored message window by scrolling down to latter portion of the sponsored message iv whether the recipient sufficiently watched a video or not when the video is attached with the sponsored message v hot spot overlays on a video or that an image needs to be touched or clicked to indicate attention when the video or the image is attached with the sponsored message vi whether a short survey at end of the sponsored message is answered by the recipient vii an explicit button needs to be acknowledged that the sponsored message is read by the recipient andor viii a time boundary by when attention needs to be provided to the sponsored messagethe compensation determination module is configured to determine the compensation amount to attach with the sponsored message to get attention from the recipient in an embodiment the sponsored message requires a minimum compensation amount to be delivered to the recipient the compensation determination module associates the compensation with the sponsored message the compensation determination module may provide a fixed compensation amount to the registered users in the target list the compensation determination module may alternatively provide a variable compensation amount to the registered users in the target list based on criteria selected from a group that includes a importance and popularity of the plurality of recipients b a minimum compensation amount that the registered users has set to receive the sponsored message c algorithmic recommendations by the recipient centric messaging system based on length of the sponsored message and d historical data indicating which compensation drives what percentage of openrates for the sponsored messagesthe klout score determination module is configured to determine a social popularity score andor a reputation score for the registered users the communication preferences verification module is configured to verify whether the sponsored message complies with the communication preferences of the registered users from the target list of the subset of registered users the communication preferences may include constraints and communication preferences specific to the sponsored messages the communication preferences verification module delivers the sponsored message only to those registered users from the target list of the subset of registered users for whom the sponsored message complies with their communication preferencesthe attention criteria verification module is configured to verify whether the recipient meets one ore more of the attention criteria to get the compensation amount attached with sponsored message the compensation crediting module is configured to credit the compensation only to those registered users from the target list of the subset of registered users for whom the sponsored message complies with their communication preferences including the mandatory constraints and the communication preferences specific to sponsored messages only when they provide attention to the sponsored message that meets the attention criteria specified by the senderthe recipient centric messaging system allows the recipient to specify the communication preferences to receive the sponsored message the communication preferences may include i whether the registered recipient wishes to receive the sponsored messages from all senders or not ii an interested topic that the recipient is open to receive the sponsored message on iii whether the recipient is open to receive the sponsored message from blacklisted senders or not iv a specification on whether images are allowed or not and whether attachments allowed or not andor v a compensation amount that is required for delivery of the sponsored messagethe sponsored messages are displayed under a sponsored message tab that is associated with a mailbox of the recipient centric messaging system the unclaimed compensation amount may also be displayed in the sponsored message tab further the recipient centric messaging system may indicate a list of the sponsored messages along with the compensation amount which is already claimed by the recipient and b unread sponsored messages with their compensation amountsdetailed description of the drawingsthe embodiments herein and the various features and advantageous details thereof are explained more fully with reference to the nonlimiting embodiments that are illustrated in the accompanying drawings and detailed in the following description as used in the below description the

localized on one computer andor distributed between two or more computers that may be localized in same data center or geographically distributedreferring now to the drawings and more particularly to figs  through  where similar reference characters denote corresponding features consistently throughout the figures preferred embodiments are shown various aspects are now described with reference to the drawings in the following description for purposes of explanation numerous specific details are set forth in order to provide a thorough understanding of one or more aspects it may be evident however that the various aspects may be practiced without these specific details in other instances wellknown structures and devices are shown in block diagram form in order to facilitate describing these aspectsfig  illustrates modules databases and user experience components in a recipient centric messaging system  that communicates with external services through a network  according to an embodiment herein the recipient centric messaging system  includes the various databases and modules and userexperience components that come together to implement the messaging system in one embodiment the various systems include additional databases or modules andor may not include all of the components and modules discussed in connection with the figures a combination of these approaches may also be used the various aspects disclosed herein can be performed on electrical devices including devices that utilize touch screen display technologies andor mouseandkeyboard type interfaces in an embodiment examples of such devices include computers desktop and mobile smart phones personal digital assistants pdas and other electronic devices both wired and wirelessthe recipient centric messaging system  includes databases such an entity storage database  a message storage database  a payment and account storage database  a user interactions storage database  modules such as a search index module  a profile and communication preferences module  a user verification module  a user to user messaging module  a group messaging module  a messaging account maintaining modulepayment module  a people and message searching module  a performance notification module  and user experience components such as a web portal  a webmessaging app  ios android or windows mobile apps  and analytics dashboards the entity storage database s may store information about “userspeople” but also about other possible entities such as businesses or groups that could be both senders and receivers of communications for people and entities the entity storage database s may store information such as a name an address a picture emailaddresses a phone no a dateofbirth a driver license number and images a backgroundpicture for a profile page education history employment history links to the person or entitys social networks eg on facebook linkedin twitter quora pinterest stack overflow medium etc endorsements from other people credit cardspaypalaccountsbankaccount links as may be required to receive and send payments within messages etc not all of the fields may be filled out at any given point in time other fields may be added at any time to capture more data that is relevant for the communications task in cases of businessgroup entities similar but slightly different fields may be recorded eg the business email address versus the individualpersonal email addressthe recipient centric messaging system  may encourage users to “verify” several of the above fields using a variety of methods in an embodiment for example sending an email to the specified account and getting a response back may verify an email address sending a code via sms to that phone and receiving a response code back may verify the mobile phone number the mobile phone verification is an important part of the system since new sims for mobile phones are hard to obtain and the messaging system may limit the maximum number of accountsuserprofiles that can be associated with any single phone number similarly a recipient may verify that the links being provided for various social accounts such as facebook twitter and linkedin are genuine by asking the user to login and authenticate against those systems the verification is important so that everybody on the recipient centric messaging system  can have high confidence that they are messaging with the “said” individual versus someone else who might have setup a similar fake profile and might be an imposter the user verification module  may provide the logic and services to implement all these verification proceduresthe entity storage database s  is also used for storing the “communications preferences” for the personentity in an embodiment the recipient centric messaging system  is capable of supporting a wide variety of options for what is recorded and how these get leveraged in another embodiment the communications preferences may include but are not limited to and may be selected from any of  a simple textfield indicating areas of interests what ought to be included in the message who they wish to connect with and for what purposes etc  a limit of characters or words of text that could be in message  a specification of whether images are allowed or not  a specification on whether attachments are allowed filetypes of attachments allowed sizelimits on attachments allowed what attachments are musthave etc  an ability to blacklist peopleentities on the messaging systemdatabase ie the entity storage database s  and preventing those from sending the recipient messages  an ability to whitelist people who may have become trusted associates and are therefore allowed to send messages without any constraints above  an ability to require that the senders musthave certain “verified” attributes before sending messages eg they have a verified phone number and verified linkedin profile link  an ability to blacklist certain specific words eg various fourletter words and ensure that messages containing those are not accepted andor simply checking a box that leverages the messaging system specified defaults for such words and image filtering  an ability to specify that before sending a message the sender much prove they are human eg done via a captcha code that asks the person to enter the number contained in a distorted image or through variety of other means that are common practice now  an ability to specify the amount eg could also be  that the sender must attach before sending the message to ensure seriousness andor as compensation for the timeattention of recipient further this amount may be specified as a minimum reserve price that could be exceeded by sender or as a dynamic price determined by the messaging systemto increase the priorityvisibility of sender messages using any of auction or other algorithms  an ability to specify different categories of communication that allows the recipient to quickly prioritize which messages to pay attention to these categories also allow for different compensation amounts for different classes of messages for eg personal messages do not require any money attached but sponsoredmarketing messages must include at minimum   the compensation amounts may not always be monetary as just indicated they could also be arbitrary other virtual pointsgoods as often use in gaming systems or search competitions  a checkbox list with ontology of different categories of industries different categories of inquiries etc that the user can simply check to indicate her interests the sender could then also checkmark what areas hisher message corresponds to  an ability to specify that messages only be accepted from senders who have a certain reputation within the system eg if their messages are not rejected or marked as spaminappropriate by xx  of recipients or that they are considered an authority on a topic of interest or they have a certain “starrating” on the messaging system or they are wellrecognized on a connected system eg they are a “topwriter” within the quora community or they are a “verified user” on the facebook or twitter communities  an ability to specify that the sender is “friends” or “connected” with recipients the user own friendscommunity eg they are less than degrees of separation from the recipient  an ability to require driverlicense verification and checks against various state and national databasesin an embodiment entity storage database s  contains notonly static information but it also records certain dynamically generated information by the recipient centric messaging system  for example reputation scores a success rate in sending messages and  that were “accepted” by recipients and etc the recipient centric messaging system  may at any time support only a subset of the preferences listed above andor new ones may be added later as needed the reason to support an extensive set of controls via these preferences is that the commoncase scenario for the messaging system is for messaging with peopleentities that you do not know well in one embodiment the senders do not belong to your socialprofessional networks at least yet and therefore one may wish to take a conservative approach to minimize spaminappropriate messages and the interruptionattentiontime that such messages may take from the user the degree of verification a recipient wishesspecifies may also be a function of the criticalityrisk associated with the message in one embodiment the sender needs to verify themselves in many ways for example this may increase chances that the recipients trust them and accept their messagesin one embodiment this profileinformation and these communicationspreferences may be captured using the logiccode contained in the profile and communication preferences module m  the profile and communication preferences module  implements the logic to enlist this information from the user and keeps profileinformation and communicationspreferences uptodate in the entity storage database s  from timetotime based on the completeness of the profile in conjunction with the performance notification module m  it may also send reminder messages encouraging them to further completeupdate the profile information stored for them this information may be updated by users via the webportal ux  the webmessaging app ux or mobile apps ux in one embodiment all of the information about a user eg both their profile information and their communications preferences information is divided into two parts i a “visible” part and a b “hidden” part the “visible” part eg name photos topics of interest to user etc are those fields that are shown to other users and entities to help them discover the “said” personuser and to communicate more effectively with them the “hidden” part eg creditcard info blacklist of people for this user etc are those fields that are not shown to other users as they may be relevant only to the internal workings of the messaging system eg creditcard info andor they may potentially hurt relationship and communications within the community eg the blacklist information in one embodiment the messaging system will have default classifications for the various kinds of information we obtain from users but we will also provide some usercontrol in deciding what is exposed externally eg some may prefer not to have their image shownthe message storage database s  may include all data associated with the actual messaging among users the user to user messaging module m  implements all the logic associated with actual sending and receipt of messages for verifying that the recipient requirements are being satisfied ensuring that the payments are made and received when they are required or offered as incentive eg in conjunction with payments store and module and other elements that are specified below the userinterface for all these functions is provided via the uxux a web portal  a web messaging app  an iosandroidwindows mobile app  and analytics dashboards  components across web and mobile appsthe message storage database  may contain all sent and received messages for users and entities in one embodiment the message storage database  contains the contents of the message eg text images attachments etc the threading relationship between the messages eg what is a reply to what message metadata such as what messages have been readunread how much time has elapsed since a message was sent and the readunread status eg in which case it may be useful to return money to the sender if there is no attention by recipient and numerous other parameters as normally found in implementations of such emailmessaging systems the message storage database  itself may be partitioned across servers and data centers eg including geographical distribution for performance for redundancy and data protection andor for meeting national piidata storage eg personally identifiable information requirements eg that data for citizens of china must be stored only on servers located in chinathe messagestore component of the recipient centric messaging system  may be similar to other public emailmessaging systems however the recipient centric messaging system  includes certain unique kinds of data that are allowed in the structured messages eg as specified by recipient preferences and in how the usertouser messaging module m then operates on the data store to implement the allowable user message exchanges in one embodiment the above section focuses only on  message exchanges between users of the messaging systemas discussed earlier the recipient centric messaging system  may include a provision for senders of messages to attach payments using real or virtual currencies to messages for recipients in lieu of their i time and attention ii for their advice and expertise iii to indicate their own serious intent in sending the message iv to increase the priority of their message in the recipients view v to increase the likelihood that the recipient will provide a more thoughtful and detailed reply based on the principle of humanreciprocity httpsenwikipediaorgwikirobertcialdini andor vi simply as a mechanism for recipient to discourage sexually or otherwise inappropriate messages to be sent to herfor any given message with attached payments the recipient is provided with a variety of ways to deal with the money as shown by few exemplars below for example the recipient could a return the money to the sender eg because they happen to be an old longlost friend b or donate it all to a given charity or in specified proportions to a set of charities c or keep it all for herself and d or keep x  for herself and donate −x  to one or more charities when the system is directed to donate  to one or more charities the recipient centric messaging system  may do so in a way so that there are no tax consequences for the recipient eg no money flows to her and all is given to charity by the recipient centric messaging system  in an anonymous manner andor the money could be first directed to the recipient account and then portion of money directed to charity with the recipientname attached the recipient centric messaging system  also may provide options such that when a recipient is unable to provide attention to a message eg it has been pending in their inbox for more than  days the attached money may be refunded to the sender of the messageas envisioned in a preferred embodiment the recipient centric messaging system  may not store “real” money in the accounts associated with users and entities to pay for sending a message users must first “fund” their recipient centric messaging system account via rd party services such as paypal stripe or bank account in an embodiment the balance in such useraccounts goes up or down based on payments made or received for messages or returned from unattended messages however when the messagingaccount is “funded” using external services or when money is taken out of the messaging system useraccount to an external bankpaypal account etc then the system may impose a certain minimumamount that must be transferred eg system could have a  minimum for adding or removing funds the  minimum may be required to limit the total no of bankpaypalstripetransactions required as typically today such transactions come with an overhead of  c charge in the us in one embodiment the fund details of the user account are stored in the payment and account storage database to support the above scenarios the messaging account maintaining modulepayment module  in combination may maintain a messagingaccount for all users and entities in the recipient centric messaging system  in one embodiment all transactions are duly recorded and an audittrail is kept in another embodiment the recipient centric messaging system  attempts to make sure all transactions comply with necessary local state national regulations and guidelines for example the system may issue a misc form in usa as record submitted for income received by a recipient through such messages the system may also attempt to perform additional processing such as fraud detection money laundering etc the recipient centric messaging system  may perform some of such processing itself or rely on interfaces to rd party systemsservices for the implementation of such hygiene and regulatory matters the recipient centric messaging system  also envisions providing informal guidance to all users on ethicaluse and best practices use of money within the systemthe messaging account maintaining modulepayment module  eg working in close conjunction with the messaging module may also implement an algorithmic recommendedauction pricing logic for messages to support senders this recommendationsystem may recommend how much money the sender may want to attach to the message to get recipients attention immediately by being the topmessage eg or be in the top unread messages or based on what other pending messages have paid or based on other digital auctionlogic and is a hint that the senders can leverage the recommendation service is also useful because often the recipients may be hesitantshynotknowhowtobestestimate putting a monetary value to their time or attention but feel much more comfortable when the recipient centric messaging system  is itself doing such price setting or recommendationsin one embodiment the recipient communication preferences may be specified to include that certain money is to digitally accompany the message for required conditions to be satisfied in this case the money specified is an “exact” amount to be delivered with the message in another embodiment the money specified may be a “reserve price” eg the minimum amount to be attached but a higher amount may also be attached to seek attention in another embodiment the money is not specified directly by the recipient but the recipient chooses that the system run an algorithm eg which may be an auction to determine how much money the sender ought to attach to increase priority of the message for the recipient the money may be a virtual currency as used often in digital gaming systems eg points virtual goods the money allocated to user may be a dynamic amount based on properties of the content eg length of attached video so that the monetary amount is a function of the amount of recipient attention requiredwhen such many marketing messages are flowing through to a selected group of users the messaging account maintaining module  helps in deciding how much needs to be paid to each group member eg fixed amount to all or variable amount based on user profile and does the needed accounting to support the system the messaging account maintaining module  may also collect a “vig” or a commission associated with all monetary transactions flowing through the recipient centric messaging system  for both regular and sponsored messagesthe recipient centric messaging system  may support searches based on i a people search and ii a message search the people search may further includes two types of scenarios as follows a looking for an individual person and b when we are looking for a group of people eg to send a sponsored message that share some characteristics in one embodiment the searches are performed in the people and message searching module by default all user profile data both structured eg date of birth name of university years when attended college name of major etc and freeform text eg what i fill out within the “interests” field are fully indexed within the recipient centric messaging system  ie in the search index module  in one embodiment the search interface provided for individual and group search is a combination of “fulltext search” and “faceted search” eg as in the search interface provided in the linkedin and microsoft outlook systems the fulltext search is used to filter the individualentities based on any of the textfields in user profile while faceted search takes advantage of known entities eg locationcities current or past companies industrysegments educational institutions etc to narrow down the scope of search such an interface can leverage the sparse knowledge the user may know about the person eg they live in city x or they went to university y or i used to work with them at company z to narrow the search quickly these are common techniques used in numerous systems deployed in industry and academia as known to persons skilled in the artin one embodiment all of the messages in the recipient centric messaging system  are also fulltext indexed and associated metadata is also indexed eg who sent the message were there any attachments date sent etc that can be used to find past messages the recipient centric messaging system  may leverage established practices in the industry in providing such search capabilities for messages within an inboxfurther the recipient centric messaging system  attempts to address some of the fundamental drawbacks of prior messaging systems or networking systems by building a “direct” connection between the buyers of attention eg an advertiser and sellers of attention eg an industry expert or any consumer and ensuring that the compensation amount  for attention are transferred directly between these two parties without the intermediating service owner keeping all of the money the recipient centric messaging system  is the “direct connection” established between the sender and recipient of messages and transfer of value for timeattention providedthe group messaging module  provides the option to the sender to send group messages that are also many messages within the recipient centric messaging system  for example one could establish a group within the recipient centric messaging system  that corresponds to all residents in a buildingcomplex the building owner could send messages to the whole group if an unidentified car had its securityalarm blaring in the parking lot and so onthe user interactions storage database s  stores all interactions that are generated across all clients and serverside components in one embodiment the user interactions storage database s  and the performance notification module m  are performance indicators eg time to load the app on mobile phone time to load a message page play a video serverside responses and soon in another embodiment the user interactions storage database s  and the performance notification module m  could be an indicator of user engagement eg indicate how often they interact with the mobile app how often do they send messages at what times of the day gathered with user permission etc allowing a user to optimize those metrics the recipient centric messaging system  may achieve such interaction data either on the system or with external partner servicesthe performance notification module  looks at all data across all databases eg what fraction of the profile they have completed when was it that they last interacted with the system etc and sends notification messages to users to increase their engagement and satisfaction with the messaging system solution in an embodiment the performance notification module  attempts to keep a global view of “user journey” so that user avoid siloed behaviors and messaging ensuring that the user has a consistent and pleasant and nonspammy interaction with the messaging system solutionfigs ac illustrate process views of a sender sending a message to a recipient using the recipient centric messaging system of fig  according to an embodiment herein at step  the recipient centric messaging system  receives recipient communication preferences that include constraints from the recipient when the recipient creates or updates hisher user profile on the recipient centric messaging system  at step  the recipient centric messaging system  publishes the recipients user profile along with a set of visible preferences that the recipient has made visible for senders at step  the recipient centric messaging system  processes a request from the sender to send a personal message to the recipient at step  the recipient centric messaging system  directs the recipient to sign up with or log on to the recipient centric messaging system  if the sender is not already logged on to the system at step  the recipient centric messaging system  may verify the sender if the recipients communication preferences require the sender to be verified at step  the recipient centric messaging system  generates a customized message form based on the recipients communication preferences to enable the sender to compose the message to comply with the recipients preferences at step  the recipient centric messaging system  provides an indication to the sender if at least one constraint is not met at step  the recipient centric messaging system  may deliver a first message to the recipient if and only if all the constraints specified in the recipient communication preferences as well as system specified constraints are met by the first message at step  the recipient centric messaging system  may return the message to the sender specifying at least one constraint which was not met due to which it did not deliver the message and gives an opportunity to the sender to modify the message to meet the constraints in one embodiment the recipient centric messaging system  indicates that the message has not met a constraint eg attached money when the sender is draftingcomposing the message in another embodiment the recipient centric messaging system  performs a verification and returns the message to the sender if the message has not met a constraint the recipient centric messaging system  may perform the verification when the sender hits the send button eg the content verification service may kickin only after a sendkey is hitat step  the recipient centric messaging system  communicates a notification to the recipient that a message has been received at step  the recipient centric messaging system  displays the first message that was received along with a compensation amount associated with the message to the recipient at step  the recipient centric messaging system  processes a first reply to the first message from the recipient at step  a first reply is published in a conversation screen that also includes the first message at step  the recipient centric messaging system  credits compensation associated with the message by the sender to a payment recipient specified by the recipient in the recipient preferences in one embodiment the payment recipients may be distributed amongst a i charity to receive  of compensation money ii charity to receive another  of compensation money iii and the recipient to keep remaining  of compensation moneyin one embodiment the recipient centric messaging system  triggers the payment i when the recipient sends the reply message to the sender ii when the recipient has sufficiently watched a video that is attached with the message iii when the recipient answered a question in a survey and etc at step  the recipient centric messaging system  processes a request from the recipient to end the conversation at step  the recipient centric messaging system  processes a second message from the sender to the recipient at step  the recipient centric messaging system  delivers the second message to the recipient if and only if all the constraints specified in the recipient communication preferences as well as system specified constraints are met by the second message including an additional compensation if specified in the recipient preferencesan example of how the system protocols might work for a sender may involve authenticating a user and then retrieving recipient preferences a client device may render the user experience of the message creator by displaying the message form that honors those recipient preferences at this point the preferences might also state that the sender cant send this recipient a message eg because they are on a blacklist for that recipient or globally because of previously sent spam messages the sender may send the message and get back a response token the message could be rejected if the recipients preferences arent met the response token could either be an event based callback or a token that the client can use to poll for the result in the system messages may not be delivered immediately since they are checked for inappropriate content they may require payment etc the response token allows the sending client to receive the status of the message and take action in case the message was rejected eg by changing the text paying for the message etc on the recipient side the apis allow for the unique nature of the mailbox and have apis that allow for retrieving messages by category tags source money etc they may also get highlevel information about the mailbox eg a number of messages total money attached total money in the account unread messages etc the recipient centric messaging system  may further include apis to manage recipient preferences mailbox preferences etcthe protocols may allow the recipient centric messaging system to a show the relevant categories based on the recipient preferences b enforce minimum stamp requirements honor code etc c receive the compensation amount from the sender to send the message d send the message to the recipient and debit the amount from the sender account e deliver the message to the recipient inbox and wait for the recipient response on the message and f credit the compensation amount to the recipient account if the recipient responds to the message or else refund the compensation amount to the sender accountfig  illustrates an exploded view  of the recipient centric messaging system  of fig  according to an embodiment herein the functional block diagram of the recipient centric messaging system includes a preferences database  a preferences customization module  a preferences displaying module  a sender verification module  a message customization module  a compensation determination module  a constraints applying module  a compensation providing module  a mailbox module  a message prioritizing module  a combined search module  and a refund module  the preferences customization module  is configured to specifysetup the communication preferences for receiving messagesin one embodiment the communication preferences include but are not limited to i a simple textfield indicating areas of interests ii who they wish to connect with and for what purposes iii a limit of characters or words of text that could be in message iv a specification whether images are allowed or not and whether attachments allowed or not v a minimum payment required for delivery of the message vi categories of communication types specified by the recipient and vii a volume of message traffic received by the recipient associated with a certain category of communication etc the recipient communications preferences may optionally be specified as a logic formula with “and” “or′ “not” clauses among the possible constraints allowed by the system the preferences customization module  is optionally configured to specify the amount that the sender must attach before sending the message to ensure seriousness andor as compensation for timeattention of recipient the preferences displaying module  is configured to display the recipient preferences to the senderin one embodiment some of recipient preferences may not be visible to the sender eg blacklists of senders the sender verification module  is configured to verify the sender before sending a message to the recipient the sender may be required to be verified using their social identities mobile number personal documents etc for example i an email may be verified by sending an email to the specified account and getting the challenge response back ii the mobile phone number may be verified by sending a code via sms to that phone and receiving a response code back etc if using a social identity like twitter that site verifies the user for example twitter has a concept of a verified user which is information that is available to the message site when the user logs in using twitter the personal documents eg a driving license etc may be verified by checking the license number with a databasethe message customization module  is configured to automatically generate a messageform where the sender enters the message in one embodiment the messageform displays the recipient preferencesconstraints in another embodiment the messageform generated is based on the communication preferences of the recipients the compensation determination module  is configured to determine a compensation amount for sending a message to a recipient for example i the compensation determination module  may determine that the compensation amount is zero when the sender wishes to send a personal message eg to a person who is known or who he has corresponded with earlier and ii the compensation determination module  may determine that the compensation amount is a minimum of  when the sender wishes to send sponsoredmarketing messages in one embodiment the compensation determination module  determines how much money the sender may want to attach to their message to get the recipients attention immediately by being the topmessage eg or be in the top unread messages or based on what other pending messages have paid or based on other digital auctionlogic in the recipients inbox in another embodiment the compensation amount is suggested by the compensation determination module  based on i amounts associated with existing messages received by the recipient and priorities of the existing messages in order to increase a priority of the message for the recipient ii one or more properties of content associated with the message wherein the one or more properties of content include a length of a video that is attached with the message or iii an amount of attention required by the recipient in one embodiment the compensation may also be other virtual pointsgoods as often use in gaming systems or search competitionsthe constraints applying module  is configured to verify whether the required constraints eg computer interpretable constraints and human interpreted constraints are met to send the message to the recipient the computer interpretable constraints may be but are not limited to i a character limit mentioned by the recipient ii does the message including attachments iii is a minimum compensation money attached to the message iv is the message received from a verified sender etc the human interpreted constraints may include whether the message is related to a topic of interest to the recipient or not the recipient centric messaging system  may allow the sender to verify that the communication preferences of the recipient are met by the message and ii allows the sender to certify that the message respects the recipients communication preferences however if the recipient reports the message as misclassified inappropriate or not meeting certain constraints the reputation score of the sender is affected adversely the recipient centric messaging system  may enforce constraints based on regulations that affect the recipient for example certain government employees may not be able to receive money or lawyers might have other such restrictions in one embodiment the recipient is able to relax one or more of the constraints needed for the sender if the sender known to the recipient outside of the recipient centric messaging system the compensation providing module  is configured to transfer the compensation amount mentioned in the message to the recipient along with the message in one embodiment the sender needs to add money to their messaging system account before they can dispatch the message the compensation providing module  credits a percentage of the compensation amount for the message to an account associated with the recipient centric messaging system  for facilitating the messaging and for exchange of the compensation money from the sender to the recipient the compensation providing module  may provide some privileges to the recipient when the recipient invites one or more new users to the recipient centric messaging system the privileges may include a credit the compensation amount to a recipient centric messaging system account of the recipient or b providing free messages to the recipient the mailbox module  is configured to manage the messages received from the different recipients the recipient centric messaging system  may be used as the single communication address across all websites and so it keeps track of the origin of the message eg whether it originated on quora linkedin medium etc in one embodiment the mailbox module  ensures a higherquality communications experience between senders and recipients of messages by providing the recipient with a single place to manage all their communication from people outside of their social networkthe message prioritizing module  is configured to receive the message from the sender and prioritize the message based on the compensation amount attached with the message the message prioritizing module  may order the message in the recipient inbox based on the compensation amount attached with the message in addition to money the message prioritizing module  can use other information like whether the sender is known to the recipient the time the message was received etc to decide on the ordering at any time the user eg the recipient is free to also sort the messages by other criteria eg unread messages by compensation by time of arrival etcthe combined search module  is configured to search for the recipients or the group to send the message the combined search module  provides i fulltext search option to filter the individuals′entities profiles based on any of the textfields in user profile eg name or designation of userrecipient and ii faceted search option to filter the individualsentities profiles based on locationcities current or past companies industrysegments educational institutions etc to narrow down the scope of search the refund module  is configured to provide choices to the recipients to dispose of that compensation money in flexible ways or automatically take action based on default preferences of the userrecipient the refund module  allows for or provides choices to recipient to i return the compensation money to the sender ii donate part of compensation money to charity and keep the remaining money for recipient andor iii donate all of the compensation money to a previously selected default charity or to a freshly selected charity just for selected message in one embodiment the refund module  automatically donates money to the charity without entering the money into the recipient account of the recipient centric messaging system  in another embodiment the money is donated directly by the sender to a charity of the senders choice the refund module  is configured to return the money or part of the money to the sender of the message if the recipient does not provide attention for a certain passage of time or does not meet any other criteria specified by the senderthe functional block diagram  further includes a preferences database  a user information database  a message template database  and a payment database  the preferences database  stores communication preferences for one or more usersrecipients in one embodiment the communications preferences may be i a simple textfield indicating areas of interests ii who they wish to connect with and for what purposes iii a limit of characters or words of text that could be in message iv a specification whether images are allowed or not and whether attachments allowed or not etc in one embodiment the preferences are stored in the preferences database  as rules the user information database  may store information about both “userspeople” but also about other possible entities such as businesses or groups that could be both senders and recipients of communications the user information database  stores information such as name address picture emailaddresses phone no dateofbirth drivers license number and images backgroundpicture for profile page education history employment history links to the person or entities social networks etc the message template database  stores one or more message templateforms that are used to send messages the one or more templates may include i a template that is used to send a personal message ii a template that used to send business messages iii a template that used to send a message which is below  words and iv a template that used to send message which is more than  words v a template to send a business plan proposal for funding etc the payment database  stores monetary details of the sender and recipient accounts for example how much the senders and recipients have in their messaging system account the payment database  may also store how much the sender used for sending the one or more messages and how much the recipient received from one or more sendersthe exploded view  of the recipient centric messaging system  further includes a reputation scoring module that is configured to determine a reputation score for each the senderrecipient in the system to be able to reportfind spam senders and have an idea of responsive recipients in one embodiment the recipient centric messaging system  may report the spam senders and the responsive recipients based on i what kind of message the sender sends to the recipients and ii how much time the recipient taken to respond to the senders message the reputation scoring module determines the reputation score for the sender based on feedback from the recipient on i a priority level of the first message ii whether the first message is properly classified by the sender eg the message title is a personal message but the message may related to promotion or advertisement andor iii whether the message is offensive or inappropriate to the recipientthe reputation scoring module may determine the reputation score for the sender based on an analysis of a message history of the sender using predefined rules based a a number of messages sent by the sender to the recipient b fraction or percentage of messages marked as irrelevant messages by the recipient and c fraction or percentage of messages replied to by the recipient the reputation scoring module may determine the reputation score for the sender using a machine learning algorithm which analyzes a plurality of parameters selected from a group consisting of a number of messages sent by the sender to one or more recipients b fraction or percentage of messages replied to by the one or more recipients c relevance ratings assigned to the messages by the one or more recipients d length of replies sent by the recipient andor e sentiment analysis of the messagesfigs ab illustrates user interface views of creating or updating a recipient profile based on social network accounts according to an embodiment herein the recipient profile may be updated based on i a headlinesummary from a twitter profile  ii what type of messages the recipient is interested in  iii what type of messages the recipient is willing to receive  iv custom categories of messages types that can be created by the recipient  andor iv a headline or summary from the recipients linkedin profile  figs cd illustrates user interface views of specifying recipient preferences according to an embodiment herein the recipient preferences may include i who can message the recipient  eg anyone or verified users or only user who pay at least  ii would the recipient be open to accepting money for replying to messages  eg yes yes and donate to charity or no iii a limit of characters or word of text that could be in message  eg  or  or  etc iv whether images are allowed or not  eg allowed or not allowed v what kind of attachments are required  eg allow pdf block imagesvideos etc vi whether the messages should be passed through a profanityfilter or not  vii what kind of verification is required for the sender  eg phone verification twitter verification linkedin verification credit card account verification viii whether a sender must prove they are human via a captcha  and ix what are the options for the received money  eg donate to charity redeem as a gift care transfer to a bank account the user interface views may also present what people are paying the recipient for  eg to represent the importance of the message to sender or to express their desire to reach the recipient or to reply to the message within  days and why the recipient should set a price  eg to receive only serious messages and filter out inappropriate contentin one embodiment the communications preferences may be i simple textfield indicating areas of interests ii who they wish to connect with and for what purposes iii limit of characters or words of text that could be in message iv specification whether images are allowed or not and whether attachments allowed or not v categories of message types specified by the recipient potentially with different payment requirements by category etc in another embodiment the recipient preference may be i a request to fill in information in a particular template eg the recipient centric messaging system  requests a particular format for a business pitch and iii the senders must state how they know the recipient in another embodiment the recipient communications preferences may optionally be specified as a logic formula with “and” “or′ “not” clauses among the possible constraints allowed by the system for example the recipient may say that the sender must be verified either via twitter or via facebook and the sender must have to verify a mobile number the user interface views of the preferences customization module  displays the amount that the sender must attach before sending the message to ensure seriousness andor as compensation for timeattention of the recipient the recipients communication preferences are displayed to the sender when the sender selects the particular recipient from the messaging system contact or linkedin contact or facebook contact etcthe communication preferences may further include a message types attention units and revenue share eg whether the recipient receive the message without payment or not b the recipient requires a minimum stamp to receive the professional message c the recipient receives the promotional message when the promotional message is attached with minimum of  aus attention units and d donating part of the compensation amount to a charity in one embodiment an attention unit is associated with a fix sum of money eg  cents or virtual goodsthe sender may be able to view recipient preferences in advance of sending message to recipient in one embodiment blacklists of senders may not be made visible to recipients preferences the recipient may enforce a limit to the number of messages that the sender can send without payment eg the recipient may receive  messages from the sender without the compensation amount in an embodiment the number of messages that are allowed to be sent without the compensation amount is determined based on the reputation score of the sender in one embodiment the limit to the number of messages may prevent the senders from sending low quality messages to the recipients the recipient is able to relax all the constraints needed for the sender if the sender is a known person to the recipient outside the recipient centric messaging system  eg sender may be a colleague may be a school mate may be a college mate etcab illustrate user interface views of a recipient profile with a list of visible recipient preferences made visible to a sender and options to contact the sender according to an embodiment herein in this example a recipient eg jane reed shows her communication preferences  that she only accepts messages from verified senders she is open to accepting money for replying to messages and she requires pdf attachments for startup pitches for example further she may specify a character limit to the messages eg  characters she may be open to either accept a personal message  or an anonymous comment  she may further indicate her areas of interest such as startup pitches expertise requests business opportunities etc the recipient profile with the communication preferences may be discovered when the sender searches and browse for recipients profiles and selects a particular recipient eg jane reed from the search results the sender can view the communication preferences and initiate to send the message when selecting the particular recipient from the search result the sender may search for the recipient based on a fulltext search” andor a “faceted search” the fulltext search is used to filter the individualentities based on any of the textfields in user profile while faceted search takes advantage of known entities eg locationcities current or past companies industrysegments educational institutions etc to narrow down the scope of searchfig  illustrates a user interface view of the sender signing up with the recipient centric messaging system  of fig  using an email or a social network account according to an embodiment herein the recipient centric messaging system  may require the sender to sign up when the sender wishes to send a message to a registered user the user interface view illustrates that the sender may sign up using a twitter account  a linkedin account  a facebook account  an email account  etc when the user signs up heshe will be able to send and receive the messages in one embodiment the user interface view of the signing up module provides an option to create a new account within the recipient centric messaging system  for a new userfigs a and b illustrate user interface views of linking the recipient centric messaging system  of fig  to the senders social network accounts according to an embodiment herein the user interface views provide the option to connect a twitter account or a linkedin account to the recipient centric messaging system  when selecting an allow option  the user grants the recipient centric messaging system  access to hisher twitter account messaging system account when selecting a continue option  the user grants the recipient centric messaging system  access to hisher linkedin account when selecting revoke permission option  the access to the linkedin account is revokedfig  illustrates a user interface view of the recipient centric messaging system  of fig  verifying a sender by verifying his mobile phone number eg of the using sender verification module  according to an embodiment herein the user interface view allows the sender to verify the messaging system account by entering a secret code  which is received through a registered mobile number  after verification the sender may access the messaging system to send the messages when selecting a continue option  in one embodiment a skip option is used to skip the verification process in one embodiment the user interface view of the sender verification module  provides a captcha to check whether the sender is human or not in another embodiment the sender verification module  may send the activation link to the senders email to verify the messaging account the verification prevents spam and inappropriate messages from being delivered to the recipient in one embodiment the recipient has the ability to specify that the sender is verified using a variety of mechanisms eg through a secret code send to the mobile or through captcha or through sending an activation link to the senders email etcfigs a and b illustrate user interface views of a sender using an automatically generated message form based on the recipients preferences to compose a message to the recipient according to an embodiment herein the message form may be generated when the sender clicks on the unique communication address eg structured as a url provided by the recipient centric messaging system  eg xyzcomjanereed which can be freely shared on any website eg linkedin facebook quora etc while selecting a url of the unique communication address from any browser or device the sender is taken to the signingup module to send the message to the recipient in an embodiment the recipient centric messaging system automatically captures the url of the source as metadata to be attached to the messagethe recipient centric messaging system  may keep track of the source of the initiation eg source may be from linkedin or facebook or quora etc and show that to the recipient the recipient centric messaging system  may track the source of the message by tracking the referrer code supplied by the browser and so can inform the recipient of the source of the message further the recipient centric messaging system  customizes the message form using the source of the message initiated using the knowledge of the context for example if the unique communication address was shown on medium the sender could also attach the title of the story to the message so that the recipient knows the page that the sender was reading when they decided to send them a messageonce the sender is successfully verified and signsup into the messaging system account the recipient centric messaging system  provides the message form to the sender eg john smith to enter the message in one embodiment the recipient centric messaging system  shows the message form along with the preferences and constraints mentioned by the recipient to avoid inappropriate and spam messages the recipient centric messaging system  may automatically generate the message forms based on the recipients preferences in one embodiment the user interface view  displays the recipient preferences and constraints when selecting a click here option mentioned in fig a the user interface view  of the message form provides the following form fields to enter the message i a subject field  to write a subject about message ii a message field  to enter a message relevant to the recipients eg jane reed areas of interest within a specified character limit eg  iii an attachment option  to attach say a business plan in a pdf format and iv an option  to select the category of the message as specified by the recipientthe recipient centric messaging system  may provide the user interface view  of the message form to the sender when the sender initiates sending the message from any website eg linkedin facebook quora etc by selecting the url of the unique communication address which is shared on the website in one embodiment the subject should be within the character limit otherwise the message wouldnt be delivered in yet another embodiment the sender must attach a business plan in a specified pdf format for delivery after entering the subject message and attachment the sender selects a send option to send the message to the recipientthe message is delivered to the recipient inbox only if all required constraints are met the constraints may be but are not limited to i a character limit mentioned by the recipient ii is the message related to the recipients topics of interest iii is compensation money attached to the messages iv is the message received from a verified sender etc the recipient centric messaging system  enforces constraints set by the recipient and may also enforce system specified constraints for example certain government employees may not be able to receive money or lawyers might also have other such restrictions these could be specified as system constraintsfig b shows a message form which is used to send the messages to the recipient from the messaging system account the user interface view  of the message form provides the following form fields to enter the message i a user id field  to enter a user id of the recipient to whom the message is sent ii a subject field  to write a subject of message ii a message field  to enter a message that may be relevant to the recipient eg jane reed iii an attachment option  to attach any business plan or similar documents specified by the recipient etc the sender selects a send option to send the message to the recipient after entering the user id subject and message in one embodiment the sender can select the user id of the recipient using a dropdown menu in another embodiment the dropdown menu includes one or more recipients user ids which are already there in the senders contact list in yet another embodiment the user interface views of the message forms show the sender that the recipient is verified so that there is no fraud by someone else posing as the recipient eg jane reedfig  illustrates a user interface view of the recipient centric messaging system  of fig  computing and suggesting compensation amounts to the sender based on what other people have bid to increase the priority of the message within the recipients inbox according to an embodiment herein the recipient centric messaging system  may determine a current placement of the senders message in the recipients inbox eg it is currently placed th in recipients inbox based on the amounts associated with messages that placed higher dynamically provides a suggestion to the sender in real time that if you want your message to move up to the top  messages you need to pay an additional  or if you want your message to move to the top position you need to pay  to the recipient the user interface view indicates why the sender should attach money to the messages with reasons and terms such as i your message shows up prominently in jane reeds inbox thereby increasing the likelihood of getting a response ii offering payment shows that you value jane reeds time and appreciate a response iii you are paying for a response to your message—a “thank you but im not interested” is a perfectly valid response and iv if jane reed does not reply within  days you will get a full refund when selecting “yes” the sender may able to add compensation money to move his message to the top  or to a top message for example in one embodiment in case where money is attached to the message if the recipient does not provide attention for a certain passage of time the money is returned to the sender of the messagefigs a and b illustrate user interface views of a conversation screen within the inbox of the recipient illustrating conversation options and compensation amounts to be claimed according to an embodiment herein the user interface view eg of the mailbox module  includes an inbox tab  to display the one or more messages received from one or more users ie senders along with a cumulative value of the money associated with these messages and display each of the messages in the inbox of the recipient along with the compensation amounts attached with each of the messages in one embodiment the mailbox module  displays the received message along with the sender name sender designation etc the user interface view of the mailbox module  displays the message with the highest compensation associated with it as top message in the inbox tab for example as shown in fig a john smiths message is displayed as the top message if john smith attached compensation higher than other senders eg  while selecting the message the mailbox module  displays the full message that is received from the sender eg john smith in one embodiment the user interface view of the mailbox module  provides a sort option to prioritize the messages based on the compensation attached with the messages in another embodiment the user interface view of the mailbox module  automatically prioritizes the messages based on the compensation money attached with the messages the recipient centric messaging system  provides ux indicators to tell the recipient how much money heshe will get by replying to messages in their mailbox module  and how many messages the recipient with some indicator of the time required as wellin one embodiment of the system the mailbox includes tags  that represent the categories specified by the recipient these tags can be used as filters to only show the messages that are part of that categorythe user interface view further includes i a sponsored message tab  to display sponsored messages and ii an anonymous message tab  to display anonymous messages which is received from the one or more senders it may display a total amount of money  available in the recipients messaging system account and sorts the messages in order of decreasing amount of money or a combination of money and other criteria eg known to the recipient relevance of topic etc the mailbox module  may filter the messages by the source eg all messages that originated from people who found your messaging system address from quora or linkedin or twitter etc for example the mailbox module  shows the messages in one category if the source of the message is linkedin and it shows the messages in another category if the source of the message is twitter etc the mailbox module  may further indicate the category of the messages eg personal message sponsored message request for meeting business pitch etc based on the recipient preferences in one embodiment the mailbox module  includes a filter to filter for only personal messages business pitches etc the mailbox module  shows the profiles of the senders and the amount of messages received from each senderthe user interface view provides a reply option to send a reply message to the sender the user interface view displays the conversation between the sender and the recipient eg between john smith and jane reed as shown in fig b it displays a first message  received from the sender and a corresponding first reply  of the recipient and a corresponding second message  received from the sender and so on in one embodiment the mailbox module  allows the recipient to send a reply eg the first reply  to the senders message and for the sender to respond to those replies eg the second message  in a conversation centric way the user interface view of the mailbox module  provides one or more conversation options to the recipient to control the next step the one or more conversation options include i end the conversation  so that the sender has to start the conversation again to send a next message to the recipient ii an ability to return money to the sender  if the sender is known to the recipient outside the recipient centric messaging system  eg a colleague school mate college mate etc iii an ability to block the sender  if the recipient received any unwantedinappropriate message from the sender and iv to report the message as spam  if the message is irrelevant or inappropriatein one embodiment once the recipient ends the conversation whereby the next time the “sender” wishes to send a message to the same “recipient” the sender would be subject to all of the rules associated with starting a new conversation such as making a payment to the recipient in one embodiment when the conversation is ended the sender has to start a new conversation paying again for the new message in one embodiment the mailbox module  of the recipient centric messaging system  provides a feedback mechanism where the recipient can rate the sender for example mark their message as spam this allows the recipient centric messaging system  to take appropriate action eg to block future messages from that particular senderin one embodiment the recipient centric messaging system  allows the recipients to gain privileges in the system based on their investment in the system for example the recipient centric messaging system  provides them additional free messages for every person they invite to the system in another embodiment the recipient centric messaging system  may credit a monetary equivalent that can be redeemed through messages that require payment in exchange for inviting new persons to the recipient centric messaging system  in case money is attached to the message the system provides choices to the recipient to dispose of that money in flexible ways or automatically taking action based on default preferences that the user has set for such purposes for example i return money to the sender ii donate part money to charity and keep rest for themselves iii donate all of the money to previously selected default charity or to a freshly selected charity just for this message and iv automatically donating all of the money to charity without the money actually entering the recipients account on the system so that there are no tax filing consequences generated for the recipientthe embodiments disclose a recipient centric messaging system  where the system can enforce recipient constraints around their preferences compensation for their attention and the ability to share their communication address freely without fear of spam existing messaging systems like email have no way of enforcing such recipient constraints since the existing protocols have no way of enforcing such constraints and all the existing client applications dont respect these as well the recipient centric messaging system  enables enforcing recipient centric preferences that may allow recipients to indicate who might contact them about what on their terms and valuing their attention it may also provide a universal public communications address eg just like an email address that people can share with everyone and post on any public website without fear of spam andor inappropriate messagesfig  illustrates a user interface view of a recipient profile that displays the communication preferences of the recipient according to an embodiment herein the recipient profile displays the message rules eg the communication preferences as shown in fig a specific to the particular recipient in one embodiment that includes that a the recipient only accepts messages with a minimum compensation amount b the recipient only receives messages from verified senders c the recipient requires a minimum stamp for professional messages d the recipient require a standard stamp eg  aus for promotional messages andor e that the recipient allows the attachments in the messagesfig  illustrates a user interface view of a customized message form for sending the message to the recipient according to an embodiment herein the sender may compose the message for the recipient using the customized message form for the recipient the customized message form is automatically generated by the recipient centric messaging system based on the communication preferences of the recipient the user interface view allows the sender to selfcertify that whether the message is related to a promotional message or not or whether it complies with the recipients preferences the user interface view allows the sender to set the importance of the message as normal important or priority if the sender set the message as a normal message the sender may need to attach the minimum compensation amount eg  if the sender sets the message as an important message the sender may need to attach  as the compensation amount if the sender sets the message as priority message the sender may need to attach  as the compensation amount for the recipient if the recipient does not reply to the message within a week the compensation amount is returned to the sender account the user interface view allows the sender to send the message to the recipient when the sender selects a box that confirms that the message respects the recipient communication preferencesfigs a and b illustrate user interface views of the recipient centric messaging system  of fig  for determining a reputation score for the sender based on feedback from a recipient according to an embodiment herein the recipient centric messaging system  may determine the reputation score for the sender based on feedback from the recipient on i a priority level of the message ii whether the message is properly classified by the sender andor iii whether the message is offensive or inappropriate to the recipient the sender may report to the recipient centric messaging system  that the message sent by the sender is promotional or an offensive message the relevance of the message for the recipient is rated as low medium or high as shown in fig a by the recipient the relevance rating will in turn influence the reputation score of the sender if the reputation score for the sender is below the threshold reputation score the sender is not allowed to sending free messages the recipient may rate the message as high relevance when the message is relevant to a topic of interest and the recipient centric messaging system  allows such messages from the recipients in the future the recipient may report the message as promotional when the message intended for recruiting marketing advertising or sales and the sender should be penalized for not properly identifying that the message sent was promotionalfig a depicts a conversation between the sender and the recipient for example john smith may send the first message to jane reed about a startup pitch eg hi jane i have attached my startup pitch in pdf format please share your feedback john smith must attach a compensation amount for the first message if jane reed specified in her communication preferences that she only receives messages if a minimum compensation amount attached jane reed sends a reply message to john smith in a conversation thread jane reed may end the conversation when john smith sends a second message that she consider irrelevant further jane reed may mark the priority of the second message as low which may reduce the reputation score of john smithfigs a and b are flow diagrams illustrating a method of communicating at least one message between the sender and the recipient using a communications protocol over a data network through the recipient centric messaging system  according to an embodiment herein at step  the recipient centric messaging system  receives the communication preferences specified by the recipient that includes computer interpretable constraints required to be met for delivery of a first message and human interpreted constraints when the recipient creates or updates a profile on the recipient centric messaging system  at step  the recipient centric messaging system  publishes the profile with a set of visible preferences from the communication preferences of the recipient that are visible to the sender when the sender selects the recipient to send a message at step  the recipient centric messaging system  processes a request received from the sender to send the first message to the recipient at step  the recipient centric messaging system  generates a customized message form based on the communication preferences of the recipient to enable the sender to compose the first message to comply with the communication preferences at step  the recipient centric messaging system  provides an indication to the sender if any of the constraints are not met at step  the recipient centric messaging system  requests the sender to certify that at least visible preferences out of the human interpreted preferences are satisfied by the message before sending the message if the recipient reports that the sender has wrongly certified at least one of the visible preferences the recipient centric messaging system  blocks the sender from sending further messages to the recipient or reduces at least one of a a reputation score of the sender or b privileges of the sender the privileges may include free messages provided to the recipient at step  the recipient centric messaging system  delivers the first message to the recipient if and only if all the computer interpretable constraints specified in the communication preferences of the recipient and any constraints applied by the recipient centric messaging system are met by the first messagefig  illustrates an exploded view of the personal communication device having a memory  having a set of computer instructions a bus  a display  a speaker  and a processor  capable of processing
