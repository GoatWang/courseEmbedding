 plans is taxfree compounding “earning on an account’s growth rather than paying taxes on the earnings provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality stack says “having the ability to withdraw the principal and taxdeferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible while as soon as the child is born is ideal he said some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future says dextraze “at the

when choosing a financial advisor your details done by eric rosenberg january   choosing a financial advisor is a big decision unlike hiring a mechanic or hairstylist financial advisors are usually long term relationships they are also taking responsibility for your money with your entire livelihood on the line choosing the wrong advisor would be a big mistake avoid these  common blunders when choosing an advisor to ensure you are on track to meet your financial goals hiring the first advisor you meetdepending on where you live you could have dozens of options for advisors it is tempting to hire the closest advisor to home some people might just pick the first advisor in the yellow pages this decision requires more time take the time to interview at least a few advisors before picking the best match for you choosing an advisor with the wrong specialtyadvisors can have different focus area some specialize on retirement planning some are best for business owners or those with a high net worth others are best for young professionals starting a family this type of focus does not make an advisor better or worse it makes them better for certain people than others be sure to understand an advisor’s strengths and weaknesses do that before signing on the dotted line  picking an advisor with an incompatible strategyeach advisor has a unique strategy some advisors may suggest aggressive investments others are more conservative again there is no right or wrong however there is a right and wrong for you if you don’t feel comfortable with risk don’t choose an advisor that prefers aggressive investments if you prefer to go all in on stocks an advisor that prefers bonds and index funds is not a great match for your style skipping checking referencesmost advisors are happy to offer references to prospective clients if you ask about references and they act nervous thats a red flag quality advisors are happy to discuss past missteps and what they learned this helps them keep from repeating the same mistake in the future calling references only takes a couple of minutes it can help put you at ease when handing over the keys to your bank account not asking about credentialsto give investment advice financial advisors are required to pass a test ask your advisor about their licenses tests and credentials this ensures they are qualified to meet your needs financial advisors tests include the series  and series  or series  some advisors go a step further and become a certified financial planner or cfp also ask where they went to school and what degree they earned some advisors have a finance degree from a top school others could have an english degree from a community college making assumptions when they are affiliated with a reputable brandan advisor might appear qualified and professional due to an association with a major firm like jp morgan or morgan stanley however that doesn’t make them a great advisor working with an advisor from a reputable firm is not a bad idea it often leads to stability and better tools and information however they still have quite a bit of autonomy choose an advisor because they are the best fit not because of their branding not understanding how they are paidthere are different payment models for financial advisors some are “fee only” in this case they charge a flat rate no matter what others charge a percentage of assets under management some advisors are paid by mutual funds this is the worst situation for you this is a serious conflict of interest if the advisor earns more by ignoring your best interests do not hire themdo your research to find the perfect advisorchoosing a financial advisor is an important decision it requires the best information available gathering information

financial advisor do you want someone new and inexperienced managing your money it is best to find someone with plenty of experience advisors with a decade or more under their belt have seen multiple economic cycles and can better help you weather the stormwhat is your strongest focus area in financial planning some advisors are experts in retirement others have expertise in estates and trusts others still are best suited to help you pay for your childs education some financial advisors focus on people who are selfemployed be sure to choose someone who can help with what you need not what someone else needswhat is your budgeting philosophy every familys budget is unique budgets can be very detailed or more general some advisors suggest living frugally to meet your goals others take a more balanced approach find an advisor with a philosophy that matches yourshow are you compensated some financial advisors are “fee only” this means that you pay your advisor a flat fee for their services many advisors charge based on the size of your portfolio the worst situation is where advisors are paid a commission by mutual funds in this case a conflict of interest exists the advisor is incentivized to put your money into those funds even if they are not the best for your needshow much does it cost to work with you after learning how they are paid make sure you know how much you will pay no one wants a giant surprise bill after your first meetingare you a fiduciary fiduciary means putting your needs first many financial advisors work as a fiduciary and have to put your needs first even if it means they earn less money however many financial advisors are not fiduciaries and can give you advice that is not in your best interestdo you own the same investments youll suggest to me do they put their money where their mouth is advisors who suggest one strategy to clients and use a different strategy for their own finances should be a big red flaghow have your clients portfolios performed how did you handle their portfolios during the great recession in  these questions get to the root of their performance if the advisor does not readily share this information they are probably hiding something that went wrong in the past make sure your financial advisor is licensedfinancial advisors are not allowed to give you specific investment advice unless they are licensed the most common and important license for a financial advisor is the cfp or certified financial planner cfps are regulated and must take a course and pass a test proving their competence in financial topicsseries  and series  licenses give finance professionals the ability to recommend and trade stocks bonds and other investments on your behalf make sure your financial advisor has successfully completed both of these exams and has an uptodate licensebeware of lofty promisesif an advisor makes promises that sound like something from the  presidential campaign proceed with caution promises to beat the market and outperform other advisors and funds are easier said than done further no advisor can promise that they will beat the marketat the end of the day many financial advisors have similar skills they use comparable tools and reports to stay uptodate on the markets and help find the best investments for you if any advisor gives you a bad vibe dont feel bad looking elsewherechoose an advisor you can trustafter you have met with a few advisors it is time to make your decision asking about licenses fees and past performance is black and white there are other parts

in  it may take an extended family to educate one with the costs of higher education trending higher each year paying for college has become a toptier life expense alongside other bigticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement however education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and homebuying—has become hampered in some families manage your wealth find a financial advisor branch and private wealth advisor near you enter zipcode go invalid zipcode some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education  at the same time children are entering their ’s with student loan debt which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home even grandparents have modified life goals choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now rather than leaving a larger legacy later in short paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern but with a little advance planning families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college  the growing cost of education according to the college boards latest “trends in higher education report the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes financial aid and many consumer goods and services it now costs on average  per year for tuition fees room and board for a fouryear private college assuming a collegecost inflation rate of  today’s yearold child may need  come college time in  “for parents the numberone goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement but close behind is paying for a child’s education” says marc dextraze executive director morgan stanley wealth management investment solutions it takes a village to raise a child but in  it may take an extended family to educate one tweet this share this on linkedin share this on facebook email this one option says dextraze is for parents to start saving early with a  college savings plan  “having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans he says for the child “having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals as opposed to the college that offers the most aid and graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom named after section  of the internal revenue code a  plan is a taxadvantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save or even pay in advance for college expenses earnings in a  plan can be tax deferred and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition fees room and board and supplies many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that making education a family affair motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education grandparents relatives and even family friends have also begun creating  accounts in a child’s name not only do  plans offer potential tax advantages they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt “today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college says jennifer tierney vice president morgan stanley wealth management investment solutions and  plans product manager “its so important to plan ahead for grandparents aunts and uncles family friends it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that  plans provide to a child and from a taxperspective to themselves” related reading wealth management the real costs of not saving for college wealth management when little geniuses have big dreams wealth management how to break the ice around family finances a flexible way to save and invest for college the appeal of  plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility there are no income restrictions no required minimum distributions no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account and high contribution limits virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child grandchild niece nephew spouse even a friend according to chris stack a managing consultant at savingforcollegecom one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the  account as opposed to a utma uniform transfers to minors act or ugma uniform gifts to minors act account or other strategy “with s grandparents or extended family give themselves an option but not an obligation to apply their funds to help pay college costs he says  another significant benefit of  plans is taxfree compounding “earning on an account’s growth rather than paying taxes on the earnings provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality stack says “having the ability to withdraw the principal and taxdeferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible while as soon as the child is born is ideal he said some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future says dextraze “at the end of the day the idea is to harmonize all of your goals taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there
