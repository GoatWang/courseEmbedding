including capital appreciation and income we seek to identify absolute value opportunities across global markets including both developed and emerging countries philosophy absolute value investors we seek genuine bargains in the equity markets rather than relatively attractive ones we may at times hold large amounts of cash if we cannot find enough opportunities meeting our investment requirements longterm focus we find that our investment goals are best achieved by taking a longterm contrarian approach in practice we tend to stay invested on average about five years bottomup we select and value individual stocks based on the fundamentals of the underlying businesses we always demand that our investments meet the following criteria  high quality businesses with longterm staying power
