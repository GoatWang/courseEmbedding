takes the guess work out of determining how much liquid is in any of your hot side brewing vessels it is most commonly installed in hot liquor tanks to measure strike and sparge water volumes but is also very useful in boil kettles to measure pre and post boil volumeswhile weldless systems have gotten a bad rep amongst homebrewers this design is different when installed per instructions the unit is  guaranteed not to leak the first time and any time you reinstall it no leak reports in at least  units soldour new flex sight kit will work for converted kegs or pots includesone pair of stainless steel machined elbow barbs with matching weldless bushings for installation at the bottom and top of the pot keg or tankone  length of high temperature silicone tubingpair of hose clampschoice of orings or stick on decals for calibration note that stick on decals can be applied directly to your keg or kettle but if you are heating on an open flame the lower numbers will melt off this option is best used for electric vessels for the orings option youll get three larger orings to mark  gallons and then eleven smaller rings to mark each gallon in between important note the numbers you see in the picture are a little different than the ones we include in this kit we include the same numbers as the other sight glass kits with the smaller arrows that run under the numberinstall intructionsdrill two  holes in the pot or keg one at the bottom and one at the top avoid putting the hole too close to any curves welds or other obstructions hint use a framing square to ensure that
