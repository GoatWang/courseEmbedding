goal of becoming a turnkey developer and engineering procurement and construction contractor of solar pv energy facilities we intend to design engineer construct market and sell highquality pv energy facilities for commercial and utility applications to local markets the company decided not to recognize the revenue of electricity supply for the year ended december   due to the uncertain collectability before june   we were engaged in exploration for commercially recoverable metalbearing mineral deposits on june   we entered into an agreement with xunyang yongjin mining co ltd to transfer our mining exploration rights for a cash payment of  rmb  further on december   our subsidiary shaanxi changjiang mining new energy co ltd shaanxi changjiang entered into equity transfer agreements with each of zhang hong jun a director of the company and owner of a controlling interest in the company holding  as of december   and wang sheng li a director and shareholder of the company holding  as of december   to sell shaanxi changjiangs entire  interest in shaanxi east mining co ltd east mining and formerly referred to as dongfang mining for a total consideration of  rmb  the consideration payable to the company was used to offset amounts owed to each of the acquirers each of the acquirers obtained  equity in this transaction we also hold land use rights in a land parcel and we lease a portion of the land use rights on the  square kilometer parcel to shaanxi huanghe bay ecological agriculture co ltd previously shaanxi huanghe bay spring lake park co ltd a company with zhang hong jun a director of the company and owner of a controlling interest in the company the term of the lease agreement is from january   to december   our land use rights are amortized over their  year term the land use right was our largest asset with an annual rent of approximately  million rmb   as of december   we only received rent payment of  and no any collection afterwards due to the uncertain collectability we decided to write off all the receivable related to land lease of  equivalent to rmb  during the year of  and decided not to recognize any revenue for the years ended december   and  our land use rights are amortized over year term the following is a summary of the book value of our land use rights as of december   cost   less accumulated

received from the related parties and cash generated from operations to meet its operating requirements although the company was successful in the past in obtaining financing there can be no assurance that it will be able to obtain adequate financing in the future or that the terms of such financings will still be favorable however in the event that we have insufficient cash to meet our operating requirements our related companies and shareholders will commit to provide loan to maintain liquidity we believe that we have adequate capital to assure that we will be able to meet our obligations or obtain sufficient capital to complete our plan of operations for the next twelve  months table of contents results of operations comparison of the years ended december   and december   sales revenue we generated  of revenue from sales of solar pv energy for the year ended december   comparing to revenue of  for the year ended december   however due to the collectability is not reasonably assured we decided to write off the revenue from the fourth quarter of  in the amount of  as a result the revenue was for the year ended december   while the total revenue was  for the year ended december   operating expense total operating expenses for the year ended december   decreased to  from comparable figure of  for the year ended december   representing a decrease of  or  the operating expenses

the depreciation expense decreased to  from comparable figure of  the amortization expense for the year ended december   slightly decreased by  or  due to the depreciation of rmb to usd and no addition or disposal occurred for land use rights net loss net loss for the year ended december   was  as compared to a net loss of  for year ended december   the significant improvement in our operating results was mainly attributable to the bad debt expense of  for the year ended december   comprehensive loss our comprehensive loss for the year ended december   was  compared with

december   compared with the other comprehensive loss of  for the year ended december   stockholders equity stockholders equity decreased to  as of december   or approximately  from  as of december   the significant decrease was primarily due to the net loss  the other comprehensive loss of  and offset by an increase in additional paidin capital of  for the year ended december   the increase in additional paid in capital was due to an exemption from the loan of rmb approximately  owed to shaanxi east mining co ltd a related party of the company as shaanxi east mining co ltd had been officially cancelled in business on april   and an exemption from the salary payable of rmb approximately  that had been paid by shaanxi dukang liquor group a related party liquidity and capital resources cash flows from operating activities net cash used in operating activities of  for the year ended december   was primarily attributable to net loss of  the adjustments to reconcile our net loss to net cash flow mainly include depreciation and amortization expense of  allowance for doubtful accounts of  an increase in due from related party of  an increase in other current assets and

assets decreased by  respectively the increased current assets were resulted from our increase in other current asset and prepayment and the decreased total assets were mainly due to the writing off receivables due from related parties and depreciation of rmb to usd we have cash of  and  as of december   and  respectively the decrease of cash balance was mainly due to the fact that we did not receive any cash for our business for the year ended december   however we believe that we have sufficient cash to fund operations for the next twelve months financing we anticipated that cash generated from operating activities will be sufficient to sustain our daily operations for the next twelve months inflation our management believes that inflation did not have a material effect on our results of operations in  going concern we had a working capital deficit of  as of december   and had a negative cash flow from operating activities amounted to  for the year ended december   if we cannot generate enough cash flow from its operating activities we will need to consider other financing methods such as borrowing from banking institutions or raising additional capital through new

assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources actual results could differ from our estimates which would affect the related amounts reported in our financial statements   an accounting policy is considered to be critical if it requires an accounting estimate to be made based on assumptions about matters that are highly uncertain at the time the estimates are made and if different estimates that reasonably could have been used or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely to occur could materially impact the consolidated financial statements we believe that the following critical

   limitations on effectiveness of controls and procedures   our management including our chief executive officer principal executive officer and chief financial officer principal financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and procedures will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include but are not limited to the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected   changes in internal controls   during the three months ended march
