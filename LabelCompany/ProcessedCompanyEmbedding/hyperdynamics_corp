however well still link you to the file overview of the guinea project   hyperdynamics holds a  interest in and is the operator of one of the largest offshore exploration concessions in west africa offshore republic of guinea the company is preparing to drill a deepwater exploration well at the fatala turbidite fan prospect in partnership with south atlantic petroleum sapetro which completed a farmout agreement with hyperdynamics for a  interest in the concession in june  multiple play types leads and prospects have been identified in this largely unexplored basin at the intersection of several prospective exploration trends within the atlantic transform margin where hyperdynamics holds a concession covering approximately  square kilometers we are encouraged by recent offshore oil discoveries in ghana sierra leone liberia and cote divoire to the south and east of our concession on the african side of the atlantic as well as discoveries offshore brazil and french guiana in south america which abutted west africa  million years ago before tectonic plate shifts separated the two continents exploration work conducted to date we have conducted extensive technical studies of the area including  kilometers of d seismic and  square kilometers of d seismic in five separate surveys covering both shallower water and deep water portions of the guinea concession hyperdynamics drilled the sabu exploration well in late  and early  in  meters of water as operator of the project the sabu reached planned total depth of  meters below the waterline testing an upper cretaceous section of the prospect the well encountered oil shows and welllog interpretations indicated the presence of residual oil in noncommercial quantities subsequent analysis of rock samples from the well confirmed the presence of hydrocarbons in fluid inclusions in the rock we believe the sabu well was not commercial because of the lack of a reservoir seal such as marine shales or reservoirseal pairs needed for a commercial accumulation we also believe that the evidence that hydrocarbon generation has taken place in the basin and the presence of reservoirquality carbonates and sandstones in the well enhances the prospectivity of our concession production sharing contract following the exit of tullow oil and dana petroleum as hyperdynamics partners in the drilling consortium in august  hyperdynamics negotiated a production sharing contract amendment on september   with the government of guinea granting an extension of the concession to september       home privacy employment contact
