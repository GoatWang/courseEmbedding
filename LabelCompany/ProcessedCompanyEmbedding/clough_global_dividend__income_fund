distributions mutual fund investors can get hit with big tax bills whether or not their funds increase in value mutual funds are frequently forced to sell securities they own to meet withdrawals by fund shareholders sales of fund positions at a gain can trigger capital gains distributions – and associated taxes – for the funds remaining shareholders in fact sales to meet investor outflows are often a leading cause of fund capital gains distributions nextshares work differently when nextshares investors sell their shares they don’t normally transact with the fund instead they trade through a broker to sell their shares to someone else buyers may include other longterm investors or professional traders acting as market makers in the funds shares because the nextshares fund itself is not involved in these transactions the fund isnt required to sell securities to raise cash – so no capital gains distributions are triggered for remaining fund shareholders when market makers and other large investors accumulate sufficient shares of a nextshares fund they can redeem their shares from the fund by transacting through intermediaries called authorized participants here too nextshares work differently than mutual funds like etfs most nextshares funds meet redemptions through authorized participants primarily in kind  meaning that the fund distributes current portfolio holdings of securities rather than cash by avoiding the sale of securities to meet redemptions nextshares can potentially reduce fund capital gains distributions and associated shareholder taxes the enhanced tax efficiency that nextshares may provide can be a meaningful source of improved investor outcomes bottom line nextshares can reduce fund taxable gains a fund’s investment strategy and portfolio turnover

ratings assigned by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization  nrsro with an average default rate calculation to come up with a weightedaverage credit quality the weightedaverage credit quality is currently a letter that roughly corresponds to the scale used by a leading nrsro funds with a low credit quality style box placement are those whose weightedaverage credit quality is less than bbb medium are those less than aa but greater or equal to bbb and high are those of aa or higher when classifying a bond portfolio morningstar first maps the nrsro credit ratings of the underlying holdings to their respective default rates as determined by morningstars analysis of actual historical default rates morningstar then averages these default rates to determine the average default rate for the entire bond fund finally morningstar maps this average default rate to its corresponding credit rating along a convex curve for interestrate sensitivity morningstar obtains from fund companies the average effective duration generally morningstar classifies a fixedincome funds interestrate sensitivity based on effective duration of the morningstar core bond index mcbi which is currently three years the classification of limited will be assigned to those funds whose average effective duration is between  to  of mcbis average effective duration average effective duration

bills whether or not their funds increase in value mutual funds are frequently forced to sell securities they own to meet withdrawals by fund shareholders sales of fund positions at a gain can trigger capital gains distributions – and associated taxes – for the funds remaining shareholders in fact sales to meet investor outflows are often a leading cause of fund capital gains distributions nextshares work differently when nextshares investors sell their shares they don’t normally transact with the fund instead they trade through a broker to sell their shares to someone else buyers may include other longterm investors or professional traders acting as market makers in the funds shares because the nextshares fund itself is not involved in these transactions the fund isnt required to sell securities to raise cash – so no capital gains distributions are triggered for remaining fund shareholders when market makers and other large investors accumulate sufficient shares of a nextshares fund they can redeem their shares from the fund by transacting through intermediaries called authorized participants here too nextshares work differently than mutual funds like etfs most

difference between a funds actual returns versus its expected performance given its level of market risk as measured by beta a positive alpha indicates the fund performed better than its beta would predict while a negative alpha indicates the funds under performance based on the expectations indicated by the funds beta beta a measure of a funds volatility in relation to the stock market as measured by a stated index by definition the beta of the stated index is  a fund with a higher beta has been more volatile than the index and a fund with a lower beta has been less volatile than the index sharpe ratio the sharpe ratio developed by nobel prize winner william sharpe provides a measure of a funds historical riskadjusted performance a higher number indicates better historical riskadjusted performance correlationthe linear relationship between two return series correlation shows the strength of the relationship between two return series the higher the relationship the more similar the returns rsquared this number indicates what percentage of a funds performance fluctuation can be explained by movements in the benchmark index rsquared correlation ranges from  to  an rsquared of  would mean that the fund is tracking its benchmark exactly a low rsquared indicates that very few of the funds movements are explained by movements of its benchmark rsquared can help determine the significance of the funds beta a higher rsquared generally indicates a more useful beta lower rsquared means the funds beta is less relevant to its performance standard deviation this figure provides a statistical measure of the range of a funds returns a high standard deviation indicates a wide range of returns and thus greater volatility as of  updated monthly based on a year

credit or risk rating it is a subjective evaluation performed by the mutual fund analysts of morningstar inc morningstar evaluates funds based on five key unequally weighted pillars which are process performance people parent and price morningstar’s analysts use this five pillar evaluation to identify funds they believe are more likely to outperform over the long term on a riskadjusted basis analysts consider quantitative and qualitative factors in their research but the assessment of each pillar and how they are combined is driven by the analyst’s overall assessment and overseen by morningstar’s analyst rating committee the approach serves not as a formula but as a framework to ensure consistency across morningstar’s global coverage universe the analyst rating scale ranges from gold to negative with gold being the highest rating and negative being the lowest rating a fund with a “gold” rating distinguishes itself across the five pillars and has garnered the analysts’ highest level of conviction a fund with a ‘silver’ rating has notable advantages across several but perhaps not all of the five pillarsstrengths that give the analysts a high level of conviction a “bronze” rated fund has advantages that outweigh the disadvantages across the five pillars with sufficient level of analyst conviction to warrant a positive rating a fund with a “neutral” rating isnt seriously flawed across the five pillars nor does it distinguish itself very positively a “negative” rated fund is flawed in at least one if not more pillars and is considered an inferior offering to its peers analyst ratings are reevaluated every  months for more detailed information about morningstar’s analyst rating including its methodology please go to httpcorporatemorningstarcomusdocumentsmethodologydocumentsanalystratingforfundsmethodologypdf the morningstar analyst rating should not be used as the sole basis in evaluating a mutual fund morningstar analyst ratings are based on morningstar’s current expectations about future events therefore in no way does morningstar represent ratings as a guarantee nor should they be viewed by an investor as such morningstar analyst ratings involve unknown risks and uncertainties which may cause morningstar’s expectations not to occur or to differ significantly from what we expected
