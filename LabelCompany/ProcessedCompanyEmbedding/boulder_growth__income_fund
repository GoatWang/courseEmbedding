investment philosophy home  contact us  privacy statement  disclosure bifview as of  nav  market price  premium  discount   distribution  of market price    home fund advisers investment philosophy contact us   investment philosophy home contact us email notifications investment philosophy the investment philosophy of the advisers is simple invest in good businesses at attractive valuations for the longrun at the heart of this philosophy are two core investment principles the first of these principles is the belief that superior longterm returns can only be generated as long as first priority is given to protecting ones principal investment we find it difficult to make any money from investing if the initial principal has been lost as a result we typically seek to minimize the risk to investment principal by focusing our efforts on identifying good quality defensible businesses with solid financial positions and strong operating track records it is our belief that these businesses will generally have the greatest probability of continued operational success into the future and represent potentially attractive investment opportunities however before investing in these opportunities we seek to further reduce our risk to investment principal by increasing our margin of safety we feel this is accomplished by investing in these opportunities at valuations that we believe reflect a discount from our estimate of the businesses intrinsic value the second principle is the belief that one must invest in businesses and not speculate in securities to have longterm investment success this is predicated on the view that the longterm performance of a security will be determined by the operating performance of the underlying business and not the vagaries of fluctuating market sentiment adherence to this belief allows us to look through the short term noise of the market and focus on understanding the underlying business and its ability to generate a strong operating performance over the longrun as a result we expect to be longterm investors in these businesses the decision to divest of an investment will generally be driven by either a change in the underlying investment thesis or as a result of the investment trading at an unjustifiably high valuation while more attractive investment opportunities are available elsewhere to implement this philosophy the advisers utilize a disciplined bottomup valuedriven investment process this process is designed to identify potentially attractive and appropriate investment opportunities through extensive fundamental research that analyzes a range of qualitative and quantitative factors once an investment has been made it is monitored and reviewed on an ongoing basis to determine if it remains an attractive and appropriate investment our commitment to this investment philosophy and process is best demonstrated by the fact that all three of the advisers portfolio managers brendon

press related documents privacy statement home contact us email notifications fund overview boulder growth  income fund inc the fund is a nondiversified closedend fund with a total return investment objective to achieve its objective the fund utilizes a bottomup valuedriven investment process to identify securities of good quality businesses trading below estimated intrinsic value the intent of this process is to identify investment opportunities that will provide attractive returns over a long holding period by doing this the fund seeks to keep portfolio turnover low which the advisers believe helps to minimize associated trading costs the fund maintains a high level of investment flexibility and has the ability to invest in equity and fixed income securities of domestic and international companies without limitation to a companys market capitalization the fund is managed by rocky mountain advisers llc and stewart investment advisers which together utilize the services of brendon fischer cfa joel looney cfp and stewart horejsi mr fischer mr looney and mr horejsi serve as the funds portfolio managers and with assistance from other advisory personnel are jointly

as of  nav  market price  premium  discount   distribution  of market price    note to stockholders on concentration of investments the funds investment advisers feel it is important that stockholders be aware that the fund is highly concentrated in a small number of positions concentrating investments in a fewer number of securities may involve a degree of risk that is greater than a fund which has less concentrated investments spread out over a greater number of securities in particular the fund is highly concentrated in berkshire hathaway inc which in addition to other business risks is dependent on warren buffett for major investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions if mr buffett were no longer able to fulfill his responsibilities to berkshire hathaway inc the effect on the value of the funds position in berkshire hathaway inc could be materially negative home fund advisers investment philosophy contact us privacy statement disclosure the performance data
