velocityshares etns download a prospectus from this site call velocity or  or write to prospectus inquiry velocityshares  old kings highway s darien ct  to request a prospectus you should read the prospectus carefully before making an investment decision not all risks described below will apply to all products please refer to the applicable prospectus supplement for a detailed discussion of risks applicable to a particular etn an investment in the etns involves significant risks please read the more detailed explanation of risks relating to an investment in the etns in “risk factors” in the applicable pricing supplement the etns are intended to be daily trading tools for sophisticated investors to manage daily trading risks they are designed to achieve their stated investment objectives on a daily basis but their performance over different periods of time can differ significantly from their stated daily objectives the etns are riskier than securities that have intermediate or longterm investment objectives and may not be suitable for investors who plan to hold them for a period other than one day any decision to hold the etns for more than one day should be made with great care and only as the result of a series of daily or more frequent investment decisions to remain invested in the etns for the next oneday period accordingly the etns should be purchased only by knowledgeable investors who understand the potential consequences of an investment linked to the underlying index and of seeking daily compounding leveraged long or leveraged inverse investment results as applicable investors should actively and frequently monitor their investments in the etns even intraday if an investor holds the etns for more than one day it is possible that the investor will suffer significant losses in the etns even if the performance of the underlying index over the time the investor holds them is positive in the case of the leveraged long etns or negative in the case of the leveraged inverse etns because the etns are linked to the daily performance of the applicable underlying index and may include either leveraged long or leveraged inverse exposure adverse changes in the market price of the futures included in the underlying index will have a magnified adverse effect on the etns and a greater likelihood of causing such etns to be worth zero than if such etns were not linked to the leveraged inverse or leveraged long return of the applicable underlying index the etns do not guarantee any return of principal at maturity acceleration or redemption and do not pay any interest during their term although the issuer intends to list or has listed the etns on nyse arca nasdaq or bats a trading market for your etns may not develop the issuer is not required to maintain any listing of the etns on an exchange the issuer of the etns may delist the etns from any exchange for any reason at any time the issuer is not obligated to issue any particular amount of the etns and may suspend further issuances at any time if the issuer suspends further issuances of the etns it is possible that the etns could begin to trade at a premium to the indicative value any premium that develops may be reduced or eliminated at any time including as a result of an announcement that the issuer will restart issuances or an announcement that the issuer will exercise its right to accelerate the etns for an amount based on the indicative value paying a premium purchase price over the indicative value of the etns could lead to significant losses in the event the investor sells the etns at a time when such premium is no longer present in the marketplace or the etns are accelerated at the issuer’s option the trading price of the etns may vary considerably before any valuation date as defined in each prospectus due among other factors to fluctuations in the price or the volatility of the underlying index and other events that are difficult to predict at higher levels of volatility and since the etns are not principal protected there is a significant chance of a complete loss of etn value even if the performance of the underlying index is flat the daily resetting of each etn’s leveraged exposure to the underlying index is likely to cause each etn to experience a “decay” effect which is likely to worsen over time and will be greater the more volatile the underlying index the “decay” effect refers to a likely tendency of the etns to lose value over time independent of the performance of the underlying index accordingly the etns are not suitable for intermediate or longterm investment as any intermediate or longterm investment is very likely to sustain significant losses even if the underlying index appreciates in the case of the leveraged long etns or depreciates in the case of the leveraged inverse etns over the relevant time period although the decay effect is more likely to manifest itself the longer the etns are held the decay effect can have a significant impact on etn performance even over a period as short as two days if the level of the underlying index decreases or does not increase sufficiently or if it increases or does not decrease sufficiently in the case of inverse etns to offset the effect of the daily investor fee and any other applicable fees over the term of the etns the investor will receive less than the amount invested upon sale early redemption acceleration or maturity of the etns prior to maturity you may subject to certain restrictions described in the pricing supplement offer the applicable minimum number of your etns to the issuer for redemption on an early redemption date as defined in the prospectus you must offer for redemption at least the applicable minimum number of etns typically ’ or ’ depending on the product as set forth in the pricing supplement or an integral multiple of such amount in excess thereof at one time in order to exercise your right to cause the issuer to redeem your etns on any early redemption date in addition the issuer may charge investors a redemption charge of a percentage of the closing indicative value of any etn that is redeemed at the investor’s option at a rate as indicated in the applicable pricing supplement please see the applicable pricing supplement for fees or charges relating to the etns any payment on the etns is subject to the ability of the issuer to satisfy its obligations as they become due the risks listed above are not exhaustive investors should review the prospectus for each etn including all risk
