threats productivity loss and compliance requirements drives businesses to adopt web filtering solutions the web today is increasingly interactive and dynamic mandating a solution that accurately filters websites including blogs and social networkshow is cyren web filtering implemented   web filtering is integrated into a service provider environment or a vendor device such as a web security gateway it consists of an engine and cloudbased detection services via the cyren globalview cloudhow many categories are provided   urls are allocated at least one of  categories eight of which are security related a url may have up to five categories associated with ithow much bandwidth does web filtering require for communication with the cyren globalview cloud   cyren offers a local cached database that adjusts content according to the browsing habits of users served this provides local categorization for over  of all queriesfor the remainder a query sizedi already have web filtering integrated within my product offering do you offer a migration tool   we offer a migration kit to make the move to cyren easy the migration kit maps our categorization to your existing scheme so you continue with existing configuration and policies but benefit from our advanced solutionhow do you categorize urls “embedded” in cache or translation sites   web filtering accurately categorizes embedded urls eghttptranslategooglecomtranslatehlenslestlenuhttpwwwcnncomespanol is categorized as “news” and “translators” we also correctly categorize archive and content delivery siteshow do you handle https  we use an integrated engine that provides url categories ondemand whether the connection is http https ftp or ip the partner extracts the url from the session and passes it to the engine for categorizationin what types of products can url filtering be used   filtering can be embedded into devices and applications such as web gateways network devices mobile devices and desktop applications the solution is for service providers such as saas and secaas providers isps mobile operators and web portals antimalware faqsanswers to the most common questions we receivehow long has the company been around and involved in the av industry   we have been in this business since the very first days viruses appeared on microcomputers now referred to as pcs we have been processing virus samples since about what is special about cyrens vs other av sdks   awardwinning multilayered detection – the sdk is based on a unified platform with multiple detection technologies for maximum protection zerohour detection is ensured by the flexible architecture that enables fast reaction to new threat types cyren av continually proves its superior detection in product evaluations for this reason it has been selected by industry leaders such as google websense and microsoftindustry leading performance  scalability – the sdk excels at rapid object processing particularly clean files which are the majority on most systems and consumes very low resources the cyren engine has numerous proven deployments requiring less than half the servers compared to other solutions this advantage is especially clear on sites where cyren runs alongside a second av engine a complete evaluation of cyren’s av benefits from integration of the sdk into the oem environment to illustrate this large resource savingmaximum operational flexibility – the sdk is easily integrated as a standalone av or with multiple engines additionally the tiny sdk footprint supports deployment on a wide range of platforms and environments these advantages have convinced vendors such as mcafee to deploy cyren alongside their own solutions the flexibility of implementation has made cyren the choice for a wide range of solutions from the smallest network appliances and desktop clients to carriergrade network cloudshow do you name malware   as far as naming is concerned we try to be as close as possible to the caro naming convention we may append the name of the heuristic detection miniengine therefore the name could be caronamegeneric or caronameheuristicminienginethe cyren solutions we know are all based in the cloud is antivirus a cloudbased solution   most virus detections are handled by the sdk which resides locally on the server or device the sdk utilizes multiple engines to detect viruses based on heuristics file signatures and other proprietary techniques however in some cases the sdk will query the cloud for final verificationcan you describe the api   the av api is similar to common object model com it consists of fewer than ten calls with a range of parameters for optimal flexibilitywhat environment can the sdk be integrated into   the av sdk can be integrated with any language that provides a cc interface method such as python java etchow long does the integration typically take   the av sdk is very easy to integrate most partners take one to three days to integrate the sdkdoes the cyren av sdk scan compressed archives eg zip files   yes the sdk scans zip files by default and the level of depth can be specified such as a zip within a zip within a zip etc the default scan level is when scanning an archive does the sdk report on every file within the archive or just a general answer if a virus was found in one of the files   the scan engine will iterate and scan through all objects inside an archivehow big is your databasedefinition file   the definition files are between  mb to about  mbcan you supply some virus files for evaluation of your sdk   we never supply actual viruses for test it is against the caro computer antivirus researcher’s organization rules we can supply specific test samples that are not actual viruses but trigger our engine the eicar test file can also be downloaded from wwweicarcom this can be used to test different functionalities in the sdk email faqsanswers to the most common questions we receivehow is cyren antispam implemented   antispam is integrated into a service provider environment or a vendor device such as a mail gateway it consists of an engine that resides in the partner product or environment and detection services via the globalview cloudwhat is cyren’s spam detection rate   due to its patented recurrent pattern detection™ rpd™ technology cyren antispam has a typical sustained detection rate of more than  with virtually zero falsepositives approximately  in  millionwhat algorithms does cyren use to block spam   cyren antispam uses our rpd technology which differs from traditional filters rpd extracts and analyzes relevant message patterns classifying both distribution patterns and structure patterns regardless of the content or language of the messagewhat is cyren’s approach to image spam   cyren rpd contains an intrinsic mechanism to match recurring patterns across similar messages in the case of images cyren antispam is able to match images even with minute differences inserted by spammershow do you investigate and study false negative and false positive mail to improve your antispam engine   cyren offers a tool to report false negatives fn or false positive fp detections a team of analysts reviews each fp and adjusts algorithms to avoid recurrences an automated process analyzes fns and adds these to rpd to improve future querieshow long does it take to detect a new spam attack and how long does it take for this information to be available to partners systems   we analyze billions of emails per day enabling detection of new spam in seconds our “globalview cloud
