recordedit cemex has been accused of violating environmental laws in the united states environmental watchdog groups and the united states environmental protection agency are threatening to file suit claiming the company has committed numerous violations of the clean air act in lyons colorado the united states environmental protection agency has also filed suit against cemex in victorville california claiming the company failed to install modern air pollution controls despite spending millions in renovations in the united kingdom cemex was originally fined £ on october  after hazardous dust was deposited up to three miles  km away from its rugby works the fine was the highest ever given under the integrated pollution prevention and control regulations and was also the highest for an environment agency prosecution for six years the fine was however judged excessive by the court of appeal and so reduced to £ in april  cemex announced that it had installed a £ million dust abatement system at the same works in rugby which had cut particulate emissions by  the site comes under the auspices of the eu waste incineration directive as it burns waste tyres for fuel there are concerns

california unified air pollution control district reported high levels of chromium vi also known as hexavalent chromium a cancer causing chemical agent at an elementary school and fire department in davenport california chromium vi is the contaminant that inspired the movie erin brockovich the toxic substance apparently originated from dust emitted by the cemex cement plant in davenport as the levels of chromium vi measured eight times the air districts acceptable level at pacific elementary school and  times at the davenport fire department both are located less than a halfmile from cemex chromium vi may have been unwittingly produced at the cemex plant in davenport for the last seven years according to ed kendig the executive director of the monterey bay unified air pollution control district its highly possible that chromium vi continues to be produced across the country as an accidental previously unknown byproduct of the cementmaking process in  the epa filed a complaint against cemex for violating federal air regulations at its victorville plant and in  cemex was cited for violations at plants in santa barbara and michigan  environmentalists and scientists are

environmental recordedit cemex has been accused of violating environmental laws in the united states environmental watchdog groups and the united states environmental protection agency are threatening to file suit claiming the company has committed numerous violations of the clean air act in lyons colorado the united states environmental protection agency has also filed suit against cemex in victorville california claiming the company failed to install modern air pollution controls despite spending millions in renovations in the united kingdom cemex was originally fined £ on october  after hazardous dust was deposited up to three miles  km away from its rugby works the fine was the highest ever given under the integrated pollution prevention and control regulations and was also the highest for an environment agency prosecution for six years the fine was however judged excessive by the court of appeal and so reduced to £ in april  cemex announced that it had installed a £ million dust abatement system at the same works in rugby which had cut particulate emissions by  the site comes under the auspices of the eu waste incineration directive as it burns waste tyres for fuel there are concerns over the impact on both the environment and human health from this practice although it is common practice in many cement works during tests conducted from june  to august   the monterey bay california unified air pollution control district reported high levels of chromium vi also known as hexavalent chromium a cancer causing chemical agent at an elementary school and fire department in davenport california chromium vi is the contaminant that inspired the movie erin brockovich the toxic substance apparently originated from dust emitted by the cemex cement plant in davenport as the levels of chromium vi measured eight times the air districts acceptable level at pacific elementary school and  times at the davenport fire department both are located less than a halfmile from cemex chromium vi may have been unwittingly produced at the cemex plant in davenport for the last seven years according to ed kendig the executive director of the monterey bay unified air pollution control district its highly possible that chromium vi continues to be produced across the country as an accidental previously unknown byproduct of the cementmaking process in  the epa filed a complaint against cemex for violating federal air regulations at its victorville plant and in  cemex was cited for violations at plants in santa barbara and michigan  environmentalists and scientists are concerned for the monterey bay coastline where cemex has a sand mining operation in the city of marina ca the california coastal commission in march  issued a cease and desist order

and the united states environmental protection agency are threatening to file suit claiming the company has committed numerous violations of the clean air act in lyons colorado the united states environmental protection agency has also filed suit against cemex in victorville california claiming the company failed to install modern air pollution controls despite spending millions in renovations in the united kingdom cemex was originally fined £ on october  after hazardous dust was deposited up to three miles  km away from its rugby works the fine was the highest ever given under the integrated pollution prevention and control regulations and was also the highest for an environment agency prosecution for six years the fine was however judged excessive by the court of appeal and so reduced to £ in april  cemex announced that it had installed a £ million dust abatement system at the same works in rugby which had cut particulate emissions by  the site comes under the auspices of the eu waste incineration directive as it burns waste tyres for fuel there are concerns over the impact on both the environment and human health from this practice although it is common practice in many cement works during tests conducted from june  to august   the monterey bay california unified air pollution control district reported high levels of chromium vi also known as hexavalent chromium a cancer causing chemical agent at an elementary school and fire department in davenport california chromium vi is the contaminant that inspired the movie erin brockovich the toxic substance apparently originated from dust emitted by the cemex cement plant in davenport as the levels of chromium vi measured eight times the air districts acceptable level at pacific elementary school and  times at the davenport fire department both are located less than a halfmile from cemex chromium vi may have been unwittingly produced at the cemex plant in davenport for the last seven years according to ed kendig the executive director of the monterey bay unified air pollution control district its highly possible that chromium vi continues to be produced across the country as an accidental previously unknown byproduct of the cementmaking process in  the epa filed a complaint against cemex for violating federal air regulations at its victorville plant and in  cemex was cited for violations at plants in santa barbara and michigan  environmentalists and scientists are concerned for the monterey bay coastline where cemex has a sand mining operation in the city of marina ca

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be
