releases privacy policy  site map  events industry council  days in the life of hyatts chief  tribunedigitalchicagotribune  days in the life of hyatts chiefjune  by david elsnerrecently darryl hartleyleonard president of hyatt hotels corp agreed to allow an outsider to sit in on his meetings and accompany him on his roundsthe result was a rare and fascinating twoday look at how one of the nations premier hotelmanagement chains does business and is coping with some of the fiercest competition it has ever encounteredhere is some of what happened during that periodtuesday  am hartleyleonard arrives for a working breakfast at the park hyatt at the water tower with peter underwood vice president in charge of engineeringa major topic of discussion is the smaller room and room hotels that hyatt has begun building in the suburbs underwood has prepared a list of the staffing requirements for maintenance engineers but more bodies are on it than hartleyleonard wants to pay fornoting how thin the profit margins are on a smaller hotel property hartleyleonard asks underwood to combine some job descriptions underwood isnt happy you wont like the end product he says referring to the maintenance problems he forseesid rather go light at the start and add on later than vice versahartleyleonard says once those positions are in the operating manual we wont be able to get them out for  years underwood says hell reexamine the situation am hartleyleonard takes a phone call from one of the companys young general managers who is responsible for an aging hotel hartleyleonard feels the manager in trying to be one of the boys made an inappropriate joke about the condition of his hotel at a recent highlevel meetingabout a week earlier hartleyleonard let word of his displeasure filter back but he has avoided answering the managers previous notes and phone messages allowing him to stew awhileon the phone hartleyleonard says the company fully intends to spend the money needed to correct the hotels situation but tells the manager his comment was tactless youve got to keep your head in the right place he admonishes morale among employees at the hotel would suffer if they ever heard that kind of comment coming from their bossafter the stick theres a carrot youre doing amazingly wellhartleyleonard says i realize your problem as for the other matter its over as far as im concerned am in the middle of a meeting with memebrs of a production company to discuss a video employee newsletter that hyatt wants to produce a telephone call comes in from hartleyleonards fiveyearold son who has been upset that his father has not been around much lately hartleyleonard has told him that he will take his phone calls any time no matter where he is he chats with his son for about five minutes holding the meeting in abeyancehe was just testing me to see if i would do what i said he notes am a labor relations officer asks for a few minutes time there is some confusion about the tack the company should be taking regarding a union representation election at an east coast hotelwe will run a normal hyatttype campaign hartleyleonard saysthere will be no badmouthing of the union nothing showing union leaders with dollar signs coming out of their ears pm hartleyleonard walks up two flights of stairs to the corporate dining room he chats from table to table finding out whats been going on with others over the course of the morning pm hyatt intends to grow not only by physical expansion but by doing a better job of marketing itselfthis meeting with marketing vice president joe garvey and nan krump director of market development has been scheduled to discuss progress on hyatts planned frequent traveler program that will offer awards for those staying at hyatts a certain number of nights and spending a certain number of dollarsin truth hyatt has fallen behind the rest of the hotel industry in offering such a program and hartleyleonard notes his general managers complain they are getting hammered by the competition marriott for instance offers attractive incentives including caribbean cruises hotel stays airline tickets and rental carsbut hyatt has moved slowly because it is extremely concerned about thecontingent liability connected with incentive programs meaning that those who offer them could have a substantial portion of their net worth wiped out if everyone claimed their prizes airlines and hotel companies with bonus programs could be badly hurt if the irs decides to tax the awards as it has said it might hartleyleonard has heard through the grapevine that one major airline has  million in contingent liabilitywe want to make sure we structure our program in the right way he says and we want to know our costs going in that means the company wants to work out some way to encourage its program participants to burn off      next morenew owner demolishes oj simpson mansionnicole simpsons grisly death described to
