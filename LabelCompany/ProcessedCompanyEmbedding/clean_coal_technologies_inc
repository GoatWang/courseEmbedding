technologies retained new management whose mission was to establish a commercial platform to market its innovative processes worldwide in so doing it became quickly apparent that the quickest path to market was through the asian market that at present is the most dynamic coalbased energy market in the world the asian opportunity initially is being addressed through clean coal technologies pristinem™ process that solves the two key problems faced by companies that offer a dry coal product these problems are that very dry coal is dangerous to transport owing to the risk of spontaneous combustion and second that the dried coal tends to reabsorb moisture quickly before it reaches the end user the companys pristinem™ process successfully addresses both problems and does so very costeffectively unlike most competing processes clean coals process does not involve pulverization and subsequent briquetting of the coal the companys vapor phase deposition process allows for the increase of the calorific content of the raw coal beyond what would be achieved naturally by the removal of moisture alone currently clean coal technologies together with  archean group its partner in

chemical engineering virginia tech  a b tech chemical engineering indian institute of technology india  and an mba university of pennsylvania    the need for coal with less moisture and volatile chemicals low rank coal tends to have a high moisture content which makes the coal much less efficient when used in a coalfired plant for energy production unfortunately with most existing technologies upgraded coal that has had its moisture removed tends to spontaneously combust and reabsorbs moistures in both transportation and storage furthermore traditional upgrade technologies involve the pulverization of coal and briquetting it back into a solid form which is exceedingly expensive and time consuming clean coal technologies pristinem™ process uses patented technology to solve these problems before it reaches the end user and does so very costeffectively this unique process is designed to remove moisture from coal and produce a coal of exceptional stability ie one that is able to be transported safely over long distances and without reabsorbing moisture unlike most competing processes clean coal does not involve pulverization and subsequent briquetting of the coal instead the companys vapor phase deposition process allows for the increase of the calorific content of the raw coal beyond what would be achieved naturally by the removal of moisture alone in addition clean coals second technology the pristine™ process addresses the issue of volatile chemicals in coal by extracting theses chemicals clean coal significantly reduced levels of toxic air pollutant precursors such as sulfur and mercury the pristine™ process also produce liquid byproducts that contain hydrocarbon compounds that via chemical synthesis may be converted into commodity chemicals for an additional revenue stream    modular construction with numerous advantages from an industrial perspective clean coal technologies processes are straightforward and elegant the industrial plant an original design by saic is a modular and scalable concept as opposed to constructing a single plant to the desired capacity it should be noted that several prominent players have failed to upscale their pilot plants as the scaleup ratios ranged from  to  as compared with clean coals  the pristine™ and pristinem™ standard modules can handle k and k tons per annum respectively in continuous mode owing to the extraction of volatile matters namely a significant amount of coal derived liquids cdls the modules are selffueling once they have been initiated using propane or diesel fuel the valuable cdl byproducts add significant value to the pristine™ process greatly improving plant economics as a fundamental design parameter that sought to minimize technology risk as much as possible the commercial plant will be built using wellestablished tried and timeproven components that are available widely and offtheshelf there are numerous advantages of the modular design most important is that scaleup risk is minimized if a company wants to increase capacity it merely adds as many identical units as needed performance risk is minimized as failure of a component will not disable the entire plant plant expansions and renovations can be made in affordable increments rather than in the usual stepup fashion that entails a degree of overcapacity at the outset   future steps toward a successful technology rollout to further validate clean coals technology on an industrial scale the company plans to construct a  scale pilot plant in the united states clean coal and its various technology partners are presently in negotiations with a major us power company to locate the pilot plant on the site of its coalfired power generation facility in oklahoma future work on fullscale commercial plants in indonesia is expected to follow what the company believes will be a successful commissioning of the pilot plant in oklahoma by yearend  or early  based on its current models clean coals processes are expected to offer exceptional plant economics even assuming zero debt in the capital structure and considering only the cost of the plant with only basic ancillary equipment dcf analysis indicates an investment recovery period of just over  years and an roi in the range of  with normal eg  debt in the capital structure both the recovery period and the investments returns improve significantly with the investment recovered in just over  years and an roi in excess of  the financial modeling that illustrates these results was based on actual test results going forward clean coal technologies is committed to market its patented processes in the global energy economy now with an experienced management team in place highly soughtafter technologies and worldclass execution the company has positioned itself to capitalize on the extraordinary demand for cleaner premium coal with an unequivocal commitment to building longterm

cleaner burning and more efficient fuel today announced progress theyre making in helping advance domestic coal interests in wyomingafter several months of working with both the doe and capitol hill we are very pleased to announce that key meetings have been scheduled for ccti management the week commencing february th in the prb region of wyoming said ccti cto robin eves these meetings have been arranged for by local officials and will combine both government officials as well as visits to local working coal mines and mines that have been shuttered due to the recent challenges facing the coal industry we remain steadfast in the belief that our technology can assist in bringing jobs back to the us coal industry our focus is on penetrating the export market with our patented processed coal by improving the quality of the coal increasing its value for export and making it more environmentally safe for transportcompany management is very excited about the change in attitude towards coal since the trump administration took office its the companys hope that coal mining handling and transportation jobs will no longer be lost because of dwindling exports environmental activism and technological advancement can mutually exist to create a more efficient and cleaner use of coal and cctis patented technology is proving that the company is committed to working with both industry bodies those businesses supporting the industry and the us government to deploy technology to bring back badly needed jobs but to do so in ways that upgrade and update processes for the entire coalfired energy industryits becoming an increasingly exciting time in this space and we are being very careful to explore every opportunity available to us that will increase shareholder value with
