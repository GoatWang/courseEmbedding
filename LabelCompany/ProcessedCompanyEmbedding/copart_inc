alphasign in  join nowgo»copart undervalued gem in a niche industrymay  about copart inc cprt mike berner long only growth at reasonable pricestocks  scuttlebutt blogsummarycopart holds enormous market share in salvage vehicle industrycompany benefits from network effects and historic trendsprospects for international expansion look crediblepast outperformance of sp  benchmark seems likely to continuestock may be undervalued by  percent giving investors wide margin of safetyfailing to purchase shares of copart nasdaqcprt a year ago probably ranks among my worst investing blunders around that time i found myself needing to purchase a new car well new to me anyway trying to find a decent used car is always a frustrating process a prime example of information asymmetrythe term in academic economics for when one party in a transaction holds a knowledge advantage unless you know a lot about car mechanics the buyer of a used vehicle is always at a disadvantage to the seller during my effort to educate myself more about used cars i happened across a few annual reports from companies connected to the industry one of them was none other than copart at first glance the company looked extremely attractive copart holds a large share of a niche market benefits from powerful network effects and produces terrific cash flow and consistently high and increasing returns on invested capital already the leader in the us market the company had successfully expanded to the uk and aimed to conquer other developed markets i read all of this and immediately understood the potential for enormous profitsand then for whatever reason i did absolutely nothing naturally the stock then rose  percent over the next year although it is painful for me to think about what could have been i recently reexamined the company in order to determine if it still looked like a promising investment after looking at the company in more detail than i did the first time i am more convinced now that copart is a longterm buy background copart inc operates as a car auctioneer that deals primarily in salvage vehicles founded in  as a single shop in california copart gradually expanded across the us through both organic growth and acquisition the company now operates over  locations worldwide with  percent of the total located in the domestic market in  copart entered the united kingdom with its acquisition of universal salvage plc and has continued to buy up competitors in the country today most auctions are conducted over the internet using coparts virtual bidding system similar to that of ebay nasdaqebay which the company refers to as vb although copart deals used vehicles of all types the bulk of the supply is provided by insurance companies that offload damaged cars deemed a total loss as broker copart earns money by extracting fees from buyers and sellers it also earns additional revenue through towing and storage services provided at its physical locations the salvage vehicle market is also concentrated in two multibilliondollar public companies copart and its principal competitor kar auction services nysekar which owns salvage auctioneer insurance auto auctions together control  percent of the domestic salvage market competitive advantages coparts advantages boil down to its geographic scale quality of service and management and network effects with its large and growing network of service centers copart possesses a nearly unparalleled ability to move vehicles across the country in an efficient manner indeed it aims to move cars from one location to the next within  hours because of the companys ubiquity it can offer vehicles from locations in almost every us state with more than  million vehicles sold in  there also seems to be a general impression among industry insiders that copart offers a superior service and better management eleven years ago an author on this site claimed to have spoken with players in the field and gathered opinions to that effect but without credible survey results we just cannot know for certain what the consensus is still it is helpful to look at a few derivative metrics for one copartcoms alexa rank stands at  globally and  in the us meanwhile iaaicom comes in at  globally and  in the us since most car auctions are now conducted over the internet this bodes well for copart compared to insurance auto auctions then there is the  study performed by deloitte which ranked copart the most exceptional public company in terms of financial performance the methodology is interesting because it seeks to determine which companies outperformed when controlling for factors such as industry performance year and company size copart also enjoys a significant edge in network effects which might be its greatest advantage the idea behind network effects is that the product or service becomes more useful when more people consume it in this respect copart probably resembles something closer to a technology company than a salvage yard network effects explain why internet marketplaces ebay and craigslist despite their dated user interfaces have done very well selling used goods since their inception in  while startups can perhaps offer a superior product they cannot offer the vast network of buyers and sellers that the stalwarts built up over  years furthermore copart possesses a vast network of physical yards in addition to its online auction platform so any potential competitor would need to wage a twofront war dealing in salvage vehicles is also a very different business than drivable used cars there are many outlets for the latter but the salvage market is comparatively highly regulated performance and future prospects coparts performance history would make any investor salivate a  investment exactly ten years ago would be worth over  today compared to less than  for an equivalent investment in an sp  index fund net income has tripled since  while shares outstanding have been reduced by  percent resulting in earnings per share increasing by  percent meanwhile return on invested capital has averaged an enviable  percent a year over the last decade never dropping below  percent indeed returns have trended upward probably because of the online segment that likely requires little capital the results speak for themselves when we consider average revenue and profit per copart location up  percent and  percent respectively since    revenue  billion  million net income  million  million number of locations   average revenue per location  million  million average net income per location  million  million favorable macro trends also bode well for coparts future the number of used vehicles on the road is at a historic high because cars last longer now than ever before a trend that seems unlikely to reverse despite new safety features the number of vehicle crashes is also up from previous years as a result of distracted driving the combined effect of these two trends is that the number of vehicles declared a total loss is increasing older cars that have depreciated significantly are often totaled in minor collisions all of this is great news for copart because it increases business without the company having to lift a finger collisions will happen regardless of what the economy is doing and copart will keep making money because its fees are fixed indeed total revenue only dropped slightly during the recession years coparts stated intention is to expand across continental europe where salvage market trends are similar to the us and also backfill the domestic market i am always wary of international expansion and prefer not to assume that it will occur in my financial projections but copart has succeeded in the uk and plans to expand by making what are essentially bolton acquisitions it simply buys up regional and independent salvage yards and folds them into its existing online network conclusion copart is in many ways the ideal business it leads its competitors with a  percent market share benefits from network effects and is involved in stable industry future growth is impossible to determine with certainty but i do think that copart will be selling substantially more vehicles ten years from now assuming earnings growth of  percent for ten years which is within coparts historic compounded average and a modest future earnings multiple of  the company could be undervalued today by anywhere from  percent disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long
