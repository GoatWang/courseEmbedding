directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
