since  at age  wayne gregory designed his first backpack as part of a boy scout project shortly after this experience he met andy drollinger the founder of san diego california adventure  at a boy scout camporee andy was impressed with waynes design and over the next few years wayne could be found hanging around the adventure  factory buying raw materials and tinkering with a variety of backpack ideas he soon became the young companies second employee in  wayne started his first company sunbird with a goal to produce advanced external frame packs unhappy with the limitations of externals he dissolved the company in  and began working as a freelance designer sleeping bags tents and technical apparel for a number of companies in the newly emerging outdoor specialty industry intrigued with new directions in soft packs and internal frame concepts he decided it was time to get back to his first love designing backpacks and in  wayne founded gregory mountain products in san diego california from the start wayne wasnt just meticulous about designing packs that improved upon fit and used the best materials available he also wanted to know how his designs worked in the field and what he could do better a heritage of accessibility he has continued to present in the early days he loved to talk tech with customers at his retail store in san diego where he built his packs in the back shop he wanted to know firsthand what worked and what didnt and many customers ideas were incorporated in new products ultimately wayne realized that in the backpack business fit was king and he pioneered many firsts including being the first to build backpacks in different frame harness and waist belt sizes the first and still only pack manufacturer to develop a waistbelt system that adjusts to fit different hip angles automatically improving load transfer and developing the centerlocking bar tack a stitch that ends and locks off on the center of a seam instead of the side for increased strength at major stress points from the earliest days gregory packs were noted for innovative design ergonomic and comfortable fit and our obsession with quality comfort and durability
