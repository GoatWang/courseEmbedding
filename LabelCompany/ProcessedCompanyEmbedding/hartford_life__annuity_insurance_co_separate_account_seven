consider adding the amount of the surrender value the customer would get in the letter that we will be sent to customers or a phone number where they could obtain it � response� since the actual amount of the surrender value fluctuates due to market performance we are not going to include the surrender value in the letter because we feel it will provide confusion� the letter does include a

for premium taxes upon surrender or annuitization of the contract or upon the payment of a death benefit depending upon the jurisdiction the contracts provide for an annual contract maintenance fee of  that hartford life or hartford la deducts on each contract anniversary and upon a full surrender of a contract a daily administrative charge deducted from the assets of each account at an annual rate

“cdsc” the cdsc is equal to the percentage of each premium payment surrendered or withdrawn as specified in the table below the cdsc is separately calculated and applied to each premium payment at any time that the payment or part of the payment is surrendered or withdrawn the cdsc applicable to each premium payment diminishes as the payment ages beyond four years no cdsc applies to contract value

are withdrawn on a firstin firstout basis the annual withdrawal amount is  of premium payments still subject to a cdsc measured at the time of withdrawal  if an owner or annuitant dies before the annuity commencement date the contracts provide under most circumstances for a death benefit payable to a beneficiary the death benefit is the greatest of   or  or  if the optional death benefit rider is purchased computed as of the date that hartford life or hartford la receives proof of death where  contract value reduced by the amount of any bonus credit applied during the twelve months prior to the date of computation  total premiums payments reduced by the amount of all withdrawals of contact value  the maximum anniversary value as defined in the contract reduced by the amount of any bonus credits applied during the twelve months prior to the date of computation or  interest accumulation value as defined in the contract  the contracts include a bonus payment provision pursuant to which hartford life or hartford la credits an owners contract value with an additional amount when a net premium payment is applied the amount of the bonus payment is a percentage of each premium payment made by the owner the percentage is a function of premiums received under a contract as shown in the following table aggregate premiumscredit in percentfrom  to  or more if a premium payment raises the amount of aggregate payments above  then hartford life or hartford la will add another bonus credit to the owners contract value in an amount equal to  of the prior premium payments  hartford life or hartford la recaptures or retains the credited amount in the event that the owner exercises his or her cancellation right during the right to examine period in addition the owner elects to annuitize the contract the amount applied to purchase any annuity payment option is the contract value less bonus credits applied during the twentyfour months prior to annuitization also as indicated above in computing death benefits hartford life or hartford la may “recapture” bonus credits applied within twelve months prior to the date as of which the death benefit is computed finally in the event of a surrender or withdrawal of contract value where the surrender charge is waived due to the owners or annuitants confinement to a hospital nursing home or other longterm care facility as defined in the contract hartford life or hartford la will “recapture” all bonus credits applied during the period of confinement a “confinement period”  as a result of the recapture provisions increases in the value of accumulation units representing bonus credits accrue to the owner immediately but the initial value of such units only belongs to the owner when or to the extent that the recapture period for the bonus payment expires and the units vest on the other hand decreases in the value of accumulation units representing bonus credits do not diminish the dollar amount of contract value subject to recapture therefore additional units must become subject to recapture as their value decreases and the proportionate share of any owners variable contract value or the owners interest in an account that hartford life or hartford la can “recapture” increases as variable contract value or the owners interest in an account decreases this dilutes the owners interest in the account visavis hartford life or hartford la and in his or her variable contract value visavis hartford life or hartford la  because it is not administratively feasible to track the value of bonus credits in an account that have not vested hartford life or hartford la deducts the daily mortality and expense risk charge and the daily administrative charge from the entire net asset value of the accounts as a result the daily mortality and expense risk charge and the daily administrative charge paid by any owner is greater than that which he start printed page or she would pay without the bonus credit  applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section c of the act exempting them as well as future accounts and future underwriters from the provisions of sections a c and ia of the act and rule c thereunder to the extent necessary to permit the recapture of certain credits applied to premium payments made in consideration of the contracts and future contracts applicants legal analysis  subsection i of section  provides that section  does not apply to any registered separate account supporting variable annuity contracts or to the sponsoring insurance company and principal underwriter of such account except as provided in paragraph  of subsection i paragraph  provides that it shall be unlawful for a registered separate account or sponsoring insurance company to sell a variable annuity contract supported by the separate account unless among other things the contract is a redeemable security section a defines a “redeemable security” as any security other than shortterm paper under the terms of which the holder upon presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent thereof  section c of the act authorizes the commission to make rules and regulations applicable to registered investment companies and to principal underwriters of and dealers in the redeemable securities of any registered investment company rule c thereunder imposes requirements with respect to both the amount payable on redemption of a redeemable security and the time as of which such amount is calculated specifically rule c in pertinent part prohibits a registered investment company issuing any redeemable security a person designated in such issuers prospectus as authorized to consummate transactions in any such security and a principal underwriter of or dealer in such security from selling redeeming or repurchasing any such security except at a price based on the current net asset value of such security which is next computed after receipt of a tender of such security for redemption or of an order to purchase or sell such security  section c of the act authorizes the commission to exempt any person security or transaction or any class of persons securities or transactions from any provision or provisions of the act andor any rule under it if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act  applicants assert that the requested exemptions are appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act  applicants assert that the recapture of bonus credits would not at any time deprive an owner of his or her proportionate share of the current net assets of an account until the appropriate recapture period expires hartford life or hartford la retains the right to and interest in each owners contract value representing the dollar amount of any unvested bonus credits therefore if hartford life or hartford la recaptures any bonus credit or part of a bonus credit in the circumstances described above it would merely be retrieving its own assets hartford life or hartford la would grant bonus credits out of its general account assets and the amount of the credits although not the earnings on such amounts would remain hartford lifes or hartford las until such amounts vest with the owner thus to the extent that hartford life or hartford la may grant and recapture bonus credits in connection with variable contract value it would not at either time deprive any owner of his or her then proportionate share of an accounts assets  applicants state that the nature of the bonus recapture provisions as they apply to variable contract value dictate that an owner will obtain a benefit from a bonus credit in a rising market because any earnings on the bonus credit amount will vest immediately and over time cause the owners share of both the contracts variable contract value and an accounts net assets to be greater on a relative basis than it would have been without the bonus credit conversely in a falling market an owner will suffer a detriment from a bonus credit because losses on the bonus credit amount also will “vest” immediately and cause the owners share of both the contracts variable contract value and the accounts net assets to decrease on a relative basis  applicants do not believe that the dynamics of hartford lifes and hartford las proposed bonus credit provisions violate sections a or ia of the act nonetheless in order to avoid any uncertainty as to full compliance with the act applicants seek exemptions from these two sections  hartford lifes or hartford las recapture of any bonus credit could be viewed as the redemption of such an interest at a price other than net asset value if such is the case then the bonus credit provisions could be viewed as conflicting with section c of the act and rule c thereunder applicants believe that the recapture of the bonus credits does not violate section c of the act or rule c thereunder nonetheless in order to avoid any uncertainty as to full compliance with the act applicants seek exemptions from section c and rule c  applicants argue that the bonus credit recapture provisions do not give rise to the evils that rule c was designated to address the rule was intended to eliminate or reduce as far as was reasonably practicable the dilution of the value of outstanding redeemable securities of registered investment companies through their redemption at a price above net asset value or other unfair results including speculative trading practices the evils prompting the adoption of rule c were primarily the result of backward pricing the practice of basing the price of a mutual fund share on the net asset value per share determined as of the close of the market on the previous day backward pricing permitted certain investors to take advantage of increases or decreases in net asset value that were not yet reflected in the price thereby diluting the values of outstanding shares the proposed bonus credit recapture provisions pose no such threat of dilution  recaptures of bonus credits result in a redemption of hartford lifes or hartford las interest in an owners contract value or in an account at a price determined on the basis of the accounts current net asset value and not at an inflated price moreover applicants represent that the amount recaptured will always equal the amount that hartford life or hartford la paid from its general account for the credits similarly although owners are entitled to retain any investment gains attributable to the bonus credits the amount of such gains would always be computed at a price determined on the basis of net asset value  applicants assert that even if the proposed bonus credit provisions conflict with sections a c or ia of the act or rule c thereunder the commission should grant the exemptions because the bonus credit provisions are generally favorable for prospective owners the bonus credits are beneficial to prospective start printed page owners the recapture provisions do not on balance diminish the overall value of the bonus credit provisions and are fully disclosed in the prospectus for the contracts  applicants assert that the bonus credit recapture provisions are necessary if hartford life or hartford la are to offer the bonus credits it would be unfair to hartford life or hartford la to permit owners to keep their bonus credits upon their exercise of the contracts right to examine provision because no cdsc applies to the exercise of the right to examine provision the owner could obtain a quick profit in the amount of the bonus credit at hartford lifes or hartford las expense by exercising that right likewise because no additional cdsc applies upon death of an owner or annuitant or upon annuitization and no cdsc applies during a confinement period such a death annuitization or confinement period surrender or withdrawal shortly after the award of bonus credits would afford an owner or a beneficiary a similar profit in the event of such profits to owners or beneficiaries hartford life and hartford la could not recover the cost of granting the bonus credits this is because hartford life and hartford la both intend to recoup the costs of providing the bonus credits through the charges under the contract particularly the daily mortality and expense risk charge and the daily administrative charge if the profits described above are permitted certain owners could take advantage of them greatly reducing the base from which the daily charges are deducted and greatly increasing the amount of bonus credits that hartford life and hartford la must provide therefore the recapture provisions are the price of offering the bonus credits hartford life and hartford life and hartford la simply cannot offer the proposed bonus credits without the ability to recapture those credits in the limited circumstances described herein  applicants assert that the commissions authority under section c of the act to grant exemptions from various provisions of the act and rules thereunder is broad enough to permit orders of exemption that cover classes of unidentified persons applicants request an order of the commission that would exempt them future accounts and future underwriters from the provisions of sections a c and ia of the act and rule c thereunder the exemption of these classes of persons is appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act because all of the potential members of the class could obtain the foregoing exemptions for themselves on the same basis as the applicants but only at a cost to each of them that is not justified by any public policy purpose the commission has previously granted exemptions to classes of similarly situated persons in various contexts and in a wide variety of circumstances including future exemptions for recapturing bonus credits under variable annuity contracts  applicants represent that future contracts will be substantially similar in all material respects to the contracts and that each factual statement and representation about the bonus credit provisions of the contracts will be equally true of future contracts applicants also represent that each material representation made by them about hartford life and hartford la each account and hsdci will be equally true of future accounts and future underwriters to the extent that such representations relate to the issues discussed in this application conclusion applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section c of the act exempting them as well as future accounts and future underwriters from the provisions of sections a c and ia of the act and rule c thereunder to the extent necessary to permit the recapture of certain credits applied to purchase payments made in consideration of the contracts and future contracts applicants assert based on the grounds summarized above that their exemptive request meets the standards set out in section c of the  act namely that the exemptions requested are necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes

make the contracts more attractive to existing contract owners applicants state that by eliminating overlapping investment options that duplicate one another by having substantially similar investment objectives strategies and risks the hartford insurance companies can present a more streamlined menu of investment options under the contracts applicants further state that since the proposed substitutions were designed to reduce investmentoption redundancy the diversity of available investment styles under the contracts will not be adversely impacted additional information for each existing portfolio and the corresponding replacement portfolio including investment objectives principal investment strategies principal risks and fees can be found in the application  applicants state that through the proposed substitutions the hartford insurance companies seek to replace certain investment options in the contracts current fund lineups with investment options that will provide contract owners with lower expenses while maintaining a highquality menu of investment options in this regard the section  applicants believe that contract owners with contract value allocated to the subaccounts of the existing portfolios will have lower total and net annual operating expenses immediately after the proposed substitutions than before the proposed substitutions applicants also state that for each substitution the combined management fee and rule b fee of each replacement portfolio is lower than that of the corresponding existing portfolio the application sets forth the fees and expenses of each existing portfolio and its corresponding replacement portfolio in greater detail  the section  applicants also agree that during a period of two  years following the implementation of the proposed substitution the “substitution date” and for those contracts with assets allocated to an existing portfolio on the substitution date the hartford insurance companies will reimburse on the last business day of each fiscal quarter the owners of those contracts invested in the applicable replacement portfolio to the extent that the replacement portfolios total net annual operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements for such period exceeds on an annualized basis the total net annual operating expenses of the existing portfolio for fiscal year  in addition the hartford insurance companies will not increase the contract fees and charges that would otherwise be assessed under the terms of those contracts for a period of at least two  years following the substitution date  applicants state that the hartford insurance companies or their affiliates will pay all expenses and transaction costs of the proposed substitutions including legal and accounting expenses any applicable brokerage expenses and other fees and expenses applicants state that no fees or charges will be assessed to the affected contract owners to effect the proposed substitutions applicants state that the proposed substitutions will not cause the contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing contract owners to be greater after the substitutions than before the substitutions  applicants state that the contract value of each contract owner affected by the proposed substitutions will not change as a result of the proposed substitutions applicants state that because the substitutions will occur at relative net asset value and the fees and charges under the contracts will not change as a result of the substitutions the benefits offered by the guarantees under the contracts will be the same immediately before and after the substitutions applicants further state that what effect the substitutions may have on the value of the benefits offered by the contract guarantees would depend among other things on the relative future performance of each existing portfolio and replacement portfolio which the section  applicants cannot predict nevertheless the section  applicants note that at the time of the substitutions the contracts will offer a comparable variety of investment options with as broad a range of riskreturn characteristics  at least  days prior to the substitution date contract owners will be notified via prospectus supplements which will be filed with the commission pursuant to rule  under the securities act of  that the section  applicants received or expect to receive commission approval of the applicable proposed substitutions and of the anticipated substitution date the “presubstitution notice” the presubstitution notice will advise contract owners that contract values attributable to investments in the existing portfolios will be transferred to the replacement portfolios without any charge that would otherwise apply and without being subject to any limitations on transfers on the substitution date the presubstitution notice also will state that from the date of the presubstitution notice through the date thirty  days after the substitutions contract owners may transfer contract value from the subaccounts investing in the existing portfolios before the substitutions or the replacement portfolios after the substitutions to any other available investment option without charge and without imposing any transfer limitations  the section  applicants will also deliver to affected contract owners at least thirty  days before the substitution date a prospectus for each applicable replacement portfolio in addition within five  business days after the substitution date contract owners whose assets are allocated to a replacement portfolio as part of the proposed substitutions will be sent a written notice each a “confirmation” informing them that the substitutions were carried out as previously notified the confirmation will also restate the information set forth in the presubstitution notice the confirmation will also reflect the contract owners contract values before and after the substitutionsstart printed page   each substitution will be effected at the relative net asset values of the respective shares of the replacement portfolios in conformity with section c of the  act and rule c thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the section  applicants the substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any contracts held by affected contract owners as such the section  applicants believe that the procedures to be implemented are sufficient to assure that each contract owners cash values immediately after the substitution will be equal to the cash value immediately before the substitution as of the substitution date the separate accounts will redeem shares of the existing portfolios for cash or inkind the proceeds of such redemptions will then be used to purchase shares of the corresponding replacement portfolio as each subaccount of the separate accounts will invest the proceeds of its redemption from the existing portfolios in the applicable replacement portfolios legal analysis  the section  applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section c of the act approving the proposed substitutions section c of the act prohibits any depositor or trustee of a unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer from substituting another security of another issuer without the approval of the commission section c provides that such approval shall be granted by order of the commission “if the evidence establishes that the substitution is consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act”  the section  applicants submit that each of the substitutions meet the standards set forth in section c and that if implemented the substitutions would not raise any of the concerns underlying this provision the section  applicants believe that each replacement portfolio and its corresponding existing portfolios have substantially similar investment objectives principal investment strategies and principal risks applicants state that accordingly no contract owner will involuntarily lose his or her riders as a result of any proposed substitution contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed substitutions  the section  applicants request that the commission issue an order pursuant to section b of the act exempting them from section a of the act to the extent necessary to permit them to carry out as part of the substitutions the inkind transactions section a of the act prohibits any affiliated person of a registered investment company or any affiliated person of such person acting as principal from selling any security or other property to such registered investment company section a of the act prohibits any of the persons described above acting as principals from purchasing any security or other property from such registered investment company  because the proposed substitutions may be effected in whole or in part by means of inkind redemptions and purchases the proposed substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between affiliated persons the proposed transactions may involve a transfer of portfolio securities by the existing portfolios to the separate accounts immediately thereafter the separate accounts would purchase shares of the replacement portfolios with the portfolio securities received from the existing portfolios accordingly to the extent the separate accounts and the existing portfolios and the separate accounts and the replacement portfolios are deemed to be affiliated persons of one another under section a of the act it is conceivable that this aspect of the proposed substitutions could be viewed as being prohibited by section a as such the section  applicants have determined that it is prudent to seek relief from section a in the context of this application  the section  applicants maintain that the terms of the proposed inkind transactions including the consideration to be paid by each existing portfolio and received by each replacement portfolio involved are reasonable fair and do not involve overreaching principally because the transactions will conform with all but one of the conditions enumerated in rule a the inkind transactions will take place at relative net asset value in conformity with the requirements of section c of the act and rule c thereunder without the imposition of any transfer or similar charges by the section  applicants the substitutions will be effected without change in the amount or value of any contract held by the affected contract owners the substitutions will in no way alter the tax treatment of affected contract owners in connection with their contracts and no tax liability will arise for contract owners as a result of the substitutions the fees and charges under the contracts will not increase because of the substitutions even though the separate accounts the hartford insurance companies and the trust may not rely on rule a the section  applicants believe that the rules conditions outline the type of safeguards that result in transactions that are fair and reasonable to registered investment company participants and preclude overreaching in connection with an investment company by its affiliated persons  the section  applicants submit that the proposed inkind purchases by the separate accounts are consistent with the policies of the trust and the replacement portfolios as recited in the trusts current registration statement and reports filed under the act finally the section  applicants submit that the proposed substitutions are consistent with the general purposes of the act applicants conditions the section  applicants and himco as applicable agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  the substitutions will not be effected unless the section  applicants determine that i the contracts allow the substitution of shares of registered openend investment companies in the manner contemplated by this application ii the substitutions can be consummated as described in this application under applicable insurance laws and iii any regulatory

mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf

with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
