the year ended december   audit committee george r whittemore edwin j glickman dov gertzulin      table of contents independent directors report to the stockholders of lightstone value plus real estate investment trust ii inc we have reviewed the companys policies and determined that they are in the best interest of the companys stockholders set forth below is a discussion of the basis for that determination general the companys primary objective is to achieve capital appreciation with a secondary objective of income without subjecting principal to undue risk the company intends to achieve this goal primarily through investments in real estate properties the company intends to acquire residential and commercial properties as well as mortgage type securities the companys acquisitions may include both portfolios and individual properties the company expects that its commercial holdings will consist of retail primarily multitenanted shopping centers lodging primarily extended stay hotels industrial and office properties and that the companys residential properties will be principally comprised of class b multifamily complexes the following is descriptive of the companys investment objectives and policies  reflecting a flexible operating style the companys portfolio is likely to be diverse and include properties of different types such as retail office industrial and residential properties both passive and active investments and joint venture transactions the portfolio is likely to be determined largely by the purchase opportunities that the market offers whether on an upward or downward trend this is in contrast to those funds that are more likely to hold investments of a single type usually as outlined in their charters  the company may invest in properties that are not sold through conventional marketing and auction processes the companys investments may be at a dollar cost level lower than levels that attract those funds that hold investments of a single type  the company may be more likely to make investments that are in need of rehabilitation redirection remarketing andor additional capital investment  the company may place major emphasis on a bargain element in its purchases and often on the individual circumstances and motivations of the sellers the company will search for bargains that become available due to circumstances that occur when real estate cannot support the mortgages securing the property  the company intends to pursue returns in excess of the returns targeted by real estate investors who target a single type of property investment  the company may diversify its portfolio by investing up to  of its net assets in collateralized debt obligations commercial mortgagebacked securities and mortgage and mezzanine loans secured directly or indirectly by the same types of properties which it may acquire financing policies the company intends to utilize leverage to acquire its properties the number of different properties the company will acquire will be affected by numerous factors including the amount of funds available to us when interest rates on mortgage loans are high or financing is otherwise unavailable on terms that are satisfactory to the company the company may purchase certain properties for cash with the intention of obtaining a mortgage loan for a portion of the purchase price at a later time there is no limitation on the amount the company may invest in any single property or on the amount the company can borrow for the purchase of any property the company intends to limit its aggregate longterm permanent borrowings to  of the aggregate fair market value of all properties unless any excess borrowing is approved by a majority of the independent directors and is disclosed to the companys stockholders the company may also incur shortterm indebtedness having a maturity of two years or less by operating on a leveraged basis the company will have more funds available for investment in properties this will allow the company to make more      table of contents investments than would otherwise be possible resulting in a more diversified portfolio although the companys liability for the repayment of indebtedness is expected to be limited to the value of the property securing the liability and the rents or profits derived therefrom the companys use of leveraging increases the risk of default on the mortgage payments and a resulting foreclosure of a particular property to the extent that the company does not obtain mortgage loans on the companys properties the companys ability to acquire additional properties will be restricted the company will endeavor to obtain financing on the most favorable terms available policy on sale or disposition of properties the companys board of directors will determine whether a particular property should be sold or otherwise disposed of after considering the relevant factors including performance or projected performance of the property and market conditions with a view toward achieving its principal investment objectives the company currently intends to hold its properties for a minimum of seven to ten years prior to selling them after seven to ten years the companys board of directors may decide to liquidate the company list its shares on a national stock exchange sell its properties individually or merge or otherwise consolidate the company with a publiclytraded reit alternatively the company may merge with or otherwise be acquired by the sponsor or its affiliates the company may however sell properties prior to such time and if so may invest the proceeds from any sale financing refinancing or other disposition of its properties into additional properties alternatively the company may use these proceeds to fund maintenance or repair of existing properties or to increase reserves for such purposes the company may choose to reinvest the proceeds from the sale financing and refinancing of its properties to increase its real estate assets and its net income notwithstanding this policy the board of directors in its discretion may distribute all or part of the proceeds from the sale financing refinancing or other disposition of all or any of the companys properties to the companys stockholders in determining whether to distribute these proceeds to stockholders the board of directors will consider among other factors the desirability of properties available for purchase real estate market conditions the likelihood of the listing of the companys shares on a national securities exchange and compliance with the applicable requirements under federal income tax laws when the company sells a property it intends to obtain an allcash sale price however the company may take a purchase money obligation secured by a mortgage on the property as partial payment and there are no limitations or restrictions on the companys ability to take such purchase money obligations the terms of payment to the company will be affected by custom in the area in which the property being sold is located and the then prevailing economic conditions if the company receives notes and other property instead of cash from sales these proceeds other than any interest payable on these proceeds will not be available for distributions until and to the extent the notes or other property are actually paid sold refinanced or otherwise disposed therefore the distribution of the proceeds of a sale to the stockholders may be delayed until that time in these cases the company will receive payments in cash and other property in the year of sale in an amount less than the selling price and subsequent payments will be spread over a number of years independent directors george r whittemore edwin j glickman dov gertzulin      table of contents other matters presented for action at the  annual meeting of stockholders our board of
