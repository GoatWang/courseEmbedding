january  acquisition of integenx’s next generation sequencing business including the apollo tm instrument and the prepxtm reagents we intend to use the rest of the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate and working capital purposes including commercialization activities intended to increase revenues from sales of our target enrichment and other products we believe the industry leaders in the markets in which we compete are life fluidigm corporation illumina agilent technologies inc and perkinelmer inc other companies known to be currently serving the genetic analysis market include affymetrix inc ge healthcare a business segment of general electric company biorad laboratories inc eppendorf ag beckman coulter inc luminex corporation cepheid pacific biosciences of california inc nanostring technologies inc sequenom inc raindance technologies inc qiagen nv biometra biomedizinische analytik gmbh enzo biochem inc idaho technologies inc and the roche family of companies the marketplace for gene expression technologies is highly competitive with many of the major players already controlling significant market share many of which have significantly greater financial technology and other resources than we do illumina is the leader in microarrays and life is the market leader for realtime pcr these two companies also have a commanding market share in ngs we believe gene expression is a growing market and this market is driven by the need for realtime pcr performance for discovery and a higher throughput platform for validation to overcome the limitations of microarrays and real time pcr technologies that are currently used for discovery and validation respectively wafergen’s smartchip real time pcr system is presently the only platform that offers a single solution for both biomarker discovery and validation with low running costs simplified workflow and fast results our competitors could compete with us by developing new products similar to our smartchip system even though we believe that we have created a unique solution this does not mean that our competitors will not develop effective products to compete with our products company description since we commenced operations in  we have been engaged in the development of systems for gene expression quantification genotyping and stem cell research since  our primary focus has been on the development manufacture and marketing of our smartchip system a genetic analysis platform used for profiling and validating molecular biomarkers in the life sciences and pharmaceutical drug discovery industries since the beginning of  following an acquisition we now also sell the apollo ™ product line used in library preparation for nextgeneration sequencing “ngs” our combined product lines now offer onestop shopping for ngs sample preparation and validation solutions that enable ngs instruments such as miseqtm from illumina and pgmtm from thermo fisher to produce better results in terms of accuracy while at the same time simplifying the workflow in a cost efficient manner our smartchip products are aimed at researchers who perform genetic analysis primarily at pharmaceutical and biotech companies academic and private research centers and diagnostics companies involved in biomarker discovery and genetic research many scientists believe that much of the work to seek new therapeutic solutions will be directed at understanding the expression level of key relevant segments of dna ie genes and other regulatory elements as well as the changes in their sequence ie mutations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms “snps” gene expression is fundamental to the understanding of many disease processes and hence drug efficacy for example in the field of oncology cancer treatment greater understanding of gene expression in certain types of cancerous cells has led to the discovery of specific disease biomarkers that will allow clinicians to provide more accurate diagnosis prognosis and treatment options for their patients increasingly researchers are focusing their attention on studying physiological phenomena at the molecular level and are consequently committing their research budgets to acquiring research tools that help them develop personalized therapies we are primarily focused on marketing a flexible open format genetic analysis system the wafergen smartchip system which provides a range of high throughput capabilities including mrna microrna and lncrna expression level measurement as well as snp genotyping in august  we formally launched our first generation smartchip k system which was an innovative realtime polymerase chain reaction “realtime pcr” tool enabling scientists to study thousands of genes simultaneously clustered in gene specific pathways the results of such studies are potentially leading to the discovery and validation of clinically relevant disease signatures we believe that the smartchip system is well suited for the large and growing genomics markets including for researchers seeking to confirm and expand on discoveries made with the growing use of ngs in july  we launched the smartchip mydesign system which is the secondgeneration instrument with significantly upgraded capabilities first the new system allows customers to dispense their own assays into a smartchip which gives them much greater flexibility and faster experiment turnaround time second we have enabled snp genotyping on the smartchip by validating appropriate chemistries and supplying the requisite software the smartchip system’s high density nanoliterscale format can provide throughput levels that facilitate the development of life science clinical research solutions at a fraction of the time and cost currently possible with existing competing systems most recently our rd efforts have been concentrated on the commercialization of the smartchip target enrichment “te” system this new product is designed to perform a critical sample preparation step prior to targeted ngs the targeted sequencing is aimed at deciphering the nucleic acid sequence of a certain portion of the genome the targets for example a set of genes of interest as opposed to the whole genome in order to limit the sequencing to the targets of interest scientists are using various techniques including pcr to treat the nucleic acid samples prior to sequencing wafergen is using its smartchip consumable to conduct massively parallel individual pcr reactions for te this approach offers certain advantages over existing chemistries and platforms although these advantages could help us successfully compete in the high potential emerging market for clinical sequencing we face considerable competition including the competing sample preparation kits from ngs instrument manufacturers such as illumina inc “illumina” and life technologies corporation “life” now a division of thermo fisher we employ a business model that primarily generates revenue from the sale of instruments ie the smartchip system or apollo tm instrument and a recurring revenue stream from the sale of consumables ie the smartchip panels or prepxtm reagents similar to the “razor and razor blade” business model  wafergen inc was incorporated in delaware on october   on may   wafergen inc was acquired by wafergen biosystems inc a nevada
