remained what to do with our newly acquired capital serendipitously i had just begun working for a privately held wall street firm kidder peabody  co incorporated over the course of the next ten years through a process of trial and error my father and i worked out a method a philosophy a way of investing that frankly worked very well we were reinforced in our endeavor by a strong equity investment culture at kidder peabody some of the legends of th century investing had passed through kidder including bill ruane and julian robertson along the way a cohort of clients assembled to invest alongside the lewis clan fastforward the movie ten years and our evolving method of investing was working so well that i was no longer interested in trading bonds for institutional investors and wealthy individuals the primary way i’d made my living since starting at kidder i yearned to focus on the implementation and improvement of our evolving investment philosophy this was the inception of weybosset research and management llc but first i spent five years with compton capital management an investment manager in providence ri at compton i met jeannine bizier who oversaw and still oversees our administrative affairs in  jeannine convinced me to open our own firm and in august of that year weybosset research and management llc opened its doors tom lamb joined in  after nine

leave it blank fields marked with a  are required sign up for our newsletter  our philosophy longrange investing –fla lewis iii principal individuals and institutions increasingly are turning to specialists to handle their investments the trend makes sense inasmuch as these same individuals would normally not attempt to remove their own gall bladders or fly without a pilot’s license but those considering hiring someone to manage their investments or investments for which they are responsible are well advised to know as much as they can about the way the prospective manager goes about investing client money sometimes an existing investor will want to know more about how his or her investment manager has delivered the returns the client has already earned this little essay is designed to answer both inquiries briefly and in layman’s terms it reflects an approach to investing that has served longtime clients my family and me personally well for more than  years in some respects it is too brief—certain important considerations are skipped over or generalized into meaninglessness nevertheless it is hoped that the following pages will give the interested reader a reasonable overview of the way we at weybosset research  management llc practice the art of investing since most of our efforts are devoted to activities in the stock market let me begin with a
