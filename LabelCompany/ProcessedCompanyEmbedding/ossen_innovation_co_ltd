selling below its net current asset value which is a proxy for liquidating value osn is selling for less than the debt it can completely service osn has negligible long term debt ossen innovation company limited nasdaqosn currently has  million of current assets on its balance sheets if you deduct from this number all current and long term liabilities of  million you will be left with a value of million which is substantially more than the current market capitalization of approximately  million this net current asset value of  million which is current assets  current liabilities  non current liabilities is a proxy for liquidating value of the company this means that  million can be generated by liquidating the company if we assume that non current assets of  million are worth nothing the fact that the company is selling below its liquidation value is fundamentally illogical it is also selling for less than its debt capacity average operating earnings of the company over the last five year period has been  suppose company wanted to issue debt on the basis of its operating earnings let us say that an interest coverage ratio of  would make it a safe bet the company can service interest of   from its operating earnings assuming that the cost of debt capital is  on after tax basis  million of debt   can be comfortably serviced by the company from its operating earnings logically a company cannot be worth less than the debt it can comfortably service osn can for example raise  million debt and give a special dividend of  million the natural question that follows from the above facts is why is the company selling so cheap the answer lies in an unsatisfactory trend of earnings and earnings per share which has declined from  to  over the last five year period the companys cash flow from operating has been negative for two years in the past five year period the primary question that has to be answered is can osn be counted to remain a going concern for foreseeable future during which three things can happen  a turnaround in companys trends of earnings  an acquisition by another major player and  a possible liquidation of the company a rather remote possibility it is also preferable to invest in a product company rather than a service company when investing in netnets which is what stocks quoting below net current asset values are called as many more things are likely to go wrong with a service offering rather than a product ossen innovation co ltd manufactures  sells an array of plain surface prestressed steel materials  rare earth coated  zinc coated prestressed steel materials its materials are used in construction of bridges highways  other infrastructure projects the company is only one of the four companies in china capable of producing coated prestressed steel products the company also has a cost advantage due to access to low cost river transport top  customers account for  of the revenue similarly purchases from five largest suppliers amounted to   and  of raw material purchases in the years ended december   and  respectively the companys principal raw material is high carbon steel wire rods whose prices are cyclical the company may not be able to pass the price increase to its customers because large customers will have large bargaining power the chairman of the company dr tang owns  of the outstanding shares which may limit the possibility of value getting unlocked by acquisitions and activist investors the company is trading at a forward price to earnings ratio of  and price to sales ratio of  the deep discount from liquidating value and debt capacity makes osn an undervalued stock while the concentration of suppliers and customers makes company somewhat risky it is likely to remain important in its industry for some time one should be prepared to hold the stock for a period of  to  years in his or her portfolio which should be adequately diversified a basket of similar value stocks would
