original product was made at the casa de fritos now rancho del zocalo at disneyland in anaheim california during the early s using surplus tortillas and taking the original idea from the traditional mexican snack known as totopo the companyowned restaurant cut them up and fried them and added basic seasoning resembling the mexican chilaquiles but in this case being dry arch west was the vice president of marketing of fritolay at the time and noticed their popularity he made a deal in  with alex foods the provider of many items for casa de fritos at disneyland and produced the chips for a short time regionally before it was overwhelmed by the volume and fritolay moved the production inhouse to its tulsa plant doritos were released nationwide in  the first tortilla chip to be launched nationally in the united states the name derives from the mexican spanish doradito meaning golden brown according to information resources international in  doritos earned  billion in retail sales onethird of the total fritolay sales for the year nevertheless in the costliest redesign in fritolay history in  the company spent  million to redesign doritos to make the chips  larger  thinner and rounded the edges of the chip roger j berdusco the vice president of tortilla chip marketing said a primary reason for the change was greater competition from restaurantstyle tortilla chips that are larger and more strongly seasoned the design change was the result of a twoyear market research study that involved  chip eaters the new design gave each chip rounded corners making it easier to eat and reducing the scrap resulting from broken corners each chip was also given more seasoning resulting in a stronger flavor the redesigned chips were released in four flavors beginning in january  the previous doritos logo can still be seen on the popular nacho cheese flavor frito kid at casa de fritos in the united states fritolay eliminated trans fat from all doritos varieties in  the same year the doritos brand began complying with us food and drug administration labeling regulations four years before the regulations became mandatory the company was sued in  by charles grady who claimed that his throat had been damaged because of eating doritos according to him the shape and rigidity of the chips made them inherently dangerous grady attempted to admit into evidence a study by a former chemistry professor that calculated how best to safely swallow the chips the pennsylvania supreme court later ruled that the study did not meet scientific standards and could not be presented as evidence in  doritos sales in the united states fell by  to  million to increase sales in  the company launched several new flavors a new label and more bilingual advertising fritolay vice

mexican snack known as totopo the companyowned restaurant cut them up and fried them and added basic seasoning resembling the mexican chilaquiles but in this case being dry arch west was the vice president of marketing of fritolay at the time and noticed their popularity he made a deal in  with alex foods the provider of many items for casa de fritos at disneyland and produced the chips for a short time regionally before it was overwhelmed by the volume and fritolay moved the production inhouse to its tulsa plant doritos were released nationwide in  the first tortilla chip to be launched nationally in the united states the name derives from the mexican spanish doradito meaning golden brown according to information resources international in  doritos earned  billion in retail sales onethird of the total fritolay sales for the year nevertheless in the costliest redesign in fritolay history in  the company spent  million to redesign doritos to make the chips  larger  thinner and rounded the edges of the chip roger j berdusco the vice president of tortilla chip marketing said a primary reason for the change was greater competition from restaurantstyle tortilla chips that are larger and more strongly seasoned the design change was the result of a twoyear market research study that involved  chip eaters the new design gave each chip rounded corners making it easier to eat and reducing the scrap resulting from broken corners each chip was also given more seasoning resulting in a stronger flavor the redesigned chips were released in four flavors beginning in january  the previous doritos logo can still be seen on the popular nacho cheese flavor frito kid at casa de fritos in the united states fritolay eliminated trans fat from all doritos varieties in  the same year the doritos brand began complying with us food and drug administration labeling regulations four years before the regulations became mandatory the company was sued in  by charles grady who claimed that his throat had been damaged because of eating doritos according to him the shape and rigidity of the chips made them inherently dangerous grady attempted to admit into evidence a study by a former chemistry professor that calculated how best to safely swallow the chips the pennsylvania supreme court later ruled that the study did not meet scientific standards and could not be presented as evidence in  doritos sales in the united states fell by  to  million to increase sales in  the company launched several new flavors a new label and more bilingual advertising fritolay vice

president of marketing of fritolay at the time and noticed their popularity he made a deal in  with alex foods the provider of many items for casa de fritos at disneyland and produced the chips for a short time regionally before it was overwhelmed by the volume and fritolay moved the production inhouse to its tulsa plant doritos were released nationwide in  the first tortilla chip to be launched nationally in the united states the name derives from the mexican spanish doradito meaning golden brown according to information resources international in  doritos earned  billion in retail sales onethird of the total fritolay sales for the year nevertheless in the costliest redesign in fritolay history in  the company spent  million to redesign doritos to make the chips  larger  thinner and rounded the edges of the chip roger j berdusco the vice president of tortilla chip marketing said a primary reason for the change was greater competition from restaurantstyle tortilla chips that are larger and more strongly seasoned the design change was the result of a twoyear market research study that involved  chip eaters the new design gave each chip rounded corners making it easier to eat and reducing the scrap resulting from broken corners each chip was also given more seasoning resulting in a stronger flavor the redesigned chips were released in four flavors beginning in january  the
