opportunity  antipodes partners antipodes partners apply online login your opportunity the market as an extrapolation engine is selectively irrational around changes in the operating environment – the type of change helps define the investment opportunity business cycle structural change sociomacroeconomic   business cycle opportunitystructural change opportunitysociomacroeconomic opportunity a business cycle opportunity relates to mean reversion in profitability and valuations and relies upon the identification of a catalyst or turning point  whilst “mean reversion” may occur in many turnaround situations the risk of substitution and obsolescence can also lead to “mean reallocation” eg mainframe computing redistributed by the pc revolution newspaper classifieds by internet verticals and paid search  broadcast and cable television by ondemand streaming etc for business cycle opportunities we apply the following investment framework determine whether the downturn is cyclical or structural – avoid value traps analyse historical patterns identify catalyst and timing of expected upturn protect downside by maintaining preference for industry leaders scalecost position balance sheet management buy stocks in area a and avoid those in b for an example of a business cycle opportunity see our investment case summary for nippon electric glass a structural change opportunity relates to nonlinear disruptive or compounding change in situations where most investors expect incremental or cyclical change dominant companies or “incumbents” can unwittingly open the door to “disruptive innovations” by over investing in sustaining innovation and creating price umbrellas  the value opportunity occurs in symmetrical form  early identification of a real disruptor  identification of an incumbent incorrectly assessed as a victim of disruption for structural change opportunities we apply the following investment framework apply sustaining versus disruptive innovation principles consider power laws nonlinear change and fattails for a disruptor establish inflexion point for mainstream adoption ahead of the consensus for an incumbent look beyond the time

for the other  billion debt and wealth imbalances are extreme central banks’ politicised and large corporations have never been more powerful the attitudes institutions and structures that lead to a more resilient society eg rule of law social cohesion specific biases etc for sociomacroeconomic opportunities we apply the following investment framework consider sociomacroeconomic factors when evaluating an individual company’s prospects eg relative attractiveness of exporters versus domestic exposures health of the institutional environment etc manage the currency risk that arises from

advantage of the market’s tendency for irrational extrapolation around change identify great businesses that are not valued as such and build high conviction portfolios  holdings with a capital preservation focus we aspire to grow client wealth over the longterm by generating absolute returns in excess of the benchmark at below market levels of risk  attitude to risk we define risk as the chance of permanent loss of capital or unforseen volatility and in this sense we believe risk is best controlled by seeking resilient investments with a margin of safety and multiple ways of winning a deep understanding of portfolio holdings within the context of diversified sources of alpha  attitude to returns equity investment returns are primarily driven by the economic performance of the business you own or business “resilience” price paid or starting valuation business “resilience” is determined by the degree and sustainability of competitive advantage and is ultimately subject to ongoing tests as excess returns will attract change in the operating environment including new competition technological disruption greater regulation and management missteps accordingly in the longterm all businesses succumb to changes in the operating environment as described by the antipodes capital lifecycle model   engagement on environmental social and governance issues we take a common sense case by case approach to implementing esg principles as part of our investment approach and where necessary will seek to engage with companies to the benefit of our investors  process in action our process can be broken down into four iterative steps as follows identifytestanalyseconstruct our approach to idea generation can be best described as eclectic that is idiosyncratic curiosity combined with many years of experience as part of this process “force multipliers” play an important role in focusing team resources and these take two basic forms proprietary quantitative filters qualitative inputsignals any investment team regardless of its size represents a scarce resource relative to the opportunity set and should be managed as such once an opportunity has been identified we perform an initial reality check before committing a large amount of research resource this check will focus on three key areas margin of safety that is the merit of the idea relative to the degree to which this may already be expressed in the valuation multiple ways of winning that is the investment outcome should not depend on just one single factor or point of failure rather multiple factors that will contribute to expected outcome context within existing portfolio given our desire for noncorrelated sources of alpha our broad approach is fundamental research within a global context we strive to filter shortterm noise with the goal of improving our longerterm judgement further team alignment results in a naturally collaborative culture to maximise the benefits of peer review without diluting overall team focus we employ a system where each major research project has a lead analyst but is supported by a secondary analyst buddy who acts as a sounding board on the project we believe this both strengthens the research process and allows for earlier identification of flaws in the investment case if an idea passes the initial reality check the research process will move forward and ultimately deliver a research note covering seven key areas of study our goal is to build resilient portfolios that maximise riskadjusted returns based on the following principles diversified sources of alpha and weighted according to riskreturn profile high conviction that is beyond  key ideas the benefits of diversification tend to be offset by conviction drift where permitted use shorts and currency positions to offset unwanted risks and protect from tail risk reduction in the level of unknown portfolio risk by calculating various factor exposures and
