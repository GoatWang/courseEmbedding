march   a brief look ahead to several upcoming milestones in the next  months bob will cover our financials and then well open the call for qa looking back over the last  months we had a solid fiscal year ending march   several highlights our cash position was  million up  million from the same period last year product revenue for the year was up  compared to the last year in october  we sold latin american assets for  million in cash and a guaranteed minimum royalty of  million over the next  years we received three new fda approvals or clearances were awfully proud of our rd team theyre on a roll we recently launched our new sebuderm product for the treatment of seborrheic dermatitis and our intellectual property portfolio now totals  issued patents and  patent applications pending specific to our dermatology business prescriptions filled at the pharmacy counter were up  versus last year our dermatology net revenue was up  for the year and we launched four new products and now have eight products in our sales bag speaking of our sales force three years ago we were a good rd focused company and yet we out licensed everything to partners for their sales teams to sell our great products its become a great point of pride that as of march  we had  sales reps two district managers and three senior leaders all facing our customers one interesting data point with respect our sales team we do not hire rookies our sales team averages  years experience specifically to dermatology weve deep relationship with our customer dermatologists and hope to continue this hiring trend as we grow so all in all we had a solid year ending march   and we think were just getting started switching gears our next  months should continue to show strong growth bob and id like to highlight several upcoming milestones one of our bright wall street gurus who covered dermatology for yearsandyears said something interesting to us recently he said its all about prescriptionsprescriptionsprescriptions as prescriptions grow your stock price will rise have a bad prescription month and your stock price will fall bob and i think hes right monthly prescription data available via bloomberg is a great metric to measure our performance going forward were expecting up to seven dermatology approvals in brazil this upcoming fiscal year as youll no doubt remember brazil has become the worlds third biggest market where beauty products after the us and japan and in plastic surgery and dermatology procedures brazils now the worlds second biggest market after the us were planning a late summer early fall launch for our recently fda approved loyon product for skin descaling which is a fancy way to say removing scales and plaque on various dermatosis you may remember we inlicensed loyon from a german company then our own regulatory team took their german clinical and recently received an fda approval in march stay tune for more news on this interesting product speaking of new products and fda approvals our innovation plan should really start bearing fruit this year our new chief strategy in marketing officer marc umscheid the exclorox guy has really pulled together a great innovation plan with the team in the next  months we should have a great and we think perhaps even our best line up of new fda approved derm and skin care products for competitive reasons we wont go into much detail now but suffice to say we should have a very busy fda schedule in the next  months in addition our profit center businesses which we defined as our international division animal health and acute care are all breakeven now and trailing off cash so we can grow us derm faster we expect continued wins from our profit center businesses building on some recent good news with manna pro petsmart and our recent hospital formulary gpo health trust group and finally with our growing sales force new products from our own rd and from our licensing efforts we march toward ebitda breakeven with as bob likes to point out more than sufficient cash to get us to ebitda breakeven so i spent a few minutes looking back at our fiscal year ending march   a few minutes looking ahead for the next  months and bob if you will well cover our financials bob miller thank you jim ill first discuss the financial results of our fourth quarter and fiscal year ended march   secondly a review of the financial results of our derm strategy and finally talk about our path to ebitda breakeven driven by the  derm sales reps and their five senior managers  of which have been recently hired moving now to a review of our financial results for the fourth quarter and the fiscal year of  and covering only the highlights with details in todays earnings press release total revenue was  million for the quarter ended march   compared to  million in the same period last year total product revenue of  was up  over the same period last year with strong growth in us dermatology animal healthcare markets and in products sold to the new owner of the latin america assets and assets at reduced and previously agreed to prices more specifically during the fourth quarter us product revenue increased  up  to  million mostly related to the increase in the dermatology product revenue and higher sales to the new animal healthcare partner partially offset by flat acute care sales total international product revenue was up  or  with increases in mexico and asia partially offset by decreases in europe and the middle east revenue from product sold to invekra is temporary as we mentioned before until invekra sets up their own manufacturing facility we expect that revenue related to invekra will be about  to  per quarter until they assume their own manufacturing and we estimate that it will take about six to  months until invekra manufacturers at their facility the gross margins have been significantly impacted by the historical separation of the discontinued operations and the very low margins of the mexico sales to invekra at a reduced price operating expenses minus noncash expenses for the march quarter were  million up  or  compared to the same period last year the increase in cash operating expenses was due to the higher sales marketing and administrate of expenses in the united states related mostly to the increased number of our direct dermatology sales force on the balance sheet and jim mentioned this earlier our cash position at the end of march was  million compared to  million last year with minimal debt would have been our financial results of our dermatology efforts starting in october  through the fourth quarter ending march   as a preface to discussing these dermatology results starting from zero direct sales in late  we have built a strong dermatology foundation over the past two plus years upon which we continue to grow on the future there are several ways to measure our success in derm market one is through the sales of our products to our wholesale distributors which are recognized as revenue when shipped to them this is a common way of recognizing revenues our total us product revenue was  for the march quarter in   million in the march quarter of  and  million in march quarter  up  over the same quarter of last year more specifically our us dermatology net product revenue was  million for the quarter ending march   compared to  in the same period last year an increase of  or  while we recognize our derm revenue when we ship to our wholesalers a second method to objectively gauge the sonoma dermatology performance is the number of prescriptions filled for patients via the pharmacies multiplied times the price paid to us by the wholesalers this is traditionally called demand dollars this information is available to the public for a fee via several wellknown databases and its also widely shown via bloomberg it is shown on a weekly basis or monthly basis for all of our products and if you have an interest in following sonoma more closely as an investor we recommend that this is relevant information to follow according to the symphony monthly data the total prescriptions filled by patients via the pharmacy times the price paid to the wholesalers for all of our derm products was  million for the march quarter  quarter up  million or  from  million for the same period last year the average quarteroverquarter growth for the last four quarters for demand dollars was  the growth in demand dollars for the march quarter over the december quarter was  the number of prescriptions filed for the december and march quarters were both in the  unit range flat with the september quarter this seasonality occurred last year slightly modified for product launch last year in the march quarter the december and march quarters has historically grown at slower quarteroverquarter growth than the other quarters due to seasonality the high number of holidays and derm conferences in the december and march quarters and with the start of the year in january most managed tier programs with initial deductible stand to cause a delay in filling up prescriptions and cause higher rebates most specifically related to the march quarter after this seasonality in december and march last year we have recovered nicely with strong quarteroverquarter growth from perception sales in the june and september quarters regardless of these seasonality factors our prescriptions filled and demand dollars have grown dramatically since we started selling products with our direct sales force from zero to over  prescriptions across at quarter and from zero to over    million in demand hours for the march  quarter there have been three primary factors which have generated the strong growth first in order of importance has been the quality effectiveness leadership and the number of our direct sales force we started with  sales people in late  and added  more in october  to april  time frame most our  sales reps had quick sales ramps in the first  to  months reaching breakeven and the positive returns in their respected territories after that the sales tend to grow at a more normal pace the second factor for the high growth has been the launch and growth of eight products and product line extensions which jim mentioned earlier the last and the third reason has been our price increases since we have relatively large product sizes our price per gram of product is currently well below that of our competitive products for example tobitcore ph a solid branded mid potencies topical steroid sells for about  a gram a comparable generic sale for  per gram and our alevicyn gel sells for a  per gram what is our plan to achieve commercial ebitda breakeven our current primary financial objective our plan to achieve ebitda or breakeven includes the same three factors which i just mentioned and is very simple in concept including hiring of experienced and effective dermatology sales reps to achieve breakeven two launch and grow new and current products and three increase prices based on a pricing strategy of periodic planned and smaller changes but remaining below the price per gram of our competitive products i will discuss each of these factors in greater detail number one and the most important is to hire additional experienced and effective sales reps how many should be hire how soon and how much do they need to sell on average we think the number of sales reps we need to achieve ebitda breakeven is a total of  to the  reps since september   we had  sales reps we have already added and trained  reps mostly in the latter half of recent march quarter a  increase in the sales force those will be hired if needed in the next  to  months we think that an aggressive hiring program like this one is the quickest path to ebitdas breakeven aggression to achieve breakeven with  sales reps sales reps need to sell a  prescriptions per quarter on average or in total sell  prescriptions per quarter the on average is key since there are fairly wide variations in the size and potential between different territories as a result our territories have different targets at  prescriptions filled the sales reps contribute enough income to cover the derm and corporate overhead the second key factor in achieving breakeven is the launch and growth of new and current products we will be launching as jim mentioned earlier a unique volume ph of product effective in reducing the scaling on dermatologist in the fall of  and several line extensions for ceramax in the december and march quarters we have a robust current portfolio of eight products and line extensions for treatment of atopic and seborrheic dermatitis scar management surgical procedures and oral and infective for severe acne and indiscernible skin barrier and repair products the sales force is now divided into two general categories the first group is  sales reps which have been with sonoma for  to  years have demonstrated a quick six to nine months sales ramp to achieve positive returns in their territory the quickest was three months generally after that as i mentioned earlier after that quick surge the growth will be at a more normal pace in the september  quarters these  sales reps sold on average  prescriptions for that quarter not too far from the thousand unit breakeven target level the second group of reps are those who have been recently hired and trained mostly in the lateral half of march  quarter similar to the year reps while starting at zero the newbies do work but experienced reps should also demonstrate a quick six to nine months strong sales reps which means that we should exhibit strong overall prescription quarteroverquarter growth in the september june and december quarters probably in that order the december quarter as i mentioned earlier will be damp and by the seasonality impact which by this seasonality impact like other sales groups after the six to nine months spurt the growth will continue and its more normal rate to verify some of these comments the prescriptions filled for those of you who not been looking at them for the last eight weeks shown on bloomberg have demonstrated a nice upward trend a key metric to watch as we drive to ebitda breakeven as a ratio of average prescriptions filled for sales rep per quarter in the first nine months with  sales people that ratio grew from zero to  prescriptions filled per quarter per sales rep than as we added seven new sales people this ratio dipped down to  and then bounced back to  as i mentioned in the september quarter as new sales reps at that time exhibit their strong six to nine months sales ramp with the addition of  new sales people mostly in march quarter  the average dips down again in march and probably the june quarter but we are assume increasing as the new reps progress up their strong six to nine months sales ramp during this time our overall prescriptions filled as i mentioned should grow quickly as mentioned earlier our breakeven level occurs when our reps achieve the average  prescriptions per rep per quarter assuming  sales reps thats the possible time of achieving the ebitda breakeven let me make it clear that we are not indicating breakeven in this specific quarter in the future while we are saying is one our prescriptions for the march quarter were about  and have been growing at an average quarteroverquarter growth rate for the fourth quarters at  and two if and i want to emphasize if our prescriptions filled grow at a quarteroverquarter growth rate average of  to  starting from a march quarter than we should achieve the breakeven in the range of june to december  timeframe let me now make some general comments about the plan to achieve either breakeven we believe and we mentioned this before this quick expansion is the fastest way to achieve fab breakeven and we expect to use about  million of our  million of nondiluted cash to achieve this breakeven therefore we do not expect to completing dilutive funding in the near future except those owners of the trading warrants who choose to exercise their positions in the stock as the stock price goes up the gross margins will improve as we increase the us dermatology revenue which has  to  gross margins and at the breakeven level we should have a blended gross margin in the range of below  level looking at the big picture in order for us to achieve ebitda breakeven we estimate that our total net revenue should be in the  million to  million per quarter range and that the prescriptions filled as weve mentioned a couple of times should be in the  to  range our last general comment on our journey to breakeven is that we will update you on our progress on each quarter earnings call and if needed well adjust our assumptions and the impacts of those changes as mentioned on previous calls we continue to believe that sonoma remains a strong investment candidate for the valued investor even with the recent increase in the stock price who is looking for a strong growth in revenue and a strong cash position with respect to valuation i would like to end with three points one our cash position at  million is a high percentage of our market cap of about  million i think today and number two our product revenue growth was growth at  from the last  months ending march compared to the same period last year in the future investors should expect to see continued strong revenue  dermatology revenue growth as the additional  new sales rep follow an already demonstrated sales ramp and three we have laid out a clear plan to breakeven as we get closer to the breakeven point our market cap and stock price should in theory increase also at the time of breakeven our net revenues should be in the annualized  million to  million range and derm companies tend to tout a revenue multiple three to five times thus a potential investor can benefit not only from the strong derm product growth and reaching breakeven but also from the potential expansion of the multiple without having to worry about stock dilution with that ill turn it over to the operator for qa questionandanswer session operator thank you operator instructions and our first question is from the line of laura engel with stonegate capital your line is now open laura engel so i wanted to as just  obviously a lot of information and a lot of exciting things going on with the products in the pipeline it looks the launch at the loyon  is that how you say it loyon skin descaler thats the next kind of big thing could you tell us  ive been looking and ive read through the release its  just a little bit more about the market opportunity and kind of what some of the other current options are which i couldnt find any as far as whats out there to be replaced jim schutz so your pronunciation is dead bang right loyon its a skin descaler for various dermatoses if you can picture a product that descales the egg shell like psoriasis covering to that ugly disease or the itchy scaly skin associated with dermatoses there is not a great product selection for dermatologist currently in the united states which is why we are excited by this product at the risk of reputation we inlicensed with from a german pharma company we got it through the fda using their clinicals and our sales team is really excited by sell of the product laura engel okay great and then as far as  it looks like  so that will be fall do you think its possibly could see one more this calendar year and then can you summarize again you said what the expectation was for going forward the metric as far as other additional launches jim schutz yes so we did see fall  late summer early fall for loyon i think i shared with you lauren not to be coy but weve got to really active fda schedule coming with some really interesting products and approvals so im not going to be more detailed on that timeline but the answer indiscernible to the question are we anticipating any additional color multiple speakers now in december bob miller well i think the ceramax  looking at the very end of our fiscal year there should be some ceramax line extensions that should come pretty close to near the end of the fiscal year jim schutz fiscal not calendar operator operator instructions and our next question is from the line of sherry grisewood with dawson james securities your line is open sherry grisewood actually two short questions congratulations on a great quarter i wanted to understand whether that  of revenue to invekra is more of a onetime thing or is that going to be a quarterly supply number whats the repeatability of that revenue bob miller first of all good question first of all the total  is a little bit higher than what would be considering normal which can certainly  we would concern the normal range between  and  and that is price paid to us at a very reduced price to that the now owner invekra of the latin america assets for manufacturing the product once they start their own  and they are in the process to setting up their own manufacturing but we think its going to take from six to  months to do that at this point so we would expect that  to  a quarter would exist as long as we are manufacturing so it would be the six to  months does that answer your question sherry grisewood but the  was a bit of an outlier bob miller yes it was an outlier exactly there were some prices that we are agreed to ahead of time prior to the deal that were at a little bit higher price and theyve all been flushed through the system at this point sherry grisewood my second question sort of on launch and follow up a little bit on the person ahead me question and that is at this point considering the range of products that you are developing for the prescription derm market what is the profile or what will be the profile products that you might be looking to either inlicense or acquire or launch next year and is there a change in the mix of that profile of products compared to which you have now jim schutz good question that seemed like that had multiple parts sherry so why don’t we break it so the ideal target product we are not looking to jump into phase  clinical we like something thats much closer to commercial our sales team has a  especially the lead guy has a really good nose for new products he takes many of our ideas to key opinion leader doctors all around the country and vets them terrific feedback what else can i say on the target products we have our great line currently of topical we have one systemic that may give you a hint of where we would like to go in the future and then the second half of that question bob why wont you  she was talking about the mix bob miller i talked to  we  one of our strategies from day  has been to diversify into different technologies other than just the microsin ph technology weve done a pretty good job of that we think with our severe acne mondoxyne product and our ceramax product and now we are adding the loyon product so whats really interesting is when we have a national salesforce that we have now we get an awful lot of people coming and knocking on a door and asking us if we have an interest in the products  in their products which they sell which gives us a lot of leverage and looking at new products and potentially adding new products to our line and so that’s a really positive in terms of our microsin products we think there is some opportunities there just because a lot of the  there is a lot of recognition now coming around that a lot like atopic dermatitis is connected to stuporous and so that’s a really interesting opportunity for us or the microsin technology products operator thank you and our next question comes from the line of  from andy summers with janus your line is now open andy summers couple of questions so first what can you say about how well this product loyon has performed in the markets where its currently sold today like for example how big is it in a country like germany jim schutz yes at the risk of replication we inlicensed from a german pharma company its only available in germany well be the first to introduce it in the us to give you a comparable they have a very big sales force and they sell by their estimation about  million per year in the european market for a similar product now mind you andy they have a broader indication than we do here in the stage we are happy with the first step of the indication but wed eventually like to go back to the fda and broaden ours also so its a good interesting product that sells well there our indication is a little bit more narrow here in the states and we would like to broaden with the fda andy summers okay what are you missing in your label versus what they have in their label jim schutz they have a full brown psoriasis  descaling of psoriasis we very much like to get that in the states andy summers what do you have to do to get that jim schutz go back to the fda  we havent given the timeline to go back to the fda on it other than to say that weve got great clinical coming from this german pharma company since they got through the european equivalent of the fda and they built up a nice data packet of clinicals so were parsing through those clinicals to figure out how to get back in front of the fda with new data andy summers i see okay okay and then you mentioned earlier  bob miller it was fdas k kind of application at this point so it wouldn’t take forever and now we also has a credited device too which has our own product for atrophic dermatologist andy summers okay great and then you mentioned earlier that you expect to have seven products approvals on brazil in fiscal year  can you just give us some color around your gotomarket strategy in brazil are you planning to do the loan or do you need a partner or just how exactly do you expect that to play out jim schutz were definitely going to partner brazil we have zero intentions of building sales force in brazil ourselves we really do have a laser focus on building us derm and keeping that beholding gotomarket strategy is through a partner the claims are interesting the portfolio is interesting and were fishing and chopping out andy summers so you would expect to start a partnership before these approvals start to commend jim schutz probably after  and this is based upon my experience if i were in their shoes why not wait to see what the final labels and indications are before you signed anything andy summers okay and youll just  youll partner all seven of these at the same company or youll buy multiple partners and how will that work jim schutz yes stay tuned weve had strong interest on handful of them so we may do exactly that but will keep you posted andy summers okay great and then the last question from me youve sort of hinted at your pipeline throughout this call but just to be very specific do you guys have any nces in your pipeline or is everything to sort of reformulations jim schutz its a good question so nce is a new chemical entity we have just read a really interesting document from one of our regulatory focus on nce opportunity but to be fair andy nces and ndas are expensive and time consuming and we do have interesting opportunities in our pipeline but wed rather get to breakeven first and bob you are really strong from that point will you hammer that point because i think you do it well bob miller yes well we think its something that we will like to look at the lower cost in orphan drug type of alternative but we want to get the breakeven first and thats a key for us at this point in time we may do small types of things it would lead to the orphan drug kind of alternatives the other thing that in terms of the question you just ask about the potential partnerships we don’t really include any potential partnerships in our path to breakeven and to the extent if we have a partnership like in brazil for the derm area that would actually improve our ability to get to breakeven sooner andy summers with some upfront cash payments or do you not expect any upfront bob miller while we may get some upfronts but looking more at the breakeven more of the continuous flow of revenue and cash that would  that they would generate jim schutz and bob is a really big fan of profit sharing mechanisms so even if we had to give up on some of upfront cash that we would make more in long run and i tend to agree with him andy summers okay if i could just squeeze in one last one so for most companies ebitda breakeven does not equal cash flow breakeven but i think in your case correct me if i’m wrong because you’re not going to be a taxpayer for so long and you don’t have debt that requires interest payments your ebitda and cash flow breakeven timeline should be roughly the same is that a fair statement bob miller close and because we don’t have a really big working capital requirement or capex requirement it’s pretty close probably lag about a quarter andy summers okay perfect bob miller so that’s but not very far the lag isn’t very much andy summers okay great i’ll get back in queue thank you operator thank you and our next question is from the line of jason kolbert with maxim your line is now open gabrielle zhou hi guys it’s gabrielle zhou for jason congratulations on a solid quarter i just have a question on the derm prescrips ph can you discuss more in detail the increased in derm prescrips in the quarter and the year and how many prescrips are there per quarter and what’s the rate of growth thank you jim schutz so our rate of growth in prescriptions for the last four quarters and that’s ending in march was about  quarteroverquarter on average for the last four quarters it’s been because of the seasonality that i mentioned before it’s been  it’s actually declined just because it’s been more flat for the last two quarters anyway prior than that was something like was up in the   level prior to that we think that thats just because of the hiring of an increase in our sales people by  our sales reps and we also know there is a pretty expected six to nine month fairly quick ramp for those  sales people that we think there should be  the growth should be higher than  quarteroverquarter going over the next two to three quarters does that answer your question gabrielle zhou yes i appreciate the insight operator thank you and our next question is from the line of bob robbins with robbins capital management your line is now open bob robbins my question has to do with europe and the rest of the world you break down in the quarter when we released toward the end shows that it’s about  as big as the united states in revenues and it’s growing on a threemonth basis about a little less than have the us rate we know you are emphasizing in us but it’s only growing  in the  months full year revenues versus  growth in the us tell us more about what the strategy really is there and at what point would europe and the rest of the world perhaps be growing a lot faster and which countries might need that jim schutz great question bob one and i put split it i’ll take europe you take rest of the world bob miller okay jim schutz on europe as you know bob primarily our european revenue is from acute care sales it’s a solid business for us we have terrific partners there but we’re just getting started in the dermatology business fair warning european dermatology pricing is not as robust as us dermatology pricing but we remain really enthusiastic about moving into that space because it affords us higher product margin opportunities in european derm why don’t you answer row bob miller okay i think our row we see a lot of potential but as a small company our strategy in the big picture with the international business is that its a business unit that should be generating cash and it does even after weve sold mexico or latin america for  billion so in taking that out it still is pretty close to breakeven in generating cash at this point there we tried to use partners almost all of our international activities are through partners were not going to change that because what that enables us to do is generate cash we dont have to spend all the money on sales and marketing like our partners would do and thats  were going to continue that model so we think that longer term that technical difficulty pointed out there is higher growth in the us we actually have higher gross margins but at the same time we have really good operating profit margins in the rest of the world and in europe simply because we dont have a high ga component so our purpose in technical difficulty is to really generate cash and we think that thatll grow but just not nearly as quickly at best we think that that ratio would probably be in  to  range   or as we grow more in the later years in the derm business versus the international does that answer your question bob robbins ill be fine for now thank you very much operator operator instructions and im not showing any further questions so i would like to turn the call back to management for any final remarks jim schutz hey thank you all for joining the call and for your continued support we feel that sonoma is in the best shape weve ever been for several reasons one weve effectively executed the turnaround strategy in a very attractive dermatology market with a strong experienced and effective sales team a robust and unique product portfolio and a growing product pipeline as bob has said repeatedly our next step is driving to commercial breakeven which should increase our shareholder value two our current cash position at  million enables us to step on the gas in our growing derm business without dilution to shareholders and while using only part of our cash three our commercial ebitdas breakeven plan which is simple includes one hiring new sales rep which we now have  two the launching of new products and continued growth of existing products three gentle price increases consistent with comparable products we believe we have the foundation and all the building blocks to achieve breakeven without further dilution to shareholders so we look forward to sharing our progress as we build to becoming a pure play multi technology dermatology company and achieving our purpose of relentless passion for healing we hope you can turn in in august for our earnings call for the quarter ending june   operator thanks very much operator youre welcome and ladies and gentlemen this concludes our program for
