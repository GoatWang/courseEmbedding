is intended to help you compare the cost of investing in the fund with the cost of investing in other funds this example does not take into account customary brokerage commissions that you pay when purchasing or selling shares of the fund in the secondary market the example assumes that you invest  in the fund for the time periods indicated the example also assumes that your investment has a

will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing at least  of its net assets including investment borrowings in a portfolio of equity securities of asian pacific companies including through

pacific country or iii that have at least  of their assets in or derive at least  of their revenues or profits from an asian pacific country asian pacific countries include the countries located in asia and the pacific islands as well as australia and new zealand the fund will generally focus its asian pacific company investments in australia hong kong japan new zealand andor singapore the fund will utilize a dynamic currency hedging strategy through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions to hedge up to  of the funds currency exposure as a result of such dynamic  first trust riverfront dynamic asia pacific etf rfap currency hedging strategy the portion of the funds portfolio securities which are subject to currency hedging transactions may vary widely from  to  of the portfolio securities a forward contract on foreign currency is an obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date which may be any fixed number of days agreed upon by the parties from the date of the contract at a price set on the date of the contract a forward foreign currency exchange contract may reduce the funds exposure to changes in the value of the currency it will deliver and increase its exposure to changes in the value of the currency it will receive for the duration of the contract the effect on the value of the fund is similar to selling securities denominated in one currency and purchasing securities denominated in another currency the fund also may enter into currency spot transactions as part of its dynamic currency hedging strategy a currency spot transaction is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell a specific currency for delivery on a date that is typically two business days from the date of the agreement as opposed to a date set in the future the underlying currencies of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions included in the funds policy relating to the investment of at least  of its net assets including investment borrowings will be limited to asian pacific currencies the fund also may invest up to  of its net assets in equity securities of nonasian pacific companies including companies in emerging market countries with a particular focus on companies in the united states and canada and forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions used to hedge the funds exposure to nonasian pacific currencies as well as any proxy currency hedging transactions involving nonasian pacific currencies determined by the subadvisor to be representative of and serve as a proxy for asian pacific currencies the fund will limit its investments in emerging market countries in the aggregate to no more than  of its net assets the fund considers an emerging market country to be any country whose issuers are included in the morgan stanley capital international emerging markets index andor those countries considered to be developing by the world bank the international finance corporation or the united nations the fund considers an emerging market issuer to be one i domiciled or with a principal place of business or primary securities trading market in an emerging market country or ii that derives a substantial portion of its total revenues or profits from emerging market countries the equity securities of nonasian pacific companies in which the fund may invest include investments in common stock depositary receipts common and preferred shares of reits and business development companies bdcs the securities in which the fund may invest must be listed on a us or nonus securities exchange the fund may invest in small mid and large capitalization companies in selecting the portfolio securities of the fund riverfront investment group llc the funds subadviser rig or the subadvisor assembles a portfolio of eligible securities based on several core attributes including but not limited to value quality and momentum the subadvisor will consider multiple factors within each core attribute such as the pricetobook value of a security when determining value and a companys cash as a percentage of the companys market capitalization when determining quality the subadvisor then assigns each qualifying security a score based on its core attributes and selects the individual securities with the highest scores for investment in doing so the subadvisor utilizes its proprietary optimization process to maximize the percentage of highscoring securities included in the portfolio in accordance with country sector and risk factor eg beta quality volatility limitations the subadvisor will also consider the market capitalization of the companies in which the fund may invest and the trading volume of a companys shares in the secondary market in managing the funds currency exposure the subadvisor will deploy a dynamic currency hedging strategy based on a proprietary hedging methodology that considers a combination of quantitative measures such as interest rate differentials central bank balance sheet expansioncontraction and price momentum and qualitative measures such as formal and informal guidance from central bankers to the extent permitted under applicable law percentage limitations described in this prospectus are generally as of the time of investment by the fund and may be exceeded on a goingforward basis as a result of market fluctuations affecting the funds portfolio securities the fund is classified as nondiversified under the investment company act of  as amended the  act principal risks you could lose money by investing in the fund an investment in the fund is not a deposit of a bank and is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency there can be no assurance that the funds investment objective will be achieved asia pacific risk the fund is more susceptible to the economic market regulatory political natural disasters and local risks of the asia pacific region than a fund that is more geographically diversified the region has historically been highly dependent on global trade with nations taking strong roles in both the importing and exporting of goods such a relationship creates a risk with this dependency on global growth the respective stock markets tend  first trust riverfront dynamic asia pacific etf rfap to have a larger prevalence of smaller companies that are inherently more volatile and less liquid than larger companies varying levels of accounting and disclosure standards restrictions on foreign ownership minority ownership rights and corporate governance standards are also common for the region bdc risk investments in bdcs may be subject to a high degree of risk a bdcs portfolio typically will include a substantial amount of securities purchased in private placements and as a result its portfolio may carry risks similar to those of a private equity or private debt fund securities that are not publicly registered may be difficult to value and may be difficult to sell at a price representative of their intrinsic value in addition investments in bdcs are subject to various other risks including managements ability to meet the bdcs investment objective and to manage the bdcs portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding a bdc or its underlying investments change bdc shares are not redeemable at the option of the bdc shareholder and they may trade in the secondary market at a discount to their net asset value bdcs may also employ the use of leverage in their portfolios through borrowings or the issuance of preferred stock such use of leverage may subject the bdc to increased risks including the likelihood of increased volatility and the possibility that the bdcs common share income may fall if the interest rate on any borrowings rises the fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of any management and other operating expenses and of any performance based or incentive fees charged by the bdcs in which it invests in addition to the expenses paid by the fund cash transactions risk the fund may under certain circumstances effect creations and redemptions in whole or in part for cash rather than inkind because of the nature of the funds underlying investments as a result an investment in the fund may be less tax efficient than it would be through more frequent creations and redemptions inkind counterparty risk the fund bears the risk that the counterparty to the funds forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions may default on its obligations or otherwise fail to honor its obligations if a counterparty defaults on its payment obligations the fund will lose money and the value of an investment in fund shares may decrease in addition the fund may engage in such investment transactions with a limited number of counterparties credit risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend payments when due and the related risk that the value of a security may decline because of concerns about the issuers ability to make such payments currency exchange rate risk the fund will hold investments that are denominated in nonus currencies or in securities that provide exposure to such currencies currency exchange rates or interest rates denominated in such currencies changes in currency exchange rates and the relative value of nonus currencies will affect the value of the funds investments and the value of fund shares changes in currency exchange rates also may affect the value of interest earned and gains and losses realized on the sale of securities currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably as a result the value of an investment in the fund may change quickly and without warning and you may lose money currency risk because the funds net asset value is determined on the basis of us dollars and the fund invests in nonus dollardenominated securities you may lose money if the local currency of a foreign market depreciates against the us dollar even if the local currency value of the funds holdings goes up the fund may hedge certain of its nonus dollar holdings depositary receipts risk depositary receipts may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market any distributions paid to the holders of depositary receipts are usually subject to a fee charged by the depositary holders of depositary receipts may have limited voting rights and investment restrictions in certain countries may adversely impact the value of depositary receipts because such restrictions may limit the ability to convert shares into depositary receipts and vice versa such restrictions may cause shares of the underlying issuer to trade at a discount or premium to the market price of the depositary receipts derivatives risk the use of forward contracts and currency spot transactions can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives in addition to the above risks the fund is deemed to have entered into an isda master agreement the isda master agreement a standard umbrella relationshipframework agreement between two parties under which one or more individual derivatives transactions are entered while most isda master agreements are highly customized and heavily negotiated a deemed isda master agreement has predetermined elections therefore the fund may forego certain protections they would have been afforded had they negotiated the isda master agreements such as terms related to choice of law events of default termination events payments on early termination and calculation agents  first trust riverfront dynamic asia pacific etf rfap dynamic hedging risk because of the funds utilization of the dynamic currency hedging strategy the fund may have lower returns than an equivalent noncurrency hedged investment when the component currencies are rising relative to the us dollar as such contracts to sell foreign currency will generally be expected to limit any potential gain that might be realized by the fund if the value of the hedged currency increases in addition the use of currency hedging will not necessarily eliminate exposure to all currency fluctuations hedging against a decline in the value of a currency does not eliminate fluctuations in the value of a portfolio security traded in that currency or prevent a loss if the value of the security declines moreover it may not be possible for the fund to hedge against a devaluation that is so generally anticipated that the fund is not able to contract to sell the currency at a price above the devaluation level it anticipates emerging markets risk investments in securities and instruments traded in developing or emerging markets or that provide exposure to such securities or markets can involve additional risks relating to political economic or regulatory conditions not associated with investments in us securities and instruments or investments in more developed international markets emerging market governments may without prior warning impose capital controls on the ability to transfer currency securities or other assets the funds ability to access certain developing or emerging markets also may be limited due to a variety of factors including currency convertibility issues such conditions may impact the ability of the fund to buy sell or otherwise transfer securities cause the funds returns to differ from those available to domestic investors adversely affect the trading market and price for fund shares and cause the fund to decline in value equity securities risk because the fund invests in equity securities the value of the funds shares will fluctuate with changes in the value of its equity securities equity securities prices fluctuate for several reasons including changes in investors perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the general condition of the relevant stock market such as market volatility or when political or economic events affecting the issuer occur in addition common stock prices may be particularly sensitive to rising interest rates as the cost of the capital rises and borrowing costs increase forward foreign currency exchange contracts risk forward foreign currency exchange contracts involve certain risks including the risk of failure of the counterparty to perform its obligations under the contract and the risk that the use of forward contracts may not serve as a complete hedge because of an imperfect correlation between movements in the prices of the contracts and the prices of the currencies hedged forward foreign currency exchange contracts may limit any potential gain that might result should the value of the underlying currencies increase in addition because forward currency exchange contracts are privately negotiated transactions there can be no assurance that the fund will have flexibility to rollover a forward currency exchange contract upon its expiration if it desires to do so hedging against a decline in the value of a currency does not eliminate fluctuations in the value of a portfolio security traded in that currency or prevent a loss if the value of the security declines liquidity risk the fund invests in equity securities that may have limited liquidity despite being listed on a securities exchange equity securities that are less liquid or that trade less can be more difficult or more costly to buy or to sell compared to other more liquid or active investments this liquidity risk is a factor of the trading volume of a particular security as well as the size and liquidity of the market for such security the prices at which the equity securities are held in the fund will be adversely affected if trading markets for the equity securities are limited or absent management risk the fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio in managing the funds investment portfolio the subadvisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result there can be no guarantee that the fund will meet its investment objective market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by the fund or shares of the fund in general may fall in value securities are subject to market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic political regulatory or market developments changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices overall securities values could decline generally or could underperform other investments new fund risk the fund currently has fewer assets than larger funds and like other relatively new funds large inflows and outflows may impact the funds market exposure for limited periods of time this impact may be positive or negative depending on the direction of market movement during the period affected also during the initial investup period the fund may depart from its principal investment strategies and invest a larger amount or all of its assets in cash equivalents or it may hold cash nondiversification risk the fund is classified as nondiversified under the  act as a result the fund is only limited as to the percentage of its assets which may be invested in the securities of any one issuer by the diversification requirements imposed by the internal revenue code of  as amended the fund may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers as a result the fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers  first trust riverfront dynamic asia pacific etf rfap nonus securities risk nonus securities are subject to higher volatility than securities of domestic issuers due to possible adverse political social or economic developments restrictions on foreign investment or exchange of securities lack of liquidity currency exchange rates excessive taxation government seizure of assets different legal or accounting standards and less government supervision and regulation of exchanges in foreign countries portfolio turnover risk high portfolio turnover may result in the fund paying higher levels of transaction costs and generating greater tax liabilities for shareholders portfolio turnover risk may cause the funds performance to be less than expected preferred stock risk preferred stocks combine some of the characteristics of both common stocks and bonds preferred stocks are typically subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a companys capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and therefore will be subject to greater credit risk than those debt instruments preferred stocks are also subject to credit risk interest rate risk and income risk reit investment risk in addition to risks related to investments in real estate generally investing in reits involves certain other risks related to their structure and focus which include but are not limited to dependency upon management skills limited diversification the risks of locating and managing financing for projects heavy cash flow dependency possible default by borrowers the costs and potential losses of selfliquidation of one or more holdings the risk of a possible lack of mortgage funds and associated interest rate risks overbuilding property vacancies increases in property taxes and operating expenses changes in zoning laws losses due to environmental damages changes in neighborhood values and appeal to purchases the possibility of failing to maintain exemptions from registration under the  act and in many cases relatively small market capitalization which may result in less market liquidity and greater price volatility reits are also subject to the risk that the real estate market may experience an economic downturn generally which may have a material effect on the real estate in which the reits invest and their underlying portfolio securities smaller companies risk the fund may invest in small and midcapitalization companies such companies may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments and their securities may be less liquid and may experience greater price volatility than larger more established companies as a result of several factors including limited trading volumes products or financial resources management inexperience and less publicly available information accordingly such companies are generally subject to greater market risk than larger more established

principal investment strategies under normal market conditions the fund will seek to achieve its investment objective by investing at least  of its net assets including investment borrowings in a portfolio of equity securities of developed market companies including through investments in common stock depositary receipts and common and preferred shares of real estate investment trusts reits

securities which are subject to currency hedging transactions may vary widely from  to  of the portfolio securities a forward contract on foreign currency is an obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date which may be any fixed number of days agreed upon by the parties from the date of the contract at a price set on the date of the contract a forward foreign currency exchange contract may reduce the funds exposure to changes in the value of the currency it will deliver and increase its exposure to changes in the value of the currency it will receive for the duration of the contract the effect on the value of the fund is similar to selling securities denominated in one currency and purchasing securities denominated in another currency the fund also may enter into currency spot transactions as part of its dynamic currency hedging strategy a currency spot transaction is an agreement between two parties to buy or sell a specific currency for delivery on a date that is typically two business days from the date of the agreement as opposed to a date set in the future the underlying currencies of the forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions included in the funds policy relating to the investment of at least  of its net assets including investment borrowings will be limited to developed market currencies the fund also may invest up to  of its net assets in companies of emerging market countries and forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions used to hedge the funds exposure to nondeveloped market currencies as well as any proxy currency hedging transactions involving nondeveloped market currencies determined by the subadvisor to be representative of and serve as a proxy

insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other governmental agency there can be no assurance that the funds investment objective will be achieved bdc risk investments in bdcs may be subject to a high degree of risk a bdcs portfolio typically will include a substantial amount of securities purchased in private placements and as a result its portfolio may carry risks similar to those of a private equity or private debt fund securities that are not publicly registered may be difficult to value and may be difficult to sell at a price representative of their intrinsic value in addition investments in bdcs are subject to various other risks including managements ability to meet the bdcs investment objective and to manage the bdcs portfolio when the underlying  first trust riverfront dynamic developed international etf rfdi securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding a bdc or its underlying investments change bdc shares are not redeemable at the option of the bdc shareholder and they may trade in the secondary market at a discount to their net asset value bdcs may also employ the use of leverage in their portfolios through borrowings or the issuance of preferred stock such use of leverage may subject the bdc to increased risks including the likelihood of increased volatility and the possibility that the bdcs common share income may fall if the interest rate on any borrowings rises the fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of any management and other operating expenses and of any performance based or incentive fees charged by the bdcs in which it invests in addition to the expenses paid by the fund cash transactions risk the fund may under certain circumstances effect creations and redemptions in whole or in part for cash rather than inkind because of the nature of the funds underlying investments as a result an investment in the fund may be less tax efficient than it would be through more frequent creations and redemptions inkind counterparty risk the fund bears the risk that the counterparty to the funds forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions may default on its obligations or otherwise fail to honor its obligations if a counterparty defaults on its payment obligations the fund will lose money and the value of an investment in fund shares may decrease in addition the fund may engage in such investment transactions with a limited number of counterparties credit risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend payments when due and the related risk that the value of a security may decline because of concerns about the issuers ability to make such payments currency exchange rate risk the fund will hold investments that are denominated in nonus currencies or in securities that provide exposure to such currencies currency exchange rates or interest rates denominated in such currencies changes in currency exchange rates and the relative value of nonus currencies will affect the value of the funds investments and the value of fund shares changes in currency exchange rates also may affect the value of interest earned and gains and losses realized on the sale of securities currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably as a result the value of an investment in the fund may change quickly and without warning and you may lose money currency risk because the funds net asset value is determined on the basis of us dollars and the fund invests in nonus dollardenominated securities you may lose money if the local currency of a foreign market depreciates against the us dollar even if the local currency value of the funds holdings goes up the fund may hedge certain of its nonus dollar holdings depositary receipts risk depositary receipts may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market any distributions paid to the holders of depositary receipts are usually subject to a fee charged by the depositary holders of depositary receipts may have limited voting rights and investment restrictions in certain countries may adversely impact the value of depositary receipts because such restrictions may limit the ability to convert shares into depositary receipts and vice versa such restrictions may cause shares of the underlying issuer to trade at a discount or premium to the market price of the depositary receipts derivatives risk the use of forward contracts and currency spot transactions can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives in addition to the above risks the fund is deemed to have entered into an isda master agreement the isda master agreement a standard umbrella relationshipframework agreement between two parties under which one or more individual derivatives transactions are entered while most isda master agreements are highly customized and heavily negotiated a deemed isda master agreement has predetermined elections therefore the fund may forego certain protections they would have been afforded had they negotiated the isda master agreements such as terms related to choice of law events of default termination events payments on early termination and calculation agents dynamic hedging risk because of the funds utilization of the dynamic currency hedging strategy the fund may have lower returns than an equivalent noncurrency hedged investment when the component currencies are rising relative to the us dollar as such contracts to sell foreign currency will generally be expected to limit any potential gain that might be realized by the fund if the value of the hedged currency increases in addition the use of currency hedging will not necessarily eliminate exposure to all currency fluctuations hedging against a decline in the value of a currency does not eliminate fluctuations in the value of a portfolio security traded in that currency or prevent a loss if the value of the security declines moreover it may not be possible for the fund to hedge against a devaluation that is so generally anticipated that the fund is not able to contract to sell the currency at a price above the devaluation level it anticipates  first trust riverfront dynamic developed international etf rfdi emerging markets risk investments in securities and instruments traded in developing or emerging markets or that provide exposure to such securities or markets can involve additional risks relating to political economic or regulatory conditions not associated with investments in us securities and instruments or investments in more developed international markets emerging market governments may without prior warning impose capital controls on the ability to transfer currency securities or other assets the funds ability to access certain developing or emerging markets also may be limited due to a variety of factors including currency convertibility issues such conditions may impact the ability of the fund to buy sell or otherwise transfer securities cause the funds returns to differ from those available to domestic investors adversely affect the trading market and price for fund shares and cause the fund to decline in value equity securities risk because the fund invests in equity securities the value of the funds shares will fluctuate with changes in the value of its equity securities equity securities prices fluctuate for several reasons including changes in investors perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the general condition of the relevant stock market such as market volatility or when political or economic events affecting the issuer occur in addition common stock prices may be particularly sensitive to rising interest rates as the cost of the capital rises and borrowing costs increase forward foreign currency exchange contracts risk forward foreign currency exchange contracts involve certain risks including the risk of failure of the counterparty to perform its obligations under the contract and the risk that the use of forward contracts may not serve as a complete hedge because of an imperfect correlation between movements in the prices of the contracts and the prices of the currencies hedged forward foreign currency exchange contracts may limit any potential gain that might result should the value of the underlying currencies increase in addition because forward currency exchange contracts are privately negotiated transactions there can be no

obligations the fund will lose money and the value of an investment in fund shares may decrease in addition the fund may engage in such investment transactions with a limited number of counterparties credit risk credit risk is the risk that an issuer of a security will be unable or unwilling to make dividend payments when due and the related risk that the value of a security may decline because of concerns about the issuers ability to make such payments currency exchange rate risk the fund will hold investments that are denominated in nonus currencies or in securities that provide exposure to such currencies currency exchange rates or interest rates denominated in such currencies changes in currency exchange rates and the relative value of nonus currencies will affect the value of the funds investments and the value of fund shares changes in currency exchange rates also may affect the value of interest earned and gains and losses realized on the sale of securities currency exchange rates can be very volatile and can change quickly and unpredictably as a result the value of an investment in the fund may change quickly and without warning and you may lose money currency risk because the funds net asset value is determined on the basis of us dollars and the fund invests in nonus dollardenominated securities you may lose money if the local currency of a foreign market depreciates against the us dollar even if the local currency value of the funds holdings goes up the fund may hedge certain of its nonus dollar holdings depositary receipts risk depositary receipts may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market any distributions paid to the holders of depositary receipts are usually subject to a fee charged by the depositary holders of depositary receipts may have limited voting rights and investment restrictions in certain countries may adversely impact the value of depositary receipts because such restrictions may limit the ability to convert shares into depositary receipts and vice versa such restrictions may cause shares of the underlying issuer to trade at a discount or premium to the market price of the depositary receipts derivatives risk the use of forward contracts and currency spot transactions can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives in addition to the above risks the fund is deemed to have entered into an isda master agreement the isda master agreement a standard umbrella relationshipframework agreement between two parties under which one or more individual derivatives transactions are entered while most isda master agreements are highly customized and heavily negotiated a deemed isda master agreement has predetermined elections therefore the fund may forego certain protections they would have been afforded had they negotiated the isda master agreements such as terms related to choice of law events of default termination events payments on early termination and calculation agents dynamic hedging risk because of the funds utilization of the dynamic currency hedging strategy the fund may have lower returns than an equivalent noncurrency hedged investment when the component currencies are rising relative to the us dollar as such contracts to sell foreign currency will generally be expected to limit any potential gain that might be realized by the fund if the value of the hedged currency increases in addition the use of currency hedging will not necessarily eliminate exposure to all currency fluctuations hedging against a decline in the value of a currency does not eliminate fluctuations in the value of a portfolio security traded in that currency or  first trust riverfront dynamic europe etf rfeu prevent a loss if the value of the security declines moreover it may not be possible for the fund to hedge against a devaluation that is so generally anticipated that the fund is not able to contract to sell the currency at a price above the devaluation level it anticipates emerging markets risk investments in securities and instruments traded in developing or emerging markets or that provide exposure to such securities or markets can involve additional risks relating to political economic or regulatory conditions not associated with investments in us securities and instruments or investments in more developed international markets emerging market governments may without prior warning impose capital controls on the ability to transfer currency securities or other assets the funds ability to access certain developing or emerging markets also may be limited due to a variety of factors including currency convertibility issues such conditions may impact the ability of the fund to buy sell or otherwise transfer securities cause the funds returns to differ from those available to domestic investors adversely affect the trading market and price for fund shares and cause the fund to decline in value equity securities risk because the fund invests in equity securities the value of the funds shares will fluctuate with changes in the value of its equity securities equity securities prices fluctuate for several reasons including changes in investors perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer or the general condition of the relevant stock market such as market volatility or when political or economic events affecting the issuer occur in addition common stock prices may be particularly sensitive to rising interest rates as the cost of the capital rises and borrowing costs increase europe risk investments in a single region even though representing a number of different countries within the region may be affected by common economic forces and other factors the fund is subject to greater risks of adverse events which occur in the european region and may experience greater volatility than a fund that is more broadly diversified geographically political or economic disruptions in european countries even in countries in which the fund is not invested may adversely affect security values and thus the funds holdings a significant number of countries in europe are member states in the european union the eu and the member states no longer control their own monetary policies by directing independent interest rates for their currencies in these member states the authority to direct monetary policies including money supply and official interest rates for the euro is exercised by the european central bank furthermore the european sovereign debt crisis has had and continues to have a significant negative impact on the economies of certain european countries and their future economic outlooks forward foreign currency exchange contracts risk forward foreign currency exchange contracts involve certain risks including the risk of failure of the counterparty to perform its obligations under the contract and the risk that the use of forward contracts may not serve as a complete hedge because of an imperfect correlation between movements in the prices of the contracts and the prices of the currencies hedged forward foreign currency exchange contracts may limit any potential gain that might result should the value of the underlying currencies increase in addition because forward currency exchange contracts are privately negotiated transactions there can be no assurance that the fund will have flexibility to rollover a forward currency exchange contract upon its expiration if it desires to do so hedging against a decline in the value of a currency does not eliminate fluctuations in the value of a portfolio security traded in that currency or prevent a loss if the value of the security declines liquidity risk the fund invests in equity securities that may have limited liquidity despite being listed on a securities exchange equity securities that are less liquid or that trade less can be more difficult or more costly to buy or to sell compared to other more liquid or active investments this liquidity risk is a factor of the trading volume of a particular security as well as the size and liquidity of the market for such security the prices at which the equity securities are held in the fund will be adversely affected if trading markets for the equity securities are limited or absent management risk the fund is subject to management risk because it is an actively managed portfolio in managing the funds investment portfolio the subadvisor will apply investment techniques and risk analyses that may not have the desired result there can be no guarantee that the fund will meet its investment objective market risk market risk is the risk that a particular security owned by the fund or shares of the fund in general may fall in value securities are subject to market fluctuations caused by such factors as economic political regulatory or market developments changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices overall securities values could decline generally or could underperform other investments new fund risk the fund currently has fewer assets than larger funds and like other relatively new funds large inflows and outflows may impact the funds market exposure for limited periods of time this impact may be positive or negative depending on the direction of market movement during the period affected also during the initial investup period the fund may depart from its principal investment strategies and invest a larger amount or all of its assets in cash equivalents or it may hold cash nondiversification risk the fund is classified as nondiversified under the  act as a result the fund is only limited as to the percentage of its assets which may be invested in the securities of any one issuer by the  first trust riverfront dynamic europe etf rfeu diversification requirements imposed by the internal revenue code of  as amended the fund may invest a relatively high percentage of its assets in a limited number of issuers as a result the fund may be more susceptible to a single adverse economic or regulatory occurrence affecting one or more of these issuers experience increased volatility and be highly concentrated in certain issuers nonus securities risk nonus securities are subject to higher volatility than securities of domestic issuers due to possible adverse political social or economic developments restrictions on foreign investment or exchange of securities lack of liquidity currency exchange rates excessive taxation government seizure of assets different legal or accounting standards and less government supervision and regulation of exchanges in foreign countries portfolio turnover risk high portfolio turnover may result in the fund paying higher levels of transaction costs and generating greater tax liabilities for shareholders portfolio turnover risk may cause the funds performance to be less than expected preferred stock risk preferred stocks combine some of the characteristics of both common stocks and bonds preferred stocks are typically subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a companys capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and therefore will be subject to greater credit risk than those debt instruments preferred stocks are also subject to credit risk interest rate risk and income risk reit investment risk in addition to risks related to investments in real estate generally investing in reits involves certain other risks related to their structure and focus which include but are not limited to dependency upon management skills limited diversification the risks of locating and managing financing for projects heavy cash flow dependency possible default by borrowers the costs and potential losses of selfliquidation of one or more holdings the risk of a possible lack of mortgage funds and associated interest rate risks overbuilding property vacancies increases in property taxes and operating expenses changes in zoning laws losses due to environmental damages changes in neighborhood values and appeal to purchases the possibility of failing to maintain exemptions from registration under the  act and in many cases relatively small market capitalization which may result in less market liquidity and greater price volatility reits are also subject to the risk that the real estate market may experience an economic downturn generally which may have a material effect on the real estate in which the reits invest and their underlying portfolio securities smaller companies risk the fund may invest in small and midcapitalization companies such companies may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments and their securities may be less liquid and may experience greater price volatility than larger more established companies as a result of several factors including limited trading volumes products or financial resources management inexperience and less publicly available information accordingly such companies are generally subject to greater market risk than larger more established companies performance the fund has not yet commenced operations and therefore does not have a performance history once available the funds performance information and

there is no guarantee that a fund will achieve its investment objective during the initial investup period each fund may depart from its principal investment strategies and invest a larger amount or all of its assets in cash or cash equivalents fund investments principal investments equity securities each fund invests in equity securities which may include common stock and other securities with equity characteristics such as real estate investment trusts reits and depositary receipts common stock common stock represents residual ownership interest in issuers and holders of common stock are entitled to the income and increase in the value of the assets and business of the issuers after all debt obligations and obligations to preferred stockholders are satisfied common stockholders generally have voting rights common stock fluctuates in price in response to many factors including historical and prospective earnings of the issuer the value of its assets general economic conditions interest rates investor perceptions and market liquidity the value of common stock purchased by each fund could decline if the financial condition of the companies the fund invests in declines or if overall market and economic conditions deteriorate their value also may decline due to factors that affect a particular industry or industries such as labor shortages or an increase in production costs and competitive conditions within an industry in addition they may decline due to general market conditions that are not specifically related to a company or industry such as real or perceived adverse economic conditions changes in the general outlook for corporate earnings changes in interest or currency rates or generally adverse investor sentiment preferred stock preferred stocks represent an equity ownership interest in the issuer but generally entitle the holder to receive in preference to the holders of other stocks such as common stocks dividends and a fixed share of the proceeds resulting from liquidation of the company some preferred stocks also entitle their holders to receive additional liquidation proceeds on the same basis as holders of a companys common stock some preferred stocks offer a fixed rate of return with no maturity date because those preferred stocks never mature they act like longterm bonds can be more volatile than other types of preferred stocks and may have heightened sensitivity to changes in interest rates other preferred stocks have a variable dividend generally determined on a quarterly or other periodic basis either according to a formula based upon a specified premium or discount to the yield on particular us treasury securities or based on an auction process involving bids submitted by holders and prospective purchasers of such stocks because preferred stocks represent an equity ownership interest in a company their value usually will react more strongly than bonds and other debt instruments to actual or perceived changes in the companys financial condition or prospects or to fluctuations in the equity markets holders of preferred stocks generally have no voting rights or their voting rights are limited to certain extraordinary transactions or events reits the fund may invest in common and preferred shares of reits reits are financial vehicles that pool investors capital to purchase or finance real estate reits are generally classified as equity reits mortgage reits or a combination of equity and mortgage reits equity reits invest the majority of their assets directly in real property and derive income primarily from the collection of rents equity reits can also realize capital gains by selling properties that have appreciated in value mortgage reits invest the majority of their assets in real estate mortgages and derive income from the collection of interest payments reits are not taxed on income distributed to shareholders provided they comply with the applicable tax requirements depositary receipts the funds may make foreign investments through american depositary receipts adrs european depositary receipts edrs and global depositary receipts gdrs or other securities representing underlying shares  of foreign issuers positions in those securities are not necessarily denominated in the same currency as the underlying shares they represent adrs are receipts typically issued by a us bank or trust company evidencing ownership of the underlying securities issued by foreign issuers edrs are european receipts listed on the luxembourg stock exchange evidencing a similar arrangement gdrs are us dollar denominated receipts evidencing ownership of foreign securities generally adrs in registered form are designed for the us securities markets and edrs and gdrs in bearer form are designed for use in foreign securities markets investments in depositary receipts involve risks similar to those accompanying direct investments in nonus securities including liquidity currency political information and other risks business development companies business development companies bdcs are a type of closedend fund regulated under the  act that typically invest in and lend to small and mediumsized private and certain public companies that may not have access to public equity markets for capital raising bdcs invest in such diverse industries as healthcare chemical and manufacturing technology and service companies bdcs are unique in that at least  of their investments must be made in private and certain public us businesses and bdcs are required to make available significant managerial assistance to their portfolio companies unlike corporations bdcs are not taxed on income distributed to their shareholders provided they comply with the applicable requirements of the internal revenue code of  as amended bdcs which are required to distribute substantially all of their income to investors in order to not be subject to entity level taxation often offer a yield advantage over other types of securities a fund will indirectly bear its proportionate share of any management and other expenses and of any performance based or incentive fees charged by the bdcs in which it invests in addition to the expenses paid by the fund the funds are permitted to invest in bdcs in excess of the limits imposed under the  act pursuant to an exemptive order obtained by the trust and the advisor currency hedging transactions in connection with their nonus investments to protect the value of their portfolios against uncertainty in the level of future currency exchange rates the funds may enter into foreign currency transactions on a spot ie cash basis or may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts the funds will invest in forward foreign currency exchange contracts for hedging or currency risk management purposes and not in order to speculate on currency exchange rate movements and the amount each fund may invest in such transactions depends in part on the extent of the funds nonus investments as part of such currency hedging transactions the fund may shift its exposure to foreign currency fluctuations from one currency to another in this regard the fund may use one currency or a basket of currencies to hedge against adverse changes in the value of another currency or basket of currencies when exchange rates between the two currencies are positively correlated this may include shifting exposure from a foreign currency to us dollars or from one foreign currency to another foreign currency a forward foreign currency exchange contract is an obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date which may be any fixed number of days agreed upon by the parties from the date of the contract at a price set on the date of the contract a forward foreign currency exchange contract may reduce a funds exposure to changes in the value of the currency it will deliver and increase its exposure to changes in the value of the currency it will receive for the duration of the contract the effect on the value of such fund is similar to selling securities denominated in one currency and purchasing securities denominated in another currency at the maturity of a forward contract to deliver a particular currency the fund may either sell portfolio securities denominated in such currency and make delivery of the currency or it may retain the securities and acquire the currency on the spot market negotiate to roll over the contract into a new forward contract with a new future settlement date or terminate its contractual obligation to deliver the currency by purchasing an offsetting contract with the same currency trader obligating it to purchase on the same maturity date the same amount of the currency the funds currency hedging transactions may involve a fund transacting in a currency whose value is expected to correlate to the value of a currency in which a portfolio security of the fund is denominatedie such substitute currency will act as a proxy for a currency that the fund seeks to hedge the subadvisor may employ such proxy hedging as opposed to direct hedging under certain circumstances including when i the currency that it seeks to hedge is thinly traded or illiquid ii the proxy hedging transaction would be less expensive than the corresponding direct hedging transaction andor iii it would not be efficient or cost effective to transact in the currency that it seeks to hedge as a result of its limited representation in a funds portfolio in this regard the subadvisor has determined i each of the japanese yen the australian dollar and the canadian dollar to be representative of and may serve as a proxy for the taiwanese dollar the singapore dollar andor the korean won ii each of the euro the british pound the swiss franc and the canadian dollar to be representative of and may serve as a proxy for the swedish krona the norwegian krone the danish krone andor the israeli shekel iii each of the australian dollar the canadian dollar and the mexican peso to be representative of and may serve as a proxy for all latin american currencies including brazil chile and peru and iv the polish zloty to be representative of and may serve as a proxy for all eastern european currencies including the ukraine and the czech republic  nonus investments nonus investments include securities issued or guaranteed by companies organized under the laws of countries other than the united states including companies domiciled in emerging markets nonus investments may be traded on foreign securities exchanges or in overthecounter capital markets many nonus companies issue both foreign currency and us dollardenominated securities additional investments cash equivalents and shortterm investments normally the funds invest substantially all of their assets to meet their objective each fund may invest the remainder of its assets in securities with maturities of less than one year or cash equivalents or it may hold cash the percentage of a fund invested in such holdings varies and depends on several factors including market conditions for temporary defensive purposes and during periods of high cash inflows or outflows a fund may depart from its principal investment strategies and invest part or all of its assets in these securities or it may hold cash during such periods a fund may not be able to achieve its investment objective a fund may adopt a defensive strategy when the portfolio managers believe securities in which such fund normally invests have elevated risks due to political or economic factors and in other extraordinary circumstances for more information on eligible short term investments see the sai illiquid securities the funds may invest up to  of their net assets in securities and other instruments that are illiquid determined using the securities and exchange commissions standard applicable to investment companies ie securities that cannot be disposed of by a fund within seven days in the ordinary course of business at approximately the price at which the fund has valued the securities disclosure of portfolio holdings a description of the policies and procedures with respect to the disclosure of the funds portfolio securities is included in the funds sai which is available on the funds website at wwwftportfolioscom additional risks of investing in the funds risk is inherent in all investing investing in a fund involves risk including the risk that you may lose all or part of your investment there can be no assurance that a fund will meet its stated objective before you invest you should consider the following risks in addition to the principal risks set forth above in this prospectus principal risks business development company risk the funds may invest in bdcs which may carry risks similar to those of a private equity or venture capital fund small and mediumsized companies may have fewer lines of business so that changes in any one line of business may have a greater impact on the value of their stock than is the case with a larger company an investment in bdcs is also subject to additional risks including managements ability to meet the funds investment objective and to manage the funds portfolio when the underlying securities are redeemed or sold during periods of market turmoil and as investors perceptions regarding the funds or their underlying investments change bdcs are not redeemable at the option of the shareholder and they may trade in the market at a discount to their net asset value the bdcs included in the funds may employ the use of leverage in their portfolios through borrowings or the issuance of preferred stock this leverage also subjects a bdc to increased risks including the likelihood of increased volatility and the possibility that a bdcs common share income will fall if the dividend rate of the preferred shares or the interest rate on any borrowings rises cash transactions risk the funds may under certain circumstances effect a portion of creations and redemptions for cash rather than inkind securities as a result an investment in the funds may be less taxefficient than an investment in an exchangetraded fund etf that effects its creations and redemptions for inkind securities etfs are able to make inkind redemptions and avoid being taxed on gains on the distributed portfolio securities at the fund level because the funds may effect a portion of redemptions for cash they may be required to sell portfolio securities in order to obtain the cash needed to distribute redemption proceeds any recognized gain on these sales by the funds will generally cause the funds to recognize gain they might not otherwise have recognized or to recognize such gain sooner than would otherwise be required if they were to distribute portfolio securities inkind the funds generally intend to distribute these gains to shareholders to avoid being taxed on this gain at the fund level and otherwise comply with the special tax rules that apply to them this strategy may cause shareholders to be subject to tax on gains they would not otherwise be subject to or at an earlier date than if they  had made an investment in a different etf moreover cash transactions may have to be carried out over several days if the securities market is relatively illiquid and may involve considerable brokerage fees and taxes these brokerage fees and taxes which will be higher than if the funds sold and redeemed their shares inkind will be passed on to purchasers and redeemers of creation units in the form of creation and redemption transaction fees in addition these factors may result in wider spreads between the bid and the offered prices of the funds shares than for etfs that distribute portfolio securities inkind currency risk an increase in the strength of the us dollar relative to other currencies may cause the value of the funds to decline certain nonus currencies may be particularly volatile and nonus governments may intervene in the currency markets causing a decline in value or liquidity in the funds nonus holdings whose value is tied to the affected nonus currency depositary receipts risk depositary receipts are usually in the form of adrs or gdrs adrs are us dollardenominated receipts representing shares of foreignbased corporations adrs are issued by us banks or trust companies and entitle the holder to all dividends and capital gains that are paid out on the underlying foreign shares gdrs are similar to adrs but are shares of foreignbased corporations generally issued by nonus banks in one or more markets around the world adrs or gdrs may be less liquid than the underlying shares in their primary trading market any distributions paid to the holders of depositary receipts whether adrs or gdrs are usually subject to a fee charged by the depositary holders of depositary receipts may have limited voting rights pursuant to a deposit agreement between the underlying issuer and the depositary in certain cases the depositary will vote the equity shares deposited with it as directed by the underlying issuers board of directors furthermore investment restrictions in certain countries may adversely impact the value of depositary receipts because such restrictions may limit the ability to convert the equity shares into depositary receipts and vice versa such restrictions may cause the equity shares of the underlying issuer to trade at a discount or premium to the market price of the depositary receipt moreover if depositary receipts are converted into equity shares the laws in certain countries may limit the ability of a nonresident to trade the equity shares and to reconvert the equity shares to depositary receipts dynamic hedging risk at the discretion of the subadvisor the funds will utilize a dynamic currency hedging process through the use of forward foreign currency exchange contracts and currency spot transactions to hedge a portion of the funds currency exposure the subadvisor will adjust the extent to which the funds will utilize currency hedging transactions on an ongoing basis based on among other things market conditions currency exchange rates and the currency exposure of the funds portfolio investments as a result of the dynamic currency hedging process the portion of a funds portfolio securities which are subject to currency hedging transactions may vary widely from  to  of the funds portfolio securities a fund may have higher returns than an equivalent noncurrency hedged investment when the component currencies are weakening relative to the us dollar conversely a fund may have lower returns than an equivalent noncurrency hedged investment when the component currencies are rising relative to the us dollar as such contracts to sell foreign currency will generally be expected to limit any potential gain that might be realized by the funds if the value of the hedged currency increases although the funds seek to minimize the impact of currency fluctuations on fund returns the use of currency hedging will not necessarily eliminate exposure to all currency fluctuations hedging against a decline in the value of a currency does not eliminate fluctuations in the value of a portfolio security traded in that currency or prevent a loss if the value of the security declines moreover it may not be possible for a fund to hedge against a devaluation that is so generally anticipated that the fund is not able to contract to sell the currency at a price above the devaluation level it anticipates the cost to a fund of engaging in currency exchange transactions varies with such factors as the currency involved the length of the contract period and prevailing market conditions a proxy hedging transaction entails greater risk than a direct hedging transaction as it is dependent on a stable relationship between the two currencies paired as proxies and that relationship may not always be maintained emerging markets risk investments in securities of issuers located in emerging market countries are considered speculative heightened risks of investing in emerging markets securities include i smaller market capitalization of securities markets which may suffer periods of relative illiquidity ii significant price volatility iii restrictions on foreign investment and iv possible repatriation of investment income and capital furthermore nonus investors may be required to register the proceeds of sales and future economic or political crises could lead to price controls forced mergers expropriation or confiscatory taxation seizure nationalization or creation of government monopolies the currencies of emerging market countries may experience significant declines against the us dollar and devaluation may occur subsequent to investments in these currencies by the funds inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates have had and may continue to have negative effects on the economies and securities markets of certain emerging market countries  equity securities risk equity securities may decline significantly in price over short or extended periods of time and such declines may occur in the equity market as a whole or they may occur only in a particular country company industry or sector of the market illiquid securities risk illiquid securities may be difficult to dispose of at the price at which a fund has valued the securities and at the times when the fund believes it is desirable to do so the market price of illiquid securities generally is more volatile than that of more liquid securities which may adversely affect the price that a fund recovers upon the sale of such securities illiquid securities are also more difficult to value especially in challenging markets the subadvisors judgment may play a greater role in the valuation process investment of a funds assets in illiquid securities may restrict the funds ability to take advantage of market opportunities the risks associated with illiquid securities may be particularly acute in situations in which a funds operations require cash and could result in the fund incurring losses on the sale of illiquid or restricted securities nonus securities risk the funds will invest in securities of nonus issuers an investment in securities of nonus issuers involves risks not associated with domestic issuers nonus securities are subject to higher volatility than securities of domestic issuers due to possible adverse political social or economic developments restrictions on foreign investment or exchange of securities lack of liquidity currency exchange rates excessive taxation government seizure of assets different legal or accounting standards and less government supervision and regulation of exchanges in nonus countries the adoption of new governmental restrictions including the possible imposition of withholding taxes on dividend income and the possible establishment of exchange controls or freezes on the convertibility of currency might adversely affect an investment in nonus securities investments in nonus securities also may involve higher costs than investments in us securities including higher transaction and custody costs as well as the imposition of additional taxes by nonus governments nonus investments may also involve risks associated with less complete financial information about the issuers preferred stock risk an investment in preferred stocks involves the further risks not associated with an investment in common stocks set forth below o limited voting rights generally holders of preferred stocks such as the fund have no voting rights with respect to the issuing company unless preferred dividends have been in arrears for a specified number of periods at which time the preferred stock holders may elect a number of directors to the issuers board generally once the issuer pays all the arrearages the preferred stock holders no longer have voting rights o special redemptions rights in certain circumstances an issuer of preferred stocks may redeem the securities prior to a specified date for instance for certain types of preferred stocks a redemption may be triggered by a change in federal income tax or securities laws as with call provisions a special redemption by the issuer may negatively impact the return of the security held by the fund o deferral preferred stocks may include provisions that permit the issuer at its discretion to defer distributions for a stated period without any adverse consequences to the issuer if the fund owns a preferred stock that is deferring its distributions the fund may be required to report income for federal income tax purposes although it has not yet received such income in cash o subordination preferred stocks are subordinated to bonds and other debt instruments in a companys capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and liquidation payments and therefore will be subject to greater credit risk than those debt instruments o liquidity preferred stocks may be substantially less liquid than many other securities such as common stocks or us government securities nonprincipal risks authorized participant concentration risk only an authorized participant as defined in the frequent purchases and redemptions section may engage in creation or redemption transactions directly with the funds each fund has a limited number of institutions that act as authorized participants to the extent that these institutions exit the business or are unable to proceed with creation andor redemption orders with respect to a fund and no other authorized participant is able to step forward to create or redeem in either of these cases fund shares may trade at a discount to the funds net asset value and possibly face delisting borrowing and leverage risks if a fund borrows money it must pay interest and other fees which may reduce the funds returns as prescribed by the  act each fund will be required to maintain specified asset coverage of at least  with respect to any bank borrowing immediately following such borrowing a fund  may be required to dispose of assets on unfavorable terms if market fluctuations or other factors reduce the funds asset coverage to less than the prescribed amount dependence on key personnel the subadvisor is dependent upon the experience and expertise of the funds portfolio managers in providing advisory services with respect to the funds investments if the subadvisor were to lose the services of any of these portfolio managers its ability to service the funds could be adversely affected there can be no assurance that a suitable replacement could be found for any of the portfolio managers in the event of their death resignation retirement or inability to act on behalf of the subadvisor inflation risk inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money as inflation increases the value of the funds assets can decline as can the value of the funds distributions certain securities in which the funds invest may be particularly sensitive to rising interest rates as the cost of capital rises and borrowing costs increase international closed market trading risk because securities held by the funds trade on nonus exchanges that are closed when the funds primary listing exchange is open there are likely to be deviations between the current price of an underlying security and the last quoted price for the underlying security ie a funds quote from the closed foreign market resulting in premiums or discounts to each funds net asset value that may be greater than those experienced by other exchangetraded funds however because shares can be created and redeemed in creation units at a funds net asset value it is not expected that large discounts or premiums to the net asset value of any fund will be sustained over the long term unlike shares of many closedend funds which frequently trade at appreciable discounts from and sometimes at premiums to their net asset values issuer specific changes risk the value of an individual security or particular type of security can be more volatile than the market as a whole and can perform differently from the value of the market as a whole legislationlitigation risk from time to time various legislative initiatives are proposed in the united states and abroad which may have a negative impact on certain companies in which the funds invest such legislation or litigation may cause a fund to lose value or may result in higher portfolio turnover if the subadvisor determines to sell such a holding market maker risk if a fund has lower average daily trading volumes it may rely on a small number of thirdparty market makers to provide a market for the purchase and sale of shares any trading halt or other problem relating to the trading activity of these market makers could result in a dramatic change in the spread between a funds net asset value and the price at which such funds shares are trading on nasdaq which could result in a decrease in value of the funds shares in addition decisions by market makers or authorized participants to reduce their role or step away from these activities in times of market stress could inhibit the effectiveness of the arbitrage process in maintaining the relationship between the underlying values of the funds portfolio securities and the funds market price this reduced effectiveness could result in fund shares trading at a discount to net asset value and also in greater than normal intraday bidask spreads for fund shares trading issues although the shares of each fund are listed for trading on nasdaq there can be no assurance that an active trading market for such shares will develop or be maintained trading in shares on nasdaq may be halted due to market conditions or for reasons that in the view of nasdaq make trading in shares inadvisable in addition trading in shares on nasdaq is subject to trading halts caused by extraordinary market volatility pursuant to nasdaq circuit breaker rules market makers are under no obligation to make a market in the funds shares and authorized participants are not obligated to submit purchase or redemption orders for creation units there can be no assurance that the requirements of nasdaq necessary to maintain the listing of a fund will continue to be met or will remain unchanged initially due to the small asset size of the funds they may have difficulty maintaining their listing on nasdaq fluctuation of net asset value the net asset value of shares of each fund will generally fluctuate with changes in the market value of such funds holdings the market prices of shares will generally fluctuate in accordance with changes in net asset value as well as the relative supply of and demand for shares on nasdaq the funds cannot predict whether shares will trade below at or above their net asset value because the shares trade on nasdaq at market prices and not at net asset value price differences may be due in large part to the fact that supply and demand forces at work in the secondary trading market for shares will be closely related to but not identical to the same forces influencing the prices of the holdings of the funds trading individually or in the aggregate at any point in time however given that shares can only be purchased and redeemed either inkind or for cash in creation units and only to and from brokerdealers and large institutional investors that have entered into participation agreements unlike shares of closedend funds which frequently trade at appreciable discounts  from and sometimes at premiums to their net asset value the funds believe that large discounts or premiums to the net asset value of shares should not be sustained fund organization each fund is a series of the trust an investment company registered under the  act each fund is treated

brokers shares of the funds are expected to be listed for trading on the secondary market on nasdaq shares can be bought and sold throughout the trading day like other publicly traded shares there is no minimum investment when buying shares on nasdaq although shares are generally purchased and sold in round lots of  shares brokerage firms typically permit investors to purchase or sell shares in smaller odd lots at no pershare price differential when buying or selling shares through a broker investors should expect to incur customary brokerage commissions investors may receive less than the net asset value of the shares because shares are bought and sold at market prices rather than net asset value and investors may pay some or all of the spread between the bid and the offer price in the secondary market on each leg of a round trip purchase and sale transaction share prices are reported in dollars and cents per share for purposes of the  act each fund is treated as a registered investment company and the acquisition of shares by other registered investment companies is subject to the restrictions of section d of the  act the trust on behalf of the funds has received an exemptive order from the securities and exchange commission that permits certain registered investment companies to invest in a fund beyond the limits set forth in section d subject to certain terms and conditions including that any such investment companies enter into an agreement with such fund regarding the terms of any investment book entry shares are held in bookentry form which means that no share certificates are issued the depository trust company dtc or its nominee is the record owner of all outstanding shares of the funds and is recognized as the owner of all shares for all purposes investors owning shares are beneficial owners as shown on the records of dtc or its participants dtc serves as the securities depository for all shares participants in dtc include securities brokers and dealers banks trust companies clearing corporations and other institutions that directly or indirectly maintain a custodial relationship with dtc as a beneficial owner of shares you are not entitled to receive physical delivery of share certificates or to have shares registered in your name and you are not considered a registered owner of shares therefore to exercise any right as an owner of shares you must rely upon the procedures of dtc and its participants these procedures are the same as those that apply to any other stocks that you hold in bookentry or street name form share trading prices the trading prices of shares of a fund on nasdaq may differ from such funds daily net asset value and can be affected by market forces of supply and demand economic conditions and other factors information regarding the intraday value of the shares of a fund also referred to as the indicative optimized portfolio value iopv is disseminated every  seconds throughout such funds trading day by the national securities exchange on which the shares are listed or by market data vendors or other information providers the iopv should not be viewed as a realtime update of the net asset value per share of a fund because the iopv may not be calculated in the same manner as the net asset value which is computed once a day generally at the end of the business day the price of a nonus security that is primarily traded on a nonus exchange will be updated using the last sale price every  seconds throughout the trading day provided that upon the closing of such nonus exchange the closing price of the security after being converted to us dollars will be used this will likely cause the iopv to deviate significantly from the true market value of the portfolio furthermore in calculating the iopv of a funds shares exchange rates may be used throughout the day  am to  pm eastern time that may differ from those used to calculate the net asset value per share of such fund and consequently may result in differences between the net asset value and the iopv  a fund is not involved in or responsible for the calculation or dissemination of the iopv of shares of such fund and such fund does not make any warranty as to its accuracy frequent purchases and redemptions of the funds shares the funds impose no restrictions on the frequency of purchases and redemptions market timing in determining not to approve a written established policy the board evaluated the risks of market timing activities by the funds shareholders the board considered that the funds shares can only be purchased and redeemed directly from a fund in creation units by brokerdealers and large institutional investors that have entered into participation agreements ie authorized participants aps and that the vast majority of trading in the funds shares occurs on the secondary market because the secondary market trades do not involve the funds directly it is unlikely those trades would cause many of the harmful effects of market timing including dilution disruption of portfolio management increases in the funds trading costs and the realization of capital gains as the funds may effect the purchase or redemption of creation units in exchange wholly or partially for cash the board noted that such trades could result in dilution to the funds and increased transaction costs which could negatively impact the funds ability to achieve their investment objective however the board noted that direct trading by aps is critical to ensuring that the shares trade at or close to net asset value in addition the funds impose fixed and variable transaction fees on purchases and redemptions of creation units to cover the custodial and other costs incurred by the funds in effecting trades finally the advisor monitors purchase and redemption orders from aps for patterns of abusive trading the funds reserve the right to reject purchase and redemption orders from aps that the advisor has determined may be disruptive to the management of a fund or otherwise not in the funds best interests dividends distributions and taxes dividends from net investment income of the funds if any are declared and paid quarterly by each fund each fund distributes its net realized capital gains if any to shareholders at least annually distributions in cash may be reinvested automatically in additional whole shares only if the broker through whom you purchased shares makes such option available such shares will generally be reinvested by the broker based upon the market price of those shares and investors may be subject to customary brokerage commissions charged by the broker federal tax matters this section summarizes some of the main us federal income tax consequences of owning shares of the funds this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or nonus tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the funds the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition counsel to the funds was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be included in the funds this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor fund status each fund intends to qualify as a regulated investment company under the federal tax laws if a fund qualifies as a regulated investment company and distributes its income as required by the tax law the fund generally will not pay federal income taxes distributions the funds distributions are generally taxable after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that separates the distributions of a fund into two categories ordinary income distributions and capital gain dividends ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate however as further discussed below certain ordinary income distributions received from the fund may be taxed at the capital gains tax rates generally you will treat all capital gain dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your shares to determine your actual tax liability for your capital gain dividends you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions as described below in addition the funds may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you however such distributions may  reduce your tax basis in your shares which could result in you having to pay higher taxes in the future when shares are sold even if you sell the shares at a loss from your original investment the tax status of your distributions from a fund is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional shares or receive them in cash the income from a fund that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales fee if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year income from a fund may also be subject to a  medicare tax this tax generally applies to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals dividends received deduction a corporation that owns shares generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received from a fund because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies however certain ordinary income dividends on shares that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the funds from certain corporations may be reported by the funds as being eligible for the dividends received deduction capital gains and losses and certain ordinary income dividends if you are an individual the maximum marginal stated federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  for taxpayers in the  tax bracket  for taxpayers in the    and  tax brackets and  for taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets some capital gain dividends may be taxed at a higher maximum stated tax rate capital gain received from assets held for more than one year that is considered unrecaptured section  gain which may be the case for example with some capital gains attributable to equity interests in real estate investment trusts that constitute interests in entities treated as real estate investment trusts for federal income tax purposes is taxed at a maximum marginal stated federal tax rate of  in the case of capital gain dividends the determination of which portion of the capital gain dividend if any is subject to the  tax rate will be made based on rules prescribed by the united states treasury capital gains may also be subject to the medicare tax described above net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your shares to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from a fund and sell your shares at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as longterm capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code of  as amended treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations ordinary income dividends received by an individual shareholder from a regulated investment company such as the funds are generally taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain as discussed above provided certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the funds themselves dividends from reits and foreign corporations are qualifying dividends only in limited circumstances each fund will provide notice to its shareholders of the amount of any distribution which may be taken into account as a dividend which is eligible for the capital gains tax rates sale of shares if you sell or redeem your shares you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in your shares from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your shares is generally equal to the cost of your shares generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your shares taxes on purchase and redemption of creation units if you exchange securities for creation units you will generally recognize a gain or a loss the gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the market value of the creation units at the time and your aggregate basis in the securities surrendered and the cash component paid if you exchange creation units for securities you will generally recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between your basis in the creation units and the aggregate market value of the securities received and the cash redemption amount the internal revenue service however may assert that a loss realized upon an exchange of securities for creation units or creation units for securities cannot be deducted currently under the rules governing wash sales or on the basis that there has been no significant change in economic position  deductibility of fund expenses expenses incurred and deducted by the funds will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however you may be required to treat your portion of these fund expenses as income in these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted gross income some individuals may also be subject to further limitations on the amount of their itemized deductions depending on their income nonus tax credit because the funds invest in nonus securities the tax statement that you receive may include an item showing nonus taxes a fund paid to other countries in this case dividends taxed to you will include your share of the taxes such fund paid to other countries you may be able to deduct or receive a tax credit for your share of these taxes nonus investors if you are a nonus investor ie an investor other than a us citizen or resident or a us corporation partnership estate or trust you should be aware that generally subject to applicable tax treaties distributions from a fund will be characterized as dividends for federal income tax purposes other than dividends which a fund properly reports as capital gain dividends and will be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes subject to certain exceptions described below however distributions received by a nonus investor from a fund that are properly reported by such fund as capital gain dividends may not be subject to us federal income taxes including withholding taxes provided that the fund makes certain elections and certain other conditions are met distributions may be subject to a us withholding tax of  in the case of distributions to i certain nonus financial institutions that have not entered into an agreement with the us treasury to collect and disclose certain information and are not resident in a jurisdiction that has entered into such an agreement with the us treasury and ii certain other nonus entities that do not provide certain certifications and information about the entitys us owners dispositions of shares by such persons may be subject to such withholding after december   investments in certain nonus corporations if a fund holds an equity interest in any passive foreign investment companies pfics which are generally certain nonus corporations that receive at least  of their annual gross income from passive sources such as interest dividends certain rents and royalties or capital gains or that hold at least  of their assets in investments producing such passive income the fund could be subject to us federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity interests even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its shareholders a fund will not be able to pass through to its shareholders any credit or deduction for such taxes a fund may be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences in this case the fund would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such pfic shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income under this election the fund might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from pfics and its proceeds from dispositions of pfic stock during that year and such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the  excise tax dividends paid by pfics are not treated as qualified dividend income distribution plan ftp serves as the distributor of creation units for the funds on an agency basis ftp does not maintain a secondary market in shares the board has adopted a distribution and service plan pursuant to rule b under the  act in accordance with its rule b plan the funds are authorized to pay an amount up to  of their average daily net assets each year to reimburse ftp for amounts expended to finance activities primarily intended to result in the sale of creation units or the provision of investor services ftp may also use this amount to compensate securities dealers or other persons that are aps for providing distribution assistance including brokerdealer and shareholder support and educational and promotional services the funds do not currently pay b fees and pursuant to a contractual arrangement the funds will not pay b fees anytime before february   however in the event b fees are charged in the future because these fees are paid out of the funds assets over time these fees will increase the cost of your investment and may cost you more than certain other types of sales charges  net asset value each funds net asset value

aggregation the method by which creation unit aggregations of fund shares are created and traded may raise certain issues under applicable securities laws because new creation unit aggregations of shares are issued and sold by a fund on an ongoing basis a distribution as such term is used in the securities act of  as amended the  act may occur at any point brokerdealers and other persons are cautioned that some activities on their part may depending on the circumstances result in their being deemed participants in a distribution in a manner that could render them statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery requirement and liability provisions of the  act for example a brokerdealer firm or its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes creation unit aggregations after placing an order with ftp breaks them down into constituent shares and sells such shares directly to customers or if it chooses to couple the creation of a supply of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for shares a determination of whether one is an underwriter for purposes of the  act must take into account all the facts and circumstances pertaining to the activities of the brokerdealer or its client in the particular case and the examples mentioned above should not be considered a complete description of all the activities that could lead to a characterization as an underwriter brokerdealer firms should also note that dealers who are not underwriters but are effecting transactions in shares whether or not participating in the distribution of shares are generally required to deliver a prospectus this is because the prospectus delivery exemption in section a of the  act is not available in respect of such transactions as a result of section d of the  act as a result brokerdealer firms should note that dealers who are not underwriters but are participating in a distribution as contrasted with ordinary secondary market transactions and thus dealing with the shares that are part of an overallotment within the meaning of section ac of the  act would be unable to take advantage of the prospectus delivery exemption provided by section a of the  act firms that incur a prospectus delivery obligation with respect to shares are reminded that under rule  of the  act rule  a prospectus delivery obligation under section b of the  act owed to a brokerdealer in connection with a sale on nasdaq is satisfied by the fact that the prospectus is available from nasdaq upon request the

shareholders each share has one vote with respect to matters upon which a shareholder vote is required consistent with the requirements of the  act and the rules promulgated thereunder shares of all series of the trust vote together as a single class except as otherwise required by the  act or if the matter being voted on affects only a particular series and if a matter affects a particular series differently from other series the shares of that series will vote separately on such matter the trusts declaration of trust the declaration requires a shareholder vote only on those matters where the  act requires a vote of shareholders and otherwise permits the trustees to take actions without seeking the consent of shareholders for example the declaration gives the trustees broad authority to approve reorganizations between a fund and another entity such as another exchangetraded fund or the sale of all or substantially all of a funds assets or the termination of the trust or any fund without shareholder approval if the  act would not require such approval the declaration provides that by becoming a shareholder of a fund each shareholder shall be expressly held to have agreed to be bound by the provisions of the declaration the declaration may except in limited circumstances be amended by the trustees in any respect without a shareholder vote the declaration provides that the trustees may establish the number of trustees and that vacancies on the board of trustees may be filled by the remaining trustees except when election of trustees by the shareholders is required under the  act trustees are then elected by a plurality of votes cast by shareholders at a meeting at which a quorum is present the declaration also provides that trustees may be removed with or without cause by a vote of shareholders holding at least twothirds of the voting power of the trust or by a vote of twothirds of the remaining trustees the provisions of the declaration relating to the election and removal of trustees may not be amended without the approval of twothirds of the trustees the holders of fund shares are required to disclose information on direct or indirect ownership of fund shares as may be required to comply with various laws applicable to the funds or as the trustees may determine and ownership of fund shares may be disclosed by the funds if so required by law or regulation in addition pursuant to the declaration the trustees may in their discretion require the trust to redeem shares held by any shareholder for any reason under terms set by the trustees the declaration provides a detailed process for the bringing of derivative actions by shareholders in order to permit legitimate inquiries and claims while avoiding the time expense distraction and other harm that can be caused to a fund or its shareholders as a result of spurious shareholder demands and derivative actions prior to bringing a derivative action a demand must first be made on the trustees the declaration details various information certifications undertakings and acknowledgements that must be included in the demand following receipt of the demand the trustees have a period of  days which may be extended by an additional  days to consider the demand if a majority of the trustees who are considered independent for the purposes of considering the demand determine that maintaining the suit would not be in the best interests of a fund the trustees are required to reject the demand and the complaining shareholder may not proceed with the derivative action unless the shareholder is able to sustain the burden of proof to a court that the decision of the trustees not to pursue the requested action was not a good faith exercise of their business judgment on behalf of a fund in making such a determination a trustee is not considered to have a personal financial interest by virtue of being compensated for his or her services as a trustee if a demand is rejected the complaining shareholder will be responsible for the costs and expenses including attorneys fees incurred by a fund in connection with the consideration of the demand under a number of circumstances if a derivative action is brought in violation of the declaration the shareholder bringing the action may be responsible for a funds costs including attorneys fees the declaration also provides that any shareholder bringing an action against a fund waives the right to trial by jury to the fullest extent permitted by law the trust is not required to and does not intend to hold annual meetings of shareholders under massachusetts law applicable to massachusetts business trusts shareholders of such a trust may under certain circumstances be held personally liable as partners for its obligations however the declaration contains an express disclaimer of shareholder liability for acts or obligations of the trust and requires that notice of this disclaimer be given in each agreement obligation or instrument entered into or executed by the trust or the trustees the declaration further provides for indemnification out of the assets and property of the trust for all losses and expenses of any shareholder held personally liable for the obligations of the trust thus the risk of a shareholder incurring financial loss on account of shareholder liability is limited to circumstances in which both inadequate insurance existed and the trust or the fund itself was unable to meet its obligations the declaration further provides that a trustee acting in his or her capacity as trustee is not personally liable to any person other than the trust or its shareholders for any act omission or obligation of the trust the  declaration requires the trust to indemnify any persons who are or who have been trustees officers or employees of the trust for any liability for actions or failure to act except to the extent prohibited by applicable federal law in making any determination as to whether any person is entitled to the advancement of expenses in connection with a claim for which indemnification is sought such person is entitled to a rebuttable presumption that he or she did not engage in conduct for which indemnification is not available the declaration provides that any trustee who serves as chair of the board of trustees or of a committee of the board of trustees as lead independent trustee or as audit committee financial expert or in any other similar capacity will not be subject to any greater standard of care or liability because of

securities of other investment companies for purposes of applying restriction  above under the  act as currently in effect the funds are not permitted to issue senior securities except that a fund may borrow from any bank if immediately after such borrowing the value of such funds total assets is at least  of the principal amount of all of the funds borrowings ie the principal amount of the borrowings may not exceed   of a funds total assets in the event that such asset coverage shall at any time fall below  the applicable fund shall within three days thereafter not including sundays and holidays reduce the amount of its borrowings to an extent that the asset coverage of such borrowing shall be at least  except for restriction  above if a percentage restriction is adhered to at the time of investment a later increase in percentage resulting from a change in market value of the investment or the total assets will not constitute a violation of that restriction with respect to restriction  if the limitations are exceeded as a result of a change in market value then the fund will reduce the amount of borrowings within three days thereafter to the extent necessary to comply with the limitations not including sundays and holidays the fundamental investment limitations set forth above limit the funds ability to engage in certain investment practices and purchase securities or other instruments to the extent permitted by or consistent with applicable law as such these limitations will change as the statute rules regulations or orders or if applicable interpretations

more than  of the outstanding securities are represented or ii more than  of the outstanding voting securities with respect to the submission of a change in an investment policy to the holders of outstanding voting securities of a fund such matter shall be deemed to have been effectively acted upon with respect to a fund if a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the fund vote for the approval of such matter notwithstanding that such matter has not been approved by the holders of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of any other series of the trust affected by such

of investments the following information supplements the discussion in the funds prospectus and reflects certain investments in which the fund may invest for further discussion of the investments in which the fund may principally invest see the prospectus depositary receipts the funds may hold securities of certain nonus companies in the form of depositary receipts depositary receipts depositary receipts may not necessarily be denominated in the same currency as the underlying securities into which they may be converted american depositary receipts adrs are receipts typically issued by an american bank or trust company that evidence ownership of underlying securities issued by a foreign corporation european depositary receipts edrs are receipts issued by a european bank or trust company evidencing ownership of securities issued by a foreign corporation global depositary receipts gdrs are receipts issued throughout the world that evidence a similar arrangement in addition the funds may invest in new york shares which are typically issued by a company incorporated in the netherlands and represent a direct interest in the company and global shares which are the actual ordinary shares of a nonus company  which trade both in the home market and the united states unlike traditional depositary receipts new york share programs do not involve custody of the dutch shares of the company generally adrs and new york shares in registered form are designed for use in the us securities markets edrs in registered form are used to access european markets gdrs in registered form are tradable both in the united states and in europe and are designed for use throughout the world global shares are represented by the same share certificate in the united states and the home market separate registrars in the united states and the home country are maintained in most cases purchases occurring on a us exchange would be reflected on the us registrar global shares may also be eligible to list on exchanges in addition to the united states and the home country equities the funds intend to invest in equity securities which represent an ownership position in a company the prices of equity securities fluctuate based on among other things events specific to their issuers and market economic and other conditions equity securities in which the funds invest include common stocks common stocks may be common stock of any class or series of a domestic or foreign corporation or any similar equity interest such as a trust or partnership interest these investments may or may not pay dividends and may or may not carry voting rights common stock occupies the most junior position in a companys capital structure the funds may also invest in warrants and rights related to common stocks forward foreign currency exchange contracts to protect the value of their portfolio against uncertainty in the level of future currency exchange rates between a particular foreign currency and the us dollar or between foreign currencies the funds may enter into foreign currency transactions on a spot ie cash basis or it may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts a forward foreign currency exchange contract is an obligation to purchase or sell a specific currency at a future date which may be any fixed number of days agreed upon by the parties from the date of the contract at a price set on the date of the contract forward foreign currency exchange contracts i are traded in a market conducted directly between currency traders typically commercial banks or other financial institutions and their customers ii generally have no deposit requirements and iii are typically consummated without payment of any commissions a fund however may enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts requiring deposits or involving the payment of commissions the funds will only enter into forward foreign currency exchange contracts with parties which it believes to be creditworthy institutions to assure that its forward foreign currency exchange contracts are not used to achieve investment leverage the funds will segregate or earmark on its records liquid assets to the extent required under the  act futures contracts the funds may enter into exchangelisted equity index futures contracts a futures contract on an index is an agreement pursuant to which two parties agree to take or make delivery of an amount of cash equal to the difference between the value of the index at the close of the last trading day of the contract and the price at which the index contract was originally written although the value of a securities index is a function of the value of certain specified securities no physical delivery of those securities is made a public market exists in futures contracts covering a number of indexes including but not limited to the standard  poors  index the russell  index the value line composite index and the new york stock exchange composite index the funds will not enter into futures contracts which are  prohibited under the cea and will to the extent required by regulatory authorities enter only into futures contracts that are traded on national futures exchanges and are standardized as to maturity date and underlying financial instrument futures exchanges and trading are regulated under the cea by the cftc futures contracts may be closed out prior to delivery by entering into an offsetting transaction in a matching futures contract if the offsetting purchase price is less than the original sale price a gain will be realized conversely if the offsetting sale price is more than the original purchase price a gain will be realized if it is less a loss will be realized the transaction costs must also be included in these calculations there can be no assurance however that a fund will be able to enter into an offsetting transaction with respect to a particular futures contract at a particular time if a fund is not able to enter into an offsetting transaction the fund will continue to be required to maintain the margin deposits on the futures contract transaction costs are incurred when a futures contract is bought or sold and margin deposits must be maintained margin is the amount of funds that must be deposited by a fund with its custodian in a segregated account in the name of the futures commission merchant in order to initiate futures trading and to maintain the funds open positions in futures contracts a margin deposit is intended to ensure a funds performance of the futures contract the margin required for a particular futures contract is set by the exchange on which the futures contract is traded and may be significantly modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the futures contract futures contracts are customarily purchased and sold on margins that may range upward from less than  of the value of the futures contract being traded if the price of an open futures contract changes by increase in the case of a sale or by decrease in the case of a purchase so that the loss on the futures contract reaches a point at which the margin on deposit does not satisfy margin requirements the broker will require an increase in the margin however if the value of a position increases because of favorable price changes in the futures contract so that the margin deposit exceeds the required margin the broker will pay the excess to a fund in computing daily net asset value a fund will mark to market the current value of its open futures contracts the funds expect to earn interest income on their margin deposits because of the low margin deposits required futures trading involves an extremely high degree of leverage as a result a relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss as well as gain to the investor for example if at the time of purchase  of the value of the futures contract is deposited as margin a subsequent  decrease in the value of the futures contract would result in a total loss of the margin deposit before any deduction for the transaction costs if the account were then closed out a  decrease would result in a loss equal to  of the original margin deposit if the future contracts were closed out thus a purchase or sale of a futures contract may result in losses in excess of the amount initially invested in the futures contract however a fund would presumably have sustained comparable losses if instead of the futures contract it had invested in the underlying financial instrument and sold it after the decline  most us futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day the day limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous days settlement price at the end of a trading session once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of futures contract no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit the daily limit governs only price movement during a particular trading day and therefore does not limit potential losses because the limit may prevent the liquidation of unfavorable positions futures contract prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and subjecting some investors to substantial losses there can be no assurance that a liquid market will exist at a time when a fund seeks to close out a futures position a fund would continue to be required to meet margin requirements until the position is closed possibly resulting in a decline in the funds net asset value there can be no assurance that an active secondary market will develop or continue to exist the funds will comply with the applicable regulatory requirements of the sec and the cftc with respect to coverage of futures positions by registered investment companies and if the guidelines so require will earmark or set aside cash us government securities high grade liquid debt securities andor other liquid assets permitted by the sec and cftc in a segregated custodial account in the amount prescribed or as may be held by the futures commission merchant or other applicable entity as permitted under the  act securities earmarked or held in a segregated account cannot be sold while the futures position is outstanding unless replaced with other permissible assets and will be markedtomarket daily illiquid securities the funds may invest in illiquid securities ie securities that are not readily marketable for purposes of this restriction illiquid securities include but are not limited to restricted securities securities the disposition of which is restricted under the federal securities laws securities that may only be resold pursuant to rule a under the  act but that are deemed to be illiquid and repurchase agreements with maturities in excess of seven days a fund will not acquire illiquid securities if as a result such securities would comprise more than  of the value of the funds net assets the board of trustees or its delegate has the ultimate authority to determine to the extent permissible under the federal securities laws which securities are liquid or illiquid for purposes of this  limitation the board of trustees has delegated to the subadvisor the daytoday determination of the illiquidity of any security although it has retained oversight for such determinations with respect to rule a securities the factors considered in such a determination may include i the nature of the market for a security including the institutional private resale market the frequency of trades and quotes for the security the number of dealers willing to purchase or sell the security the amount of time normally needed to dispose of the security the method of soliciting offers and the mechanics of transfer ii the terms of certain securities or other instruments allowing for the disposition to a third party or the issuer thereof eg certain repurchase obligations and demand instruments and iii other permissible relevant factors restricted securities may be sold only in privately negotiated transactions or in a public offering with respect to which a registration statement is in effect under the  act where registration is required a  fund may be obligated to pay all or part of the registration expenses and a considerable period may elapse between the time of the decision to sell and the time a fund may be permitted to sell a security under an effective registration statement if during such a period adverse market conditions were to develop a fund might obtain a less favorable price than that which prevailed when it decided to sell illiquid securities will be priced at fair value as determined in good faith under procedures adopted by the board of trustees if through the appreciation of illiquid securities or the depreciation of liquid securities a fund should be in a position where more than  of the value of its net assets are invested in illiquid securities including restricted securities which are not readily marketable a fund will take such steps as is deemed advisable if any to protect liquidity fixed income investments and cash equivalents normally the funds invest substantially all of their assets to meet their investment objectives however for temporary or defensive purposes the funds may invest in fixed income investments and cash equivalents in order to provide income liquidity and preserve capital fixed income investments and cash equivalents held by each fund may include without limitation the types of investments set forth below  a fund may invest in us government securities including bills notes and bonds differing as to maturity and rates of interest which are either issued or guaranteed by the us treasury or by us government agencies or instrumentalities us government securities include securities that are issued or guaranteed by the united states treasury by various agencies of the us government or by various instrumentalities that have been established or sponsored by the us government us treasury securities are backed by the full faith and credit of the united states securities issued or guaranteed by federal agencies and us governmentsponsored instrumentalities may or may not be backed by the full faith and credit of the united states some of the us government agencies that issue or guarantee securities include the exportimport bank of the united states the farmers home administration the federal housing administration the maritime administration the small business administration and the tennessee valley authority an instrumentality of the us government is a government agency organized under federal charter with government supervision instrumentalities issuing or guaranteeing securities include among others the federal home loan banks the federal land banks the central bank for cooperatives federal intermediate credit banks and federal national mortgage association fnma in the case of those us government securities not backed by the full faith and credit of the united states the investor must look principally to the agency or instrumentality issuing or guaranteeing the security for ultimate repayment and may not be able to assert a claim against the united states itself in the event that the agency or instrumentality does not meet its commitment the us government its agencies and instrumentalities do not guarantee the market value of their securities consequently the value of such securities may fluctuate in addition each fund may invest in sovereign debt obligations of nonus countries a sovereign debtors willingness or ability to repay principal and interest in a timely manner may be affected by a number of factors including its cash flow situation the extent of its  nonus reserves the availability of sufficient nonus exchange on the date a payment is due the relative size of the debt service burden to the economy as a whole the sovereign debtors policy toward principal international lenders and the political constraints to which it may be subject  a fund may invest in certificates of deposit issued against funds deposited in a bank or savings and loan association such certificates are for a definite period of time earn a specified rate of return and are normally negotiable if such certificates of deposit are nonnegotiable they will be considered illiquid securities and be subject to a funds  restriction on investments in illiquid securities pursuant to the certificate of deposit the issuer agrees to pay the amount deposited plus interest to the bearer of the certificate on the date specified thereon under current fdic regulations the maximum insurance payable as to any one certificate of deposit is  therefore certificates of deposit purchased by a fund may not be fully insured a fund may only invest in certificates of deposit issued by us banks with at least  billion in assets  a fund may invest in bankers acceptances which are shortterm credit instruments used to finance commercial transactions generally an acceptance is a time draft drawn on a bank by an exporter or an importer to obtain a stated amount of funds to pay for specific merchandise the draft is then accepted by a bank that in effect unconditionally guarantees to pay the face value of the instrument on its maturity date the acceptance may then be held by the accepting bank as an asset or it may be sold in the secondary market at the going rate of interest for a specific maturity  a fund may invest in repurchase agreements which involve purchases of debt securities with counterparties that are deemed by the advisor to present acceptable credit risks in such an action at the time a fund purchases the security it simultaneously agrees to resell and redeliver the security to the seller who also simultaneously agrees to buy back the security at a fixed price and time this assures a predetermined yield for a fund during its holding period since the resale price is always greater than the purchase price and reflects an agreedupon market rate such actions afford an opportunity for a fund to invest temporarily available cash a fund may enter into repurchase agreements only with respect to obligations of the us government its agencies or instrumentalities certificates of deposit or bankers acceptances in which a fund may invest repurchase agreements may be considered loans to the seller collateralized by the underlying securities the risk to a fund is limited to the ability of the seller to pay the agreedupon sum on the repurchase date in the event of default the repurchase agreement provides that the affected fund is entitled to sell the underlying collateral if the value of the collateral declines after the agreement is entered into however and if the seller defaults under a repurchase agreement when the value of the underlying collateral is less than the repurchase price a fund could incur a loss of both principal and interest the portfolio managers monitor the value of the collateral at the time the action is entered into and at all times during the term of the repurchase agreement the portfolio managers do so in an effort to determine that the value of the collateral always equals or exceeds the agreedupon repurchase price to be paid to a fund if the  seller were to be subject to a federal bankruptcy proceeding the ability of a fund to liquidate the collateral could be delayed or impaired because of certain provisions of the bankruptcy laws  a fund may invest in bank time deposits which are monies kept on deposit with banks or savings and loan associations for a stated period of time at a fixed rate of interest there may be penalties for the early withdrawal of such time deposits in which case the yields of these investments will be reduced  a fund may invest in commercial paper which are shortterm unsecured promissory notes including variable rate master demand notes issued by corporations to finance their current operations master demand notes are direct lending arrangements between the fund and a corporation there is no secondary market for the notes however they are redeemable by a fund at any time a funds portfolio managers will consider the financial condition of the corporation eg earning power cash flow and other liquidity ratios and will continuously monitor the corporations ability to meet all of its financial obligations because a funds liquidity might be impaired if the corporation were unable to pay principal and interest on demand a fund may invest in commercial paper only if its has received the highest rating from at least one nationally recognized statistical rating organization or if unrated judged by first trust to be of comparable quality  a fund may invest in shares of money market funds as consistent with its investment objective and policies shares of money market funds are subject to management fees and other expenses of those funds therefore investments in money market funds will cause the fund to bear proportionately the costs incurred by the money market funds operations at the same time a fund will continue to pay its own management fees and expenses with respect to all of its assets including any portion invested in the shares of other investment companies although money market funds that operate in accordance with rule a under the  act seek to preserve a  share price it is possible for the fund to lose money by investing in money market funds delayeddelivery transactions the funds may from time to time purchase securities on a whenissued or other delayeddelivery basis the price of securities purchased in such transactions is fixed at the time the commitment to purchase is made but delivery and payment for the securities take place at a later date during the period between the purchase and settlement a fund does not remit payment to the issuer no interest is accrued on debt securities and dividend income is not earned on equity securities delayeddelivery commitments involve a risk of loss if the value of the security to be purchased declines prior to the settlement date which risk is in addition to the risk of a decline in value of a funds other assets while securities purchased in delayeddelivery transactions may be sold prior to the settlement date the funds intend to purchase such securities with the purpose of actually acquiring them at the time a fund makes the commitment to purchase a security in a delayeddelivery transaction it will record the transaction and reflect the value of the security in determining its net asset value the funds will earmark or maintain in a segregated account cash us government securities and highgrade liquid debt securities equal in value to commitments for delayeddelivery securities such earmarked or segregated  securities will mature or if necessary be sold on or before the settlement date when the time comes to pay for delayeddelivery securities a fund will meet its obligations from thenavailable cash flow sale of the securities earmarked or held in the segregated account described above sale of other securities or although it would not normally expect to do so from the sale of the delayeddelivery securities themselves which may have a market value greater or less than a funds payment obligation although the prospectus and this sai describe certain permitted methods of segregating assets or otherwise covering certain transactions such descriptions are not allinclusive each fund may segregate against or cover such transactions using other methods permitted under the  act the rules and regulations thereunder or orders issued by the sec thereunder for these purposes interpretations and guidance provided by the sec staff may be taken into account when deemed appropriate by a fund hedging strategies the funds may engage in hedging activities and in this regard may utilize forward contracts currency spot transactions and futures contracts the use of futures is not a part of a principal investment strategy of the funds hedging or derivative instruments on securities generally are used to hedge against price movements in one or more particular securities positions that the fund owns or intends to acquire such instruments may also be used to lockin realized but unrecognized gains in the value of portfolio securities hedging instruments on stock indices in contrast generally are used to hedge against price movements in broad market sectors in which the fund has invested or expects to invest hedging strategies if successful can reduce the risk of loss by wholly or partially offsetting the negative effect of unfavorable price movements in the investments being hedged however hedging strategies can also reduce the opportunity for gain by offsetting the positive effect of favorable price movements in the hedged investments the use of hedging instruments is subject to applicable regulations of the sec the several futures exchanges upon which they are traded the commodity futures trading commission the cftc and various state regulatory authorities in addition the funds ability to use hedging instruments may be limited by tax considerations general limitations on derivative transactions the funds limit their direct investments in derivative instruments to the extent necessary for the advisor to claim the exclusion from regulation as a commodity pool operator with respect to each fund under cftc rule  as such rule may be amended from time to time under rule  as currently in effect the funds limit their trading activity in certain derivative instruments excluding activity for bona fide hedging purposes as defined by the cftc such that each meets one of the following tests i aggregate initial margin and premiums required to establish its futures options on futures and swap positions do not exceed  of the liquidation value of the applicable funds portfolio after taking into account unrealized profits and losses on such positions or ii aggregate net notional value of the applicable funds  futures options on futures and swap positions does not exceed  of the liquidation value of the funds portfolio after taking into account unrealized profits and losses on such positions the advisor has filed a notice of eligibility for exclusion from the definition of the term commodity pool operator with respect to each fund with the national futures association the futures industrys selfregulatory organization if first trust were no longer able to claim the exclusion for a fund first trust would be required to register as a commodity pool operator and the fund and first trust would be subject to regulation under the commodity exchange act the cea the foregoing limitations are nonfundamental policies of the funds and may be changed without shareholder approval as regulatory agencies permit portfolio turnover the funds buy and sell portfolio securities in the normal course of their investment activities the proportion of a funds investment portfolio that is bought and sold during a year is known as the funds portfolio turnover rate a turnover rate of  would occur for example if the fund bought and sold securities valued at  of its net assets within one year a high portfolio turnover rate could result in the payment by the fund of increased brokerage costs expenses and taxes lending of portfolio securities in order to generate additional income as a nonprincipal investment strategy first trust is authorized to select certain funds with notice to the board of trustees to lend portfolio securities representing up to  of the value of their total assets to brokerdealers banks or other institutional borrowers of securities as with other extensions of credit there may be risks of delay in recovery of the securities or even loss of rights in the collateral should the borrower of the securities fail financially however the funds will only enter into domestic loan arrangements with brokerdealers banks or other institutions that first trust has determined are creditworthy under guidelines established by the board of trustees the funds will pay a portion of the income earned on the lending transaction to the placing broker and may pay administrative and custodial fees in connection with these loans first trust may select any fund to participate in securities lending program at its discretion with notice to the board of trustees in these loan arrangements the funds will receive collateral in the form of cash us government securities or other high grade debt obligations equal to at least  for domestic securities or  for international securities of the market value of the securities loaned as determined at the time of loan origination this collateral must be valued daily by first trust or the applicable funds lending agent and if the market value of the loaned securities increases the borrower must furnish additional collateral to the fund during the time portfolio securities are on loan the borrower pays the fund any dividends or interest paid on the securities loans are subject to termination at any time by the fund or the borrower while a fund does not have the right to vote securities on loan it would terminate the loan and regain the right to vote if that were considered important with respect to the investment when a fund lends portfolio securities to a borrower payments in lieu of  dividends made by the borrower to the fund will not constitute qualified dividends taxable at the same rate as longterm capital gains even if the actual dividends would have constituted qualified dividends had the fund held the securities investment risks the following risk disclosure supplements the discussion of the funds investment risks that appears in the prospectus overview an investment in a fund should be made with an understanding of the risks that an investment in the funds shares entails including the risk that the financial condition of the issuers of the securities held by the fund or the general condition of the securities market may worsen and the value of the equity securities and therefore the value of the fund may decline a fund may not be an appropriate investment for those who are unable or unwilling to assume the risks involved generally with such an investment the past market and earnings performance of any of the securities included in a fund is not predictive of their future performance common stock risk common stocks are especially susceptible to general stock market movements and to volatile increases and decreases of value as market confidence in and perceptions of the issuers change these perceptions are based on unpredictable factors including expectations regarding government economic monetary and fiscal policies inflation and interest rates economic expansion or contraction and global or regional political economic or banking crises first trust cannot predict the direction or scope of any of these factors shareholders of common stocks have rights to receive payments from the issuers of those common stocks that are generally subordinate to those of creditors of or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks of such issuers shareholders of common stocks of the type held by the funds have a right to receive dividends only when and if and in the amounts declared by the issuers board of directors and have a right to participate in amounts available for distribution by the issuer only after all other claims on the issuer have been paid common stocks do not represent an obligation of the issuer and therefore do not offer any assurance of income or provide the same degree of protection of capital as do debt securities the issuance of additional debt securities or preferred stock will create prior claims for payment of principal interest and dividends which could adversely affect the ability and inclination of the issuer to declare or pay dividends on its common stock or the rights of holders of common stock with respect to assets of the issuer upon liquidation or bankruptcy the value of common stocks is subject to market fluctuations for as long as the common stocks remain outstanding and thus the value of the equity securities in the funds will fluctuate over the life of the funds and may be more or less than the price at which they were purchased by the funds the equity securities held in the funds may appreciate or depreciate in value or pay dividends depending on the full range of economic and market influences  affecting these securities including the impact of a funds purchase and sale of the equity securities and other factors holders of common stocks incur more risk than holders of preferred stocks and debt obligations because common stockholders as owners of the entity have generally inferior rights to receive payments from the issuer in comparison with the rights of creditors of or holders of debt obligations or preferred stocks issued by the issuer cumulative preferred stock dividends must be paid before common stock dividends and any cumulative preferred stock dividend omitted is added to future dividends payable to the holders of cumulative preferred stock preferred stockholders are also generally entitled to rights on liquidation which are senior to those of common stockholders whether or not the equity securities in the funds are listed on a securities exchange the principal trading market for certain of the equity securities in certain of the funds may be in the overthecounter otc market as a result the existence of a liquid trading market for the equity securities may depend on whether dealers will make a market in the equity securities there can be no assurance that a market will be made for any of the equity securities that any market for the equity securities will be maintained or that there will be sufficient liquidity of the equity securities in any markets made the price at which the equity securities are held in the funds will be adversely affected if trading markets for the equity securities are limited or absent cyber security risk as the use of internet technology has become more prevalent in the course of business the fund has become more susceptible to potential operational risks through breaches in cyber security a breach in cyber security refers to both intentional and unintentional events that may cause the fund to lose proprietary information suffer data corruption or lose operational capacity such events could cause the fund to incur regulatory penalties reputational damage additional compliance costs associated with corrective measures andor financial loss cyber security breaches may involve unauthorized access to the funds digital information systems through hacking or malicious software coding but may also result from outside attacks such as denialofservice attacks through efforts to make network services unavailable to intended users in addition cyber security breaches of the funds third party service providers such as its administrator transfer agent custodian or subadvisor as applicable or issuers in which the fund invests can also subject the fund to many of the same risks associated with direct cyber security breaches the fund has established risk management systems designed to reduce the risks associated with cyber security however there is no guarantee that such efforts will succeed especially because the fund does not directly control the cyber security systems of issuers or third party service providers derivatives risk the use of derivatives presents risks different from and possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in traditional securities the use of derivatives can lead to losses because of adverse movements in the price or value of the underlying asset index or rate which may be magnified by certain features of the derivatives in addition when a fund invests in certain  derivative securities including but not limited to whenissued securities forward commitments and futures contracts they are effectively leveraging their investments which could result in exaggerated changes in the net asset value of the funds shares and can result in losses that exceed the amount originally invested the success of the subadvisors derivatives strategies will depend on its ability to assess and predict the impact of market or economic developments on the underlying asset index or rate and the derivative itself without the benefit of observing the performance of the derivative under all possible market conditions liquidity risk exists when a security cannot be purchased or sold at the time desired or cannot be purchased or sold without adversely affecting the price certain specific risks associated with an investment in derivatives may include market risk credit risk correlation risk liquidity risk legal risk and systemic or interconnection risk as specified below  market risk market risk is the risk that the value of the underlying assets may go up or down adverse movements in the value of an underlying asset can expose the funds to losses derivative instruments may include elements of leverage and accordingly fluctuations in the value of the derivative instrument in relation to the underlying asset may be magnified the successful use of derivative instruments depends upon a variety of factors particularly the ability of the portfolio managers to predict correctly market movements or changes in the relationships of such instruments to a funds portfolio holdings and there can be no assurance the judgment of the portfolio managers in this respect will be accurate consequently the use of derivatives for investment or hedging purposes might result in a poorer overall performance for the funds whether or not adjusted for risk than if the funds had not used derivatives  creditcounterparty risk credit risk is the risk that a loss is sustained as a result of the failure of a counterparty to comply with the terms of a derivative instrument the counterparty risk for exchangetraded derivatives is generally lower than for overthecounter derivatives not cleared through a central counterparty since generally a clearing organization provides a guarantee of performance and cleared derivative transactions benefit from daily marktomarket and settlement as well as from segregation and minimum capital requirements applicable to intermediaries for privatelynegotiated instruments not cleared through a central counterparty there are no similar protections in all transactions a fund will bear the risk that the counterparty will default and this could result in a loss of the expected benefit of the derivative transactions and possibly other losses to the fund such counterparty risk is accentuated in the case of contracts with longer maturities where there is a greater risk that a specific event may prevent or delay settlement or where the fund has concentrated its transactions with a single or small group of counterparties the funds are not restricted from dealing with any particular counterparty or from concentrating any or all of its transactions with one counterparty the funds will enter into transactions in derivative instruments only with counterparties that the portfolio managers reasonably believe are capable of performing under the contract  correlation risk correlation risk is the risk that there might be an imperfect correlation or even no correlation between price movements of a derivative instrument and price movements of investments being hedged when a derivative transaction is used to completely hedge  another position changes in the market value of the combined position the derivative instrument plus the position being hedged result from an imperfect correlation between the price movements of the two instruments with a perfect hedge the value of the combined position remains unchanged with any change in the price of the underlying asset with an imperfect hedge the value of the derivative instrument and its hedge are not perfectly correlated for example if the value of a derivative instrument used in a short hedge such as selling a futures contract increased by less than the decline in value of the hedged investments the hedge would not be perfectly correlated this might occur due to factors unrelated to the value of the investments being hedged such as speculative or other pressures on the markets in which these instruments are traded in addition a funds success in using hedging instruments is subject to the ability of the portfolio managers to correctly predict changes in relationships of such hedge instruments to the funds portfolio holdings and there can be no assurance that the judgment of the portfolio managers in this respect will be accurate an imperfect correlation may prevent a fund from achieving the intended hedge or expose the fund to a risk of loss  liquidity risk liquidity risk is the risk that a derivative instrument cannot be sold closed out or replaced quickly at or very close to its fundamental value generally exchange contracts are more liquid than overthecounter transactions the illiquidity of the derivatives markets may be due to various factors including congestion disorderly markets limitations on deliverable supplies the participation of speculators government regulation and intervention and technical and operational or system failures in addition daily limits on price fluctuations and speculative position limits on exchanges on which the funds may conduct their transactions in derivative instruments may prevent prompt liquidation of positions subjecting the funds to the potential of greater losses the funds might be required by applicable regulatory requirements to maintain assets as cover maintain segregated accounts andor make margin payments when they take positions in derivative instruments involving obligations to third parties ie instruments other than purchase options if a fund is unable to close out its positions in such instruments it might be required to continue to maintain such accounts or make such payments until the position expires matures or is closed out these requirements might impair the funds ability to sell a security or make an investment at a time when it would otherwise be favorable to do so or require that the fund sell a portfolio security at a disadvantageous time the funds ability to sell or close out a position in an instrument prior to expiration or maturity depends upon the existence of a liquid secondary market or in the absence of such a market the ability and willingness of a counterparty to enter into a transaction closing out the position due to liquidity risk there is no assurance that any derivatives position can be sold or closed out at a time and price that is favorable to the funds  legal risk legal risk is the risk of loss caused by the unenforceability of a partys obligations under the derivative while a party seeking price certainty agrees to surrender the potential upside in exchange for downside protection the party taking the risk is looking for a positive payoff despite this voluntary assumption of risk a  counterparty that has lost money in a derivative transaction may try to avoid payment by exploiting various legal uncertainties about certain derivative products  volatility the prices of many derivative instruments are highly volatile price movements of such instruments may be influenced by among other things interest rates changing supply and demand relationships trade fiscal monetary and exchange control programs and policies of governments and national and international political and economic events and policies the value of such instruments also may depend upon the price of the securities or currencies underlying them  systemic or interconnection risk systemic or interconnection risk is the risk that a disruption in the financial markets will cause difficulties for all market participants in other words a disruption in one market will spill over into other markets perhaps creating a chain reaction much of the overthecounter derivatives market takes place among the overthecounter dealers themselves thus creating a large interconnected web of financial obligations this interconnectedness raises the possibility that a default by one large dealer could create losses for other dealers and destabilize the entire market for overthecounter derivative instruments emerging markets risk investments in securities of issuers located in emerging market countries are considered speculative and are subject to greater levels of nonus securities risk than investments in more developed nonus markets heightened risks of investing in emerging markets securities include i smaller market capitalization of securities markets which may suffer periods of relative illiquidity ii significant price volatility iii restrictions on foreign investment iv possible repatriation of investment income and capital v increased risk of default including both government and private issuers vi greater social economic and political uncertainty and instability including the risk of war vii more substantial governmental involvement in the economy viii less governmental supervision and regulation of the securities markets and participants in those markets ix unavailability of currency hedging techniques in certain emerging market countries and x the fact that companies in emerging market countries may be newly organized smaller and less seasoned furthermore foreign investors may be required to register the proceeds of sales and future economic or political crises could lead to price controls forced mergers expropriation or confiscatory taxation seizure nationalization or creation of government monopolies the currencies of emerging market countries may experience significant declines against the us dollar and devaluation may occur subsequent to investments in these currencies by the funds inflation and rapid fluctuations in inflation rates have had and may continue to have negative effects on the economies and securities markets of certain emerging market countries foreign currency risk the funds will engage in practices and strategies that will result in exposure to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates thus subjecting the funds to foreign currency risk the funds exposure to foreign currencies or in securities or instruments that trade or receive revenues in foreign currencies are subject to the risk that those currencies will decline in value relative to  the us dollar or in the case of hedging positions that the us dollar will decline in value relative to the currency being hedged currency rates in foreign countries may fluctuate significantly over short periods of time for a number of reasons including the forces of supply and demand in the nonus exchange markets actual or perceived changes in interest rates rates of inflation balance of payments and governmental surpluses or deficits intervention or the failure to intervene by us or foreign governments central banks or supranational entities such as the international monetary fund or by the imposition of currency controls or other political developments in the united states or abroad these fluctuations may have a significant adverse impact on the value of a funds portfolio andor the level of fund distributions made to its common shareholders the funds will seek to hedge exposure to reduce the risk of loss due to fluctuations in currency exchange rates there is no assurance however that these strategies will be available or will be successful and the funds will incur costs associated with such strategies currency transactions are subject to risks different from those of other portfolio transactions because currency control is of great importance to the issuing governments and influences economic planning and policy purchases and sales of currency and related instruments can be negatively affected by government exchange controls blockages and manipulations or exchange restrictions imposed by governments these can result in losses if the funds are unable to deliver or receive currency or funds in settlement of obligations and could also cause hedges they have entered into to be rendered useless resulting in full currency exposure as well as incurring transactions costs currency exchange rates may fluctuate based on factors extrinsic to that countrys economy geographic concentration risk the funds may invest from time to time a substantial amount of their assets in issuers located in a single country or region investments in a single region although representing a number of different countries within the region may be affected by common economic forces and other factors because the funds may concentrate their investments in this manner it assumes the risk that economic political and social conditions in those countries will have a significant impact on their investment performance market disruption and geopolitical risk some countries in which the funds invest have experienced security concerns war or threats of war and aggression terrorism economic uncertainty natural and environmental disasters andor systemic market dislocations that have led and in the future may lead to increased short term market volatility and may have adverse long term effects on the economies and markets of such countries generally each of which may negatively impact the funds investments for example there have been various events throughout europe including russias annexation of crimea and the resulting sanctions against russia ongoing tension between russia and ukraine and the political uncertainty and market turmoil in greece that have recently had and may continue to have an adverse impact on european and global markets it is possible for instance that the events occurring in russia could result in among other things russia withholding its natural gas supply from other european countries which has the potential to harm the economies and markets of such countries the events occurring in one country or region may spread through or otherwise affect  other countries and regions and therefore adversely impact the funds investments in such countries and regions in addition the terrorist attacks in the us on september   had a disruptive effect on the securities markets the ongoing us military and related action throughout the world as well as the continuing threat of terrorist attacks could have significant adverse effects on the us economy the stock market and world economies and markets generally a similar disruption of financial markets or other terrorist attacks could adversely affect fund service providers andor the funds operations as well as interest rates secondary trading credit risk inflation and other factors relating to the common shares of the funds a fund cannot predict the effects or likelihood of similar events in the future on the us and world economies the value of its common shares or the nav of the fund nonus securities risk investing in securities of nonus issuers which are generally denominated in nonus currencies may involve certain risks not typically associated with investing in securities of us issuers these risks include i there may be less publicly available information about nonus issuers or markets due to less rigorous disclosure or accounting standards or regulatory practices as nonus companies are generally not subject to the same accounting auditing and financial reporting standards as are us companies ii nonus markets may be smaller less liquid and more volatile than the us market iii potential adverse effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates or controls on the value of the funds investments iv the economies of nonus countries may grow at slower rates than expected or may experience a downturn or recession v the impact of economic political social or diplomatic events including the risk of adverse political developments nationalization military unrest social instability war and terrorism confiscation without fair compensation expropriation or confiscatory taxation limitations on the movement of funds and other assets between different countries or diplomatic developments vi certain nonus countries may impose restrictions on the ability of nonus issuers to make payments of principal and interest to investors located in the united states due to blockage of nonus currency exchanges or otherwise and vii withholding and other nonus taxes may decrease a funds return action by these governments could have a significant effect on market prices of securities and dividend payments in the event of nationalization expropriation or other confiscation the funds could lose their entire investment in nonus securities in addition to the foregoing risks there may be difficulty in obtaining or enforcing a court judgment abroad these risks may be more pronounced to the extent that the funds invest a significant amount of their assets in companies located in one region or in emerging markets as described above governments in certain foreign countries continue to participate to a significant degree through ownership interest or regulation in their respective economies furthermore many countries throughout the world are dependent on a healthy us economy and are adversely affected when the us economy weakens or its markets decline additionally many foreign country economies are heavily dependent on international trade and are adversely affected by protective trade barriers and economic conditions of their trading partners protectionist trade legislation enacted by those trading partners could have a significant adverse affect on the securities markets of those countries individual foreign economies may differ favorably or unfavorably from the us economy in such respects as growth of gross national product rate of inflation capital reinvestment resource selfsufficiency and balance of payments position  fixed commissions on foreign securities exchanges are generally higher than negotiated commissions on us exchanges although the funds endeavor to achieve the most favorable net results on its portfolio transactions there is generally less government supervision and regulation of foreign securities exchanges brokers dealers and listed and unlisted companies than in the united states and the legal remedies for investors may be more limited than the remedies available in the united states for example there may be no comparable provisions under certain foreign laws to insider trading and similar investor protections that apply with respect to securities transactions consummated in the united states mail service between the united states and foreign countries may be slower or less reliable than within the united states thus increasing the risk of delayed settlement of portfolio transactions or loss of certificates for portfolio securities foreign markets also have different clearance and settlement procedures and in certain markets there have been times when settlements have been unable to keep pace with the volume of securities transactions making it difficult to conduct such transactions such delays in settlement could result in temporary periods when some of the funds assets are uninvested and no return is earned on such assets the inability of a fund to make intended security purchases due to settlement problems could cause the fund to miss attractive investment opportunities inability to dispose of portfolio securities due to settlement problems could result either in losses to the funds due to subsequent declines in value of the portfolio securities or if the funds have entered into a contract to sell the securities in possible liability to the purchaser passive foreign investment companies risk a fund may invest in companies that are considered to be passive foreign investment companies pfics which are generally certain nonus corporations that receive at least  of their annual gross income from passive sources such as interest dividends certain rents and royalties or capital gains or that hold at least  of their assets in investments producing such passive income therefore the fund could be subject to us federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity interests even if all the income or gain is distributed to its shareholders in a timely manner a fund will not be able to pass through to its shareholders any credit or deduction for such taxes real estate investment trust risk reits are financial vehicles that pool investors capital to purchase or finance real estate reits may concentrate their investments in specific geographic areas or in specific property types eg hotels shopping malls residential complexes and office buildings the market value of reit shares and the ability of the reits to distribute income may be adversely affected by several factors including i rising interest rates ii changes in the economic climate and real estate conditions iii perceptions of prospective tenants of the safety convenience and attractiveness of the properties iv the ability of the owners to provide adequate management maintenance and insurance v the cost of complying with local laws vi increased competition from new properties vii the impact of present or future environmental legislation and compliance with environmental laws viii changes in real estate taxes and other operating expenses ix adverse changes in governmental rules and fiscal policies x adverse changes in zoning laws and xi other  factors beyond the control of the reits including changes in tax laws in addition distributions received by the funds from reits may consist of dividends capital gains andor return of capital many of these distributions however when further distributed to shareholders will not generally qualify for favorable treatment as qualified dividend income certain reits have relatively small market capitalizations as such reits may have limited financial resources and their securities may trade less frequently and in limited volume and may be subject to more abrupt or erratic price movements than larger company securities furthermore reits are dependent upon specialized management skills and have limited diversification reits are also subject to heavy cash flow dependency defaults by borrowers or lessees and the possibility of failing to qualify for favorable tax treatment by investing in reits indirectly through a fund a shareholder will bear not only his or her proportionate share of the expenses of the fund but also indirectly similar expenses of the reits in addition reits depend generally on their ability to generate cash flow to make distributions to shareholders reits may incur significant amounts of leverage management of the funds trustees and officers the general supervision of the duties performed for the funds under the investment management agreement is the responsibility of the board of trustees there are five trustees of the trust one of whom is an

the advisor is the responsibility of the board of trustees the trustees of the trust set broad policies for the funds choose the trusts officers and hire the funds investment advisor and other service providers the officers of the trust manage the day today operations and are responsible to the trusts board the trusts board is composed of four independent trustees and one interested trustee the interested trustee james a bowen serves as the chairman of the board for each fund in the first trust fund complex the same five persons serve as trustees on the trusts board and on the boards of all other first trust funds the unitary board structure was adopted for the first trust funds because of the efficiencies it achieves with respect to the governance and oversight of the first trust funds each first trust fund is subject to the rules and regulations of the  act and other applicable securities laws which means that many of the first trust funds face similar issues with respect to certain of their fundamental activities including risk management portfolio liquidity portfolio valuation and financial reporting because of the similar and often overlapping issues facing the first trust funds including among the first trust exchangetraded funds the board of the first trust funds believes that maintaining a unitary board structure promotes efficiency and consistency in the governance and oversight of all first trust funds and reduces the costs administrative burdens and possible conflicts that may result from having multiple boards in adopting a unitary board structure the trustees seek to provide effective governance through establishing a board the overall composition of which will as a body possess the appropriate skills diversity independence and experience to oversee the funds business annually the board reviews its governance structure and the committee structures their performance and functions and it reviews any processes that would enhance board governance over the funds business the board has determined that its leadership structure including the unitary board and committee structure is appropriate based on the characteristics of the funds it serves and the characteristics of the first trust fund complex as a whole in order to streamline communication between the advisor and the independent trustees and create certain efficiencies the board has a lead independent trustee who is responsible for i coordinating activities of the independent trustees ii working with the advisor fund counsel and the  independent legal counsel to the independent trustees to determine the agenda for board meetings iii serving as the principal contact for and facilitating communication between the independent trustees and the funds service providers particularly the advisor and iv any other duties that the independent trustees may delegate to the lead independent trustee the lead independent trustee is selected by the independent trustees and serves a three year term or until his or her successor is selected the board has established four standing committees as described below and has delegated certain of its responsibilities to those committees the board and its committees meet frequently throughout the year to oversee the funds activities review contractual arrangements with and performance of service providers oversee compliance with regulatory requirements and review fund performance the independent trustees are represented by independent legal counsel at all board and committee meetings other than meetings of the executive

to more than one fund or other account more specifically portfolio managers who manage multiple funds andor other accounts may be presented with one or more of the potential conflicts described below the management of multiple funds andor other accounts may result in a portfolio manager devoting unequal time and attention to the management of each fund andor other account the subadvisor seeks to manage such competing interests for the time and attention of a portfolio manager by having the portfolio manager focus on a particular investment discipline most other accounts managed by a portfolio manager are managed using a similar investment model that is used in connection with the management of the funds the funds are expected to be included as part of a broader investment program developed by the subadvisor and managed by the portfolio managers the portfolio managers will be required to satisfy their duties to both the funds and the accounts that invest in these broader programs conflicts may potentially arise when the portfolio managers attempt to satisfy the needs of each type of customer the subadvisor has developed procedures to address these potential conflicts if a portfolio manager identifies a limited investment opportunity that may be suitable for more than one fund or other account a fund may not be able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to an allocation of filled purchase or sale orders across all eligible funds and other accounts to deal with these situations the subadvisor has adopted procedures for allocating  portfolio transactions across multiple accounts however first trust will be responsible for effecting all security transactions for the funds assets and in placing orders for the sale and purchase of securities for the funds first trust will be responsible for seeking the best execution of such orders with respect to securities transactions for the funds first trust determines which broker to use to execute each order consistent with its duty to seek best execution of the transaction however with respect to certain other accounts such as mutual funds for which the subadvisor acts as subadvisor other pooled investment vehicles that are not registered mutual funds and other accounts managed for organizations and individuals the subadvisor may be limited by the client with respect to the selection of brokers or may be instructed to direct trades through a particular broker in these cases trades for the fund in a particular security may be placed separately from rather than aggregated with such other accounts having separate transactions with respect to a security may temporarily affect the market price of the security or the execution of the transaction or both to the possible detriment of the fund or other accounts involved the subadvisor the advisor and the funds have adopted certain compliance procedures that are designed to address these types of conflicts however there is no guarantee that such procedures will detect each and every situation in which a conflict arises the subadvisory agreement the subadvisor subject to the board of trustees and advisors supervision provides the funds with discretionary investment services specifically the subadvisor is responsible for managing the investments of the fund in accordance with the funds investment objectives policies and restrictions as provided in the prospectus and this sai as may be subsequently changed by the board of trustees and communicated to the subadvisor in writing the subadvisor further agrees

fiduciary duties it may have to the funds will monitor the funds investments and will comply with the provisions of the trusts declaration of trust and bylaws as amended from time to time and the stated investment objective policies and restrictions of the funds first trust is responsible for effecting all security transactions for the funds assets the subadvisory agreement provides that the subadvisor shall generally not be liable for any loss suffered by the funds or the advisor including without limitation by reason of the purchase sale or retention of any security in connection with the performance of the subadvisors duties under the subadvisory agreement except for a loss resulting from willful misfeasance bad faith or gross negligence on the part of the subadvisor in performance of its duties under the subadvisory agreement or by reason of its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties under the subadvisory agreement pursuant to the subadvisory agreement among the advisor the subadvisor and the fund the advisor has agreed to pay for the services and facilities provided by the subadvisor through subadvisory fees as set forth in the funds prospectus  the subadvisory agreement may be terminated without the payment of any penalty by first trust the board of trustees or a majority of the outstanding voting securities of the funds as defined in the  act upon  days written notice to the subadvisor all fees and expenses are accrued daily and deducted before payment of dividends to investors the subadvisory agreement has been approved by the board of trustees including a majority of the independent trustees of the funds and the initial shareholder of the funds brokerage allocations first trust is responsible for decisions to buy and sell securities for the funds and for the placement of the funds securities business the negotiation of the commissions to be paid on brokered transactions the prices for principal trades in securities and the allocation of portfolio brokerage and principal business it is the policy of first trust to seek the best execution at the best security price available with respect to each transaction and with respect to brokered transactions in light of the overall quality of brokerage and research services provided to first trust and its clients the best price to a fund means the best net price without regard to the mix between purchase or sale price and commission if any purchases may be made from underwriters dealers and on occasion the issuers commissions will be paid on the funds futures and options transactions if any the purchase price of portfolio securities purchased from an underwriter or dealer may include underwriting commissions and dealer spreads the funds may pay markups on principal transactions in selecting brokerdealers and in negotiating commissions first trust considers among other things the firms reliability the quality of its execution services on a continuing basis and its financial condition fund portfolio transactions may be effected with brokerdealers who have assisted investors in the purchase of shares section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the  act permits an investment advisor under certain circumstances to cause an account to pay a broker or dealer who supplies brokerage and research services a commission for effecting a transaction in excess of the amount of commission another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the transaction brokerage and research services include a furnishing advice as to the value of securities the advisability of investing purchasing or selling securities and the availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of securities b furnishing analyses and reports concerning issuers industries securities economic factors and trends portfolio strategy and the performance of accounts and c effecting securities transactions and performing functions incidental thereto such as clearance settlement and custody such brokerage and research services are often referred to as soft dollars first trust may use soft dollars on a limited basis notwithstanding the foregoing in selecting brokers the first trust may in the future consider investment and market information and other research such as economic securities and performance measurement research provided by such brokers and the quality and reliability of brokerage services including execution capability performance and financial responsibility accordingly the commissions charged by any such broker may be greater than the amount another firm might charge if first trust determines in good faith that the amount of such commissions is reasonable in relation to the value of the research information and brokerage services provided by such broker to the first trust or the trust in addition first trust must determine that the research  information received in this manner provides the funds with benefits by supplementing the research otherwise available to the funds the investment management agreement provides that such higher commissions will not be paid by the funds unless first trust determines in good faith that the amount is reasonable in relation to the services provided the investment advisory fees paid by the funds to first trust under the investment management agreement would not be reduced as a result of receipt by first trust of research services the first trust places portfolio transactions for other advisory accounts advised by it and research services furnished by firms through which the funds effect their securities transactions may be used by first trust in servicing all of its accounts not all of such services may be used by first trust in connection with the funds first trust believes it is not possible to measure separately the benefits from research services to each of the accounts including the funds advised by it because the volume and nature of the trading activities of the accounts are not uniform the amount of commissions in excess of those charged by another broker paid by each account for brokerage and research services will vary however first trust believes such costs to the funds will not be disproportionate to the benefits received by the funds on a continuing basis first trust seeks to allocate portfolio transactions equitably whenever concurrent decisions are made to purchase or sell securities by the funds and another advisory account in some cases this procedure could have an adverse effect on the price or the amount of securities available to the funds in making such allocations between the funds and other advisory accounts the main factors considered by first trust are the respective investment objectives the relative size of portfolio holding of the same or comparable securities the availability of cash for investment and the size of investment commitments generally held custodian administrator fund

participant agreement and must comply with the applicable provisions of such participant agreement investors other than aps are responsible for making arrangements for a redemption request to be made through an authorized participant an order to redeem creation unit aggregations of a fund is deemed received by the trust on the transmittal date if i such order is received by bbh in its capacity as transfer agent not later than the closing time on the transmittal date ii such order is accompanied or followed by the requisite number of shares of a fund specified in such order which delivery must be made through dtc to bbh and iii all other procedures set forth in the participant agreement are properly followed deliveries of fund securities to investors are generally expected to be made within three business days due to the schedule of holidays in certain countries however the delivery of inkind redemption proceeds for the fund may take longer than three business days after the day on which the redemption request is received in proper form in such cases the local market settlement procedures will not commence until the end of the local holiday periods see below for a list of the local holidays in the foreign countries relevant to the fund under the  act the fund would generally be required to make payment of redemption proceeds within seven days after a security is tendered for redemption however because the settlement of redemptions of fund shares is  contingent not only on the settlement cycle of the united states securities markets but also on delivery cycles of foreign markets pursuant to an exemptive order on which the fund may rely the funds inkind redemption proceeds must be paid within the maximum number of calendar days required for such payment or satisfaction in the principal local markets where transactions in portfolio securities customarily clear and settle but generally no later than twelve calendar days following tender of a creation unit aggregation in connection with taking delivery of shares of nonus fund securities upon redemption of shares of the fund a redeeming beneficial owner or ap acting on behalf of such beneficial owner must maintain appropriate security arrangements with a qualified brokerdealer bank or other custody provider in each jurisdiction in which any of the fund securities are customarily traded to which account such fund securities will be delivered to the extent contemplated by a participant agreement in the event the authorized participant has submitted a redemption request in proper form but is unable to transfer all or part of the creation unit aggregation to be redeemed to the funds transfer agent the transfer agent may nonetheless accept the redemption request in reliance on the undertaking by the authorized participant to deliver the missing shares as soon as possible such undertaking shall be secured by the authorized participants delivery and maintenance of collateral consisting of cash having a value marked to market daily at least equal to  which first trust may change from time to time of the value of the missing shares the current procedures for collateralization of missing shares require among other things that any cash collateral shall be in the form of us dollars in immediately available funds and shall be held by bbh and marked to market daily and that the fees of bbh and any subcustodians in respect of the delivery maintenance and redelivery of the cash collateral shall be payable by the authorized participant if the participant agreement provides for collateralization it will permit the trust on behalf of the affected fund to purchase the missing shares at any time and will subject the authorized participant to liability for any shortfall between the cost to the trust of purchasing such shares and the value of the collateral the calculation of the value of the fund securities and the cash redemption amount to be deliveredreceived upon redemption will be made by bbh according to the procedures set forth in this sai under determination of net asset value computed on the business day on which a redemption order is deemed received by the trust therefore if a redemption order in proper form is submitted to bbh by a dtc participant not later than closing time on the transmittal date and the requisite number of shares of the fund are delivered to bbh prior to the specified time then the value of the fund securities and the cash redemption amount to be delivered will be determined by bbh on such transmittal date if however a redemption order is submitted to bbh by a dtc participant not later than the closing time on the transmittal date but either i the requisite number of shares of the relevant fund are not delivered by the specified time as described above on such transmittal date or ii the redemption order is not submitted in proper form then the redemption order will not be deemed received as of the transmittal date in such case the value of the fund securities and the cash redemption amount to be deliveredreceived will be computed on the business day that such order is deemed received by the trust  ie the business day on which the shares of the fund are delivered through dtc to bbh by the specified time on such business day pursuant to a properly submitted redemption order if it is not possible to effect deliveries of the fund securities the trust may in its discretion exercise its option to redeem such fund shares in cash and the redeeming beneficial owner will be required to receive its redemption proceeds in cash in addition an investor may request a redemption in cash that the fund may in its sole discretion permit in either case the investor will receive a cash payment equal to the net asset value of its fund shares based on the net asset value of shares of the relevant fund next determined after the redemption request is received in proper form minus a redemption transaction fee and additional charges for requested cash redemptions specified above to offset the trusts brokerage and other transaction costs associated with the disposition of fund securities a fund may also in its sole discretion upon request of a shareholder provide such redeemer cash in lieu of some securities added to the cash redemption amount but in no event will the total value of the securities delivered and the cash transmitted differ from the net asset value redemptions of fund shares for fund securities will be subject to compliance with applicable federal and state securities laws and the fund whether or not it otherwise permits cash redemptions reserves the right to redeem creation unit aggregations for cash to the extent that the trust could not lawfully deliver specific fund securities upon redemptions or could not do so without first registering the fund securities under such laws an authorized participant or an investor for which it is acting subject to a legal restriction with respect to a particular stock included in the fund securities applicable to the redemption of a creation unit aggregation may be paid an equivalent amount of cash the authorized participant may request the redeeming beneficial owner of the fund shares to complete an order form or to enter into agreements with respect to such matters as compensating cash payment beneficial ownership of shares or delivery instructions because the portfolio securities of the funds may trade on the relevant exchanges on days that the listing exchange for a fund is closed or that are otherwise not business days for such fund shareholders may not be able to redeem their shares of such fund or purchase and sell shares of such fund on the listing exchange for a fund on days when the net asset value of such fund could be significantly affected by events in the relevant foreign markets regular holidays each fund generally intends to effect deliveries of creation units and securities in its portfolio portfolio securities on a basis of t plus three business days ie days on which the nyse is open a fund may effect deliveries of creation units and portfolio securities on a basis other than t plus three in order to accommodate local holiday schedules to account for different treatment among nonus and us markets of dividend record dates and exdividend dates or under certain other circumstances the ability of the trust to effect inkind creations and redemptions within three business days of receipt of an order in good form is subject among other things to the condition that within the time period from the date of the order to the date of delivery of the securities there are no days that are holidays in the applicable foreign market for every occurrence of one or more intervening holidays in the applicable nonus market that are not holidays observed in the  us equity market the redemption settlement cycle will be extended by the number of such intervening holidays in addition to holidays other unforeseeable closings in a nonus market due to emergencies may also prevent the trust from delivering securities within the normal settlement period the longest redemption cycle for a fund is a function of the longest redemption cycle among the countries whose securities comprise the fund the securities delivery cycles currently practicable for transferring portfolio securities to redeeming investors coupled with nonus market holiday schedules will require a delivery process longer than seven calendar days for some fund in certain circumstances in no event however will the fund take more than twelve calendar days from the date of the tender to deliver the redemption proceeds the holidays applicable to a fund during such periods are listed below certain holidays may occur on different dates in subsequent years the proclamation of new holidays the treatment by market participants of certain days as informal holidays eg days on which no or limited securities transactions occur as a result of substantially shortened trading hours the elimination of existing holidays or changes in local securities delivery practices could

federal tax matters this section summarizes some of the main us federal income tax consequences of owning shares of a fund this section is current as of the date of the sai tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state local or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the funds the internal revenue service could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the funds this may not be sufficient for prospective investors to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment prospective investors should seek advice based on their individual circumstances from their own tax advisor each fund intends to qualify annually and to elect to be treated as a regulated investment company under the internal revenue code of  as amended the code to qualify for the favorable us federal income tax treatment generally accorded to regulated investment companies each fund must among other things i derive in each taxable year at least  of its gross income from dividends interest payments with respect to securities loans and gains from the sale or other disposition of stock securities or foreign currencies or other income derived with respect to its business of investing in such stock securities or currencies or net income derived from interests in certain publicly traded partnerships ii diversify its holdings so that at the end of each quarter of the taxable year i at least  of the market value of each funds assets is represented by cash and cash items including receivables us government securities the securities of other regulated investment companies and other securities with such other securities of any one issuer generally limited for the purposes of this calculation to an amount not greater than  of the value of each funds total assets and not greater than  of the outstanding voting securities of such issuer and ii not more than  of the value of its total assets is invested in the securities other than us government securities or the securities of other regulated investment companies of any one issuer or  two or more issuers which a fund controls which are engaged in the same similar or related trades or businesses or the securities of one or more of certain publicly traded partnerships and iii distribute at least  of its investment company taxable income which includes among other items dividends interest and net shortterm capital gains in excess of net longterm capital losses and at least  of its net taxexempt interest income each taxable year there are certain exceptions for failure to qualify if the failure is for reasonable cause or is de minimis and certain corrective action is taken and certain tax payments are made by the fund as a regulated investment company the funds generally will not be subject to us federal income tax on their investment company taxable income as that term is defined in the code but without regard to the deduction for dividends paid and net capital gain the excess of net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss if any that they distribute to shareholders each fund intends to distribute to its shareholders at least annually substantially all of its investment company taxable income and net capital gain if a fund retains any net capital gain or investment company taxable income it will generally be subject to federal income tax at regular corporate rates on the amount retained in addition amounts not distributed on a timely basis in accordance with a calendar year distribution requirement are subject to a nondeductible  excise tax unless generally each fund distributes during each calendar year an amount equal to the sum of  at least  of its ordinary income not taking into account any capital gains or losses for the calendar year  at least  of its capital gains in excess of its capital losses adjusted for certain ordinary losses for the oneyear period ending october  of the calendar year and  any ordinary income and capital gains for previous years that were not distributed during those years in order to prevent application of the excise tax the funds intend to make its distributions in accordance with the calendar year distribution requirement a distribution will be treated as paid on december  of the current calendar year if it is declared by a fund in october november or december with a record date in such a month and paid by the fund during january of the following calendar year such distributions will be taxable to shareholders in the calendar year in which the distributions are declared rather than the calendar year in which the distributions are received subject to certain reasonable cause and de minimis exceptions if a fund fails to qualify as a regulated investment company or fails to satisfy the  distribution requirement in any taxable year the fund would be taxed as an ordinary corporation on its taxable income even if such income were distributed to its shareholders and all distributions out of earnings and profits would be taxed to shareholders as ordinary income distributions dividends paid out of the funds investment company taxable income are generally taxable to a shareholder as ordinary income to the extent of the funds earnings and profits whether paid in cash or reinvested in additional shares however certain ordinary income distributions received from a fund may be taxed at capital gains tax rates in particular ordinary income dividends received by an individual shareholder from a regulated investment company such as the fund are generally taxed at the same rates that apply to net capital gain provided that certain holding period requirements are satisfied and provided the dividends are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the fund itself dividends received by the fund from reits and foreign corporations  are qualifying dividends eligible for this lower tax rate only in certain circumstances the fund will provide notice to its shareholders of the amount of any distributions that may be taken into account as a dividend which is eligible for the capital gains tax rates the fund cannot make any guarantees as to the amount of any distribution which will be regarded as a qualifying dividend income from a fund may also be subject to a  medicare tax this tax generally applies to net investment income if the taxpayers adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals a corporation that owns shares generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to many dividends received from the funds because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies however certain ordinary income dividends on shares that are attributable to qualifying dividends received by the funds from certain domestic corporations may be reported by the funds as being eligible for the dividends received deduction distributions of net capital gain the excess of net longterm capital gain over net shortterm capital loss if any properly reported as capital gain dividends are taxable to a shareholder as longterm capital gains regardless of how long the shareholder has held fund shares shareholders receiving distributions in the form of additional shares rather than cash generally will have a tax basis in each such share equal to the value of a share of a fund on the reinvestment date a distribution of an amount in excess of a funds current and accumulated earnings and profits will be treated by a shareholder as a return of capital which is applied against and reduces the shareholders basis in his or her shares to the extent that the amount of any such distribution exceeds the shareholders basis in his or her shares the excess will be treated by the shareholder as gain from a sale or exchange of the shares shareholders will be notified annually as to the us federal income tax status of distributions and shareholders receiving distributions in the form of additional shares will receive a report as to the value of those shares sale or exchange of fund shares upon the sale or other disposition of shares of the funds which a shareholder holds as a capital asset such shareholder may realize a capital gain or loss which will be longterm or shortterm depending upon the shareholders holding period for the shares generally a shareholders gain or loss will be a longterm gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year any loss realized on a sale or exchange will be disallowed to the extent that shares disposed of are replaced including through reinvestment of dividends within a period of  days beginning  days before and ending  days after disposition of shares or to the extent that the shareholder during such period acquires or enters into an option or contract to acquire substantially identical stock or securities in such a case the basis of the  shares acquired will be adjusted to reflect the disallowed loss any loss realized by a shareholder on a disposition of fund shares held by the shareholder for six months or less will be treated as a longterm capital loss to the extent of any distributions of longterm capital gain received by the shareholder with respect to such shares taxes on purchase and redemption of creation units if a shareholder exchanges equity securities for creation units the shareholder will generally recognize a gain or a loss the gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the market value of the creation units at the time and the shareholders aggregate basis in the securities surrendered and the cash component paid if a shareholder exchanges creation units for equity securities then the shareholder will generally recognize a gain or loss equal to the difference between the shareholders basis in the creation units and the aggregate market value of the securities received and the cash redemption amount the internal revenue service however may assert that a loss realized upon an exchange of securities for creation units or creation units for securities cannot be deducted currently under the rules governing wash sales or on the basis that there has been no significant change in economic position nature of funds investments certain of the funds investment practices are subject to special and complex federal income tax provisions that may among other things i disallow suspend or otherwise limit the allowance of certain losses or deductions ii convert lower taxed longterm capital gain into higher taxed shortterm capital gain or ordinary income iii convert an ordinary loss or a deduction into a capital loss the deductibility of which is more limited iv cause the funds to recognize income or gain without a corresponding receipt of cash v adversely affect the time as to when a purchase or sale of stock or securities is deemed to occur and vi adversely alter the characterization of certain complex financial transactions futures contracts and options the funds transactions in futures contracts and options will be subject to special provisions of the code that among other things may affect the character of gains and losses realized by the funds ie may affect whether gains or losses are ordinary or capital or shortterm or longterm may accelerate recognition of income to the funds and may defer fund losses these rules could therefore affect the character amount and timing of distributions to shareholders these provisions also i will require the funds to marktomarket certain types of the positions in its portfolio ie treat them as if they were closed out and ii may cause the funds to recognize income without receiving cash with which to make distributions in amounts necessary to satisfy the  distribution requirement for qualifying to be taxed as a regulated investment company and the distribution requirements for avoiding excise taxes  investments in certain foreign corporations if a fund holds an equity interest in any pfics which are generally certain foreign corporations that receive at least  of their annual gross income from passive sources such as interest dividends certain rents and royalties or capital gains or that hold at least  of their assets in investments producing such passive income the fund could be subject to us federal income tax and additional interest charges on gains and certain distributions with respect to those equity interests even if all the income or gain is timely distributed to its shareholders a fund will not be able to pass through to its shareholders any credit or deduction for such taxes a fund may be able to make an election that could ameliorate these adverse tax consequences in this case a fund would recognize as ordinary income any increase in the value of such pfic shares and as ordinary loss any decrease in such value to the extent it did not exceed prior increases included in income under this election a fund might be required to recognize in a year income in excess of its distributions from pfics and its proceeds from dispositions of pfic stock during that year and such income would nevertheless be subject to the distribution requirement and would be taken into account for purposes of the  excise tax described above dividends paid by pfics are not treated as qualified dividend income backup withholding the funds may be required to withhold us federal income tax from all taxable distributions and sale proceeds payable to shareholders who fail to provide the funds with their correct taxpayer identification number or fail to make required certifications or who have been notified by the internal revenue service that they are subject to backup withholding corporate shareholders and certain other shareholders specified in the code generally are exempt from such backup withholding this withholding is not an additional tax any amounts withheld may be credited against the shareholders us federal income tax liability nonus shareholders us taxation of a shareholder who as to the united states is a nonresident alien individual a foreign trust or estate a foreign corporation or foreign partnership nonus shareholder depends on whether the income of a fund is effectively connected with a us trade or business carried on by the shareholder in addition to the rules described in this section concerning the potential imposition of withholding on distributions to nonus persons distributions to nonus persons that are financial institutions may be subject to a withholding tax of  unless an agreement is in place between the financial institution and the us treasury to collect and disclose information about accounts equity investments or debt interests in the financial institution held by one or more us persons or the institution is resident in a jurisdiction that has entered into such an agreement with the us treasury for these purposes a financial institution means any entity that i accepts deposits in the ordinary course of a banking or similar business ii holds financial assets for the account of others as a substantial portion of its business or iii is engaged or holds itself out as being engaged primarily in the business of investing reinvesting or trading in securities partnership interests commodities or any interest including a futures contract or option  in such securities partnership interests or commodities dispositions of shares by such persons may be subject to such withholding after december   distributions to nonfinancial nonus entities other than publicly traded foreign entities entities owned by residents of us possessions foreign governments international organizations or foreign central banks will also be subject to a withholding tax of  if the entity does not certify that the entity does not have any substantial us owners or provide the name address and tin of each substantial us owner dispositions of shares by such persons may be subject to such withholding after december   income not effectively connected if the income from a fund is not effectively connected with a us trade or business carried on by the nonus shareholder distributions of investment company taxable income will generally be subject to a us tax of  or lower treaty rate which tax is generally withheld from such distributions distributions of capital gain dividends and any amounts retained by a fund which are properly reported by the fund as undistributed capital gains will not be subject to us tax at the rate of  or lower treaty rate unless the nonus shareholder is a nonresident alien individual and is physically present in the united states for more than  days during the taxable year and meets certain other requirements however this  tax on capital gains of nonresident alien individuals who are physically present in the united states for more than the  day period only applies in exceptional cases because any individual present in the united states for more than  days during the taxable year is generally treated as a resident for us income tax purposes in that case he or she would be subject to us income tax on his or her worldwide income at the graduated rates applicable to us citizens rather than the  us tax in the case of a nonus shareholder who is a nonresident alien individual the funds may be required to withhold us income tax from distributions of net capital gain unless the nonus shareholder certifies his or her nonus status under penalties of perjury or otherwise establishes an exemption if a nonus shareholder is a nonresident alien individual any gain such shareholder realizes upon the sale or exchange of such shareholders shares of the funds in the united states will ordinarily be exempt from us tax unless the gain is us source income and such shareholder is physically present in the united states for more than  days during the taxable year and meets certain other requirements in addition capital gains distributions attributable to gains from us real property interests including certain us real property holding corporations will generally be subject to united states withholding tax and will give rise to an obligation on the part of the foreign shareholder to file a united states tax return income effectively connected if the income from a fund is effectively connected with a us trade or business carried on by a nonus shareholder then distributions of investment company taxable income and capital gain dividends any amounts retained by a fund which are properly reported by a fund as undistributed capital gains and any gains realized upon the sale or exchange of shares of the funds will be subject to us income tax at the graduated rates applicable to us citizens residents and domestic corporations nonus corporate shareholders may also be subject to the branch profits tax imposed by the code the tax consequences to a nonus shareholder entitled to claim the benefits of an applicable tax treaty may differ from those described herein  nonus shareholders are advised to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the funds capital loss carryforward under the regulated investment company modernization act of  the ric modernization act net capital losses of the fund may be carried forward indefinitely and their character is retained as shortterm andor longterm losses to the extent that these loss carryforwards are used to offset future capital gains it is probable that the capital gains so offset will not be distributed to fund shareholders the fund is subject to certain limitations under us tax rules on the use of capital loss carryforwards and net unrealized builtin losses these limitations apply when there has been a  change in ownership other taxation fund shareholders may be subject to state local and foreign taxes on their fund distributions shareholders are advised to consult their own tax advisors with respect to the particular tax consequences to them of an investment in the funds determination of net asset value the following information supplements and should be read in conjunction with the section in the prospectus entitled net asset value the pershare net asset value of a fund is determined by dividing the total value of the securities and other assets less liabilities by the total number of shares outstanding under normal circumstances daily calculation of the net asset value will utilize the last closing sale price of each security held by a fund at the close of the market on which such security is principally listed in determining net asset value portfolio securities for a fund for which accurate market quotations are readily available will be valued by the fund accounting agent as follows  common stocks and other equity securities listed on any national or foreign exchange other than nasdaq and the london stock exchange alternative investment market aim will be valued at the last sale price on the exchange on which they are principally traded or the official closing price for nasdaq and aim securities portfolio securities traded on more than one securities exchange are valued at the last sale price or official closing price as applicable on the business day as of which such value is being determined at the close of the exchange representing the principal market for such securities  shares of openend mutual funds are valued at fair value which is based on nav per share   securities traded in the otc market are fair valued at the mean of their most recent bid and asked price if available and otherwise at their closing bid price  exchange traded options and futures contracts are valued at the closing price in the market where such contracts are principally traded if no closing price is available they will be fair valued at the mean of their most recent bid and asked price if available and otherwise at their closing bid price otc options and futures contracts are fair valued at the mean of their most recent bid and asked price if available and otherwise at their closing bid price  forward foreign currency contracts are fair valued at the current days interpolated foreign exchange rate as calculated using the current days spot rate and the    and day forward rates provided by a pricing service or by certain independent dealers in such contracts in addition the following types of securities will be fair valued by the fund accounting agent as follows  fixedincome securities interest rate swaps credit default swaps total return swaps currency swaps currencylinked notes creditlinked notes and other similar instruments will be fair valued using a pricing service  fixed income and other debt securities having a remaining maturity of  days or less when purchased are fair valued at cost adjusted for amortization of premiums and accretion of discounts amortized cost provided the advisors pricing committee has determined that the use of amortized cost is an appropriate reflection of fair value given market and issuerspecific conditions existing at the time of the determination factors that may be considered in determining the appropriateness of the use of amortized cost include but are not limited to the following i the credit conditions in the relevant market and changes thereto ii the liquidity conditions in the relevant market and changes thereto iii the interest rate conditions in the relevant market and changes thereto such as significant changes in interest rates iv issuerspecific conditions such as significant credit deterioration and v any other marketbased data the advisors pricing committee considers relevant in this regard the advisors pricing committee may use lastobtained marketbased data to assist it when valuing portfolio securities using amortized cost   repurchase agreements will be valued as follows overnight repurchase agreements will be fair valued at amortized cost when it represents the best estimate of fair value term repurchase agreements ie those whose maturity exceeds seven days will be fair valued by the advisors pricing committee at the average of the bid quotations obtained daily from at least two recognized dealers if the advisors pricing committee has reason to question the accuracy or reliability of a price supplied or the use of the amortized cost methodology the advisors pricing committee shall determine if it needs to fair value such portfolio security pursuant to established valuation procedures from time to time the advisors pricing committee will request that the fund accounting agent submit price challenges to a pricing service usually in response to any updated broker prices received certain securities may not be able to be priced by preestablished pricing methods such securities may be valued by the board of trustees or its delegate the advisors pricing committee at fair value these securities generally include but are not limited to restricted securities securities that may not be publicly sold without registration under the  act for which a pricing service is unable to provide a market price securities whose trading has been formally suspended a security whose market or fair value price is not available from a preestablished pricing source a security with respect to which an event has occurred that is likely to materially affect the value of the security after the market has closed but before the calculation of fund net asset value as may be the case in foreign markets on which the security is primarily traded or is likely to make it difficult or impossible to obtain a reliable market quotation and a security whose price as provided by the pricing service does not reflect the securitys fair value fair value prices represent any prices not considered market value prices and are either obtained from a pricing service or are determined by the advisors pricing committee market value prices represent last sale or official closing prices from a national or foreign exchange ie a regulated market and are primarily obtained from pricing services if no market price or official close price is available from either a pricing service or no quotations are available from one or more brokers or if the advisors pricing committee has reason to question the reliability or accuracy of a price supplied or the use of amortized cost the value of any portfolio security held by a fund for which reliable market pricesquotations are not readily available will be determined by the advisors pricing committee in a manner that most appropriately reflects fair market value of the security on the valuation date based on a consideration of all available information when fair value prices are used generally they will differ from market quotations or official closing prices on the applicable exchange because foreign markets may be open on different days than the days during which a shareholder may purchase the shares of a fund the value of a funds investments may change on the days when shareholders are not able to purchase the shares of the funds for foreign securities if an extraordinary market event occurs between the time the last current market quotation is available for a security in a funds portfolio and the time the funds net asset value is determined and calls into doubt whether that earlier market quotation represents fair value at the time the funds net asset value is determined the fund accounting agent will immediately notify the advisors pricing committee and the advisors pricing committee shall determine the fair valuation for foreign  securities the advisors pricing committee may seek to determine the fair value of such securities by retaining a pricing service to determine the value of the securities foreign securities currencies and other assets denominated in foreign currencies are translated into us dollars at the exchange rate of such currencies against the us dollar as provided by a pricing service all assets denominated in foreign currencies will be converted into us dollars at the exchange rates in effect at the time of valuation dividends and distributions the following information supplements and should be read in conjunction with the section in the prospectus entitled

valuation reasonableness emphasis is placed on the offer premium market reaction and strategic rationale o market reaction  how has the market responded to the proposed deal a negative market reaction should cause closer scrutiny of a deal o strategic rationale  does the deal make sense strategically from where is the value derived cost and revenue synergies should not be overly aggressive or optimistic but reasonably achievable management should also have a favorable track record of successful integration of historical acquisitions o negotiations and process  were the terms of the transaction negotiated at armslength was the process fair and equitable a fair process helps to ensure the best price for shareholders significant negotiation wins can also signify the deal makers competency the comprehensiveness of the sales process eg full auction partial auction no auction can also affect shareholder value o conflicts of interest  are insiders benefiting from the transaction

appears to be excessive analyze the underlying assumptions to determine whether a potential conflict exists o governance  will the combined company have a better or worse governance profile than the current governance profiles of the respective parties to the transaction if the governance profile is to change for the worse the burden is on the company to prove that other issues such as valuation outweigh any deterioration in governance compensation executive pay evaluation underlying all evaluations are five global principles that most investors expect corporations to adhere to in designing and administering executive and director compensation programs  maintain appropriate payforperformance alignment with emphasis on longterm shareholder value this principle encompasses overall

appropriateness of long or indefinite contracts excessive severance packages and guaranteed compensation  maintain an independent and effective compensation committee this principle promotes oversight of executive pay programs by directors with appropriate skills knowledge experience and a sound process for compensation decisionmaking eg including access to independent expertise and advice when needed  provide shareholders with clear comprehensive compensation disclosures this principle underscores the importance of informative and timely disclosures that enable shareholders to evaluate executive pay practices fully and fairly  avoid inappropriate pay to nonexecutive directors this principle recognizes the interests of shareholders in ensuring that compensation to outside directors
