the worldwide provider in resilient positioning navigation and timing pnt solutions announces that it has formed a strategic alliance including an equity investment with satelles inc to develop market and sell pnt solutions based on satelles’ satellite time and location stl signal technology stl is a unique spacebased pnt technology that provides location and timing data independent from traditional gps and other gnss satellite signals by using stl orolia’s proven spectracom and mcmurdo branded solutions will be less susceptible to vulnerabilities – spoofing interference and jamming – associated with gpsgnss many highly sensitive military defense government and commercial applications and operations including maritimeaviation fleetasset tracking management search and rescue and data center management require accurate and reliable pnt data today these applications rely on signals from gpsgnss satellites sbasgagan or regional satellite navigation systems such as the indian regional navigation satellite system irnss there are instances however where gpsgnssirnss signal strength and security are not sufficient and prone to signal disruption for these cases stl can be used as a secure signal of opportunity to complement gpsgnss making the application more accurate and secure and less prone to interference attack furthermore “orolia has provided india with positioning and timing technologies for critical applications for many years in the field of search  rescue orolia is a longterm partner with india since we equip the ground stations with the international satellite search and rescue system called “cospassarsat” the first generation was commissioned in  these stations are used to detect the emission of distress signals and to calculate the position of beacons triggered in the event of danger to human life our aeronautical distress beacons are used by major indian airlines we are also being tested with the ada aeronautical development agency for our military distress beacons used by fighter pilots in the field of ultraprecise time we equip indian satellite navigation satellites irnss with atomic clocks and have been supplying highperformance time and frequency references to the indian defense industry for many years example for telecommunication or radar applications” explains rohit braggs vp networks  sources of orolia “the strategic partnership with satelles which allows us to expand our portfolio of highly robust positioning navigation and timing pnt technologies is an opportunity for indian government players armed forces internal security defense industry and eg marine aviation banking it etc to have gps  irnss signal curing technology interfered with by jamming and thus an additional level of reliability in accessing critical pnt data their applications need” “in today’s increasingly dynamic and mobile world there is a growing need for precise and robust positioning navigation and timing information especially in businesscrucial highrisk and lifesaving operations” said dr jeanyves courtois orolia ceo “by augmenting orolia’s marketleading gpsgnssbased solutions with satelles’ stl technology we will have the industry’s first truly failsafe resilient pnt solution this breakthrough offering will be ideal for mission critical applications in which the smallest of discrepancies in pnt data accuracy availability and stability can result in a network outage a system crash or a loss of life” based on the iridium satellite constellation stl signals are up to  times stronger than gpsgnss which helps to prevent jamming and allows easier signal reach into buildings and other hardtoreach locations stl’s additional cryptographic security also ensures the highest levels of performance productivity and security “satelles’ pioneering role in stl technology is a perfect fit with orolia’s proven resilient pnt strategy” said dr michael o’connor satelles ceo “we look forward to working together to
