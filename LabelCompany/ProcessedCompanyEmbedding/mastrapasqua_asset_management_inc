needs these targets include portfolio maturity effective duration overall portfolio quality rating and sector weightings finally we use relative valuation to determine the attractiveness of individual

multiple copies of the wall street journal and investors business daily  the portfolio managers and analysts have arrived one by one settling in at the large conference table surrounded by glass walls and windows with a view of the morning traffic as downtown nashville wakes up following a greeting to the traders the conversation starts slowly as calls with news from the street are received by all accounts a typical morning research meeting right wrong it is frank mastrapasquas experience and love for teaching that creates a morning research meeting like none other the themes of economics and business fundamentals are interwoven with the incoming information in a unique way that challenges mastrapasquas analysts to think beyond the sound bites knowledge is shared and learning is a priority questioning is encouraged and the mood of the meeting often takes on that of a classroom in an institution of higher learning it is an atmosphere of openness and respect what makes our company unique is the fact that our investment team meets daily compared to most money managers who meet weekly  thus the flow of information regarding names in the portfolio is continuously scrutinized proprietary valuation model grad point™ methodology mastrapasquas independent research team utilizes a proprietary valuation methodology growth to riskadjusted differential grad point™ for stock selection the grad point™ model evaluates absolute and relative company market valuations by determining those factors that contribute positively or negatively to valuation the grad point model is an enhancement over customary valuation measures riskadjusted pe  mastrapasqua asset management builds on the traditional priceearnings ratio pe to growth rate benchmark to create a quantitative model which incorporates a multitude of company financial and industry variables to either raise or lower the pe hence calculating a riskadjusted pe macro riskadjusted pe  the riskadjusted pe multiple is further adjusted based upon macroeconomic variables and trends intending to capture the impact of the economic environment on corporate valuations the macroeconomic adjustment evaluates the interest rate environment relative to a stock’s volatility beta a more volatile stock’s riskadjusted pe will be decreased more when interest rates are falling and conversely increased more when interest rates are rising relative to a less volatile stock grad points™  the macro riskadjusted pe is then compared to the projected year earnings growth rate for the company stocks with growth rates higher than the macro riskadjusted pe are rewarded with positive grad points the outcome is a ranking system that delineates valuation reasonableness across industry and sector groups     home about us services
