huntsman plans to spin off its pigments business by jordan blum july   updated july   pm the chief executive of huntsman corp said wednesday that the woodlands company plans to spin off its specialty chemical business  rather than sell it  and create a new publicly traded company by early next year after debating for many months which route to take ceo peter huntsman said now that the struggling pigments and additives business is becoming profitable again  back in the black  his company can gain more value by spinning off the unit and selling shares than by selling it outright the new company would focus specifically on titanium dioxide chemical called tio which is used as a pigment for everything from food coloring and paints to coatings and sunscreen a spin allows us to have a process that we can control huntsman said noting that shareholders should benefit this is something that has greater certainty behind it huntsman has sought to unload or at least distance itself from the titanium dioxide business because its poor performance has weighed on huntsmans stock price translator to read this article in one of houstons mostspoken languages click on the button below business

britain to ban new diesel and gas cars by  has fracking reached peak sand hassan ahmed a chemical industry analyst of new yorkbased alembic global advisors said spinning off the unit could prove wise because the titanium dioxide business is cyclical and makes investors wary of huntsman in addition the new company might be attractive to investors now because the pigments industry is out of the cyclical trough he said giving a timeline  rather than some pieinthesky thing  is better than expected ahmed said of the spinoff last year was termed a transition year for huntsman after the  purchase of  billion in plants and other assets from rockwood holdings a chemical company owned by albemarle corp of charlotte nc huntsmans biggest financial drag has been its titanium dioxide plants some of

venator materials corp  fuel fix chroncom houston chronicle huntsman names spinoff venator materials corp posted by jordan blum date january   the woodlandsbased huntsman corp chemicals giant will name its pigments business after the latin word for hunter — a play off of the family name — as it spins off into its own company this spring the new venator materials corp will start trading by the end of june as its own company under the stock ticker “vntr” huntsman announced tuesday huntsman president and chief executive peter huntsman said the legacy company though will retain the textile effects business which originally was to be included in the spinoff the business makes dyes and chemicals that offer qualities such as sun protection builtin freshness and imaging effects for textiles and other products huntsman said last year it planned to spin off its pigments business in  the new venator would focus largely on the titanium dioxide chemical called tio which is used as a pigment for everything from food coloring and paints to coatings and sunscreen the business is more cyclical than huntsman’s other divisions and prone to more financial peaks and valleys huntsman values the business at more than  billion “we expect venator will be a premier pigments company unencumbered by excessive debt or other unrelated liabilities” peter huntsman said in tuesday’s announcement huntsman corp became the world’s secondlargest pigments producer two years ago after buying more than  billion in plants from new yorkbased rockwood holdings but the timing was bad huntsman admitted the pigments business is cyclical dominated by four or five large paint companies whose buying decisions drive the cycle up or down huntsman said he bought the rockwood assets at a good price during a cyclical low but that trough lasted two years longer than expected and dragged down the value of huntsman corp he said the company is already eyeing potential mergers or acquisitions that could be made with proceeds from the spinoff and wouldn’t rule out making deals before the new company goes public next year after the company went public in  huntsman moved the family business from utah where it was founded to the woodlands where it would be closer to its plants customers and supplies of natural gas that provide the feedstock for petrochemicals huntsman today employs about  people in
