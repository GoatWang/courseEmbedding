us individual investors phocas financial named for saint phocas the gardener the phocas financial phocas investment team has successfully managed money for individuals since  and for large institutions including some of our nations largest pension funds and banks since  this gives phocas individual clients direct access to investment experience and sophistication that is rarely available to individual investors your objectives and investment context each of our clients has a unique life situation with their own investment goals risk tolerance and tax situation we meet to discuss your life your objectives and family situation your values and how your financial needs might change over time your resulting portfolio will match your needs and maximize longterm capital appreciation while minimizing unnecessary risk and taxes investment selection and philosophy phocas selects us stocks including real estate investment trusts reits and income securities based on indepth research and sophisticated analyses of individual companies and the sectors in which they operate for other investment types or asset classes such as international equities we may select mutual funds andor exchange traded funds etfs with managers whose investment discipline meets our standards we are not seeking home runs which comes with the risk inherent in swinging for the fences instead we find funds that have over time had aboveaverage returns we also select funds that have appropriate fees for the services that they provide for example mutual funds that invest in large wellcovered stocks should charge a much lower fee than a fund that invests in emerging markets we believe that our disciplined approach and our emphasis upon fundamental investment value is optimal to create wealth for our clients in the long term risk discussion we understand that most people measure risk not just by overall fluctuations or volatility but also by the probability of losing money we minimize business risk by focusing only on those companies with strong balance sheets solid histories of generating earnings and cash flow and which are leaders in their industries we seek to reduce risk by being disciplined about the valuations at which we buy and sell investments our models give us reliable indications of the risks of investments we consider we aim to maximize returns without taking on unwanted risk fees and transparency phocas charges a management fee that is highly competitive all professions use a lot of jargon as internal shorthand we try not to subject you to internal references that might be handy for us but less relevant for you as part of our belief in full transparency we try to avoid jargon and speak like normal people is your money in the right hands when we look at a potential clients existing portfolio we almost invariably see one or more of the following too much or too little risk lack of diversification within and across asset types mutual funds with high fees mutual funds with poor performance and investments that represent a conflict of interest for example mutual funds that pay the financial adviser for their business or investments in the
