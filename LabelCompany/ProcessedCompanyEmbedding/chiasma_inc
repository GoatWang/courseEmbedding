impaired vision and enlargement of the hands feet and tongue serious associated health conditions include diabetes hypertension cardiac and cerebrovascular disease and respiratory disorders current treatment options include surgery to remove the tumor radiation therapy which destroys any lingering tumor cells andor medical treatment in cases where these approaches are not possible or fully effective medical treatments available currently include dopamine agonists gh antagonists and injectable somatostatin analogs the current standard of care currently available somatostatin analogs require largebore needles for injection into muscle octreotide or deep into the tissue underlying the skin lanreotide researchers estimate that three to four out of every million people develop
