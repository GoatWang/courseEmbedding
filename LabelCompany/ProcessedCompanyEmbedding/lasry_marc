quiznos close to deal with lasry’s avenue capital published on december   at  pm by renee ann butler in hedge fundsthe smart set sandwich chain quiznos is in danger of bankruptcy reports the wall street journal if the company does not find a way to restructure its  million debt load quiznos will be forced to file for chapter  bankruptcy protection its last hope for this restructuring is not a bank but rather a hedge fund – marc lasry’s avenue capital to be exact “struggling amid slumping sales and a recent violation of debt terms quiznos has found a potential new owner in avenue capital group the hedge fund controlled by billionaire marc lasry” reports the wall street journal “avenue would convert its debt to equity and invest cash in quiznos as part of a tentative deal that would give the hedge fund more than a  ownership stake in the chain” the plan if approved would cut quiznos debt by roughly  million the deal that is being discussed right now “is being driven by the company’s biggest lenders who have a plan to take ownership of the company as long as other creditors give their consent” the creditors have  days to accept the plan as written or face bankruptcy quiznos’ debt stems from five years ago when its current owners decided to purchase the chain in a leveraged buyout at the time the market was at its peak and quiznos soon reported nearly  locations then the recession hit and so was quiznos in addition the chain also faced increased competition from subway as the sandwich chain expanded its offerings to include quiznos mainstay – toasted sandwiches all in all quiznos ended up having to close roughly  locations “quiznos warned lenders over the summer that sales were coming in below projections which would likely cause the chain to violate loan terms and put it in default” reports the wall street journal at that point “the chain hired wall street restructuring lawyers and bankers to negotiate with investors” a path which eventually led to lasry “avenue’s mr lasry like other distresseddebt investors often tries to gain control of troubled companies by purchasing discounted debt and later converting it to equity which carries more risk but also the potential for greater reward” for instance “in the wake of the financial crisis mr lasry has led investors to gain control of three atlantic city nj casinos bearing donald trump’s name and broadcaster ion media networks inc among other companies” related insider monkey articleshedge funds lose after general motors gm shares tumblemarc lasry’s avenue capital and

and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans

that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no
