clause in this law now  usc  permits this preexisting uses of the red cross to continue a declaration made by the us upon its ratification of the  geneva conventions includes a reservation that pre us domestic uses of the red cross such as johnson  johnsons would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on aircraft vessels vehicles buildings or other structures or upon the ground ie uses
