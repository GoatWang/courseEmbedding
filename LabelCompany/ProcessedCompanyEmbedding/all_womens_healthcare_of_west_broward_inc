plantation fljackson memorial hospital miami flwestside regional medical center plantation flbroward health medical center fort lauderdale fl information about group practices what is a group practice according to the medical group management association a group practice is any relationship between three or more physicians who share facilities expenses profits and other resources like support staff and equipment group practices tend to fall into two categories those that organize around a particular medical specialty and those that encompass several specialties like east boston neighborhood health that specializes in internal medicine why group practice as medicine became more complex in the twentieth century the need for group practices made more sense physicians found it impossible to know everything about the emerging drugs and technologies on the medical landscape in addition the cost of providing a full range of diagnostic services such as tests and xrays in one location became prohibitive to the individual practitioner hence doctors from various disciplines began to team together in order to provide more comprehensive care to their community of patients benefits of group practice access to doctors from various disciplines for referrals and advice better coverage on weekends and offhours onestop clinics for comprehensive care and testing advertisement home  group
