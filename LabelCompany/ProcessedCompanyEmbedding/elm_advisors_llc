their s came to us with a trust and two iras—each invested in an assortment of activelymanaged highercost mutual funds they couldn’t keep track of how much was in stock bonds or what kinds of investments they were and they didn’t realize many of the funds had overlapping positions and high ongoing expenses—both investment and tax expenses we immediately saw that they had too many investments yet not enough diversification we went to work to reduce their risk and their expenses being sensitive to realized gains in their taxable accounts we moved their highercost mutual funds into broadly diversified taxsensitive low cost index funds we also added low cost municipal bond funds to improve their aftertax return for their iras we created a taxable bond ladder that would meet future distribution requirements in retirement and we took advantage of the iras’ tax deferred status by placing less tax favored securities here the result was a plan that reduced costs minimized risk and eliminated confusion while enhancing their peace of mind elm advisors llc  el camino real suite  burlingame california  directions to elm advisors tel  toll free  fax  email elm advisors
