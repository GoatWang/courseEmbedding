quarter followed by mark comments on the overall performance and our way forward following these prepared statements we welcome your questions and now i would like to turn the call over to christoph christoph bausch  weatherford international plc thank you karen second quarter results included an adjustment for revenue in venezuela amounting to  million in order to better compare results with prior periods and estimates for the quarter i have excluded this affect in the following comments unless specifically mentioned second quarter revenue increased by  sequentially segment operating income before rd corporate expenses and charges and credits of  million improved by  million compared to last quarter with sequential operating income margins improving by  basis points to  excluding charges and credits loss per share for the quarter was  and without the adjustment for venezuela loss per share for the quarter was  aside from the accounting change for venezuela we recorded  million of income and charges net of tax during the second quarter this included a noncash credit of  million related to the fair value adjustment of our outstanding warrants  million of severance and restructuring charges and  million in net credits primarily related to the amortization of unrecognized net gains associated with our supplemental retirement plan north america operating income margins improved by  basis points and were positive for the first time since the fourth quarter  all product lines operating in the lower  us land market showed sequential margin improvements north america revenue was down  sequentially primarily due to the seasonal spring break up in canada offshore revenue in the gulf of mexico remained subdued and decreased by  compared to the first quarter overall margins continue to improve with operating income of  million an improvement of  million or  basis points including a loss of  million related to the us pressure pumping business improved activity levels and pricing in our well construction reservoir solutions and artificial lift product lines combined with higher completions activity in the united states supported this sequential improvement we believe that in the third quarter revenue in north america will continue to grow despite the recent flattening of the rig count in the us driven by the canada rebound from the spring breakup and new contract commencement in the us sequential incrementals are expected to be in the low singledigit percentage and are primarily impacted by increased employee compensation costs and other costs adjusted second quarter international revenue grew by  and excluding the second quarter revenue adjustment in venezuela our latin america revenue was up  sequentially with gains coming mainly from increased activity levels in argentina as operations resumed after the temporary disruptions during the first quarter the corresponding second quarter operating segment income was  million a margin of  the decrease in segment operating income of  million and the corresponding reduction in margins of  basis points is a result of higher compensation costs in argentina following an agreement with local unions to retroactively increase salaries excluding the aforementioned adjustment in venezuela we expect third quarter revenue in latin america to decline due to lower activity levels and continued pricing pressure throughout the region in the europe caspian russia subsaharan africa region revenue was flat sequentially given that the first quarter benefited from high volume of low margin product sales which did not repeat in the second quarter we witness seasonally higher activity in the norwegian continental shelf and in russia operating income margins improved significantly by  basis points given the favorable product mix and the seasonal rebound overall we expect an increase in revenue during the third quarter given higher activity levels in the north sea with a lessfavorable product mix and service mix incrementals are expected in the low doubledigit range in the middle east north africa asiapacific region revenue increased by  with strong incrementals primarily driven by higher activity levels and the commencement of new projects in the united arab emirates kuwait and thailand as well as recharges related to the zubair contract with no margin operating income margins expanded by  basis points we expect revenue in the middle east and asia region to further increase in the third quarter as our market share continues to expand and new contracts continue to ramp up we expect margins in the region to be relatively flat versus the second quarter primarily as a result of increased startup costs for new projects and an expected change in geographical mix revenue for our land rig business increased  sequentially largely due to improved operational efficiency rigs in algeria and kuwait were fully operational during the quarter and the structural improvements that we implemented in the first quarter were reflected in improved safety and service quality performance these improvements were manifested in solid financial improvements in may and in june with potential opportunities to restart operations in other markets we expect continued growth with positive incremental margins throughout the second half of  and beyond we have completed our previouslyannounced project  cost reduction efforts and as of the end of the quarter had reduced nearly  employees this represents  of our previously planned reductions related to project  we are confident that this reduced cost structure will support our capacity requirements while improving our efficiency in key manufacturing locations rd and corporate expenses were slightly down compared to the prior quarter at  million and  million respectively we expect that the current run rate for rd and corporate expenses will remain broadly flat for the remainder of  but we are working on several initiatives to reduce our corporate costs which will show in  and beyond the tax expense of  million represents the expense associated with our method of recording a discrete tax charge based on actual quarterly results the tax charge is reflective of profits in certain jurisdictions deemed profit countries and withholding taxes on intercompany charges the cash tax paid in the quarter approximated the tax expense partly offset by tax refunds related to prior years our current estimate for quarterly tax charge in the second half of the year is approximately  million which may be impacted by our actual geographical mix of revenue and earnings outside any significant discrete events and not considering timing differences we continue to expect cash taxes to be in the same range as our tax expense net cash used in operating activities was  million for the second quarter of  including  million of debt interest payments  million of cash severance and restructuring costs and  million of sec legal settlement costs this was partially offset by the collection of other receivables insurance proceeds and favorable legal settlements totaling  million capital expenditures of  million increased slightly by  million or  sequentially and increased  million or  from the same quarter of the prior year we expect capital expenditures for the second half of  to range between  million and  million which includes upgrades of two drilling rigs where we have recently won a contract in kuwait total net debt of  billion increased by  million during the second quarter including adjustments related to venezuela customer receivables decreased in the second quarter and dso decreased from  to  days inventory levels increased by  million sequentially mainly as a result of a buildup of products destined for customer delivery in the middle east asia region in the second half of  we have commenced a competitive land drilling rigs divestiture process and we have seen a high level of initial interest this is a sizable opportunity for us as weatherford drilling international is highly respected and one of the largest international land drilling contractors in the market we have a fleet of  rigs with a premier customer base which is geographically diversified to take advantage of secular and cyclical trends with that i will turn the call over to mark mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc thanks christoph and good morning everyone im pleased to report a strong second quarter performance we generated significantly higher incrementals on increased revenue in the us the middle east and russia and we improved our cash flow compared to the previous quarter excluding the adjustment related to venezuela our operating margins improved by  basis points sequentially our service quality execution in the second quarter was exemplary with consistent and reliable performance across all segments of our business and particularly noteworthy improvement in our land drilling rigs business which achieved its lowest nonproductive time since  the weatherford team has been doing particularly well in the middle east rig activity has been going strong and our tendering activity has correspondingly remained high with our market share steadily increasing during the second quarter middle east north africa and asia pacific revenue grew  sequentially weve already signed several large contracts todate with notable wins in the uae oman kuwait and saudi arabia and we commenced work on our significant wireline and artificial lift contracts in kuwait in june weatherford has posted the best comparative service quality results in saudi arabia yeartodate and as a result were invited to participate in large turnkey well construction projects where well have the opportunity to provide project management along with most of our products and services during the quarter we won a turnkey project related to rigless well testing operations and we already mobilized assets and crews to commence operations the middle east is a very important market for weatherford and i had the honor of joining fellow executives from across the industry at the saudius ceo forum in may at this forum we signed a memorandum of understanding as part of saudi arabias inkingdom total value added program were strongly committed to the localization of content in saudi arabia as well as other countries in the region weve also had several successful field runs of our industryleading technologies in this region for example weatherford delivered recordsetting directional drilling results in five different wells for an operator with our revolution rotarysteerable system the hostileenvironmentlogging system and logging while drilling tools in one well weatherford achieved a rate of penetration  higher than the field average in kuwait weatherford provided a complete characterization of a challenging well in a prolific field by deploying our compact logging information testing tools on drill pipe weatherford saved the operator approximately  hours of rig time compared to conventional pipeconveyed logging operations and in australia we deployed our wfx system which is the industrys first fullyintegrated gravelpack system to achieve an apiiso v rating which has been tested to the industrys highest standard with zero gas leakage while leveraging several v rated weatherford technologies including the terraform packer the system enables gravel pack completions of multiple open hole zones in a single trip and achieves casedhole functionality in an open hole environment turning to europe were seeing increased plugandabandonment activity in the north sea and higher land activity across europe especially in geothermal wells we expect these upward trends to continue in the second half of the year contributing to improved results in that region im very pleased to share that weatherford received the eni safety award in the category of well services for the second year in a row in recognition of our teams achieving the best safety performance and maintaining a strong commitment to safety in addition after demonstrating high levels of service quality and efficiency on a onewell project in the north sea weatherford replaced the incumbent on a fiveyear logging while drilling contact with options for extensions russia activity levels were high benefiting from a seasonal rebound in addition market share gains have allowed us to increase revenue and profitability in june we signed a technology cooperation agreement with gazprom neft intended to further develop our current business relationships and collaborations between the two companies in latin america our previously disclosed revenue accounting adjustment related to venezuela negatively impacted our reported second quarter results absent that adjustment however latin america results improved sequentially on higher activity in argentina colombia and mexico where the first well drilled as part of our recentlyawarded integrated services contract for a shallow water project in the gulf of mexico set a new field record drilling a horizontal well to total depth in  days was seven days faster than the previous field record the second well was drilled in  days more than  days ahead of plan in addition were benefiting from several contract wins in argentina and chile weve seen healthy activity levels in the us land market especially in product lines such as drilling services wireline and well construction pricing and utilization has improved in all product lines as operators increasingly drill wells with complex profiles and longer laterals as operators continue to move deeper into the well lifecycle we expect further improvement in our productionrelated businesses in addition with the spring breakup behind us the canadian rig count has come back quickly and is above last years levels during the quarter we released the foresite production optimization platform an integrated software solution that leverages the internet of things and advanced analytics to maximize equipment uptime and extend asset life trialed in north america this software platform will help our global customers to reduce downtime of vital production assets and to optimize critical maintenance routines for the offshore market we developed the premium version of riptide our rfid controlled drilling reamer that incorporates advanced cutter technology which was developed through collaborative efforts between weatherford and us synthetic the leading provider of polycrystalline diamond cutters for the oil and gas industry during the quarter we introduced the new wireline tool the raptor  casedhole evaluation system in its first deployment in western canada the tool assess the remaining production potential of three shutin unconventional wells data from the system identified untapped oil and gas producing zones in two of the three wells using this data the operators established initial production and is planning additional recompletion campaigns in the reservoir one of weatherfords biggest assets is its strong customer relationships ive experienced that first hand in my first few months traveling to different regions throughout our organization to spend time with our customers its clear to me that customers are encouraged to see weatherfords consistent service quality and service delivery improvement over the past few quarters this is resulting in increased confidence in weatherford services which is already resulting in a wider available market customers told me that theyre looking forward to seeing a more procedural processoriented and disciplined company and there is strong confidence in our ability to further improve performance many customers have expressed their appreciation of weatherfords support and our ability to deploy a skilled team to solve their challenges the level of encouragement i received from our customers leaves me confident that we have significant opportunities ahead of us moving forward we remain cautiously optimistic despite the recent drop in oil price over the last few months increasing us domestic production and resilient international nonopec production have placed pressure on oil prices and the anticipated energy services recovery outside of completions activity in key us unconventional basins has been slow to develop we have seen a flattening of the north american rig count which will make it more difficult we believe to obtain improved margins in particular as certain input cost are likely to increase on the other hand with the spring breakup behind us the canadian rig count came back earlier than usual and is now above last years levels and internationally numerous recent contract awards coupled with the startup of new projects should allow us to outpace rig count growth over time steady growth in demand combined with natural decline rates in basins outside the us should offset us supply surplus and improve the global market outlook but im anticipating that this is a couple of years away itd be great to get some wind at our backs in the form of a market recovery however we cannot and are not holding out for a macrolevel change to strengthen our results that doesnt mean though that there arent plenty of things that we can do to improve our financial performance and position that are well within our control to execute my motivation coming into this role was based on the opportunities i could see available to weatherford and im committed to doing the heavy lifting to get things fixed obviously our top priority is to strengthen our balance sheet my goal is to cut our net debt in half by the end of  we have a number of initiatives underway designed to help achieve this goal but let me bucket them into three categories first we intend to heighten our focus on the operational and financial accountability with a more disciplined and streamlined management process were currently carrying out a thorough and comprehensive evaluation of the way we operate which today varies greatly between different product lines and geographies with the goal of standardizing simplifying and in some cases automating key processes across the organization various teams have been working diligently across the company for the last couple of months reviewing customer service delivery supply chain sales and a host of backoffice processes by improving these particular areas we can better ensure flawless service quality reliability and consistency for our customers in the field but the ultimate goal is to significantly reduce our support cost as a percentage of revenue by having a more efficient and lean organization our businesses can execute well and be profitable and we arent that far away we just need to do the right things with discipline to make that happen the second initiative underway is a complete portfolio review were working to thoroughly evaluate each product line in its position in weatherfords portfolio were considering current business performance available technologies and competitive positioning future market outlook and growth opportunity our technology pipeline and future financial trajectory if were going to have it its got to have a future its got to make a return my early discussions with customers in review of operations suggest to me that there is significant untapped opportunity to improve weatherfords market position and returns we have an attractive and differentiated portfolio on which to build we have great technologies and extensive global presence a set of outstanding collaborative customer relationships and a highcaliber workforce these qualities make us an important partner for our customers in many basins around the world theres a compelling strength to our fundamental qualities and underlying assets which suggests an attractive revenue upside that we have the ability to secure we just need a clear strategic vision for our portfolio aligned with an organization designed to execute on that vision in that regard these first two initiatives ive discussed are linked my commitment is to get the composition and structure of this organization right finally in parallel with these other initiatives were continuing to move forward with the strategic transactions we disclosed early in the year were on track to close the onestim joint venture transaction with schlumberger in the second half of this year which will allow us to better capitalize on the recovery in north america land unconventional activity were also following through with marketing of our international land rigs business the outlook for this business is improving and weve seen high levels of initial interest were working along a time line to allow us to conclude this process before yearend as well i know that youre all eager to hear more specifics about how well harness these opportunities to create increased value for our stakeholders were moving expeditiously with these initiatives and well be reviewing results with the board later this quarter my goal is be able to present a clear strategic direction in the market early in the fourth quarter so stay tuned i joined weatherford because i saw an incredible amount of opportunity in this company and in speaking with our customers i see that they feel the same theyre supportive of weatherford they just need us to be more aggressively focused on finding unique internallycollaborative solutions to the technical challenges they face and to up our game when it comes to consistent execution and service quality im sure the same could be said for all of our competitors too for our part though we as an organization have admittedly been a bit disjointed at times that ends now were dedicating ourselves to moving forward a stronger more unified company that is guided by our core values we intend to lead with ethics and integrity and were committed to act with discipline in every aspect of our work were focusing on delivering reliable services and bestinclass technologies that provide maximum value to our customers and in turn value to our shareholders were going to strive for flawless execution all while maintaining the highest levels of safety and service quality and as weve shown in the second quarter we can achieve that high level of execution and well continue to foster collaboration and innovation both within our organization across product lines and functions and with our customers and partners sharing resources and capabilities to develop new solutions that continuously improve our product and service offerings and deliver exceptional results in closing my key priority is to repair our balance sheet and to get the structure and operation of this organization right so that we can successfully be successful regardless of the market that we find ourselves in i look forward to further updating you about our next steps early in the fourth quarter at that time well lay out a more specific strategic vision for the company and present a more detailed path to sustainable value creation theres a lot of opportunities in front of us both internally and externally and make no mistake were going after them i saw them from the outside when i chose to take the role and now that ive seen the organization from a more granular level i believe it to be truer than our ever weatherford will emerge a much stronger and better company with a clear purpose and vision for the future its my mission to ensure this happens for the greater good of all of our stakeholders with that ill turn the call back to the operator for the questionandanswer session questionandanswer session operator thank you and your first question comes from line of jim wicklund with credit suisse your line is open james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc good morning guys mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc hi jim james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc and mark that was a nice speech and we look forward to the business plan but i think you lay it out well just in general you talk when you were on the outside and now that youre on the inside and people have looked at weatherford as not being a technology leader in your press release and in your comments this morning you went through a list of technical wins can you talk about your view of weatherford and technology after being in for three months versus being on the outside for years mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc sure no i actually think that one of the things thats been underappreciated about weatherford is the level of technology that they have obviously when youre sitting in a competitors shoes your goal is to sort of knockdown everybody elses tools in favor of your own but i think admittedly always had an appreciation for the technologies that weatherford had as ive gotten in and had a chance to spend more time get a sense for it weatherford has great tools in some ways it hasnt always been the guy whos in front on the technology development but in a lot of the tools what you find is that by being a fast follower theyve had the opportunity to work out bugs that other tools havent so when the tools come forward theyre very very strong so like in the wireline space the compact series of tools are very well regarded were in development of a new rotarysteerable that i think is going to be extremely well accepted and probably will leapfrog some of the competition and were in field testing of that now and you heard the list of some of the others and in visiting with customers i think customers have all expressed appreciation they believe that the weatherford tools perform exceptionally well i think that the larger issue for the weatherford organization has been possibly an inconsistent design of service or at least an inconsistent deployment of design of service so that when youre executing in the field that execution of service quality has been somewhat inconsistent so were driving hard on first of all making sure that we are consistent and as a part of some of these initiatives that were working on – i talked about service delivery part of that will be coming out with sort of consistent design of service across all of our product lines and geographies so that we can ensure better execution of the tools and really get maximum advantage for the technologies that we have james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc okay thats a helpful view because we dont always look at weatherford as technology my followup if i could you had made a comment i guess at some conference youre in and some investors but investors came away with the comment that weatherford said theyre willing to sell their crown jewels if necessary and i know you guys are going through a portfolio review process and thats not done yet and i know the goal is to reduce debt cut it in half by the middle of  land rigs are for sale i understand cleaning up a portfolio but can you talk about the likelihood that over the next couple of years you would be willing to or have to sell a crown jewel for weatherford to survive mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc well i think its premature to sort of reach the conclusion if that thats the endgame for the portfolio the review that were doing i think what im trying to suggest is that coming in as a fresh face here im agnostic i know if youve been here for a long time you probably have some emotional investment in some of the product lines what might be a crown jewel or not and my view is every product line is equal in the portfolio has an equal space whether its large or small and they all have to perform they have to perform on their own merits and so what were trying to do is look at them very agnostically weve got internal help but ive got external help helping me with this too to make an evaluation about not only what theyre doing now what they can do whats their future and to try to come up with a better strategy and then also for me to try to get a better sense of how we can synthesize this fairlydisparatetoday group of product lines to bring them closer together i mean one of the issues that i see is all of our product lines run very independent from each other today and while that might have been okay for a long period of time my discussion with customers theyre all – they say we want solutions we need solutions and that begs the question of james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc  mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc exactly how can we bring these to provide solutions how can we get them to work together better but i also think that in bringing them together there are probably significant cost synergies to be had by leaning out the organization and how we run it both at the top of the organization as well as down at the field interface james wicklund  credit suisse securities usa llc okay okay thats very helpful and that corrects some misperceptions so i appreciate it thanks guys operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of david anderson with barclays your line is open j david anderson  barclays capital inc good to hear theres no sacred cows there mark so a question for you in the north american portfolio its quite a bit different than a lot of the companies now without the pressure pumping in there so i was wondering if you could kind of help us out a little bit your later cycle now so how do we think about your growth versus a us land growth in terms of the rig count or well completions i would think particularly in the artificial lift that theres a backlog of completions that might arguably be even a bigger backlog of artificial lift so does that come in later quarters how should we be thinking about the progression mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc yes thats the way that were seeing it right the artificial lift has done okay one of the things that mask our performance is of course we dont have an esp offering so were missing a little bit of that weve had a significant uptick in sales of jet pumps and gas lift gas lift has been going great but its a cheaper tool than traditional rod lift systems by probably a  factor and so while youre seeing increased volume you dont see it necessarily show up in the sales percentages but it has improved a portion of these unconventional wells that are being drilled move later down the well life cycle at some point theyre going to go to rod lift they just have to you know esps and gaslift will work in initial production phases and customers are tending to stretch them out a bit but at some point theyre going to shift that so we should see an uptick in our well construction product lines i mean were sold out of rotarysteerables like others i mean weve got every tool – and we brought in tools from other parts of the world to satisfy demand and thats been going well weve seen a big uptick in our wireline work completions work has continued to do okay the us piece probably has a larger percentage of gulf of mexico which has been a bit weaker but canada has been ripping on completion sales and so all of our other product lines have been doing fairly well the lift has probably been the one thats probably been later cycle and with it some of the other well service product lines and we do think that particularly if the rig count levels out that things will begin to mature and those product lines will see an uptick j david anderson  barclays capital inc mark you addressed the debt paydown and obviously your sense of urgency is obvious the other issue for investors has been the cash burn this has been sort of kind of the achilles heel i would say probably the last  to  months there with weatherford had another cash burn this quarter some handful kind of oneoffs in there how should we be thinking about free cash flow like second half of  or then maybe kind of beyond there if you wouldnt mind just touching on that mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc ill let christoph handle that christoph bausch  weatherford international plc hey david thank you so i think again we drive very hard to get to breakeven cash flow thats our commitment and the whole company works aligned on that you have to understand that there are several costs which we still carry we carry a lot of severance cost we have our sec settlements which are negatively impacting the cash flow so thats impacting our results now we had some favorable effects in q to understand that we had sold a note for a customer in ecuador and we had a couple of other positive ones but we also had a couple of negative ones as well going in the second half of the year there is one difference on interest charges which i think is very important to understand q interest is usually lower than q and we also have a ramp up on capital expenditure as i had outlined in my comments but i would say as we get into q well work and we will be at breakeven thats our commitment from that q well not be there j david anderson  barclays capital inc okay christoph bausch  weatherford international plc q well be breakeven j david anderson  barclays capital inc okay thank you very much appreciate it mark christoph operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of bill herbert with simmons your line is open william a herbert  simmons  company international good morning mark with regard to mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc good morning william a herbert  simmons  company international hey good morning with regard to the land rig sale timing a targeted aspiration of resolution by yearend do you have any comments with regard to like the structure of the deal at this stage is it i mean openended in terms of any number of forms could take place is it a likely outright complete asset sale is it a jv what are your thoughts on that front mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc its a little early yet to know how thats going to go out weve offered it as a complete package weve also divided it in a way that if there was interest in smaller packages such as like the middle east then that could also be a transaction that could come out of this i mean what we want to try to do is maximize the value for the assets that we give up the middle east business is doing really well as we described in the calls i mean theyve seen a significant uptick in not only rig deployment but also their service quality they moved profitable in june as an entire group but when you look at the middle east business separately its a very nice business and so it could be that thats how it goes what i want to try to do is to maximize the amount of cash that we can get and reduce the complexity to execute that so that we can close as quickly as possible and get the cash in our pocket and reduce the debt so were in the middle of the process now weve got people in the data rooms and expect to hopefully have something to present to our board at the september meeting to see if weve got something that we can execute on and then wrap that up before the end of the year william a herbert  simmons  company international okay and then secondly kind of bigger picture here with regard to kind of addressing the internal transformation of weatherford you talked about your three objectives here which are coherent and lucid im just curious as thus far as youve examined weatherford effectively from the outside in and now from the inside but not for all that long where is internal transformation unfolding at a targeted or better than a targeted pace and you dont need to give all the examples just a few and other than the balance sheet where is the transformation looking harder and taking longer mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc thats a good question the first initiative that i described where people are looking in various processes i think thats going fairly rapidly some of those were already initiated like some of the backoffice processes christoph had previously kicked off some work in the back office to look at doing some business support centers and using extended enterprise to take a greater burden off some of our transaction work so thats underway and probably has a little bit of a head start across some other things were also working on sales to try to get that pushed harder to me the end goal of it of course is working through having revised and standardized processes but with the goal of then saying okay now that we have that were going to reorganize the company to better support those processes and lean out and i think that theres a big opportunity there as we look at a percentage of support cost to revenues so those things are moving along and we have a fairly i think good view of where we need to go and to help that out and well have something fairly quick the portfolio review were going to have a view of what we need to do or how – at the september board meeting were presenting it to the board but its hard to know at this point what the outcomes are going to be if some of those are going to be making some transformational moves on those product lines that may take a little bit longer to execute it may go into  to actually do i cant even say right now but thats a little bit more the first initiative is sort of designed at taking a broad swipe at structural support cost and how we execute so that we can sort of drive the company to get it to profitability and cash flow generation sustainably very quickly the second one is then looking at the portfolio making sure that were moving in at the right direction i think that broadly i peppered this through my comments but it really is true when you look at the revenue opportunity weatherfords market position with its customers and my conversation with customers most of them are like we really like weatherford we like what youre doing we want more of you you guys need to figure out how to get here right its actually on our side of the table to actually push harder to get a bigger share of the pie with a number of our key customers and so thats a part of – but theres a lot of topline opportunity its going to take some time to get but thats going to be a big push for us as well william a herbert  simmons  company international okay thanks mark operator thank you and your next question comes from line of james west with evercore isi your line is open james west  evercore isi hey good morning guys mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc hi how are you james christoph bausch  weatherford international plc good morning james james west  evercore isi good good mark and thanks for laying out your strategic priorities my first question really is along the lines of the first one its both process and accountability and i fully appreciate the processes are getting much better especially given your background and your history but i had a question about accountability thats one of the things that has always lagged at weatherford and what are you putting in place or what is the organization putting in place to drive that accountability throughout the organization in order to continue to help with operational excellence and all the things to go along with that like cash generation mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc well it starts with me right and my engagement with the organization and being out there calling the question from the top were having – which is kind of a new thing for weatherford right even just something as simple as staff meetings at my level of me being out ive been on the road for about four five six weeks in and out visiting operations and things and people have told me thats the first time they had ever seen the ceo but getting out and communicating with people about what the expectations are and then one of the things to do here weve been working hard to improve forecasting christoph and the team and i are trying to also – a lot of the financial – theres a lot of information one of things that has been a surprise for me is its really not that theres not a lot of information there is a lot of information coming off the system the problem is that its primarily historical but to turn that information and look forward so that people are spending more time thinking about the future about the forecasting and where were going rather than where weve been it sounds simple but sometimes thats hard to do to get peoples eyes focused on the horizon and so by asking the right questions at my level and then kind of pushing it down making sure that were working as a team and feeling accountable as a group rather than sort of individuals kind of running and doing their thing is a key part of that so its kind of interesting i mean its been a big investment of time early but thats kind of gets things started now separate from that and you heard at the backend of my comments were really largely directed – for our organization as a whole weve redone the mission statement weve redone our values were kicking off a lot of internal things to kind of sort of levelset the organization about what the expectations are from a culture standpoint what were about what were going to be i think a lot of receptivity to that i mean i think employees like that but the old one the proof is in the pudding right its not just saying the right things but doing the right things and so for me longterm what ive got to do is not just encourage and cajole and to put values and all that out there but also really hold people accountable if you dont make your numbers if you dont follow through then there is a consequence to that as well which is the hard part of leadership but thats probably something that has been missing that well be introducing as well james west  evercore isi okay great great to hear and then mark with respect to the support costs in the organization and bringing those down further given the unique portfolio that weatherford has is there any reason to think that you shouldnt be able to get support costs down to kind of peer levels or even below that mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc well i would say that aspirationally theres not a reason okay but i think that the question that well have to work through as we standardize all these processes and drive im going to drive pretty hard but there probably is a point where theres some level of cost can come out because of automation that comes with an expense we dont have the luxury of the time to put in one instance of sap worldwide so we have a good we have a very good system jd edwards is fine and we actually have one instance of it the question is using it properly and doing everything we can around the seams to make sure that we get it out as i look at the opportunity it feels like our support costs run   of revenues our peers are in the lowteens you can kind of do the math and say okay from an opportunity set its a pretty significant opportunity and while im going to try to push this hard as i can to get as much of that as we can but its going to take some work i mean at this point in time the way that the organization has been built for everything from real estate to the organization chart itself this will be cutting into the weatherford bone a bit james west  evercore isi sure mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc and i understand that its hard but its going to get done james west  evercore isi got it okay thanks mark operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of angie sedita with ubs your line is open angie sedita  ubs securities llc thanks good morning mark mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc hi angie angie sedita  ubs securities llc so appreciate the details on the game plan so far and your goals and well look for more later in the year but on the complete portfolio review thats underway certainly you have technology within weatherford and maybe a better ability to monetize and create revenue growth out of those product lines and if you think through those product lines by either segment or region where do you think the opportunities lie where are the products underperforming versus their technology capabilities mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc its too early to really know i mean i have tried to step away from the early parts of this portfolio review im going to have my first meetings on it next week christoph has been driving maybe he can tell you and answer that question but i think that it would be wrong of me to answer that question early what i would say i think that i see opportunity across every single one of our product lines i mean just from the early days thats what i see in some of our very best customers around the world a huge opportunity to significantly expand our share and weve got the tools its interesting that there are some customers where we have a really large share of one product line and then the next customer a really large share of another product line and those customers are doing the same thing just sort of inconsistency about how weve gone to market and how weve sold and built relationships or even demonstrated the prowess of the technology portfolio we have so i just look at that going okay you know what theres opportunity everywhere and its palpable and thats actually exciting to me quite frankly that theres so much out there and customers as i said have been very supportive and theyre cheerleading in the back they want weatherford to be a strong competitor in this market and theyre willing to help us do what we need to do given the feedback and the direction to help us get this thing going in the right direction angie sedita  ubs securities llc all right fair enough and then if you could tap onto updated comments on working capital and how much now youve been in there more than a month and youve been there a little longer how much cash do you think is still trapped on the balance sheet specifically in inventory and what product lines and inventories is sitting on your balance sheet and what do you think is easily monetizable versus what would take time christoph bausch  weatherford international plc angie this is christoph ill take that so we had i think we worked relatively well on the receivables this quarter but theres more opportunity there and it depends on the geography as well as you go forward and revenue goes up so you have a draw on receivables just naturally but were very very focused actually on that part on inventory thats where the big opportunities are on our side simply we havent performed in q as to what our expectations were now there is reasons for that were preparing for some contracts as i mentioned in my prepared remarks so this will change going forward and weve put a very big effort in there so we will see some reductions in inventory going forward but its not an easy task because the geographical location and the exact fit of the right piece for the right opportunity but youll see us pushing very very hard on that i dont want to give you a firm number but you will see reductions going forward mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc the inventory number is a huge number its like  billion of inventory on the balance sheet today my early visits its slower moving thats partly a market overlay the fact that the market is slow itself is causing some of that and from a process point of view historically manufacturing pushed product rather than with a pull system and that i think created part of this problem so talk about these initiatives to review processes part of that when i talk about supply chain is reforming that so that as we do service delivery that we reframe this thing to be a pull system versus a push and stop that and so weve initiated processes so that there is high visibility around the world of whats on the shelf where it is and trying to give a pass to folks to move that stuff around as expeditious as we can start working it off but it would work off a lot faster and easier if we had a market to sell into and thats the problem is the market continues to be a bit slow particularly in many of our international markets its going to take a little while to work off angie sedita  ubs securities llc all right fair enough thanks ill turn it over operator thank you and your next question comes from the line of sean meakim with jpmorgan your line is open sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc thanks good morning mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc hey sean christoph bausch  weatherford international plc good morning sean sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc so on the portfolio review you mentioned being agnostic coming in and the onestim deal seems like a real opportunity for you to generate some cash but also maintain some upside in what could be a better overall business once its up and running so as youre doing the portfolio review are you also looking at other value creation levers like that more jvs other types of more creative ways that can help you fix your balance sheet but also improve what your leverage looks like to a recovery eventually mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc yes the answer is yes not only jvs that would be productline oriented but also there are some potential jvs that are regional oriented that might – that we might look at that are in the mix it would also be fair to say that as we evaluate product lines and understand what their future are to the extent that a fix might be an acquisition thats something that were going to factor in too and how do we acquire the technology that we need or whatever else and sometimes that might be through a partnership or jv so were just – i said its a pretty thorough and expansive review trying to really understand how the portfolio works today how it will work in the future and how it could work together its something thats not been done so its a clean sheet here but weve got to do it and were moving fast on it sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc absolutely yes seems like creativity could lead to a lot of good opportunities mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc yes sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc so on the land rig fleet so for the land rig fleet can you help us understand what can be done to improve profitability to a point where it can really help you to maximize value i guess im think about we dont have a lot of public comps for international land rigs but where we do were still seeing generally pretty good ebitda margins weatherford is closer to breakeven is that just a function of fixed cost absorption in too many subscale markets is it day rates or legacy contracts the makeup of the fleet i guess it would be helpful to get a sense of the levers you have to improve that business which i know it seems like sales fairly accelerated but what are the levers you have to present that fleet in the best possible condition for sale mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc yes the biggest single factor right now is just utilization right i mean rigs are great when theyre working and when theyre not it can be punitive and so a part of the issue has been just during this downturn a number of these rigs are positioned in sections of the market that are not working in the middle east has been a different situation there a high percentage are working and they have moved they have moved profitable so thats probably the single biggest factor here is continuing to get them to work part of the issue has been that we have one and two rigs spread out sort of all over the world and that does make a difference the second factor new leadership there has been working aggressively to lean out the organization to take out costs like other product lines within the weatherford portfolio it sits very separate from the other product lines and so its got its own locations and operations and functions in every single geography that it operates in and so trying to make sure that thats – the organization is as lean as possible it can be has been part of the issue as well so theyve been working hard on that and they made a lot of changes early which youre seeing the results of now the third thing that i would tell you is really around execution right i think one of the concerns have been inconsistent service and execution which not only resulted sometimes in rigs being laid down customers will say okay were not going to use that rig or just inability to get them working you lose money by having to refund outofservice quality issues they made a significant shift on that in the last quarter had very very good performance and so as that continues that should also improve too and again thats management its leadership and process discipline just as were trying to drive across the entire weatherford organization sean c meakim  jpmorgan securities llc got it thats very helpful feedback thank you mark operator thank you mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc i think that – go ahead well take one more question operator your next question comes from the line of kurt hallead with rbc your line is open kurt hallead  rbc capital markets llc look at that thank you mark for letting me in on this kind of the last one mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc hi kurt sure kurt hallead  rbc capital markets llc so mark you laid out everything i know youve got a game plan and a process and youre going to provide us with some more interesting stuff come the fourth quarter the  billion reduction or  reduction in debt i should say by the end of  if you were to generally kind of map that out how much of that – you dont have to give specifics right im just looking at generality how would you kind of consider that debt reduction in terms of free cash flow from operations visàvis asset sales visàvis improved market conditions in terms of generating higher net income just roughly how do you think that might map out mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc right now the way i kind of view it its probably going to come onethird from cash generation from the company and twothirds from dispositions or transactionaltype work kurt hallead  rbc capital markets llc okay and then i appreciate that stat mark so that would also not include the warrant that obviously not include the converts right mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc thats right kurt hallead  rbc capital markets llc right thats awesome mark ill just keep it there i appreciate it thanks mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc okay thank you mark a mccollum  weatherford international plc all right thank you

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate
