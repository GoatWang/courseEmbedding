reporter at the huffington post and im based in greater new york city area there are a lot of challenges that come with the growth of a company especially with a business as complex as a restaurant but if handled correctly all those struggles can be overcometake maggianos little italy for example it exists in the higherend chain restaurant category with competitors like the cheesecake factory and pf changs china bistro it has semiscratch kitchens large locations and multiple business lines that make it particularly hard to scale and yet it managed to grow in fact maggianos is the only highend italian food chain that has scaled to the size it is right now  restaurantshow did it pull that off maggianos president steve provost shares his thoughts on how he has built the companys reputation while staying true to its originssmall player advantageeconomics is destiny in any business provost says while there are some challenges we also have the advantage of not spending a lot of money on expensive tv commercials talking about how good we are we want your friends to tell you how good we aresmaller brands with a megaphone now have an advantage the world is changing and the beauty of being a smaller player is that were now in a better world for nonmarketers provost says with the rise of social you can tell your story much more extensively staying true to its brandtheres no simple answer for what a company should do with its brand since each one is different all you can do is stay true to your ownthe hardest thing about any brand is whatever you do has to be done off of who you are provost says the ideas that stick are the ideas that fit the brandfor maggianos its brand is about being indulgent thats how consumers think of it it can never instantly reverse itself and become all about health for instanceits also focused on family diners go there to eat in a big group for long periods of time and they expect exquisite service if maggianos cant provide that expected level of service then it has failedacting small and big maggianos has combined two models of doing business the entrepreneurial model and the big company model the entrepreneurial model involves one innovator with a great gut instinct and the ability to stay nimble and react quickly to what customers think while the big company model is about longterm processes that are highly scientific and about getting the customers involved with every process what we try to do at maggianos is get them both together provost says both have flaws the gut instinct could be wrong or you could fall in love with the process and lose sight of the end resultfuture plansour goal is to be a billiondollar brand— restaurants and more—but never sacrifice the unique service experience that we have provost says we want to grow responsibly recruit and develop worldclass chefs and find the sites that are specialread more interviews with entrepreneurs and business experts photo courtesy of
