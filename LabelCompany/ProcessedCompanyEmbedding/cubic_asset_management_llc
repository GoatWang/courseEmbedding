knowledgeable buyer would evaluate a business for acquisition in its entirety  the business should be reasonably easy to understand have favorable longterm prospects be managed by competent individuals with integrity and just as importantly be available at a price which represents a discount from its intrinsic value   the larger the discount the less risk the investor assumes and the greater the margin of safety  this approach is widely referred to as “value investing”  the purchase of an asset at a price not predicated upon an estimate of its value is simply speculation     home

of interest rate forecasters those who don’t know where interest rates are going and those who don’t know that they don’t know john kenneth galbraith q  it’s the culture stupid prior to the brexit vote in june political pundits and pollsters were unanimous in predicting that british voters would reject leaving the eu and vote their pocketbooks but the electorate instead voted to resist the homogenization of britain causing stocks to plummet worldwide this overreaction to bad news is a wellstudied phenomenon which often creates a buying opportunity for those able to act against the crowd q  hour town the “gig” economy has shown explosive growth in recent years and shows no sign of slowing down apps such as uber or lyft allow individuals to pursue earning a living working only when they want to without reporting to a traditional office or boss in this essay we argue that the primary beneficaries of this trend are likely to be corporations who can staff by using independent contractors who do not receive benefits like health insurance or paid vacations for workers though the seductiveness of being your own boss may very well lead to reduced earning power with no career advancement q  when less is more more or less the federal reserve’s zero interest rate policy zirp has prompted investors to cast an unusually wide net in the search for investment returns one result has been that many startup companies have been able to raise large amounts of capital from institutional investors without being subjected to the discipline required to go public many mutual funds are among the investors in these prepublic entities and they use varying methodologies to value their holdings resulting in identical shares being priced at vastly different prices this seems likely to cause a problem since mutual funds promise daily liquidity at their published net asset value despite the fact that some of their holdings have imprecise values and no liquidity q  central banker wardrobe suit tie  flipflops in the same way that some fashions skinny ties or short hemlines swing in and out of favor the popularity of specific central bank policies also varies over time it was not long ago that federal reserve officials argued that the us should pursue a stronger dollar this is now out of favor though and fed officials would prefer a weaker dollar to stimulate exports this essay explores the investments likely to prosper when the pendulum of fed policy swings back q  no fracking way college campuses witnessed the start of several divestiture movements one example was to urge the sale of shares of companies doing business in south africa as a means of opposing apartheid the latest movement favors the sale of all energy companies in endowment portfolios in this essay we suggest that calls for divestiture may not be the most effective way to produce change q  bigger than elvis soaring pharmaceutical prices are very much in the headlines but the forces which have encouraged this escalation show no signs of abating and political rhetoric notwithstanding should continue this trend for some time to come q  the golden rule corporate activists are making headlines by taking huge stakes in public companies and agitating for change but money management expertise does not imply expertise in managing a company any more than athletic prowess in one sport implies the ability to excel in another q  investing is not always ebola cherries the stock market experienced a sharp drop in the fall many explanations for the drop were put forward but the most likely was the fear of a global ebola pandemic in this essay we examine the economic consequences of previous epidemics and conclude that the markets reaction is overdone and most likely represents a good entry point q  the rolling stones as management gurus every good parent knows that it is necessary to use an appropriate combination of rewards and punishments to foster appropriate behavior in children  your allowance will increase if you make your bed every morning or there will be no tv for a week if you hit your sister again carrots and sticks are important drivers of executive behavior too here we examine several examples of bonus systems which work against the creation of shareholder value and offer a template for aligning management and shareholder interests q  herd on the street the longterm outperformance of value investing over growth has been well documented nevertheless most investors utilize the latter approach plowing money into the same trendy stocks in this essay we examine data that suggests that the economic environment tends to push investors toward one style or the other but the propensity to be a value investor appears to also have a genetic component like most complex behaviors they arise from a combination of nature and nurture q  the ultimatum game the media is rife with articles about the widening disparity in incomes between the top  of earners and everyone else recent research in psychology shows that when people feel that the system is unfair they are willing to make irrational economic decisions hurting themselves provided it also hurts those of whom they are envious we suggest that improved education is the only politically palatable way to narrow the perceived inequality q  comparing apples and nonapples the market value of nearly every wellknown consumer products company far exceeds its tangible book value that is because the biggest asset of such companies is the value of their brands an offbalance sheet item in this essay we discuss the short product life for most technology consumer products and argue that investors should not assign the same value to a brand like apple as to brands like coca cola or mcdonalds q  taking the hypocritic oath we are inundated with hypcrisy evangelical ministers involved in sex scandals politicians voting for policies they opposed as candidates and actors flitting from city to city in their private jets to lecture the rest of us on how to reduce our carbon footprint corporate executives are frequently guilty of failing to walk the talk too in this essay we review recent research which suggests that we should pay as much attention to management integrity as we do to income statement and balance sheet analysis since good behavior is statistically linked to superior returns q  a bad case of apophenia apophenia also known as patternicity is the phenomenon of seeing patterns or connections in random or meaningless data wall street traders are constantly studying data to tease out potentially profitable patterns but just as when someone perceives the image of a famous person in a piece of burnt toast many of the patters are spurious and lead to flawed trading rules in this essay we consider several wellknown trading rules which while widely accepted are not likely to o consistent profitability q  losing interest as we age traditional asset allocation models usually advise individuals to increase their bond exposure and decrease their stock allocation as they get older but with interest rates at a historic low we suggest that capital losses on fixed income securities are almost certain over the next few years so that contrary to conventional wisdom a higher stock allocation may be the more conservative course q  algos gone wild high frequency trading hft is the use of computers and computational algorithms to quickly trade securities such trading now account for an estimated  of all securities trading in the united states and have undoubtedly increase market liquidity but as is always the case where huge sums of money are involved many hft firms aided by exchanges seduced by the enormous commissions generated have engaged in questionable behavior which have tilted the playing field against the individual investor unfortunately in recent years the algorithms have occasionally broken down and destabilized the markets in this essay we examine this phenomenon and propose a potential remedy q  collateral damage the federal reserves policy of keeping interest rates low has been successful in helping to stabilize the fragile banking sector and revive the depressed housing market but accommodative monetary policy can have unintended consequences here we examine how record low rates have lowered the discount rate by which corporations value their pension liabilities forcing many companies to use the profits generated by the recovery to make outsized pension contributions rather than create jobs q  channeling captain louis renault in the classic movie casablanca captain louis renault professes to be shocked shocked to find gambling going on in this establishment despite having accepted bribes to look the other way this essay examines how our political class expresses similar outrage that many large corporations and wealthy individuals pay little in the way of taxes while accepting campaign contributions to create loopholes q  the worlds best discount store individual investors frequently express frustration that stocks often rise after a seemingly negative new story and fall after reporting good news in this essay we consider the process of discounting which is the markets way of incorporating future news into todays prices q  sinos problems corporate america seems uniformly obsessed with doing business in china in this essay we consider how normally riskaverse ceos are tripping over each other to build market share there while ignoring flagrant disregard for intellectual property rights unreliable market data rampant corruption confiscatory corporate tax rates and protectionist policies q  living in the future in science it is standard practice to perform experiments measure the results and then use the data to validate a hypothesis in a federal system of government the states can frequently serve as a laboratory for testing alternative approaches to societal problems we examine several instances in which states have approached the same issues in vastly different ways which resulted in vastly different outcomes and note that there seems to be little point in experimentation when the data is routinely ignored q  gray matter insider trading has been very much in the news lately yet despite a spate of high profile convictions there is no single statute which uses the phrase insider trading defines who is an insider or delineates which information is material this essay explores the tension between regulators who prefer vague laws that permit expansive interpretation and market participants who seek clarity about which acts are illegal and which are not q  chainsaw ben an exploration of the unintended consequences of the federal reserves massive stimulus program one of which is the reluctance of corporations to hire when faced with margin pressure from soaring commodity prices q  confirmation hearings an essay about confirmation bias the nearuniversal tendency to focus on data which supports our beliefs while ignoring contrary data and which frequently leads to poor investment decisions q  etfs – extremely tricky financial securities etfs closedend mutual funds which trade continuously throughout the day like stocks have enjoyed explosive growth in this essay we consider how their unique structure sometimes causes them to diverge sharply from the indices they are supposed to track and how they hold the potential to destabilize markets in unexpected ways q  the tyranny of the few anecdotal evidence of the way in which litigation by a few activists stalls economic development that would benefit society as a whole while acknowledging that the resulting loss of american jobs and competitiveness may be the inevitable price for avoiding the ecological degradation that frequently accompanies unfettered development q  the doctrine of people infallibility an examination of the phenomenon in which a group of independent individuals often make more accurate predictions than experts and the divergent forecasts now being sent by stock and bond investors q  ben bernanke homeopath an essay on the longterm risks to the american economy from the federal reserve’s prescription for artificially low interest rates as a cure for the problems that resulted from the previous period of artificially low interest rates q  uncle sam ceo an examination of the history of the nationalization of private enterprises in the us and the likely impact of the current wave of nationalizations on longterm competitiveness q  morton’s fork an essay about how conflicting government policy objectives can place executives between a rock and a hard place and undermine confidence in the capital markets q  alfred e newman for president an analysis of the implications of the looming huge shortfall in the social security and medicare trust funds and recommendations for how to position portfolios q  the mother of all margin calls how the world’s financial system nearly unraveled in the aftermath of the collective delusion that real estate could only appreciate q  a free ticket to the grandstand speculators have long served as the scapegoat for the nation’s financial ills but a nuanced analysis suggests that the role of speculators and their tools derivatives is essential to the functioning of a modern economy q  adventures in kiting an analysis of how the federal reserve’s low interest rate policy ultimately created the credit crunch q  nothing recedes like excess a brief description of the statistical phenomenon of regression to the mean and why it suggests that investors should be buying rather than selling stocks q  ingeneious investing spock vs charles darwin a discussion of the manner in which
