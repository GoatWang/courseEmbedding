troubleshooting eventually tech help who said send it back under warranty i did but hp can’t seem to fix the machine they built waiting now nearly a month no updates i have to constantly check on the service page to find status as hp does not send any timely info the estimated repair dates have been consistently wrong and aren’t updated unless i get through the hellish maze of contact pages and chat with a real person so the simple truth i have learned don’t buy hp laptops reply sandy morris may   at  am summary of laptop model  aynr serial  cdnxt as i write this summary i would like you to keep in mind that i am a yearold woman probably old enough to be your grandmother and i feel that i have been treated unfairly and that this laptop is not the quality i expected from hp i currently own  other hp computers and an hp printer which is why i purchased this new laptop my  pavilion dv with a pentium  has much more dependability and better sound and much better quality purchased during thanksgiving holiday  case ’s       note i can forward all emails associated with the support tickets if there were any initial support techs blamed the computer issues on not using internet explorer and other support techs wanted after about  minutes to sell smart friend one tech person named raj was excellent and i believe he was in quality control he transferred me after trying several different things to tech person named pradeep in the hardware team pradeep put request in to send me a box to send the laptop to hp service for repair  shipped to jefferson indiana for repair  was notified case was being transferred from leo sanchez x because he was being assigned to a new area leo sanchez is an excellent employee  received email from sabrina x  computer shipped back and received on  – note from tech said missing drivers new hard drive and new fan installed  began reinstalling all software  notified sabrina – no sound blue tooth issues tons of registry errors no response back  reemailed sabrina same issues no response  emailed sabrina with continuing issues  contacted hp forum to request info on how to reach corporate or a higher up tech support  sabrina emailed saying she understands we have same issues  sabrina emailed saying she had been out on a birthday celebration holiday and was forwarding my issue to mike x and it was case   received email from mike and emailed him back with time and day to call he did not call during designated time  emailed my disappointment that he failed to call during appointed time he had agreed to  email from mike saying family emergency for his not calling  case was turned over to donavan moore x  received message and email from donavan to set up time to call on   worked with donavan on computerfixed sound  received email and spoke with donavan to schedule for  after my next webinar to see if results of his work were completely fixed  i had scheduling issue so rescheduled for   spoke at length with donavan and worked on computer again reinstalled audio and other drivers a nd flash program and a nd java plus silverlight adjustment told him i would need to attend my next webinar to see if it played and then get back to him he gave me a private email to email him donavanmoore at hpcom i asked him to hold the status of my issues until i got back to him via email at that address  emailed donavan to private email no response  emailed donavan to private email no response  emailed donavan both to private and to original support email no response  emailed sabrina no response  contacted hp forum i would also like you to know that on  i took it upon myself to contact microsoft to verify that the issues the computer was having were not relating to the windows operating system i spent  grueling days with microsoft support completing several different tests with the end result being that the windows operating system is functioning properly in summary i do not feel that i can trust this laptop computer any longer sincerely sandy morris reply zalak dave april   at  pm with highly unreliable products just stop selling laptops altogether reply zalak dave april   at  pm i have hp pavilion aucl laptop and it is experience kernel power issues for over  months now repeated calls with the hp tech support has only resulted in formatting the laptop over and over again and failed repair attempts the tech support is hopeless cannot figure out the problem with their own system and hp won’t even replace until god know how many failed repair attempts highly disappointed in hp not likely to recommend at all replace or refund reply tamara wanzer april   at  pm i have an hp envy  this is my second hp laptop  i have been having so many issues with this device and whenever i call in for help i have to reset it or restore and i’m tired of this so many times i have lost pictures and things like that that i cant get back i am currently a college student that takes classes online and all of these issues are causing a lot of problems there is always trouble starting and shutting down and when it is on an error message comes up asking me to take recovery options the laptop sometimes makes a ticking sound for what reason i don’t know and that is just the beginning of what i have endured with this laptop reply teresa d fitzgerald april   at  pm i am going to the news facebookcomterehidalgofitzgerald reply teresa d fitzgerald april   at  pm probably hp should take the complaints as a way to improve their business customer service and product quality i feel good to know that i am not the only person that feels treated unfairly but i wish things will get better this affect all the party involved the credit card companies the retail stores that sell hp and the consumer reputation worth more than money now i know the reason the sales man in staples was trying to help me to get another brand probably it is a coincidence probably no… reply teresa d fitzgerald april   at  pm i got my hp laptop in december and the pc cracked when i closed the lid after several attempts of negotiate hp blames me for their defective product and do not want to honor its manufacturer warrantee please review my records i am not a liar i have been an hp customer for years and i do not deserve this treatment hp resolution was to for me to put in my credit card a  dollars debit for then send me a  dollars coupon toward another hp without fixing my laptop this is not right my case number is  i wonder how hp gets away with treating their loyal customer like this i bought my pc from staples and i am still paying for it now i need to think what to do next but it would be nice if hp will come to a resolution reply kim fuller march   at  am i purchased a computer and returned it when i called and talked to the return department the girl did a good job i was so upset i didn’t want to purchase another laptop then i rethought things and called back i talked to customer service they told me something totally different from the return girl the person i spoke with spoke with her supervisor and he only agreed to give me  off purchase i called today st time i called…i sat there on the phone after someone answered it and didn’t say anything…i kept saying hello…hello… is anyone there…i could here typing on the computer…after  minutes of this the call was disconnected i called back upset of course and talked to customer service again so this will be the rd person about going ahead and purchasing the computer he gave me a totally different price and told me i wouldn’t get the same thing as i returned just with a different processor he would not honor the  unless i purchased the  yr warranty i asked for him to listen to the tapes of the other calls he stated he couldn’t do that i asked to speak to a supervisor he told me a supervisor wouldn’t help me i asked to have to supervisor pull the tapes of my previous conversations and told him this is the rd price i have gotten for this computer and the price keeps going up each time he told me a supervisor could not do that and would not help me i am very disappointed with the customer service i have received i have  hp desktops and wanted to purchase a laptop if i would have known all the problems i would have had… i am very disappointed and upset will not be purchasing a hp again you have lost a customer especially after the way the last caller handled the call he should definitely not be in sales reply rhonda baker march   at  pm i have been a loyal hp customer since i purchased my first hp desktop in  it is an all in one touchsmart  with the bare minimums gb ram but it has served me well i am currently working on a degree in graphic design and as my classes and software have become more complicated i decided to purchase a new laptop as i also have an hp laser jet printer and have had nothing but the best service and products getting an hp laptop was a no brainer i purchased the notebook with  gb ram and better graphics imagine my surprise when i began working with the laptop it is much slower than my old desktop and keeps giving me an error message i work   hour shifts and commute over an each way daily so i don’t time on week days to call tech support i was off today friday and was excited to get my issue fixed no i purchased the laptop on  and called today  and was told that my warranty has expired and that i will have to pay for technical support to fix the issue are you kidding me i have had a product for four months and it has not worked as it should from the very beginning i am outraged that hp does not take care of its products or customers you have lost one of your best customers due to your lack of quality in your products and due to your lack of support i will tell you that with a career in graphic design i need a product that is dependable i also know that i will need to upgrade regularly i can tell you that i will no longer be purchasing hp products and i will also tell my friends and coworkers so that they will not consider purchasing an hp product reply rhonda baker march   at  pm i am sorry about the typo in there i commute over an hour each way to work so my days are usually   to  hour days reply steven stockholder march   at  pm i agree with analysts – hp is too big and as a result cant achieve customers satisfaction reply henry march   at  am case nocncmtn  refdghqkmwref  i have for reference your service call report s no   attached my various mail and letters regarding my new printer atb series dh sl no cncmtn as can be seen from the service report of  the scanner top cover was found to be broken and was “waiting for warranty” validation four months have passed and there is still no news at all from hp regarding the replacement of my printer cover i contacted hp on the nd instant and was given the name and phone number  of ms moumita who i was told could help me when i rang her up she mentioned she was busy scheduling the engineers’ to send her all details and she would ring back in half an hourone hour the call did not come on the rd inst i tried contacting ms moumita again at am am and at pm the first two attempts went in vain as the phone just kept on ringing third time lucky as soon as i mentioned my name “henry castellino” she promptly repeated “henry castellino” and handed the phone over to one mr sarfaraz who told me the printer cover was a “cosmetic item” hence was not available but if i sent him my invoice copy he would calculate under some toffer the amount i could get as a discount for purchasing a new printer to process this discount he said he would require my invoice copy… i sent the invoice copy on the rd instant…till date no reply… may i have frank answers to the following…  is hpiqor waiting for the warranty to expire before replying  i have attached photographs of the breakage is it possible under whatever circumstances for a customerend user to break the top cover in that way – the clip has chipped off if a customer had broken the top cover the whole clip would have broken off  i have reattached photographs of your service engineer opening and repairing the “stuck scanner” this was repaired twice so i feel that at that time the cover had been broken this only came to light when i was working with the printer on november nd   all this apart from the experience i have had so far with hp and allies i feel i would have to pay for a new scanner top cover which reluctantly i guess i would perforce have to i find it difficult to comprehend how within a matter of  months spare parts for a new premium printer is not available…hence i would request you to kindly arrange to supply and fit a scanner top cover for my new printer atb series dh sl no cncmtn purchased on  installed by you on  or replace the same with a new one no discountdepreciated values andor the likes is acceptable to me on my existing printer regards henry

information and necessary action please reply gina march   at  pm no customer service no live people all numbers go to automation lousy products reply harvey february   at  pm hp scam alert  i find this very disturbing the fact that hp has indeed bein breeched by scammers they are calling from hp’s legitimate   they have all client information  phone numbers  email  home address  previous computer problems  your sales info  ect ect  this is disturbing and they need to rectify this situation its there responsibility to protect there customers and when i talk to customer service they have the nerve to tell me its my fault if when i have a call back date scheduled with legitimate hp tech support and the scammer also has this information so the scammer calls from hp’s legitimate phone number and knows all specific account details and then he randomly asks for remote access  wtf  so i told him to call back later and let him play around on windows  just to see if he was a actual technician and he was fraudulent  i suspected it so i didn’t get fooled  but i work on computers every day  this might not seem odd to the average user that’s waiting on a call back from hp … hp needs to correct this imideatly reply karen february   at  pm i had to call corporate i’m working with someone he said they will send the same one they will send to me and i get it i’ll send the other one back my prob is i got an hp back in jun best buy from set to dec of  had it more them me i took it  times the last time they could not fix it so they gave a gift card to get another on well

better one as this has cost me time and money as i run a small biz for all my hassle well today we can give a gift card what the heck ya i got a better price at best buy i’ve have to pay an extra  more nope i calling again today and give them a piece of my mind i told hp needs to right by me reply eric february   at  pm purchased a hp laptop for my daughter’s birthday in december  soon after she had problems with the charging connection on the laptop called and set up a case and repair number sent it in in early january  i called in early february and they tell me it wouldn’t be reay till april  that’s about  months without my daughters labor she uses for school school will be out in late may on top of that it only a year warranty on laptop so i’m getting beat out of  months worth of the warranty deal tried to talk to someone in charge and they gave me the run around called corporate and just sent me right back to the first people i started this ideal with worse costumer service i have ever encountered and i have delta with some bad one but this one makes those look like a cake walk i usually don’t leave reviews or replies but i needed to do this i’m going to tell my kids family members and anyone who even thinks of purchasing a product from hp to think twice and they better warn anyone they care about to stay far away from hp products it’s that bad reply mandy v february   at  am i’ve always had dell computers and never had problems with them but for some reason in december  i thought i’d try hp and purchased an all in one pavilion  desktop computer and all i’ve had are problems with it it’s been sent to hp x for repair and the problems continue here are the errors that continually come up when the pc is turned on “hard disk error smartcheck not installed long dst not installed and this error comes up almost every time the pc is turned on “errorno boot disk has been detected or the disk has failed” what is this all about i have to manually turn the computer off and on several times before it works properly i have continually called hp and all they can offer me is additional warranty for year heck no one technician asked me where i had purchased the computer and when i told him best buy he told me that could be the problem because vendors keep their computers on shelves for years and by the time they are sold the systems on the pc are outdated and may cause it to have problems really seriously my computer has been returned to hp x for repairs and the apparent repair action shows as replacedhdd so why do i continue to have the same problems i’m done with hp will never purchase another one of your products reply m jamison february   at  pm “if you don’t take care of your customers someone else will” ll bean btw they have a

ago now its slow and the techs wont help they say i need to purchase a extra plan why does hp offer tech support if they wont help so much for customer servicei need this reformatted and they told me its a software problem your competor i wont mention who always helped me reply coolcondor january   at  pm i purchased a laptop a few month ago now its slow and the techs wont help they say i need to purchase a extra plan why does hp offer tech support if they wont help so much for customer servicei need this reformatted and they told me its a software problem your competor i wont mention who

february   at  pm i dont mean to offend anyone at hp but—— if you market hp computers you should stand behind what you sell hpsells you a computer and then when something goes wrong and you call for tech support all they do is try to upsell to purchase additional support this is a joke  if someone purchased a computer from hp i guess they want you to buy if it needs formatting or repair they just want you to purchse a new one or repair from a third party coolcondor march   at  pm i am looking now for a desktop  hp needs an overhaul of employees if i had to rate customer service it would be  cynthia january   at  pm first i’ll say i know no business is perfect…but i’m quite frustrated with hp and the way they’re doing their business i ordered a laptop and wireless mouse on dec   for my daughter christmas gift well my problem is i have not received her laptop as of today jan   this is totally unacceptable coming from a very reputable company i’ve been on the phone numerous times hours minutes and days first the laptop was being held in “customs in china”… really i live in the us and should have my laptop by now i was told i wouldn’t get it before christmas so i had to buy another gift for my daughter to suffice for the laptop not getting to her on time as planned and knowing three weeks was more than enough time to receive it in the meanwhile i mentioned to the hp rep that i wasn’t going to be at my job the week after christmas and i was assured they would reroute the laptop to my home address well that did not happen it showed up at my job while it was closed for business and “returned to sender” now for the past two weeks after talking with two “hp rep and two hp supervisors” my laptop is still sitting at supposedly the hp warehouse and no one seems to be able to reach the warehouse for some reason i’ve asked for some sort of compensation for my inconvenience and i was offered a  credit… really hp the hp reps at this point have no clue what’s going on and again this is totally unacceptable and i will spread the word furiously with everyone who it matters… bbb yelp ftc etc… i will give them till the end of the week and if no word of my laptop… i will get my full refund back for the laptop and wireless mouse dell i’ll be on your website because i don’t see it arriving on or before friday… reply joyce johnson january   at  pm dear sir i have

drive restore which did not work before doing the hard drive restore i specifically asked  times what about the word programs and other programs i just downloaded and she stated don’t worry we can get them back so i asked are you going to get them back and reinstall them and she responded with yes yes don’t worry we will fix it for you guess what no one at hp is going to help me and basically told me they don’t know what to tell me call microsoft word thank you for not only crashing my business computer but know i myself have to restore everything before i can finish my accounting for my accountant to do year end stuff thank you for screwing me over in case hp doesn’t realize this the federal government has a deadline on when to get out w’s this has not been the only problem i have

gangster outfit reply georgia kubat september   at  pm my name is georgia i am writing in regards to the hp stream notebook that i purchased back in march of  back in late may i couldnt get it to download the updates for it i called talked to a young gal and she got it done the next time i called it would not boot up so that my husband and i could use it i called again and was put on hold and hung up on  times when i finally got to talk to someone i had been on hold for  minutes when the young man that i was talking to got rude with me and accused me of not doing the backup step i ended up getting a flash drive for free to get it working again after several attempts to get it working it finally worked about  weeks ago i came home from work to have my husband tell me that the screen to the computer is broken i right away took a look at it there is no damage to any part of the computer except for the screen underneath the top screen i just called your help desk and was accused of damaging the computer all that was done to the computer was the screen was cleaned by my husband while it was off he turned it on to use it and found that the screen was cracked i was told that the screen being cracked is not covered by your warranty because it was an accidental damage we did nothing to it except clean the screen i must tell you that i am not happy with the service that i have gotten from your people at your customer service center most of them are rude and are quick to accuse the customer of damaging the product i take very good care of my computers i have never had a problem with any computer as much as i have had with hp unless i can get some help resolving this issue i have no choice but to tell my family and friends that hp does nothing to help you out if you have a problem with their hp computer that the warranty is no good so they might as well leave it in the box and not use it i hope that i will get some kind of a response to this email i can be reached at  if i dont answer please leave a message and i will get back to you as soon as i can thank you for your time in this matter georgia kubat reply olga otero august   at  pm my brother purchased an hp pavilion laptop from cotsco for me i barely got it out the box and had trouble with the system shutting down due to memory failure i also noticed the speaker grid was not comepletely perforated i suppose the factory in china was only concerned with getting the item out rather than a quality product a full diagnostic was never performed before shipping neither was the right processors were used as far as i can ascertain i would like to return the laptop for an exchange or return i’m only hesitating due to the fact that my brother will have to be notified and he would not be “happy” about it to say the least i was told a shippingu box will bie sent to me to return the laptop for repair my cocern is if a “supposedly freshly” built brand new laptop needs repair how long will it last the laptop’s original price was just over  my brother specifically waited to get it on sale to think he wanted to buy a more advanced model makes me very relieved i cannot see the value of this laptop for the price their asking—even on sale for half price of the sale price i hope this incident can be resolved without foo much “drama” reply mike schell august   at  pm the contact numbers you show hear for their hp corporate are no longer accurate nor is the   “helpline” number…the corp office one which has been “good” for some years is disconnected the helpline one takes you to something called “keitel corporation” in albany ny of course hp is in the tall grass again this has got to be one of the worst companies ever…not that they always were once upon a time the exact opposite was true now you can’t even get hold of them because they are such a miserable company everyone there is hiding under his or her desk lovely reply tammy robinson august   at  pm hi mike

believed what this guy is taling about for your agent before give me the four year warranty as stated if hp is committed to the warranty of their machine for one year i don’t see any reason this warrantry was not honored also to remind you your agent is hard to understand and not fit for customer satisfaction explanation need your answer to this matter reply jeff adler july   at  pm just received my custom hp t laptop and upon unpacking unit heard loose parts rattles from inside unit called customer service agent had her own agenda and would not listen to what i had to say after over one hour she gave me an address for a service center in my area hover it was not a service center but now a gaming center called tech support but they could not help and said i should possibly return

staples six months ago i was told that my computer should be replaced and was told that a box would be sent to me a week ago i never got it i have spent a total of   hours trying to get resolution i have been disconnected repeatedly i have been told by both the it person and the staples manager that the computer should be replaced this is incredibly exasperating and if i don’t get this resolved i

solid product and stood behind your workmanship hp envy m the left hinge is separating the casing of the keyboard portion of the computer countless reports online of the same thing happening to others after calling customer “support” and speaking to someone from another country and his supervisor it has become clear that your company does not stand behind its products you created a product with a faulty part your company should fix the part free of charge you have lost a customer and any future positive reference for your products thank you for the frustration and complete dissatisfaction reply erin june   at  am on the phone with hp yet again for our recently purchased hp envy the unit has been disabled more than it has been operable while hp support has attempted to be helpful by running remote diagnostics and hours of apologies for my inconvenience there has been no resolve i was instructed to reinstall the os and that was supposed to fix the issue but again no dice finally the unit was shipped back to hp for repair this week i received the unit back and here i am on the phone with hp i called in with my case number and was quickly advised that i should call the repair department at the moment i am being batted around hp’s customer support center repeating the same information over and over again my computer repeatedly freezes in various applications and the only solution is to shut the computer down and restart it this ridiculous for a brand new cpu to be performing at this level i am currently using my old trusty  year old hp all in one while the new and “improved one is being trouble shot i am utterly disgusted with the amount of time that has been invested in trying to fix this cpu just send me a replacement unit and i will be happy reply dee may   at  pm i have been on the phone with hp store for over an hour been speaking with the taliban still waiting on my hard earn money now on the phone with corporate headquarters and that too is also a joke so they pair me me with this fool named jamal whose also breathing hard over the phone then had the nerve to tell me i was getting an attitude its not my fault you cant breathe and very unprofessional i used to think hp was good now i know the services behind them is wack even at headquarters i was on hold for nearly  hours that headquarters with jamal he was rude then send me to a leon who seem nice but we got nowhere thanksfornothinghp reply n cruz may   at  pm i have had hp’s for a long time since college med school etc… within the past few years and in an effort to compete with other companies that produce the same products hp has failed beyond reproach i have unfortunately had to work with hp’s “technical”and “case management” departments for well over months and counting regarding a laptop that cost nearly  the last “case manager” i will use initials instead of the employees full name “t” i worked with and  replacement laptops later i shared i did not want to continue the laptop tradeoffs and wanted a full refund of which they a had the original receipt and i will purchase a different laptop via a different company until hp sorts out their “issues” with the devices he agreed many days later i receive an email not the courtesy of a phone call that the case manager “t” i had built a relationship with has been replaced with another after speaking with the new case manager  “m” after the receipt of the email it is obvious he had and still has no intention on wrapping this matter up i contacted the “corporate” office at  and asked for the office of the president the representative “j” shared “we stand by the case managers and i will contact your case manager” hp has no concern about the customer after reading the posts on this site it is painfully clear there is no allegiancerespectregard or there of as it pertains to hp and the company’s pseudorelationship with the customer hp has officially lost one of its faithful customers unfortunate best to you reply rameki may   at  pm i’m currently on the phone with hp case manager i’ve been a loyal customer since  after this i’m done with this company forever i’m having issues regarding receiving my laptop which was supposed to be delivered by fed ex a week ago i’m still having trouble getting my package delivered they say they can’t deliver ups but i’ve had this problem previously and they ended up having it delivered ups they should utilize both companies if this is the case i always have problems with fed ex delivery never a problem with ups hp is no help reply randall smith phd july   at  pm your story is truly unfortunate for several important reasons after resigning from the usaf following the vietnam war i accepted a position with ibm corporation first as a field engineer then as a systems engineer and se manager and finally as a marketing representative some of the most valuable lessons i learned from ibm and they were great teachers had to do with providing outstanding service their approach was that there are several good hardware and software manufacturers that customers can choose from the single most important difference that would distinguish us from the competition was customer service whatever it took we did and we never told a customer we could not satisfy a hardware or a software request companies such as hp and dell appeal to a particular marketplace that does not think in terms of service after the sale perhaps price is their overriding concern i had purchased two hps several years ago – one for a collegebound daughter the other for my wife my wife’s computer developed a networking problem over a month ago i have at last count talked with  different “technicians” at various levels none of them knows what they are doing there is no logic no thought flow just an endless series of useless and unproductive activities these kinds of people would never survive working for a company like ibm the mindset is totally different unfortunately those of us who are left to depend on them must find creative nonhp ways to get our computers repaired like yourself i will never have anything to do with hp again remember the “dollar vote” – every time someone buys inferior merchandise they are casting their vote for more of the same best of luck to you reply richard pace march   at  pm i purchased an hp w brand new it doesn’t show a picture at all me knowing a little about cpu’s know that chances are its the video board i’ve contacted hp customer service on tuesday march  after spending  hours of my day on the

send me a box with a free shipping label they said it will take  business days before i will receive the bo’s at my door step today is the third day and still no box never bought something brand new

bought  hp scanjets and none of the buttons work with windows  on hp website it says it is compatible with the g but it is not none of the hp techs can get any of the  scanners to work on a windows  machine so we wanted them to replace them they replaced  of them and since october of  we have had this issue and hp does not seem to want to make it right and replace the others that dont work with windows  even though their site says it will that makes pretty crappy customer service reply rhonda coomer february   at  pm rhonda coomer says i am complaining to the bbb concerning customer service the tech talking me into purchasing a hacking program which he blamed on my doing bill pay oneline and talked me into purchasing a “ total security” to remedy my problem it didn’t help at all and when i called another tech he told me the hp tech scammed me into buying it the same hp company i’ve only had my printer a month and it doesn’t work it has a defect of some kind and keeps telling me there is no ink in the printer and there are errors i hope by contacting the bbb we can have them shut down for good and be compensated for what hp has put us through if that doesn’t work i am getting am attorney reply chris lyons september   at  am i have had the same problem i was hired as an office manager in a new company right after the computer was connected to the internet i couldn’t get the printer to work i called hp and asked them why the printer wasn’t working they told me that the pc has been hacked and it corrupted the printer i told them that it was just connected to the internet service just a few hours ago it cost me  to so called “correct” the problem the company got a new printer because we needed a fax machine everything was working fine but a few weeks later the printer stopped printing again i called hp and they said the printer was corrupted and they would send me a refurbished one in place of the new one that was just purchased and in the mean time they would make this one run…for another  which we paid the company was having a hard time getting online with the internet server we had so we had to switch providers wouldn’t you know it the printer didn’t work again i called hp and they said it was corrupted again and they could fix it for me i said let me guess for another  dollars right i disconnected the phone call and i started looking into the problem myself and i figured it out we have bought two printers and we’re out  what ever you do do not call the support team because it will cost  every time you call reply joseph ascone february   at  pm instant ink very interesting scam i mean program i have just been informed that paying into this program pays for pages used not the ink i also found out that even though i have only used one quarter of the ink in a  mo period and want to cancel my program the cartridges will no longer function very nice scam i was never informed that you “own” the cartridges i thought since i’ve been paying for over a year now that i could at least finish what i haven’t used if i cancel the program you see i only print about  to  pages a month not worth paying into the program i will be sure to inform my friends and family of this scam and i will never buy another hp product again i had an hp printer before this and it never worked right from day one i was constantly on the phone with tech services i thought i’d give hp another chance but as usual there’s always a catch cust service could only apologize which does me no good i am still stuck with this printer not to mention staples has the combo pack ink cartridges for  less than i’ve paid for your instant ink program reply s taylor january   at  am what in the hell where is the freaking instant ink here we go again hp is screwing me again

laptops – one for daughter one for wife my wife almost expired from a brainstem aneurysm several months ago that was followed by a stroke she is bedbound and can only enjoy tv and her laptop about a month ago  it lost networking capability and the dvd drive stopped working i spent hours on the phone talking with  levels of “tech support” no one had a clue several started trying to steer me to “parts repair” which is outside of my maintenance agreement with them one level  technician in canada advised me to order  of cds from “computer surgeons” these have done nothing i replaced the dvd drive with a new one that reads the cds but with no device manager entry for it or for networking i’m not sure what to do with the cds – nor is anyone else at hp as a neuroscientist at a medical school i certainly will not be recommending hp to colleagues students acquaintances friends relatives or anyone else they made their buck dishonestly they won’t make another from me i don’t know how else to get the message to these kinds of vendors if they go into bankruptcy it is due to mismanagement and no sense of sound business ethics reply bruce kittredge january   at  am had a hp laser jet that had mechanical problems in august called hp after several hours on the phone they said that it needed to be replaced and i needed to send them proof of when i brought the printer scanned and emailed the receipt two days and no contact so i called and was told so sorry but the warranty ran out  days prior to me callings do there was nothing they could do for me but they could sell me a new printer no thank you i went to staples instead intending to buy a different brand but there happen to be a hp rep in the store when i was looking at printers and he asked why i was looking at printers other than hp when i told him of my experience with customer support he said he was sorry and if i would reconsider hp he would try to make it up to me for the bad experience i did and he gave me a toner cartridge and a extended warranty for three years that was in september in november when making copies with the auto sheet feeder one or two lines would be through the page but not if i single sheet on the glass yes i cleaned everything just so you know i am a computer technician so i called hp on november th after going through all the gyrations including up dating the firm ware i was told that the printer would have to be replaced and was transferred to a hardware supervisor who took all my info but because their system was down for processing credit cards which was needed to assure returning of the defected printer they would call back as soon as the system was up received all back the next day she placed the order and the replacement printer would arrive dec st cause of the thanksgiving holiday and all no problem since i was going on vacation and was not returning til dec th anyway but someone would be here to receive it when i returned from vacation no printer so i called after  minutes on the phone the “support” person couldn’t under stand why but the order was canceled and that it would have to be reordered ok stuff happens so he transferred me to a hardware supervisor so sorry but they couldn’t place the order right then because there system was down but they would call me back after playing phone tag for a couple of days we finally got together on the phone and he was sorry but he couldn’t place the order i would have to provide proof of purchase at this point i asked if he could send me an email with those instructions he told me no i had to go to such and such website and follow the instructions at this point i insisted that i needed emailed instructionsno he couldn’t do that so he escalated the issue to ruth who is a case manager on the hewlett packard ams tco escalations team responsible for resolving my issue that was on dec st she sent me an email stating the above with her contact info etc upon receiving her email i replied to it with the situation wand a copy of the reciept and all the information to which i got no answer so the next day i replied again to the email still no response we closed for xmas ok i deal with this

to best buy where i bought it and they said there was something wrong where it needed to go back to hp but because hp has the reputation for sending them back not fixed i should call hp first and have

december   at  am i began the saga of getting help on a laptop   hours ago and found this site to describe how much fun it is after a sales pitch from a representative probably in india who guaranteed a solution to my issue i agree to pay  for a one time service he asked me to hold for a few minutes to make sure the payment was made sure enough after about ten minutes he came back and said everything was fine and he would transfer me to someone who would respond in about three minutes  minutes later the phone went dead started the process again while i usually get a notification that they are experiencing high call volume i sometime either get shut off again after about twenty minutes or someone comes on so i can explain the case all over again the person says no problem asks a few questions and says they can fix the problem but hold on for a few minutes they then come back and say that i need to be transferred they make the transfer which rings a few times and the phone goes dead so what have i gotten for   hours of my time a bill for  and no results reply kent jones december   at  pm hp is the worst never order from them i had serious doubts about ordering from hp

at least six months without a computer i had one in all the replacements that’s i liked but a line of pixels burnt out on the screen when the computer was  months old so i was afraid the screen was going and sent it in for repair they replaced the screen but then the computer wouldn’t work right i sent it back and once again it couldn’t be repaired that computer has been replaced three more times with on that was missing features that it was suppose to have so they sent me another that the speaker didn’t work on and then they built me a custom computer last october that hasn’t worked since i received it it’s been back for repairs in which they didn’t address what i said was wrong and the manager sonny told me he “he didn’t give a rat’s ass if the computer worked or not and that no

wouldn’t go further until i gave him my visa and he said i would be charged  a n d couldn’t fix it made some comment i didn’t hear and disappeared we were ready to buy new equipment but your customer service doesn’t warrant my business i would certainly appreciate an american answer to this how can you get away with it i understand there are thousands in this location in india…don’t we american customers deserve american speaking help we also deserve work or isn’t this an american company anymore…………………… reply rachelle may   at  pm wow i wish i would’ve looked at this before i bought an hp printer last fall i have to say i have never had a bad experience with their printers until i purchased the laserjet mnw it has software issues i purchased it in oct  and immediately contacted hp support it is may  with one replacement down two visits from a tech at my location multiple occasions of remoting into my computer which i don’t particularly like as a business owner and still no working printer they ask do you want a replacement no i don’t think the third will work any better not to mention they say they will call and i am still waiting it is to the point where i have to record names phone numbers log emails etc there are case numbers but they either dont read them or they say they dont have the information…”it is in another department” rediculous reply charles pennington may   at  pm i have some concerns about your “allinone” printer scanner copier  fax this is the second time this year i’ve had issues with hp ink the first time was  at  a m mt case   i spoke with christen i had purchased a multipack of ink and the yellow did not work they did send me a replacement now   p m mt after getting a message the black ink is depleted and replacing it again i had problems with the carriages case   i spoke with kevin he had me reset the printer by unplugging  replugging then taking out all the ink carriages reading the info on the screen putting them all back read info put in old black carriage read info it was determined the new carriages is faulty they will send another one bfrb i buy hp products because i was told by someone that hp brands are usually repairable whereas other brands are mostly throwaway however what about the ink carriages i’m sometimes up late getting work done for stuff i’ll need for the next day if i run out of ink as i have done twice i like to have extra ink just in case both times this has happened it was  a m and both on weekends and the so called extra carriage did not work hp usually send me replacements but that does not happen until three days later which does not help me for the next days work i’m purchasing genuine hp carriages from reputable places the multipack from costco and the single black carriages from walmart i also have an l model with a bad print head i wonder if i would do better with some of the other cheaper brands reply dorothy bolton march   at  pm i have been fedup with hew

this now  the sales and technical support will definitely put you back on the bloodpressure medication for sure gina and karen from the   option  susheel and crew option are extremely unprofessional disrespectful folks told my to throw my windows  away or pay someone else to fixit i have to keep calling back weeks later because of my bloodpressure now today karen told me to call  then call them back about the issue at hand after i get back home from the hospital i told her that i pay monthly for my computer to be fixed when needed instead i get passed from trouble to trouble she then went on to say that i have talked to them enough that my money what i was told to be my insurance money to keep my computer maintenanced when needed karen said that money has been spent on the numerous times that i keep calling back complaining about my computer so there for i will not be getting any refund and if i attempt to cancel my contract i interrupted her contract i told her i dont have any contract with hew  pac she said that i sould had read my emails and i will be paying a  fee i told karen the man on the phone made absolutely no mention about any contract of any kind so that trumpedup without my knowledge or consent of email holds nothing i then asked to speak with the manager or her supervisor she went on to say that she is the supervisor so no there is not anyone else

and have had nothing but problems since day  ironically  days after walmart’s  day return policy i did not purchase the additional warrantee offered by walmart since hp offers a  yr parts and repair replacement warrantee i have had to send laptop back to hp twice for repair since april of this year pretty sad to have for only  months and already problems i called hp yesterday monday  wasted about an hour talking to tech support most of which was me saying “huh” because i couldn’t understand what they were saying because of their thick accent the agent took my  gave me a case  i was promised a manager would call and make things right with my pc……well glad i’m not holding my breath because i’m still waiting for that call hewlett packard lacks good customer service skills and i’m begining to wonder if they stand behind their products at all next time i will purchase a different brand of laptop sure hate these expensive life lessons reply sharrel september   at  pm dissatisfied customer on september   i ordered and paid for a lap top for my daughter for college l after calling twice and talked to like i’m ignorant to check the status of my order ironically the day the lap top was due to ship i called again for a status update rolls by a supervisor their were no problems i could expect the shipping information in stead i receive an email saying sorry for the inconvenience but your

bbb reply hp customer december   at  pm yes reply anonymous september   at  pm i just had the most horrible customer service experience with a sales rep by the name of katiekerri i recognized her voice several times and each time she is either katie or kerri i was argued with and yelled at on the telephone i was also told that i could never order from hp’s website…ever and to take my services else where she specifically told me to go to best buy i have never been so angry in my life she also refused to let me speak with a supervisor i really am baffled as to how she is working in the customer service industry i have worked in customer service for over a decade and have never witnessed someone yelling at a customer because they are asking a question i will be contacting corporate and reporting this agent everyday if i have to reply samantha august   at  pm i wish i had read some of these complaints before my purchase of this cheap laptop my complaint sounds very similar and i cannot get any help such a big company and they cant help the little people who support their products reply sunny kessel july   at  pm wow hp – lots of the same complaints – and you say you’re sooo improving customer relations what a joke i’ve been trying to get a replacement computer for almost a year now when you finally do get a case number and worker you’re ignored forever unless you call every day your case “supervisors” can’t be bothered to call is what i’ve been told i’ve been pushed to the point of wanting to scream at you people i paid money in good faith to purchase your lousy product i expect it to work correctly so with no word again from your wonderful case managers i’m going to give the wall street journal and msnbc a call lets discuss what a great job meg whitman is doing so far reply sharrel september   at  pm in reading your compliant it’s angry me to think that after contacting the corporate office you got no satisfaction i’ve just made my first contact today for a product paid for but not received can you advise how going to the news media helped i will not be played by hp reply anonymous january   at  am sunny i’m with you we ordered a desktop through our phone company who has an “arrangement” with hp to sell a few of their computers i’m a desktop guy and luckily the phone company offered only one but it seemed decent and was advertised as not just having a cd drive but also a cd burner…something i sorta neededand still do when the pc got here it was a completely different one from what we’d ordered after numerous and fruitless phone calls with the phone company i was finally directed to the head of the warehouse he was a super slick “salesman” rattling off specs etc on the pc that was delivered and simply wore me down and i stupidly agreed to just keep it since it was already here and had been here for a month still in the box since that time one year into ownership the os failed since then it’s been memory crash dump after memory crash dump sometimes as many as  in the same day as of yesterday it’d crashed  times in as many days the phone company’s “tech dept” has told me numerous reasons causing the problem and finally last week and definitive answer was given in less than  minutes i called hp immediately and explained everything to the “tech” there and was told “we’re so sorry but your warranty expired a month and a day ago” and there was zero offer to try to resolve the situation yesterday i spent from approx pm until almost pm on the phone with the phone company and hp hp had me run some kind of test and when it was done and showed  different issues she didn’t even want to hear what they were she just wanted to go to another long test to check the processor and promised to call in about  minutes which would’ve been about pm it’s am the next day and still no call and oddly i’m not surprised one bit between the phone company and hp they’ll end up losing more business by unhappy customers than if they’d just admit they had a faulty product and offer a new one and i’ve already told the phone company that i know all too well how to use social networking and sites like changeorg and other sites to put out the word on bad products and bad service i’ve owned a business before and to keep a good customer base sometimes you simply have to bite the bullet and lose a couple dollars if it means keeping the customer and having the free positive word of mouth advertising neither the phone company nor hp seem to understand this…i guess they think like the bank not too long ago…they’re too big to failor fall i hope your situation finally got resolved and everybody else’s who’s posted here and wish me luck as i’m about to call corporate and have a “prayer session” with them about both the product and the “tech help” which was a joke from the second we were connected hp would also be wise to hire people who can actually fg speak english for english speaking customers reply zellner christopher july   at  pm is it company policy to hang up or ignore a customers repeated request for a supervisor  is it also company policy to hear a complaint and a name yet transfer the customer right back to the person they are wishing to report i have two useless laptops yet hp representatives don’t know who there supervisors are i’ve bee treated as if i’ve done something wrong it’s your product all i ever asked for was what i paid over  for reply mary kay loose july   at  pm i have a defective printer cartridge — when i installed it the msg “at least one of the cartridges has a problem” i have been through all the steps to try to fix the problem and i am sure it is a defective cartridge xl i purchased it directly from hp on  there is no way to email hp and get a replacement cartridge i had a

accused me of failing to return printer received fedex label fedex’s scanner couldn’t scan the label the driver called her boss who helped resolve the issue tried to return replacement printer but the printer fedex picked up can’t be found just received email from richard saying ‘without proof of the other printer being returned to us the only option is to replace your printer with a refurbished model’ well… i didn’t provide the fedex label now did i richard and i used to work at hp contacting all my hp buddies and family members who work there for meg’s address this is beyond ridiculous reply david yaron april   at  am three months to get a case number followed by three more months of dead silence i bought an hp laptop on sept    the touch pad didn’t function from day one it took me a lot of time and frustration until i got an hp support case number on jan   i am quoting their answer “hi  we have received your email our support agent will contact you shortly case number for the case created  thanks hp support” no one contacted me since then when i replied to the above hp email it failed time and time again i tried a number of times to call hp from abroad where i have been traveling each time i waited over  minutes listening to hp advertisement how good they are but no one answered i was looking forward to having a good new laptop with me but instead i have been carrying a heavy dead laptop spending a fortune on phone calls to a “reputable” company that does not care one bit about its costumers and make it as difficult as possible for them to contact hp i will consider it to be a miracle if hp would care seeing this post and contact me reply un happy april   at  pm call center is routed out of india hard to understand don’t worry for an extra  you can

serial  cgl dear ms whitman i am writing to you regarding one of three laptop computers i purchased from your company over the summer i have been attempting to seek repairs for one of the laptops for the last several months to no avail i am taking this directly to you as this issue seems to be a serious flaw in customer support which should be immediatly addressed i am unable to seek any service repair for a completly new laptop i have spoken repeatedly to customer service a total of  telephone calls for over three and a half hours with customer support long distance with no resolution i have submitted the laptop to my local hp repair representive and have had the computer returned unfixed the latest call to customer support today for  minutes resulted in again the representive telling me he will call me back in a couple minutes and again i never receive a return call the only solution offered by your customer support was i mail the computer i purchased back to the country it was purchased in to someone i may know so they can send the computer through your prepaid box you can send to them to a repair center named in advance so they may repair the already documented broken mother board then return the computer to someone i know in the country the computer was purchased in and they will in tern then mail the computer back to me in the country i currently am working in logistically this is a nightmare cost wise through shipping alone i will pay next to the cost of a new machine this process will take  months in mail and delivery time repair is still an unknown and burdens many people this is an ineffective and utterly total waist of my time and yours money loss for your company and your customers satisfaction has been destroyed now let me point out this small detail i was in schipol airport yesterday and purchased electronics at a store if it were your computer would you require me to find someone i know at the airport to return the computer to be fixed what with hong kong or spain the logic your support is giving to me is crap that the computer i have has to be repaired in the country it was purchased in i bought hp because i know or at least assumed albeit incorrectly it seems i could get help world wide i have taken the machine to an authorized repair workshop and they cannot fix it if you have another facility that can fix it thats great but you can offer to send a shipping box to me where i am not to some country the computer originated in i have spent months trying to get help only to have my time waisted get hung up on or not receive a return call at this point we have been with out this new laptop for months and cannot receive any support or help from your company i want to offer your organization one last oppertunity to make this issue correct we want a replacement laptop i tried to explain to the customer rep that it would be far cheeper to just send a po to our local hp outlet for a replacement machine at the same time we can return the broken laptop and your company can ship it to whoever to try and fix it you are welcome to keep this damaged machine i am afraid at this point to even attempt to seek repair help on the second of the three machines purchased as this one also has issues affecting functionality albeit not as critical as the computer in question which is completly dead but still its two machines out of three first things first lets replace the documted broken mb with a new laptop please i await your prompt response and a streamlined effective and customer satisifaction oreintated solution to this situation without further delay christopher thomas ole weggersvei x  sandefjord norway    xxxxx reply ronald kerr april   at  pm hewlettpackard rodeo in reference to service order bdtd i received a replacement printer under my warranty when the technical supervisor submitted the order i asked him how i can extend the warranty on the new printer he stated i would go to the following website where i could order an extended warranty shoppinghpcom i went to that website and couldn’t quite determine what i was looking for and given the amount of time i had spent between two phone calls to technical support decided to contact hp via online chat i was connected with a service rep identified as “gracep” see chat log below i inquired about the extended warranty and provided the background information including the order  for the replacement printer bdtd gracep conducted research into the matter stated the prices and provided links to where i could purchase the extended warranty when i went to order the warranty my customer account would not come up as my email address did not show as valid i sensed a problem and called customersales support the sales rep and his supervisor stated i would have to go through technical support for a warranty extension i stated that it was technical support that had me go to the shopping website which led me to them in the first place i feel like i am getting the runaround from hp personnel on two different continents—please advise or provide information my wife received the printer this morning and when she set it up and attempted to put it into operation she kept receiving carriage jammed errors she stated she followed the troubleshooting measures as best she could and as of this writing has spent a little more than one hour on the phone with technical support attempting to get this printer to work ——————————————————–questions——————————————————————— can someone explain to me why after i spent nearly  minutes on hold while the original service tech i contacted on wednesday and after i very passionately and loudly explained that i could continue to hold and she set up an am est time for the technical supervisor to call my wife no one at hp contacted my wife at the appointed day and time i had to call hp and go through the process of getting through to the technical supervisor granted that call resulted in success as he initiated the process to send out the replacement printer—it was just more time that is very precious to me given the fact that my wife and i have spent at least  and a half hours on the phone talking with various representatives from two departments on two separate continents and still don’t have a printer that works nor a method or means to extend the warranty can you think of any reason for me to continue purchasing hp products we’ve purchased at least three printers all all in one photosmart series over the years and at least  usd in ink from hp needless to say my wife and i are not real pleased with hewlett packard right now in fact you might say that we are livid at hewlett packard at the moment it would extremely nice if hewlett packard would a help my wife put this newly received printer into operation and b provide some correct information to either my wife or i as to how we can extend the warranty on this newly received refurbished printer and c figure some way or gesture that might make believe that your firm practices what your leadership surely preaches to the rank and file concerning customer service our customers are our most important asset the customer is always right we take pride in providing the highest degree of customer service blah blah blah update as of friday apr  est i wanted to email the above narrative to hp via the online website—as the submission form limited my input to  characters i called the sales support customer service contact number—explained the situation in detail to a rep named brandi sp she stated to call   and ask to speak with a case manager who will be able to help me at that number the representative gave me yet another number to call to reach a case manager   when i called that number i received the same runaround from a rep named thomas—he asked me several questions and wanted to put me through to a supervisor i explained in no uncertain terms that i have already spoke with a technical support supervisor and need to speak with a case manager—as described by brandi thomas asked me for the background on this issue he stated that i would have to wait until the current warranty expired before i could order a new warranty this makes about the rd different version i’ve been told by hp personnel concerning this issue thomas then wanted to know if the carriage jam had been cleared i explained for the d time that i wasn’t with my wife and the printer and that because she has been on the phone with hp for the past three hours and because i have not heard back from her that no i don’t believe the problem has been resolved he then attempted to put me on hold in order to connect me to his supervisor—i adamantly explained that i’ve already spoken to a technical support supervisor and demand to speak with a case manager he put me on hold and about  minutes later his supervisor a man named nick came on the line nick wanted to hear the entire story stating he needed to hear it from by now i was livid—i started to provide the data and demanded to know why thomas had not taken any notes to put into the case record so i would not have describe this entire ordeal—for about the third time in last hour and a half he stated that they don’t have a direct line to the case managers and that someone would have to call me i explained that since one technical supervisor did not call my wife back at the agreed date and time that i had absolutely no confidence that i would be receiving a call from anyone at hewlett packard i threatened to send this entire narrative to hewlett packard’s corporate headquarters—either via the corporate website hopefully this will result in some sort of response– sincerely ronald p kerr  xxxx evenings and weekends  xxxx

way is your printer still within its base warranty”  am ronald kerr “yes–we are receiving a refurbished printer from hp tomorrow the warranty will remain in place until  dec  the end of the warranty

can purchase for your printer here are the details below”  am ronald kerr “i guess my idea is if the extended warranty costs say  for at least two years it may be worth it if the cost is say  or more it would be more cost efeective to simply by a new printer”  am agent grace p “you can purchase the hp  year care pack wnext day exchange for printers”  am agent grace p “this is only for ”  am agent

ronald kerr “do i have until the end of the current warranty to make the decision–sounds like the yr care pack would be worth it”  am agent grace p “also as long as the printer is still within its warranty you have the chance to purchase the extended warranty considering there is no defect of the printer until you purchased it”  am agent grace p “no you have to purchase it within the base warranty of the printer”  am agent grace p “the extended service plan starts at the date of delivery of the product like computer or printer it does not start at the date of purchased of the extended service plan that is why it is highly recommended that they purchased the extended service plan” together with the product computer or printer so that they can enjoy full coverage in terms of technical concerns since the standard manufacturer’s warranty is not exactly a full technical support  am ronald kerr “okay so i’m receiving a replacement printer tomorrow–should i purchase the

have gotten the runaround they tried to sell me protection they constantly lied by telling me there was nothing wrong with the computer they told me to restore to factory setting but do not install windows  because they were having issues they kept telling me that i have a case number and would get back to me asap but after i waited a couple of days and nothing happened they said that they were having a electronic ‘glitch’ which sounded very phony i have had to email them several times between feb  and feb  the response was usually that i’d hear from them soon their idea of soon is nonexistent i could go on and on but i’m sure others have had the same kinds of problems that i’ve had i believe that i have a useless computer and it should be considered under our lemon law i either want a new computer or full reimbursement reply dennis charison february   at  am first printer was replaced second had issues from day one but i lived with the notice shaking missed paper pick up not shutting down after a tech assist got a phone offer a  yr care pack warranty  i b ought it issues continued and called tech support nothing was done and i said forget it and used it as it was finaly called tech they could not find prior notes adn told me the whole tech support process needed to be done over again…a tech walking me thru testing the unit i said no no more it was escalated to a case mgr authorizing replacement unit i was to be phoned at am next morning or following morning bot mornings passed an i was late to work i called hp finally got the right dept was told to select a printer within a price range no problem teh replace ment would be received in  days   friggin days when i took out the care pack warranty i was told repairs or replacement would be next day service now i have a case mgr who knows nothing about that and if did not like the  day delivery then i was to keep the printer i was using an deal with it  hp should only know where they stick their care packs managerial attitudes and mis information don’t get me started on ink cartridges that all have to be replaced when the black is empty—–the first time so to replace the black for the first time i had to buy black and  colors even though i use gray scale only no where in the manual or box was this hiddendevious expense indicated they may put in print that customer service is a priority but their actions indicate otherwise now i have to wait  business days to get a replacement printer reply makaila march   at  pm keep on writing and chgguing away reply william ramsey august   at  am hello on dec   i purchased a dvt select ed laptop from you hp website order h for  i also purchased a yr pickup and rtnadp lojack hgb package for  the laptop’s fan is not functioning properly and shuts down after a warning message i call  for tech support the issue was not able to be resolved mins i was unable to access computer to down load new bios update due my not knowing my son’s password i forwarded the email receipt from  to hppopmailsupporthpcom tech support kindly called back when my son was home the issue was not resolved and tech support recommended sending laptop in for fan replacement i was transferred to a supervisor because the  yr pickup and return warranty could not be verified this was the case with the first call i made this took  mins the only issue i have is the yr warrant i purchased i have the email i was sent of this purchase and bank statement showing where i was charged for this purchased however no one can located this purchase in you computer files now reason would dictate that your computer files are not my responsibility to maintain or insure its accuracy i was charged for this warranty as indicated by the above mention order number and my bank records i seen two reasonably alternatives  honor the warranty  refund my money for a produce that you are not going to honor i will take the second alternative as a buyer beware scenario and shame on
