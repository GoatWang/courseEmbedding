small cap universe looking at companies for prospective investments once a candidate is identified we undertake an investigation that typically includes not only an analysis of all financial figures but also a visit to talk with management and personally interview management a company review may includes a tour of company facilities interviews of its vendors customers lenders and other stakeholders this helps us get an insight into the company that one cannot get by just reviewing financial statements where possible we corroborate the story as detailed by management and the filings with other research such as testing the product getting a disinterested third party’s opinion or doing channel checks only a small number of companies we investigate eventually pass this screening
