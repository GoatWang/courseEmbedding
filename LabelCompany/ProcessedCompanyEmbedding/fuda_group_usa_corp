intention to either trade on these or appoint a subcontractor to extract and process this gold powder into gold bars and other precious metal   the company’s management believes that the market demand for natural resources such as gold granite and marble will continue gold and other precious metals are commodities and will have times of high and low price but the demand for it as a commodity would be present the same to be said for granite and marble that would be affected by the economy in particular the performance in construction trade   products and services   the main activities of the

well as international buyers though the company is currently focused on selling domestically it does not intend to abandon international buyers we do not actively promote to international buyers however if there is a request we will still sell we expect interest from international buyers to flow in with the appointment of our new marketing director   the finished products for granite include granite slabs pavers carvings and wall claddings since one of the particular features of the stone that the company engages in is that they can be used for both for internal as well as external construction application the company has a large target market to reach out to for sales of products   the company also buys gold powder and raw stones from suppliers and processes them into gold bars

be designed to help the company find new customers and to increase awareness of the company’s products services and competitive solutions a variety of marketing approaches emphasizing the competitive advantages ie low cost labour and large domestic market in china and internal and external application as the key differentiators of the company’s products and services are expected to be used in

personal contact personal selling will remain the company’s most important means of promotion in the corporate and government sectors   in and through  to  the company changed the focus of the business to more regional customers and distributions from international customers and distribution channels this is in large part due to larger costs associated with international delivery focusing

mr wu may be deemed to be the beneficial owner of the shares held by such entities   risks and uncertainties facing the company   the company has a limited operating history and may experience losses in the near term the company needs to maintain a steady operating structure ensuring that expenses are contained such that profits are consistently achieved in order to expand the company’s business the company would likely require additional financing   one of the biggest challenges facing the company will be in securing adequate capital to continue to expand its business and build a larger scale and more efficient set of operations secondarily an ongoing challenge remains the maintenance of an efficient operating structure and business model the company must keep its expenses and the costs of employees at a minimum in order to generate a profit from the revenues that it receives from its clients third in order to expand the company will need to continue implementing effective sales marketing and distribution strategies to reach the intended end customer clients the company has devised its initial sales marketing and advertising strategies however the company will need to continue refinement of these strategies and also skillfully implement these plans in order to achieve ongoing and longterm success in its business          due to financial constraints and the early stage of the company’s life the company has to date conducted limited advertising and marketing to reach customers in addition the company has not yet located the sources of funding to develop the company on a broader scale through acquisitions or other major partnerships if the company were unable to locate such financing andor later develop strong and reliable sources of potential customers and a means to efficiently reach buyers and customers it is unlikely that the company could develop its operations to return revenue sufficient to further develop its business plan moreover the above assumes that the company’s services are consistently met with client satisfaction in the marketplace and exhibit steady success amongst the potential customer base neither of which is reasonably predictable or guaranteed   the company will likely be significantly affected by any unforeseen changes in the businesses and operations of its clients for example and without limitation any change in the individual at a client making purchase decisions of the company’s services or any change of the client department that authorizes such purchases could potentially be very damaging for the company   due to these and other factors the company’s need for additional capital the company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising substantial doubt of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   risk factors   no assurance of continued market acceptance   there is no assurance that the company’s services or solutions will continued to meet with market acceptance moreover there is no assurance that these services and solutions will continue to have any competitive advantages also there is no assurance that the market reception will be positive the company’s industry is characterized by a large and fragmented group of competitors and as such there can be no guarantee that the company will not lose business to its existing or potential new competitors   the company’s independent auditors have issued a report raising a substantial doubt of the company’s ability to continue as a going concern   the company’s independent auditors have issued a comment that unless the company is able to generate sufficient cash flows from operations andor obtain additional financing there is a substantial doubt as to its ability to continue as a going concern   the company is an earlystage company with a limited operating history and as such any prospective investor may have difficulty in assessing the company’s profitability or performance   because the company except fuda mining co is an earlystage company with a limited operating history it could be difficult for any investor to assess the performance of the company or to determine whether the company will meet its projected business plan the company has limited financial results upon which an investor may judge its potential as a company still in the early stages of its life the company may in the future experience undercapitalization shortages setbacks and many of the problems delays and expenses encountered by any earlystage business an investor will be required to make an investment decision based solely on the company management’s history its projected operations in light of the risks the limited operations and financial results of the company to date and any expenses and uncertainties that may be encountered by one engaging in the company’s industry   the company is an earlystage company and has little experience in being a public company   the company is an earlystage company and as such has little experience in managing a public company such lack of experience may result in the company experiencing difficulty in adequately operating and growing its business further the company may be hampered by lack of experience in addressing the issues and considerations which are common to growing companies if the company’s operating or management abilities consistently perform below expectations the company’s business is unlikely to thrive   the company may not successfully consummate or initiate acquisitions   the ability of the company to grow through acquisitions as planned will depend on a number of factors including competition for acquisitions the availability of capital and other resources to consummate acquisitions and the ability to successfully integrate and train additional staff including the staff of an acquired company there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be able to establish and expand its market presence or to successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates and complete acquisitions on favorable terms          in addition to facing competition in identifying and consummating successful acquisitions such acquisitions could involve significant risks including   difficulties in the assimilation of the operations services and corporate culture of acquired companies and higherthananticipated costs associated with such assimilation   overvaluation of acquired companies or delays in realizing or a failure to realize the benefits revenues cost savings and synergies that were anticipated   difficulties in integrating the acquired business into information systems controls policies and procedures   failure to retain key personnel business relationships reputation or clients of an acquired business   the potential impairment of acquired assets   diversion of management’s attention from other business activities   insufficient indemnification from the selling parties for legal liabilities incurred by the acquired companies prior to acquisition   the assumption of unknown liabilities and additional risks of the acquired business and   unforeseen operating difficulties that require significant financial and managerial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of existing operations   in addition future acquisitions could materially and adversely affect the company’s business financial condition results of operations and liquidity possible impairment losses on goodwill and intangible assets or restructuring charges could occur these risks could have a material adverse effect on the business because they may result in substantial costs to the company and disrupt its business   reliance on third party agreements and relationships is necessary for development of the companys business   the company will need strong third party relationships and partnerships in order to develop and grow its business the company will be substantially dependent on these strategic partners and third party relationships   the company expects to incur additional expenses and may ultimately never be profitable   the company is an earlystage company and has a limited history of its operations the company will need to continue generating revenue in order to maintain sustained profitability ultimately in spite of the company’s best or reasonable efforts the company may have difficulty in generating revenues or remaining profitable   the company’s officers and directors beneficially own a majority of the company’s common stock and as a result can exercise control over stockholder and corporate actions   the officers and directors of the company currently beneficially own approximately  of the company’s outstanding common stock as such they will be able to control most matters requiring approval by stockholders including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions this concentration of ownership may also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control which in turn could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the company’s common stock or prevent stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares          the company does not have any independent directors   all of the directors of the company are executive officers andor employees of the company as such the company does not have any independent oversight or administration of its management and operations the company’s decisionmaking may suffer from the lack of an independent set of directors since only officers and employees of the company will make all important decisions regarding the company   the company depends on its management team to manage its business effectively   the companys future success is dependent in large part upon its ability to understand and develop the business plan and to attract and retain highly skilled management operational and executive personnel in particular due to the relatively early stage of the companys business its future success is highly dependent on its officers to provide the necessary experience and background to execute the companys business plan the loss of any officer’s services could impede particularly initially as the company builds a record and reputation its ability to develop its objectives and as such would negatively impact the companys possible overall development   the company may face significant competition from companies that serve its industries   the company may face competition from other companies that offer similar solutions some of these potential competitors may have longer operating histories greater brand recognition larger client bases and significantly greater financial technical and marketing resources than the company possesses these advantages may enable such competitors to respond more quickly to new or emerging trends and changes in customer preferences these advantages may also allow them to engage in more extensive market research and development undertake extensive farreaching marketing campaigns adopt more aggressive pricing policies and make more attractive offers to potential customers employees and strategic partners the company believes that its current and anticipated solutions are and will be sufficiently different from existing competition and that there is limited to no competition in its local area however it is nevertheless possible that potential competitors may have or may rapidly acquire significant market share increased competition may result in price reductions reduced gross margin and loss of market share the company may not be able to compete successfully and competitive pressures may adversely affect its business results of operations and financial condition   no formal market survey has been conducted   no independent marketing survey has been performed to determine the potential demand for the company’s products or services over the longer term the company has conducted no marketing studies regarding whether its business would continue to be marketable no assurances can be given that upon marketing sufficient customer markets and business segments can be developed to sustain the companys operations on a continued basis   the company has authorized the issuance of preferred stock with certain preferences   the board of directors of the company is authorized to issue up to  shares of  par value preferred stock the board of directors has the power to establish the dividend rates liquidation preferences and voting rights of any series of preferred stock and these rights may be superior to the rights of holders of shares of common stock the board of directors may also establish redemption and conversion terms and privileges with respect to any shares of preferred stock any such preferences may operate to the detriment of the rights of the holders of the shares and further could be used by the board of directors as a device to prevent a change in control of the company currently no such preferred shares or preferences have been issued to date but such shares or preferences may be issued at a later time subject to the sole discretion of the board of directors          the company does not maintain certain insurance including errors and omissions and indemnification insurance   the company has limited capital and therefore does not currently have a policy of insurance against liabilities arising out of the negligence of its officers and directors andor deficiencies in any of its business operations even assuming that the company obtained insurance there is no assurance that such insurance coverage would be adequate to satisfy any potential claims made against the company its officers and directors or its business operations any such liability which might arise could be substantial and may exceed the assets of the company the certificate of incorporation and bylaws of the company provide for indemnification of officers and directors to the fullest extent permitted under delaware law insofar as indemnification for liabilities arising under the securities act may be permitted to directors officers and controlling persons it is the opinion of the securities and exchange commission that such indemnification is against public policy as expressed in the act and is therefore unenforceable   intellectual property andor trade secret protection may be inadequate   the company has not applied for any intellectual property or trade secret protection on any aspects of its business the company has no current plans on attempting to obtain patents copyright trademarks andor service marks on any of its solutions and services there can be no assurance that the company can obtain effective protection against unauthorized duplication or the introduction of substantially similar solutions and services   the company is subject to the potential factors of market and customer changes   the business of the company is susceptible to rapidly changing preferences of the marketplace and its customers the needs of customers are subject to constant change as staffing needs are as quick to change as are the businesses of customers although the company intends to continue to develop and improve its products and services to meet changing customer needs of the marketplace there can be no assurance that funds for such expenditures will be available or that the companys competition will not develop similar or superior capabilities or that the company will be successful in its internal efforts the future success of the company will depend in part on its ability to respond effectively to rapidly changing trends industry standards and customer requirements by adapting and improving the features and functions of its services in the company’s industry failure by a business to adapt to the changing needs and demands of customers is likely to render the business obsolete   shares of common stock in the company are subject to resale restrictions imposed by rule  of the securities and exchange commission   the shares of common stock held by current shareholders are “restricted securities” subject to the limitations of rule  under the securities act in general securities can be sold pursuant to rule  after being fullypaid and held for more than  months shares of the company’s common stock are subject to rule  resale restrictions and accordingly investors are subject to such resale limitations   shareholders of the company cannot rely upon rule  to resell securities of the company   due to the company’s previous status as a shell company shareholders cannot rely upon rule  for resales of the company’s securities pursuant to rule i as such certain shares of common stock have no ability for resale or transfer until the company meets the requirements of rule i of the securities and exchange commission   rule  establishes specific criteria for determining whether a person is not engaged in a distribution of securities among other things rule  creates a safe harbor whereby a person satisfying the applicable conditions of the rule  safe harbor is deemed not to be engaged in a distribution of the securities and therefore not an underwriter of the securities if a purchaser of securities is unable to rely upon rule  to sell securities due to rule i then the securities must be registered or another exemption from registration must be found in order for the distribution of securities to be made in the event that the securities are not registered or another exemption is not found a purchaser of securities cannot sell or transfer the shares of common stock in the company since the company does not meet the requirements of rule i   pursuant to rule i reliance upon rule  is typically available for the resale of restricted or unrestricted securities that were initially issued by a reporting or nonreporting shell company or an issuer that has been at any time previously a reporting or nonreporting shell company only if the following conditions are met          the issuer of the securities that was formerly a reporting or nonreporting shell company has ceased to be a shell company   the issuer of the securities is subject to the reporting requirements of section  or d of the securities exchange act of    the issuer of the securities has filed all reports and material required to be filed under section  or d of the exchange act as applicable during the preceding  months or for such shorter period that the issuer was required to file such reports and materials other than form k reports and   at least one year has elapsed from the time that the issuer filed current form  type information with the commission reflecting its status as an entity that is not a shell company   government regulation could negatively impact the business   the company’s business segments may be subject to various government regulations in the jurisdictions in which they operate due to the potential wide scope of the company’s operations the company could be subject to regulation by various political and regulatory entities including various local and municipal agencies and government subdivisions the company may incur increased costs necessary to comply with existing and newly adopted laws and regulations or penalties for any failure to comply the company’s operations could be adversely affected directly or indirectly by existing or future laws and regulations relating to its business or industry   the company is susceptible to changes economic conditions   demand for natural resources may decline with changing economic conditions for example decline in private construction projects may reduce demand for granite products that the company operates in international economic conditions or a slowdown of growth in china or around the globe could harm the company’s business and operations   changes in prices for metals or products will affect the company’s profitability and operations   commodities such as gold fluctuate and change in price on a daily basis changes in these prices could negatively affect the company’s operations and profitability   the company is dependent on its suppliers and business difficulty for a supplier could harm the company’s own business   the company relies on its key suppliers difficulties that the suppliers experience will burden the company’s ability to operate the company needs to diversify among suppliers but until such time the company is dependent and exposed to the risk of its current key suppliers   the company is exposed to seasonal risks in its business and operations   the company’s business can encounter seasonal issues from time to time in granite and marble mining as the mining and processing activities can typically be done at year round and during the seasonal periods that construction demand slowed the mines and processing continued operations and built up inventories to prepare for the periods of higher demand   item  unregistered sales of equity securities   recent sales of unregistered securities

laptop i explained the issues i was having in very laymen terms computer slow to start up incessant popups constant freezing unreliable internet access etc he listened intently and assured me that he would be able to repair the issues and have my computer running like new in less than  hours not only did ryan hold true to this promise he explained in terms even i could understand the issues that were plaguing my computer and walked me through the additional features he installed free of charge to prevent these same issues in the future all in all he completely surpassed my expectations and my

well as in a barter trade exchange which the fair market sales price of the stones its corresponding accounts receivables were used to offset the outstanding payables   in  the company acquired lands from fuda investment affiliated entity for rmb  and from winner international affiliated for rmb  in addition fuda investment and winner international has executed sales agreements to purchase granite stones from the company the purchase price of the land its corresponding outstanding payables was to be paid off by fair market sales price of the stones its corresponding accounts receivables as a barter trade exchange   in accordance to asc  the transactions above are considered nonmonetary transaction because the transactions involve exchange of products held for sale in the ordinary course of business inventory for other productive assets lands as a means of selling the product inventory to a customer   in accordance to asc  the lands purchased were recorded at the purchase price of the lands assets received as indicated on the agreement because the costs to acquire the stones from the suppliers and the types the sales price and the quantity of stones to be delivered was not determinable at the time of the exchange as a result the earning process was not completed at the time of the exchange and therefore gain or loss cannot be computed at the time of the exchange   the company could not record the exchange of land for stones at historical costs of the stones because the stones to be delivered to the land sellers are based on fair market sales price in the future and is not based on the costs of the stones paid by the company the sales to relieve the accounts payable were not needed immediately as the exchange wasn’t instant and the stones in inventory at the time weren’t all going to relieve this debt the agreement was to provide stones in barter when the land sellers needed the stones the transaction would have been completed when the lands were transferred if all of the stones were immediately delivered from inventory and extinguished but instead the stones were delivered as required and “sold” or bartered at fair market value of the stones in the future which changed considerably over the period of the barter where there was no fixed or historical price that could be utilized   the “sales agreement” and the “land purchase and sale agreements” executed by the parties above consisted of two separate agreements   the sales agreement includes a total sales amount equal to the purchase price of the granite and provides that payment may be made by cash or land the sales agreement also includes the name type and grade of granite and a unit sales price for each granite product based on the fair market value on the day of execution of the sales agreement however the actual sales price to be paid is the fair market value of that product on the date of the purchase order such price fluctuation is usually no greater than  higher or lower and is typically acceptable to both the purchaser and seller in addition the sales agreements also indicate the acceptable quality of the granite block the delivery terms and penalty clauses for breach of contract              the land purchase and sale agreements indicate the sales price of the land the size of the land and the unit sales price per muacre but do not contain payment terms or maturity date each of the land purchase and sale agreements also states that the company is required to manage nurture harvest and develop the woodlands in accordance to the guidelines of the forestry department as long as the company owns the lands the guidelines of the forestry department does not require the company to provide any maintenance as long as the land is not being developed and naturally growing the company does not intend to develop the property at this time the contractual period of the land is approximately  years for each contract the company estimated that the cost to manage nurture harvest and develop the woodlands is minimal because the trees would grow and develop naturally without much care or intervention the only cost would be laborers to manage and harvest the woodlands if required but the company does not anticipate doing any such harvesting or managing if used any laborers would be unskilled workers at a very low wage therefore the effect to the companys financial and operational obligation is minimal   in  the company and beijing huanda the land seller executed a “land purchase and sales agreement” for approximately mu  acre at a price of rmb approximately  per mu initial payment was due on transfer of the land title which the company paid in cash to beijing huanda subsequently beijing huanda experienced a need for granite and entered into a sales agreement with the company to purchase granite from the company the parties also agreed to use granite to reduce the remaining amount due on the land purchase and sales agreement   in  fuda investment and winner international the “land sellers” executed a series of “sales agreement” and “land purchase and sale agreement” with the company for an aggregate of approximately mu  acre for an average price of rmb approximately  per mu and approximately mu  acre for an average price of rmb approximately  per mu respectively as the company desired to acquire land from the land sellers and the land sellers desired to purchase granite from the company the parties agreed to trade the land for granite thereafter each executed a sales agreement and a land purchase and sales agreement with the company the transaction is considered an arm length transaction as the purchase price of the land is determined based on appraised value and the price of granite is based on normal sales price without any special consideration or discount or conditions the appraisal was a current appraisal and performed by an independent thirdparty   the land debts above were treated as accounts payable and accrued expenses classified as a current liability on the balance sheet as there were no payment terms or maturity date   the company initially recognized land assets and its corresponding payables to the sellers at purchase price of the lands as indicated on the agreement when stones were delivered to the sellers as ordered the fair market sales price of the stones delivered were recognized against the outstanding amount owed to the sellers the differences between the fair market sales price of the stones delivered and the cost of the stones purchased by the company in inventory were recognized as gain or loss from barter trade accordingly the company netted the barter trade sales and cost of sales and recorded as gain or loss on barter trade no revenue or cost of sales are recorded related to these barter trades   for beijing huanda the company delivered stones with fair market sales price of  that cost the company  to purchase the stones in inventory from the suppliers as a result the company recognized gain on barter trade of  for the nine months ended september   outstanding payable to beijing huanda was reduced by  through barter exchange   for fuda investment the company delivered stones with fair market sales price of  that cost the company  to purchase the stones in inventory from the suppliers as a result the company recognized gain on barter trade of  for the nine months ended september   outstanding payable to fuda investment was reduced by  through barter exchange   for winner international the company delivered stones with fair market sales price of  that cost the company to purchase the stones in inventory from the suppliers as a result the company recognized gain on barter trade of  for the nine months ended september   outstanding payable to winner international was reduced by  through barter exchange   the company reviewed asc  and determined that the barter trade exchange transactions above are in the normal course of business and have commercial substance because the company’s future cash flows are expected to significantly change as a result of the exchange the company’s future cash flows are expected to significantly change because the configuration risk timing and amount of the future cash flows of the assets received differs significantly from the configuration of the future cash flows of the assets transferred in the normal course of business the company purchase granite sell to customers for profit and receive cash payment from the customers which has commercial substance in the barter trade exchange the company purchased granites stones and sold to the land sellers as customers and received land as payment the future cash flows of the lands received differs significantly from the configuration of the future cash flows of the granite transferred if the company did not acquire lands from these customers the company would receive cash from these customers as payment in contrary if the company did not sell granite to these land sellers as customers the company would pay cash to these land sellers for the lands as payment    stockholders equity   the company is authorized to
