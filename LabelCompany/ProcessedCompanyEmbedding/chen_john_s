blackberry ceo john chen has led tech turnaround before new blackberry phones aimed at keyboardlovers blackberry loses m in last quarter as revenue plunges john chen has an enviable track record as a turnaround specialist for troubled tech companies but the yearold hong kong native knew he’d really have his work cut out for him when he assumed the role of ceo at blackberry one of canada’s most iconic tech companies that was five short months ago blackberry was in desperate shape at the time shedding customers and losing billions as more aggressive and nimble smartphone companies helped themselves to a market share that was at one time so solid it seemed to be a blackberry birthright  but how to engineer the turnaround how even to stop the hemorrhaging in a wideranging and revealing interview with amanda lang host of the lang  o’leary exchange chen spelled out the rationale behind his customerfirst repair strategy  to that end chen did a lot of listening to his core customers – the longneglected business market what’s often referred to as the enterprise market he tried to find out what they don’t like and what they do “if the customer likes it it’s the right thing to do” he says — a phrase that amounts to chen’s turnaround tagline discussions like that persuaded him to bring back some muchloved but abandoned features “i knew we’d have to stabilize the company and show some level of confidence” chen says “and the only way to do that is to tell your customers that you’re here to stay we’re very focused on delivering better products better services going forward”  if the customer likes it it’s the right thing to do  blackberry ceo john chen chen knew his enterprise users were starting to worry  not to worry was chen’s message back “we’re here to stay and there’s a future plan of good technology and services” but the ceo says his company’s more than  million mobile subscribers aren’t being forgotten in the rush  “i don’t want anybody to think that blackberry is walking away from the mass market but in order to repair the company especially on the financial side of the equation i need to focus on the enterprise customer first” no saleat least not yet  some analysts have speculated that chen’s cleanup his aggressive costcutting seems designed to pretty up blackberry’s balance sheet for a possible sale maybe down the road in a number of years ages decades he told lang but not now he insists “i have no interest in selling the company” chen said “not at this point i think the company has a lot of value i’m interested in unlocking that value i think the shareholder will not be as rewarded by selling at this point because our full value hasn’t been realized“ just watch us seems to be chen’s message to the shareholders the customers the competitors and especially the doubters is it working chen thinks the doubters are starting to come around “people are sayingmaybe there’s a chance it’ll come back all i ask for is that to give us the opportunity to execute”     report typo or error send feedback latest business headlines taking flight loonie may top  cents for first time since  july   am et read comments greening canadas oil could be good for

liquid cooling  june   business hardware mobile computing vr world john chen blackberry’s future is as a niche product may  may   sam reynolds there once was a time when blackberry nasdaq bbry was a global force in the smartphone market then along came apple nasdaqaapl and the countless android phones that the world’s  billion smartphone owners use people have long thought that blackberry with its dramatic fall from grace was going to be dismantled patentbypatent and sold off in chunks to its competitors after all blackberry’s market share is almost too small to measure as the company only shipped  million phones in the last quarter compared to apple’s  million but under john chen the ceo blackberry’s board appointed in november  the company seems to have another chance at life with chen repeatedly promising a turnaround and recovery by focusing strictly on enterprise and government customers in a recent interview with business insider chen says that blackberry will continue pushing along in the smartphone market because its key customers — enterprise and government — demand the security that only blackberry can provide “i can only make iphone so much more secure but i can’t make it as secure as a blackberry device” chen said to business insider “if you look at the us army they’re still rolling out all blackberry if i tell them there are no more phones i lose that account the question is how do you make phones profitable at the volume those people represent” blackberry’s cash burn isn’t as bad as it once was but shareholders aren’t going to be infinitely patient with chen they will want to see evidence of a turnaround soon blackberry’s client base is a guaranteed source of income but the company will have to do much more than that to enter the turn
