pdt  by shirley halperin facebook twitter email me print comments now comanaging country star clay walker the former ceo of martha stewart living omnimedia and steve madden ltd also expounds on running a company whose namesake is in prison these things happen he tells thr as a former executive at cbs records the founder of sbk records later sold to emi for a reported  million and ceo of his own cak entertainment which handles brand management for such artists as jennifer lopez nicki minaj adam levine and marc anthony charles koppelman is a music industry veteran if ever there was one but in the last decade the lifelong new yorker has stepped away from the lights of arena stages and devoted himself fully to the business of branding  first as chairman of the board for shoe giant steve madden from  to  and then as chairman of the board and ceo of martha stewart living omnimedia from  to  worth noting during both stints the company’s founders were incarcerated today the yearold executive is jumping back into the music game taking on comanagement duties for country star clay walker getting him representation at caa and launching a campaign to celebrate the th anniversary of his debut album as well as the singers forthcoming release which has yet to be announced why walker and why now when the industry’s glory days have long since faded koppelman explained in a recent interview with the hollywood reporter what prompted your return to the music business  clay has been a friend and we’ve had a lot of conversations over the years i’ve always felt that he was an incredible artist that never quite reached his potential although he’s a big star he has so much more to go and is much more diverse than where he’s been that quite candidly is the way i approach branding i look at artists and songs as brands and clay really fits the overall picture of not only someone who can be bigger in the world of music concerts and performance but has a great future for television film and other branding opportunities clay is the perfect lightning rod for that and i think we can take him to the next level does becoming a country star inherently involve being able to crossover or can you still just be a country singer no i think it is crossover i’ve always been a fan of country music its america’s music  i love the songs love the lyrics you can go to any city in the country whether it’s southern north east or the southwest and hear country radio so country music is as vibrant as ever photos  celebrity tax dodgers in your time away from the music business did you miss it the music business that i grew up in is a different business today but individual artists are the same business the basics havent changed great songs great live shows and being in the right venues to expose your music to more people today you have an opportunity to do that even more via social media television all the formats where music is in realtime of all the companies that you’ve run which experience has taught you the most ive always had an interest in the fashion side of pop culture when i first connected with steve madden it was very clear to me that he sold his shoes to the same constituency  females from  to  let’s say  that i was gearing my music to i learned to go about the marketing in a similar way with martha stewart the power of the brand the power of television taught me that if you can marry all those ingredients  like you marry a great song with a great artist  and get the right television exposure then you’ve got something that really is going to be sustainable you can expand and blow up then if you take it a step further and look at the fashion sense of that person that gives you plenty of places to extend the brand marc anthony being a great example i’ve known marc for ten years about four or five years ago he and i had a conversation that he could be a brand i always thought he was the latin sinatra he has a style unto himself we took some time and put some ideas together and marc anthony is now doing tremendous business at kohl’s with his apparel line you’d be amazed at the numbers that he does he has a perspective on fashion he has perspective on a look is it more challenging to market a men’s line that was the case five years ago today men’s business is a terrific business lifestyle is a terrific business when you think of country look at the amount of people involved in rodeo or nascar  it’s a lifestyle and it hasnt been wellserved from a fashion perspective carlos santana however has an incredibly successful shoe line what gives most people don’t get the connection if you’re a big movie star  say george clooney  nobody really cares what shoes or suit he’s wearing what we care about are the roles he plays when you’re a music celebrity your fans are used to spending money on you they go to your shows they want to look like you they want to be like you you become part of their life so it’s a nobrainer that the audience if the products are right will respond to that that’s why marc anthony does so well jennifer lopez does incredibly well nicki minaj and adam levine who are two clients of mine are about to launch their lines at kmart it isn’t about celebrity as much as it is a lifestyle it’s a connection daily television is a connection you see someone everyday and you trust them you emulate them you take their suggestions sbk records which was home to vanilla ice and wilson phillips in the s claims some very successful alumni among them daniel glass who’s seen massive hits by phoenix and mumford  sons on his own glassnote entertainment… i couldn’t be prouder of him qa glassnotes daniel glass taking mumford  sons to the masses was torture in the beginning did you see those ceo traits in daniel back then when he was head of promotion of course republic records chairman and ceo monte lipman was one of my interns i’ve got those people all over the place i used to hire anybody who had a child that wanted to intern we would have  to  interns because i found them to be a great resource wed play music for them look at their lifestyle see what they’re into to this day i get anecdotal research from my grandchildren and my kids the first time i heard about lady gaga was from a granddaughter of mine when she was yearsold i took her to a concert and she wouldn’t let me come in so i waited outside and watched who was coming to that concert there were straight people and gay people and black people and people with piercings everywhere  it was such a variety of folks streaming into this club on the upper west side i said to my daughter who was with me “if i was still in the music publishing business i would go in and write a check for a million bucks without even hearing a note of music” because it was so clear to me martin bandier was the b in sbk and is still in the publishing business running sonyatv which bought emi music publishing the company he helmed for  years are you surprised that hes still at it and essentially doing the same thing i’m not surprised marty is a dear friend who loves what he’s doing it’s all about loving what you do publishing is a different kind of business i always look at music publishing kind of like real estate you own the songs and if somebody wants to use them they have to pay you it’s different than relying on finding a great song finding a great artist and making sure that the public becomes aware of them along with private equity firm apollo global management you were in the bidding to purchase emi publishing how do you think things have worked out i think the combination with sonyatv is awesome they have the scale to absorb a lot of overhead and as a business music publishing is a great business i know for sure nobody could run that business better than marty it’s an incredible asset  one i helped build and would have loved to own the truth is on a standalone it would have been much more difficult combining it with what is already at sonyatv and the great team that marty has assembled  a lot of whom are still there from when we assembled them they’re a terrific team and i’m sure they’re going to do very well you led two companies during or after their founders were incarcerated is jail time sometimes just the cost of doing business these things do happen when you’re a highprofile individual it becomes even more daunting of course but in both of those instances these are incredibly talented individuals steve madden got into trouble having nothing to do with his business his designs or his shoes madden was convicted of stock manipulation money and securities fraud in  and sentence to  months in prison he made a mistake and he got in trouble for it martha was never convicted for insider trading they convicted her because they said she lied on a question to a prosecutor in  stewart was found guilty of conspiracy obstruction of an agency proceeding and making false statements to federal investigators she was sentenced to five months in prison having said that martha was iconic her brand is iconic steve’s brand was phenomenal the public  they get it these are good people i also represented michael jackson for a number of years my christmas party invitation would say “if you’re not indicted you’re not invited” twitter shirleyhalperin facebook twitter email me print comments

and popular recording stars of the era the first artists he signed were the lovin spoonful in  he persuaded bobby darin to record the song if i were a carpenter and coproduced the record in  while working for columbia records as head of artists and recordings he signed janis ian after  when he got together with builder samuel lefrak to form the entertainment company he produced and found songs for glen campbell southern nights dolly parton here you come again paul anka cher eddie murphy the four tops and barbra streisand five albums from songbird to guilty including her smashhit pairings with donna summer and barry gibb koppelman produced the music for the television show fame in the mids his son brian then a student at tufts university in boston discovered a brilliant young performer named tracy chapman and brought her to his father then came rapper vanilla ice whose first album to the extreme was no  for six weeks and sold more than  million copies and the vocal group wilson phillips whose debut album sold more than  million copies and then his most recent successes arrested development which won two grammys this year for best new artist and best rap performance by a duo or group and jon secada the composer and singer who garnered a grammy for best latin pop album ive spent the last  years finding working with and developing talent koppelman says in a voice that gently betrays his new york city roots he was born in brooklyn and grew up in laurelton queens and that despite its calm tone reveals at least a hint of the precision determination and toughness necessary to compete in what can often be the cutthroat competition of his profession he describes his work as listening to songs hearing a song and feeling it would be right for a particular artist to sing and convincing that artist that he or she should sing it and then finding a producer to produce it making sure the music comes out in a way that matches my original vision the way i imagined it when i first heard it its incredibly simple and its incredibly difficult clearly for koppelman it is incredibly simple with his thinning gray hair roundish open face and confident selfassured demeanor he certainly looks the role of ceo and he dresses it too from the crisp white shirt to the blueandgold striped tie to the colorful wide suspenders illustrated with scenes from his favorite sports passion golf his business surroundings too are appropriate for his position music and video equipment of every kind populates his spacious realm cassette and compactdisc players turntable amplifier and vcr all presided over by four huge grayandblack tandy speakers suspended from on high one in each corner of the kingdom awards plaques and memorabilia are everywhere a platinum record

leukemia cancer and aids research along a shelf by one set of windows sits a group of modern sculptures among them a giant papiermâché rendering of his ear a gift from a partner with a dedication to my friend charles whose ears are exceeded only by his heart it is an appropriate artistic gesture for koppelmans ears have certainly been a prime factor in his career ears that have the ability to know on first hearing whether a song or performer has that indefinable somethingor doesnt it is says koppelman a matter of taste whether its taste in music or taste in cigars or taste in clothes and indeed he has just come from his personal tailor where he was delayed for  minutes over a problem with a button you have to know what is the best in order to have the best my wife has a great expression the best will do just fine and i think taste is what does it youre either born with it or you acquire it koppelmans ears work in a very basic way im a fan i cant sing i cant write music i just think that if im attracted to something everybodys going to be attracted to it when i listen to a singer one of the things i focus on is whether i believe that singer do i believe the words theyre singing is their voice distinctive will i recognize that voice any time i hear it when i listen to a song is it really organic do i feel the hairs stand up on the back of my neck when i hear it does it make me smile things of that nature that i think are the same things the audience hears and responds to maybe its some sort of commonand i underline commondenominator that i have within me because more of what i like everybody ends up liking despite his apparent instinctive ability to recognize the music that makes him dance the art of melody did not consume much of his childhood all i did when i was growing up was play stickball base ball and basketball koppelman says if stickball was the national pastime i think i would have been ty cobb he attended adelphi college and long island university earning a degree in physical education and an early goal was to coach or manage in baseball but he had a nextdoor neighbor who sang all the time and while in college he met someone else who also sang and played the guitar and the three of us would hang around and sometimes create some music he says i didnt create the music i was kind of hanging around and if they were singing songs maybe id try to sing on one of the notes that everyone else was singing so there might have been three people but there was only twopart harmony coincidentally another neighbor was the editor of cash box a music trade publication and koppelman says from about age  to  i was exposed to reading old cash box magazines so i some how learned there was a business of music meanwhile his friends were still singing i realized that if we sang at different college events it would be a great way to attract girls one easter week he suggested that the group go into manhattan to see whether they could get a recording contract we went in and knocked on doors he says i had the names of all these different record companies from reading cash box and as luck would have it we were signed by a small record company owned by a dentist from new jersey it was called shell records their logo was a big seashell the group took the name the ivy three and this unlikely creation would lead to a surprising musical hit and for koppelman and another trio member don rubin who would become a longtime associate a lifetime career one day koppelman says while working part time in the boys department of gimbels he had another idea why not a song about yogi bear after all the hannabarbera cartoon character was the rage on college campuses so he found a pair of songwriters and wound up working with them the song yogi was born and wonder of wonders became a hit we went on tour koppelman recalls we sang in the midwest we sang on the dick clark television show american bandstand and that got me interested in the music business sports was out and music was in the ivy three had no other hits and soon disbanded but koppelman and rubin got jobs writing songs for alden music which was coowned by music publisher don kirschner whom koppelman had met when the ivy three performed at grossingers in the catskills aldens stable of writers included carole king and neil sedaka and it soon became clear that koppelman was not in their league but he had not really wanted to be a songwriter he had just wanted an entree to the business so after about two years of unsuccessfully writing songs don kirschner hired me to be the director of his music publishing company he says it was just about the time he sold it to columbia pictures so my first real job was as director of screen gemscolumbia music that was in  two years later he and rubin went into business on their own in  they sold their company and koppelman went to work for columbia records first running their publishing company and then as head of artists and recordings then in  he and lefrak formed the entertainment company which was both a musicpublishing and recordproduction concern and says koppelman it just evolved from there in  he and two colleagues stephen c swid and martin n bandier the latter of whom had been general counsel for the lefrak organization and who had worked with koppelman since the start of the entertainment company got together to buy cbs songs for a reported  million cbs songs was the musicpublishing division of cbs records its holdings included the mgmunited artists copyright catalog including such songs as over the rainbow singin in the rain new york new york and the music from the james bond movies three years later the partners sold their company to thorn emi reportedly for more than  million and koppelman moved to emi records group north america as did bandier its a daily challenge koppelman says slowly taking another puff of his cohiba for with the change of positions has come a slight change in his role its as meaningful to me these days to discover a terrific young executive and nurture that person as it is to find a great young artist he says being in this business im surrounded by young people who have great energy and what i hope is to give them focus if you can give someone whos young whether its your child or an employee or a partner the guidance and the focus to harness their talent thats something you can really enjoy something else that koppelman clearly enjoys is his cigars and he has delighted in them for many years i never smoked cigarettes he says when i was  or  i saw somebody smoking a tiparillo so i started by smoking a couple of tiparillos and from there i kept moving up i spent a lot of time smoking cream of jamaica then i tried temple hall claros for a long period of time and ultimately i ended up with davidoff cuban no s and montecrisro especiales and now cohiba esplendidos i cant tell you that im a cigar aficionado he continues perhaps ignoring the fact that he has not one but two humidors on the window sill behind his desk the other in brown and blond wood is from dunhill and contains under its lid a plaque from the connoisseurs humidor society but i can tell you that i love to smoke cigars its incredibly relaxing and i like the taste he has from time to time tried other cigars he says im not a cuban snob ill try a dominican cigar but i just keep gravitating back to the cohibas to me theyre the best another of his loves as his suspenders suggest is golfin part because it recalls the sporting life of his childhood ive been playing about seven or eight years he says but ive only been serious about it for the past two or three in the beginning i played infrequently no more than ten times a year now i play every chance i get yesterday i had the best score ive ever made i shot an  so im making real progress what he loves most about the game he says is the competitionthe inner contest im very competitive he says and golf is a terrific way to be competitive within yourself its a great feeling to hit a pure shot i loved to play basketball and to shoot the ball and the skills in putting the ball in the hoop or putting the ball in the cup are not that dissimilar i also used to love batting in stickball making contact with the ball and being able to put it where i wanted to put it golf really combines so many of the sports i enjoyed when i was a kid koppelman lives in roslyn harbor long island he and his wife bunny have three children two of them are married he says and all three are now in law school his corporate life is quintessentially bicoastal he spends a week or so every month presiding over the companys hollywood office in the capitol tower on the legendary corner of hollywood and vine commuting is accomplished by means of a chartered private jet he stays in the presidential suite at either the hotel belair or the peninsula hotel and as is only fitting for a chief executive he has the services of a bentley and a driver on the shores of both the atlantic and the pacific because he has achieved so much in his career it is natural to wonder whether anything is missing is there something he wants to do that he has not yet done he reflects for a moment i dont think so he says sounding like a prototypically superconfident and accomplished ceo is he absolutely sure he ponders again he glances quickly at his suspenders and then toward the shelf that holds a newspaper reproduction of a portrait of him at golf painted by sports artist leroy neiman he smiles i guess he says id

koppelman and l londell mcmillan on honoring  and monetizing  his legacy  by jem aswad facebook twitter email me print comments wesley mann l londell mcmillan left and charles koppleman right photographed on jan  at cak entertainment in new york “special music industry advisers to the estate of prince rogers nelson” is not a job title that charles koppelman and l londell mcmillan expected or wanted but with the artist’s affairs in disarray after his death from an accidental drug overdose on april   he apparently left behind no will  and a tax bill estimated at  million it’s a job they undertook with determination and decisivenessin recent weeks the duo have announced deals for the estate with warner bros records and universal music group which include previously unreleased material from prince’s legendary vault universal music publishing global music rights and universal’s bravado for licensing and merchandise  all in time for the jan  due date of the tax bills first payment  and sources tell billboard that streaming deals for most of princes biggest hits will be in place on grammy night feb the two are perhaps uniquely qualified for the role koppelman  is one of the most formidable industry executives of the past  years he began his career as a singer but quickly became a topflight publisher working for don kirshner’s aldon music with clive davis at cbs records and in partnership with current sonyatv chief martin bandier founded sbk entertainment which was sold to emi in  for  million after leaving his post at the helm of emi in  he worked with steve madden and martha stewart before returning to the music business with his own cak entertainment in  where he has scored branding deals for jennifer lopez and marc anthony with kohl’s nicki minaj and adam levine with kmart and many others mcmillan  is a veteran attorney who has worked with michael jackson stevie wonder chaka khan and until  prince whom he also managed for part of their dozenyearlong working relationship  he is also owner of hiphop publication the source and jones magazine  at press time their status with the estate was in transition  comerica bank which took over from bremer bank as the estate’s administrator on feb  has not determined whether the two will continue as advisers  and two of prince’s six likely heirs among other disagreements have objected to mcmillan continuing as an advisor citing past nonpayment of a loan and his role in organizing an uneven prince tribute concert in october yet the two emphasize they will remain contractually involved in each deal they have made and will make for the estate below they talk about working with and maximizing the legacy of this unique innovative and very selfdetermined artist and businessmanyou both worked directly with prince what can you say about him as a businessmanmcmillan he was very much an innovator  dont forget he was the first major artist to use the internet to go directly to the consumer in a major way he didnt always seek the largest advances he sought the most amount of control and ownership so the deals were making now are in that spirit and i think its also important to work with people who had prior relationships with prince for instance universal evp michelle anthony is someone who worked with me and prince directly in a major way there are other executives that i was able to get prince to warm up to including koppelman including clive davis at one point people thought he had contempt for the record industry and people in the industry but he really just had contempt for the onesided legal terms that impact artists and writers and we wanted to be transformative and revolutionary in that sense prince did write the playbook and i think we had a very strong run at having people rethink how the business model and the industry workskoppelman he really laid the groundwork for a lot of other artists who redefined the kind of deals they would make so many more artists own most or all of their publishing and just do administrative deals so many more artists have shorter terms on their recording deals and understand that they need to get ownership at some point he was really a forerunner of making that public i mean when he put the word slave on his face as a tactic to get out of his warner bros deal in the early s he was saying to warner im not your slave he was saying the things that were right to be said at that time and everyone took notice most artists would be afraid to do that and most of the managers would quiet them down and say this is the way it works lets get you another big advance mcmillan he wasnt afraid and i guess i didnt know enough to be afraid laughter apart from prince’s nonwarner catalog what major assets are still unexploitedkoppelman theres tremendous tremendous interest in doing things with his legacy whether its a motion picture documentaries broadway cirque de soleil all of those are opportunities that i think are in the future for londell and me and the estate to work on but what we needed to do initially was get the deals in place that are going to enhance the estate and make it valuable for the heirs and those deals needed to be in the hands of the best of class we must have had  different publishing meetings  with every multinational and some that just administer and collect what was the state of his business when you took overkoppelman its important to understand that over the last couple of years princes business life was a bit of a shambles i use the analogy a little bit of michael jackson michael had no personal life but his business life was in great order he had the right record deal he had the right musicpublishing partner and ownership prince had a terrific personal life but over the last couple of years had none of those other great relationships that would enhance the value of his assets that worked for him because if prince needed money he could wake up on monday and do a concert on friday and raise whatever money he needed and he was very independent ill tell you one quick little story the first time i met prince was in  maybe  someone called my office a cold call and said they were calling on behalf of prince and we set up a meeting at the meeting prince said that he was incredibly impressed with sbk and diversity of the artists i was signing and how i was marketing them technotronic wilson phillips tracy chapman vanilla ice jon secada he asked if i would be interested in him producing artists for sbk and i said are you kidding of course  when can i hear some music he said you cant ill deliver it and youll put it out i said well its my record company i cant put something out and market it if i dont believe in it im gonna have to hear it he stood up said thank you very much and walked out the door i didnt hear from him again until londell called beginning the process for the  deal what is your status as advisors to the estate now that bremer bank is basically out of the picturekoppelman theyre not completely out yet they will be out at a point in time itll be sooner than latermcmillan and the court will give whomever steps into that role similar authority to move forward in a way that will be in the best interest of the estateare you still empowered to do deals and continue exploiting the assetskoppelman definitely do you hope to be in this role indefinitelykoppelman i think we would have two different answers to that mine would depend on the circumstances and how much aggravation may be involved when we started this march together i was very excited about it  recognizing how incredible prince was and also recognizing the opportunities that werent seized upon over the last number of years there was money being left everywhere people werent collecting it was a bit of a mess so in the first week i think we met or spoke to at least  different players and we basically had deals ready to go within two or three weeks after these meetings but then there were different sides causing different issues and that actually retarded some of the progress so i’m really good at what i do but i also dont need to do this and would not have done this if londell had not come to talk to me about it and if i didnt have the ultimate respect for prince mcmillan has a different perspective because hes the friend and kind of the conscience here and will do anything to make sure that the wrong things dont happenmcmillan his legacy is very much a part of my legacy i owe much of my career to his generosity his confidence in our friendship the work we did so im a lifer whether im approved by a court or just a citizen and a friend koppelman all factions in my view would like us to continue to do what we are doing mcmillan most factions laughter koppelman at the end of the day all of them will want that this actually quite easy to do the hard thing is deciding who to do it with but deals have a gestation period if youre talking about broadway or movies even if you did the deal today the product wont be ready for the marketplace until two years down the road and if you did it a year from today youre talking three four years down the road how relevant will it be then im not sure the public grows up every day and the attention span doesnt last forever  mcmillan what i am most thrilled about is taking this great body of work and working with the family and others in the industry to determine how it will be reintroduced to generation y and z and continue that legacy prince has amazing content beyond the music  there are filmed recordings of the most amazing performances that we havent even begun to discuss  koppelman thats the way you introduce prince to a younger audience or an audience that didnt really know him that well  and thats why the time frame is important for example to have a documentary for the younger generation and for an older generation to reacquaint and understand his incredible talent if that happens three years from now its not the sameis anyone currently going through the unreleased material and determining whats coming nextmcmillan currently things are on a schedule and there is not an active search through that material because of some of the things charles spoke about in terms of different interests so currently the process of that is being contemplated so how its done preserving the integrity of it making sure the right players are therekoppelman and determining whats releasable and how to release it et ceteramcmillan so that has not commenced but its soon to commence i do want to make clear that if prince were here we likely would not be making these deals  but also prince would not be needing half the value of his estate to pay the estate tax bill right now while some people may say why are you making all these deals prince wouldnt make these deals prince never wanted to lose ownership and control of his creations so we place ownership and control over dealmaking in order to preserve the assets and stay within princes brand values and as i have told everybody theres not gonna be a big irs truck backing up to paisley park saying ill take those assets is the fact that he didnt have a will a reason why so much of the value of his estate is going to the government koppelman no itll be worked out whether he had a will or he didnt have a will when you die theres an estate that has to be dealt with for the governmentmcmillan at some point somebody wouldve been getting it and having to raise the estate tax the governments gonna get paid regardlesswhy didn’t prince have a willmcmillan let me say it this way prince in my opinion shouldve had a will many of us who worked with prince advised him to have a will but those who really know prince are not surprised he didnt have a willwhymcmillan because prince would ask you “who wants to kill me somebody wants to kill me” laughter all of us thought that prince would outlive us koppleman and by the way the only reason michael jackson had a will is because on one of his financing deals the banker insisted upon it otherwise he probably wouldnt have had a will having one would mean recognizing your own mortality and some artists or some people mcmillan i do want to say one thing about the family and the heirs theyre not fighting with each other some of the issues are due to the fact that youve got six people who have been forced to come together some of them didnt even know each other they had different views and concepts different advisors so when you have that many differences it takes time to shake itself out londell two of the heirs have made some strong accusations against you is there anything you want to say in regard to that beyond what youve already saidmcmillan family members in mourning are easy to take advantage of people who advise vulnerable people should have a higher responsibility and ethics in terms of what they do im very confident in what were doing and i know that those stories are false both of those allegations have no truth and no merit whatsoever there’s never been any malice or wrongdoing that ive been accused of that has merit weve got four of six likely heirs that are very enthusiastic and im very grateful to have the majority of the family fully in support prince told me a long time ago dont worry too much about what other people say just keep doing the right thing and move forwardapart from the earlier warner bros material does the estate own all of prince’s mastersmcmillan everything from s emancipation on absolutely one hundred percent even with masters under warner bros  not all of them but the estate owns a substantial amount of the warner masters are any of the licensing deals for that material still in effect could someone license all of the nonwarner materialmcmillan certainly towards the latter part of his life there are a few that may be in effect but nothing thats materially going to impact what we do  to our knowledge to our knowledge  i want to make sure thats clearkoppelman thats why its always good to have a lawyer as your partnermcmillan weve got another big huge deal thats about to be announced its gonna be one of the best deals ever i think because hes got one of the greatest catalogs can you give any sense of what that deal iskoppelman laughing we could but wed have to shoot you mcmillan its for recorded music the catalog deal with universal announced on feb    facebook twitter email me print comments comments charles koppelman quizzes  lists  trending sign up  login feedback charles koppelman topics

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed
