call to discuss your project in more detail and review next steps for questions please email email protected or call  required documentation typically loans are initially submitted through our website and customers provide information regarding the project and their background customers are emailed a copy of their application and a list of documents needed to complete the application process the list includes credit report we look at all scores because we take a holistic approach proof of funds for down payment closing cost et cetera inspection report of the property if available list of

statement if a refinance borrower’s attorney information articles of incorporation if applicable developer biography to be posted on the website property descriptionplans to be posted on the website we also complete an independent background check of the borrower and the corporation  once we review all the items the developer is called to discuss details and answer any questions if everything looks good the loan is presented to our executive team to determine the interest rate points  structure of the loan it is important to note that many factors go into the underwriting of a loan we typically like the developer to put money into the deal the more the better how “seasoned” is the developer are they buying under market value what is the ltv more importantly what will the arv after renovated value be we typically look for an arv to be around  of the loan is it in an appreciating market we then call the developer to present the letter of engagement and answer any questions they may have once the developer agrees to the terms an appraisal and legal work are ordered all of this usually takes about  hours at this point then the appraisal is ordered the appraisal will usually take  days to be completed and returned to the underwriter for review this is a crucial part of the underwriting process because we always use a licensed independent third appraiser to evaluate the property and give us two values the “as is” value and the “subject to” value this can make or break a deal or at the very least renegotiate the loan size the appraiser is our eyes and ears at the property and helps ensure our due diligence to protect our investors’ capital once everything is signed off by the underwriter it is scheduled to close in total a loan can close as quickly as  days
