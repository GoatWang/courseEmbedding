return profile federated investors leveraged company stock federated’s leveraged company stock strategy applies a private equity approach to public stocks by targeting the stocks of leveraged companies using a bottomup value approach this concentrated portfolio invests in micro to midcap stocks with strong and stable freecashflow characteristics the strategy is managed within federated’s highyield group as credit and capital structure analysis are key components to its strategy of identifying mispriced stocks and risk management trade finance fixed income trade finance offers investors the potential for a source of uncorrelated return with low volatility and returns that adjust with inflation it is an asset class that requires specialized expertise including intensive legal and operational due diligence a deep understanding of risk and how to mitigate it and relationships with the largest global banks we believe that as the worldwide demand for trade continues to grow a diversified pool of trade transactions will consistently deliver the “pure alpha” that investors seek guardian capital – guardian global fundamental equity the investment process is a fundamental bottomup stock selection approach which is designed to give exposure to a concentrated portfolio of stocks each of which have significantly better growth and quality characteristics than the market average but which are not overvalued at the time of purchase portfolio construction is index agnostic and aims to provide high active share at all times country and sector weightings are driven by stock selection decisions rather than “top down” asset allocation activities guardian global dividend equity guardian’s global equity investment process employs a systematic approach to finding bestofbreed companies within global sectors our proprietary alpha system called gemx compares the rates of change in fundamental factors to detect pockets of strength in global markets to be rated as a buy in gemx a company must not only exhibit superior fundamentals but those fundamentals must also be recognized by the market in terms of relative share price performance in cases where there is a breakdown in the correlation between fundamentals and share price performance then conviction is low and the company is penalized in our analysis our global dividend equity strategy emphasizes dividend paying securities yet instead of selecting dividend payers on the basis of yield alone empirical evidence suggests that focusing on dividend payers that exhibit strong dividend growth payout and sustainability gps characteristics leads to strong risk adjusted returns coupled with reduced volatility guardian’s unique approach to stock selection is thus focused on selecting names that exhibit strong gps characteristics rather than seeking yield for yield’s sake aside from providing yield which acts as a dampening effect on volatility our dividend strategy has provided strong downside protection during negative market cycles preservation of capital is therefore an important attribute of our strategy which proves beneficial to any endowmentfoundation who seeks capital preservation the investment style is a combination of yield and growth at a reasonable price the overall emphasis combines a focus on yield as well as dividend growth chase investment counsel
