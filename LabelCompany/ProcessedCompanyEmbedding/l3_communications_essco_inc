radome leader for over  years our acquisition by l a fortune  company provided essco with the financial stability to fund our continued growth and product development and access to immense technical expertise and resources this association has allowed us to continue to build on our philosophy of providing the best performing radomes in the world our commitment to excellence is what has separated essco from its competition for over half a century and will continue to be our guiding principal as we move to the future what is a radome radome antennas are precision instruments whether used for satellite communications air traffic control weather tracking or surveillance an antennas performance will suffer immeasurably if its left to the mercy of the elements a radome is an electromagnetically transparent domelike structure that houses an antenna the primary responsibilities of a radome are to protect an antenna from the ravages of the environment or to provide an environment where the antenna is critical for security   why essco radomes l essco essco has always been at the forefront of radome technology throughout our history we have been market leader in the radome industry and been first to market in the development of new membrane materials geometric designs radome hydrophobic coatings and radome tuning technology as the industry leader in radome technology we are in a unique position to provide creative–cost effective solutions to your requirements voice of the customer we are constantly seeking ways to provide our customers with the highest

radome typical accessory offerings include doors hatches and windows  exterior accessories interior accessories installation accessories  maintenance accessories climate control equipment doors hatches and windows base access hatches and doors are used to gain access to the inside and outside of the radome doors andor base access hatches are located near the base of the radome for direct entry into groundmounted radomes or for access to catwalks on towermounted radomes sizes range from approximately  in x  in to  in x  in large equipment doors or access openings when large equipment needs to be moved on a regular basis essco can design access doors to meet that requirement  for sandwich radomes we can also design quick removable panels to lower the overall costs associated with large equipment doors panel removal kits for infrequent equipment access it is possible to remove panels near the base of the radome contact us to discuss your specific application as these requirements differ significantly depending on the type of radome utilized in your application zenith hatches and vents are often used on larger radomes to gain access to the upper exterior portion of the radome the zenith hatch can also be combined with a vent to provide a simple ventilation system using natural convection to minimize stratification of air inside the radome  this is accomplished by installing a manually adjustable louver at the base of the radome resulting in a stack effect of airflow within the radome  where more ventilation is required a forced ventilation system can be used a boresight window can be used to allow alignment of the enclosed antenna without removal of a radome panel an optically transparent lexan window typically less than ½ thick can be installed in any designated radome panel exterior accessories aircraft warning light assemblies mark the radome in accordance with faa requirements or incountry requirements the aircraft warning light includes a lightning rod and can include a maintenance rope and pulley assembly for international customers please review your local codes governing this equipment prior to placing an order lightning protection systems including a lightning arrestor down conductors and grounding wires are generally used on sandwich radomes depending on site locations and requirements occasionally more robust systems are required to provide adequate safety as lightning is a random and unpredictable event it should be noted that total prevention or  protection is impossible as the purpose of any lightning protection system is to mitigate the effects of lightning as much as possible in this regard essco has designed and provided multiple lighting rod systems in the us and other areas meeting the requirements of faastd b and d  for nato and countries throughout europe we have provided lightning protection systems meeting iec  metal space radomes act as a faraday cage and do not require a separate lighting rod unless equipped with an aircraft warning light in which case it is provided with the assembly and connected to the radome frame work at the top of the radome to provide multiple uninterrupted conductive paths from the rod to the base of the radome interior accessories interior lifting slings interior lighting and internal zenith ladders make it easy to work on the enclosed antenna and help minimize antenna downtime installation accessories anchor bolt templates ensure accuracy of the interface between the radome and its foundation  unless installing a radome on an already existing foundation we strongly recommend ordering this accessory at the same time as the radome in order to provide an accurate interface between the radome and its foundation radome lifting slings can lift an assembled radome on and off its foundation to reduce antenna downtime and installation tool kits assist in radome installation efforts maintenance accessories essco can supply anchor points at the radome zenith to allow for safety line attachment maintenance rope and pulley assemblies climbers harness kits external rope ladders panel repair kits and spare panels for ease of periodic maintenance for any radome essco recommends that a spare panel kit be purchased at the same time as the radome to avoid costly setup charges and minimum material buys if the spare panels are bought at a later time contact essco to discuss the right complement of panels to order for your radome climate control equipment a radome itself does not require any type of climate control however in certain cases where sensitive electronics could be affected by humidity or temperature or when trying to make the atmosphere more comfortable for personnel working inside environmental equipment such as heaters ventilation blowers dehumidifiers or air conditioners may be necessary to control the environment the table below provides an overview of climate control systems that are typically used  please contact us to discuss your specific site conditions and equipment sizing climate condition equipment recommended for sandwich radomes equipment recommended for space frame radomes comments hot humid

papers that l essco has published over the years after reading this material you will come to understand why l essco has been considered the worlds leading authority on radomes since   to this day many of the papers l essco has published has set industry standards and been adopted for determining radome performance tutorials ifr definition every large radome has joints in order to put the radome together  these joints have em wave scattering properties that are very different from the scattering properties of the panel surface and thus the em distortions introduced by the joints have to be accounted for separate from those introduced by the panel  to account for these distortions the radome industry adopted what is referred to as the ifr induced field ratio approach to determine the overall scattering levels of the radome and thus their performance the importance of hydrophobic coating it has been well documented for years that water on the surface of a radome has a negative effect with regards to antenna performance this tutorial provides information on the importance of using hydrophobic coatings to minimize transmission loss in rain environments noise temperature of metal space frame radomes in a metal space frame radome many engineers assume that the total transmission loss of the radome is made up of the the losses due to the dielectric membranes plus the loss of the metal space frame  this is not the case and this tutorial provides information on all of the components that make up the total transmission loss of a metal space frame radome using metal in radomes for many years it was assumed that metal should not be used in front of an antenna aperture as it would block rf energy  learn why the use of metal in some parts of a radome will actually provide better overall performance radome selector guide the radome selector guide provides an overview of the four major types of ground based radomes  the guide will help you in choosing the best radome for your application  in cases where this is not clear we recommend that you contact us and let one of our sales professionals determine the best radome for your needs  copyright  l
