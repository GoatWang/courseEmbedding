opportunities library contact why us boston many firms say they provide exceptional wealth and investment management services at us boston the proof is that most of our clients and the family and friends they have referred have been with us for decades experienced advice on what matters most at us boston we listen carefully and care deeply about our clients and their families we seek to understand each client’s personal values concerns limitations and opportunities  our deep knowledge and experience of the markets investments and financial matters form our objective “subject matter expertise” and while investment management and wealth management expertise is the reason many clients join us we believe our clients remain with us for the course of their lifetimes because we help them better understand respond to and manage the very personal choices they face in their lives families and businesses our clients benefit from our principals collective knowledge and wisdom gained from study and experience by combining backgrounds in finance accounting business law financial planning education and charitable institutions we have built a firm with the distinct mission to serve the individual needs of each client across all of lifes stages we offer many services in house but not all in areas that require additional expertise we introduce our clients to trusted specialists who supplement our advice we serve as the single point of contact to ensure client financial decisions are wellintegrated with lifestyle decisions finally at us boston we also are fortunate in that the depth and longevity of our client relationships allows us to grow wiser by virtue of the opportunity to live hundreds of lives simultaneously we personally have guided our clients through many life transitions crises and opportunities and frequently are the first call when something occurs in the life of one of our client families why because we help our clients solve problems we distill information to simplify complex decision making and we provide resources structure and discipline for the implementation of decisions over time individualized comprehensive service we choose to commit to a high level of personalized service for a select group of clients rather than a modest level of service to many  we help our clients pursue their goals and we save our clients time and effort by handling many of the administrative functions necessary to manage financial assets and income if there is a way we can follow up on a matter for our clients we will we also prepare each of our clients’ meeting agendas balance sheets and investment recommendations ourselves – we never outsource that work to an external computer program or firm that can’t possibly integrate individualized needs while the result may not be a fancy presentation book such “takeaways” are not the product we seek to produce our product is simply the set of recommendations and solutions that result from the application of our knowledge and wisdom to our clients’ individual needs and opportunities our “takeaways” are handprepared comprehensive “life” balance sheets and individualized summary letters detailing all of our mutual decisions and followup items we then use these summaries to keep all of us on track and to provide structure discipline and a way to monitor progress independent and small by choice us boston capital is independent and privately owned and has been so since its inception in   while we have working relationships with many major financial institutions and entities we are not owned or managed by anyone but ourselves this helps us focus on longterm stewardship of our business for our most important constituent – our clients at us boston capital we also are a small firm by choice we believe in growth to maintain our vitality for the future – for ourselves and our clients – but we do not feel the need to strive to be the biggest on the block we are large enough to be stable profitable and capable of negotiating for the appropriate services we need – but small enough to control the quality of our clients’ experiences  at us boston capital we believe that staying small allows us to be more nimble than large institutions in responding to opportunities in the market we also believe that many investment opportunities are small not large – and overrunning them with too much money will destroy their inherent value we have grown cautiously as we believe that the combination of analytical ability emotional intelligence and character needed to provide the insight and wisdom our clients deserve is not easy to find in an advisor  we will not compromise our level of service by diluting the experience quick facts us boston and its affiliated companies

approach to wealth management that is grounded in a long term view of the global economy and a firm conviction in both analytical market truths and human behavior in other words we are big picture thinkers – over time and across markets we believe profitable investments will be tied to improved productivity increased demand and the ability to generate sustainable cash flow over time no amount of marketing or hype will convince us that an investment makes sense if we cant figure out the small details ie how the investment generates sustainable cash flow for its owners we believe that markets and investment firms lose sight of these truths at times creating both risk and opportunity by maintaining a consistent philosophy a steady hand and a global view we believe we can provide attractive longterm returns to our investors we do not believe in playing zero sum games with our clients money by putting them in investments in which structurally there will always be a winner and a loser investment capital like labor knowledge and natural resources is an input to economic growth if it is not being used that way we believe there is a higher chance of misuse we manage risk at a portfolio level with diversification and strategic reserves and at an individual level by using tools that are stable and within the control of our clients not the market – cash flow and reserves insurance and the ability and desire to earn income and structure lifestyle disciplined innovators we understand that our industry and our clients’ needs are constantly evolving and while we eschew fads we strive to anticipate and respond creatively to new challenges and opportunities  throughout our fortyyear history we consistently have been early to identify and participate in many investment trends that subsequently have become market norms including styledisciplined equity funds global asset allocation a holistic approach to individual investment management
