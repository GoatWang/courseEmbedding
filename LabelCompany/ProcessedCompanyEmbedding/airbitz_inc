was developed from a collective need for a better city parking solution the apps creators having spent years driving and parking in cities around the world are no strangers to the difficulty of parking on busy streets after researching barriers that exist with our current freeforall system the organic parking team found three points to address its often hard to find a public space its difficult to afford a private space and its stressful to make plans without a guarantee of finding parking so we asked ourselves — what if a person that is parked where you plan to be could save a spot for you until you arrive well with a greater portion of our population making smartphones part of their everyday lives we knew that our solution relied on the development of a communication and exchange platform between these two drivers our goal is to facilitate this interaction within your community so you can be able to park your car seamlessly and affordably no matter where you go and

contractpowered platform prismprism is a trustless digital asset portfolio management platform powered entirely by ethereum smart contracts the platform allows users to create portfolios of leading digital assets such as bitcoin litecoin ethereum dash monero and more without counterparty riskchris groshong ceo of coinstructive inc introduced justin by saying “prism is the easiest and most convenient way for a nontechnical user to diversify and manage their cryptoasset portfolios”justin introduced the new product to a packed house showing a stepbystep video on how users create and fund their portfolios – known as “prisms” – and also touched on some of the product’s featuresone feature called the “leaderboard” shows the user a list of prisms that other customers have created and which ones are the current topperforming portfolios users can choose to create a copy of these topperforming prisms or create their own unique collection from more than  different assetsjustin stressed prism’s advantage is easy access to a widerange of blockchain tokens meetup attendees were enthused about this aspect of the platform and the potential for transactions in the world of cryptocurrencyto create a prism the user first indicates the amount of funds in ether they would like to invest then chooses a name for their prism and determines the assets they would like their portfolio to representafter the funds have been allocated among these chosen assets the user is prompted to provide the platform with their ethereum public address this address will allow them to monitor their prism over time and is where their payout will be sent at the time they close their portfoliolastly the user funds their prism by sending the exact amount of ether indicated to the provided smart contract address once this smart contract address is funded the prism is live until the user chooses to close the portfoliowhen the user feels they are ready to close their prism they simply visit their prism’s info page click “sell prism” and send a zero ether transaction to the address provided“if the prism gained  percent during the time the portfolio was open they receive  percent more ether to the address they provided when they initially set up their prism” emily shapeshift chief marketing officershapeshift announced prism in may during consensus  in new york city
