international code council icc and the international association of plumbers and mechanical officials uniform evaluation services iapmoues since  the company’s quality system has been registered under iso  an internationally recognized set of qualityassurance standards the company believes that iso registration is a valuable tool for maintaining and promoting its high quality standards as the company establishes new business locations through expansion or acquisitions projects are established to integrate the company’s quality systems and achieve iso  registration in addition the company has six testing laboratories accredited to iso standard  an internationally accepted standard that provides requirements for the competence of testing and calibration laboratories the company implements testing requirements through systematic control of its processes enhancing the company’s standard for quality products whether produced by the company or purchased from others wood construction products manufacturing most of the company’s wood construction products are produced with a high level of automation the company has significant press capacity and has multiple dies for some of its high volume products to enable production of these products close to the customer and to provide backup capacity the balance of production is accomplished through a combination of manual blanking and numerically controlled nc processes that include robotic welders lasers and turret punches this capability allows the company to produce products with little redesign or setup time facilitating rapid turnaround for customers the company also has smaller specialty production facilities which primarily use batch production with some automated lines concrete construction products manufacturing the company manufactures its concrete construction products at its facilities in zhangjiagang china addison illinois baltimore maryland cardet france seewen switzerland malbork poland and elvas portugal based on current information and subject to future events and circumstances the company anticipates that by the end of the second quarter of  it will finish consolidating the addison and baltimore facilities into a single manufacturing facility in west chicago illinois see item  — properties the mechanical anchor products are produced with a high level of automation some products such as epoxy and adhesive anchors are mixed in batches and are then loaded into onepart or twopart dispensers which mix the product on the job site because setup times are usually very short in addition the company purchases a number of products powder actuated pins tools and accessories and certain of its mechanical anchoring products from various sources around the world these purchased products undergo inspections on a sample basis for conformance with ordered specifications and tolerances before being distributed regulation environmental regulation the company itself is subject to environmental laws and regulations governing emissions into the air discharges into water and generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste materials the company is also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters the company believes that it has obtained all material licenses and permits required by environmental health

regulations see “item a — risk factors” other the company’s product lines are subject to federal state county municipal and other governmental and quasigovernmental regulations that affect product development design testing analysis load rating application marketing sales exportation installation and use the company considers product evaluation recognition and listing to the building code as a significant tool that facilitates and expedites the use of the company’s products by design professionals building officials inspectors builders home centers and contractors industry members are more likely to use building products that have the appropriate recognition and listing than products that lack this acceptance the company devotes considerable time and testing resources to obtaining and maintaining appropriate listings for its products the company actively participates in industry related professional associations and building code committees both to keep abreast of regulatory changes and to provide comments and expertise to these regulatory agencies a substantial portion of the company’s products have been evaluated and are recognized by governmental and product evaluation agencies some of the entities that recognize the company’s products include the international code council uniform evaluation service icces iapmoues the city of los angeles larr’s california division of the state architect the state of florida underwriters laboratory ul factory mutual fm and state departments of transportation in europe the company’s structural products meet european technical agreement eta regulations competition the company faces a variety of competition in all of the markets in which it participates this competition ranges from subsidiaries of large national or international corporations to small regional manufacturers while price is an important factor the company also competes on the basis of quality breadth of product line proprietary technology technical support availability of inventory service including custom design and manufacturing field support and product innovation as a result of differences in structural design and building practices and codes the company’s markets tend to differ by region within these regions the company competes with companies of varying size several of which also distribute their products nationally or internationally see “item a — risk factors” raw materials the principal raw material used by the company is steel including stainless steel the company also uses materials such as carbon fiber epoxies and acrylics in the manufacture of its chemical anchoring and reinforcing products the company purchases raw materials from a variety of commercial sources the company’s practice is to seek cost savings and enhanced quality by purchasing from a limited number of suppliers the steel industry is highly cyclical and prices for the company’s raw materials are influenced by numerous factors beyond the company’s control the steel market continues to be dynamic with a high degree of uncertainty about future pricing trends given current conditions labor union contract negotiations antidumping and countervailing duty trade cases filed by united states steel producers in  and   and the current political climate regarding international trade the company currently expects that the high degree of uncertainty regarding steel prices will continue numerous factors may cause steel prices to increase in the future in addition to increases in steel prices steel mills may add surcharges for zinc energy and freight in response to increases in their costs see “item a — risk factors” and “item  — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” the company historically has not attempted to hedge against changes in prices of steel or other raw materials patents and proprietary rights the company has united states and foreign patents the majority of which cover products that the company currently manufactures and markets these patents and applications for new patents cover various design aspects of the company’s products as well as processes used in their manufacture the company continues to develop new potentially patentable products product enhancements and product designs although the company does not intend to apply for additional foreign patents covering existing products the company has developed an international patent program to protect new products that it may develop in addition to seeking patent protection the company relies on unpatented proprietary technology to maintain its competitive position see “item a — risk factors”  acquisitions and expansion into new markets in august  the company purchased all of the outstanding shares of multi services dêcoupe sa ms decoupe a belgium public limited company for  million  ms decoupe primarily manufactures and distributes connectors for wood construction as well as plastic and metal label products in belgium and the netherlands including distributing the companys products manufactured at the companys production facility in france with this acquisition the company expects to be able to offer the belgium market a widerrange of its products shorten delivery lead times and expand the companys sales presence into the netherlands the companys provisional measurement of assets acquired and liabilities assumed included cash and cash equivalents of  million  other current assets of  million  noncurrent assets of  million  current liabilities of  million and noncurrent deferred income tax liabilities of  million  included in noncurrent assets was goodwill of  million  which was assigned to the europe segment and intangible assets of  million  both of which are not

intellectual property from blue heron enterprises llc and fox chase enterprises llc collectively ebty both new jersey limited liability companies for  million in cash ebty manufactured and sold hidden deck clips and associated products and systems the companys measurement of assets acquired included goodwill of  million which was assigned to the north america segment and intangible assets of  million both of which are subject to taxdeductible amortization net assets consisting of inventory and equipment accounted for the balance of the purchase price the company’s growth potential depends to some extent on its ability to penetrate new markets both domestically and internationally see “business strategy” above the company currently intends as part of its expansion strategy to continue to pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses see “note  — acquisitions” and “note  — subsequent events” to the company’s consolidated financial statements as well as “item a — risk factors” and “item  — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” seasonality and cyclicality the company’s sales are seasonal and cyclical operating results vary from quarter to quarter and with economic cycles the company’s sales are also dependent to a large degree on the north american residential home construction industry see “item a — risk factors” and “item  — management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations” employees and labor relations as of december    the company had  fulltime employees of whom  were hourly employees and  were salaried employees the company believes that its overall compensation and benefits for the most part meet industry averages and that its relations with its employees are good a significant number of the employees at two of the company’s facilities are represented by labor unions and are covered by collective bargaining agreements the company’s facility in stockton california is a union facility with two collective bargaining agreements one with tool and die craftsmen and maintenance workers and the other with sheetmetal workers these two contracts will expire in july and september  respectively the company’s facility in san bernardino county california also has two collective bargaining agreements one with tool and die craftsmen and maintenance workers and the other with sheetmetal workers these two contracts will expire in february  and june  respectively the company expects to agree with the san bernardino tool and die craftsman and maintenance workers union to extend the existing labor union contract that expires in february  while the parties are negotiating a new agreement based on current information and subject to future events and circumstances the company believes that even if a new agreement is not reached before the existing labor union contract expires it is not likely to have a material adverse effect on the company’s ability to provide products to customers or on the company’s profitability see “item a — risk factors” available information the company makes available free of charge on its website wwwsimpsonmfgcom copies of its

investing in our common stock involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below in addition to other information contained in this annual report on form k including our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto before you decide to buy or hold shares of our common stock the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face additional risks and uncertainties that we are unaware of or that we currently believe are not material may also become important factors that adversely affect our business we may not be able to control any of those risks and uncertainties if any of those risks and uncertainties whether described below or not actually occurs our business results of operations financial condition and future prospects could be materially and adversely affected and you may lose all or part of your investment to facilitate a review of our risk factors we have organized our risk factors into general groups of risks including “general business risks” “products services and sales risks” “technological and intellectual property risks” “regulatory risks” “capital expenditures expansions acquisitions and divestitures risk” “international operations risks” “capital and company structure risks” “employee risks” and “other risks” the grouping of risks is to facilitate your review only and no ranking of importance of risks or other inference should be made on account of such groups general business risks business cycles affect our operating results our operating results and our stock price are heavily tied to the health of the building construction industry with an estimated  to  of our total product sales being dependent on housing starts the construction industry is subject to significant volatility due to real estate market cycles fluctuations in interest rates the availability or lack thereof of credit to builders and developers inflation rates weather and other factors and trends further many of our customers in the construction industry are small and mediumsized businesses these businesses are more likely to be significantly affected by economic downturns than larger more established businesses uncertainty about current global economic conditions may cause these consumers to postpone or refrain from spending or may cause them to switch to lowercost alternative products which could reduce demand for our products and materially and adversely affect our financial condition and operating results additionally declines in commercial and residential construction such as housing starts and remodeling projects which generally occur during economic downturns have in the past significantly reduced and in the future can be expected to reduce the demand for our products and our stock price our sales are seasonal and we have little control over the timing of customer purchases if we miss seasonal forecasts or customers purchase our products in different quarters than we or analysts expect our stock could materially decline our sales are seasonal with operating results varying from quarter to quarter with some exceptions our sales and income have historically been lower in the first and fourth quarters than in the second and third quarters as customers tend to purchase construction materials in the late spring and summer months for the construction season in addition weather conditions such as unseasonably warm cold or wet weather which affect and sometimes delay or accelerate installation of some of our products may significantly affect our results of operations sales that we anticipate in one quarter may occur in another quarter affecting both quarters’ results if our operating results for a quarter are below the expectations of analysts and investors it could have a material adverse effect on our stock price in addition we typically ship orders as we receive them and maintain such inventory levels to allow us to operate with little backlog the efficiency of our inventory system is closely tied to our ability to accurately predict seasonal and quarterly variances further our planned expenditures are also based primarily on sales forecasts when sales do not  meet our expectations our operating results will be reduced for the relevant quarters as we will have already incurred expenses based on those expectations this could result in a material decline in our stock price we operate in a competitive industry and if we fail to anticipate and react appropriately to competitors technological changes changing industry trends and other competitive forces our sales and profit margins will decline our ability to compete effectively depends upon our ability to meet changing market conditions and develop enhancements to our products on a timely basis in order to maintain our competitive advantage many of our competitors have greater financial and other resources than we do our continued growth depends upon our ability to develop additional products services and technologies that meet our customers’ expectation of our brand and quality there can be no assurance that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products product enhancements and additional technologies that we will not experience difficulties that could delay or prevent the successful development introduction and marketing of these products or that our new products and product enhancements will adequately meet the requirements of the marketplace or will achieve market acceptance further one of the core elements of our strategy is to provide high quality products and customer services many of our competitors are dedicating increasing resources to competing with us especially as our products and services become more affected by technological advances and software innovations some of our competitors have more experience producing software and other technologydriven solutions as a result we are dedicating increasing resources to research and development in new and changing technologies in order to stay competitive and provide high quality and innovative products and services these increased expenditures could reduce our operating results additionally our ability to compete effectively depends to a significant extent on the specification or approval of our products by architects engineers building inspectors building code officials and customers and their acceptance of our premium brand if a significant segment of those communities were to decide that the design materials manufacturing testing or quality control of our products is inferior to that of any of our competitors or the cost differences between our products and any competitors are not justifiable our sales and profits would be materially reduced our future growth may depend on our ability to develop new products and penetrate new markets which could reduce our profitability our future success depends upon our continued investment in research and new product development and our ability to continue to develop new products that allow us to expand into new markets expansion into new markets and the development of new products may involve considerable costs and may not generate sufficient revenue to be profitable or cover the costs of development we might not be able to penetrate these product markets and any market penetration that occurs might not be timely or profitable we may be unable to recoup part or all of the significant investments we will have made in attempting to penetrate new markets product services and sales risks design defects labeling defects product formula defects inaccurate chemical mixes product recalls andor product liability claims could harm our reputation sales and financial results we have on occasion found flaws and deficiencies in the design manufacturing assembling labeling product formulations chemical mixes or testing of our products we also have on occasion found flaws and deficiencies in raw materials and finished goods produced by others and used with or incorporated into our products some flaws and deficiencies have not been apparent until after the products were installed by customers many of our products are integral to the structural soundness or safety of the structures in which they are used if any flaws or deficiencies exist in our products and if such flaws or deficiencies are not discovered and corrected before our products are incorporated into structures the structures could be unsafe or could suffer severe damage such as collapse or fire and personal injury or death could result errors in the installation of our products even if the products are free of flaws and deficiencies could also cause personal injury or death and unsafe structural conditions to the extent that such damage or injury is not covered by our product liability insurance and we are held to be liable we could be required to correct such damage and to compensate persons who might have suffered injury or death and our reputation business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected  even if a flaw or deficiency is discovered before any damage or injury occurs we may need to refund customers andor repair or recall products to the extent possible and we may be liable for any costs necessary to replace recalled products or retrofit or remedy the affected structures any such recall retrofit or other remedy could entail substantial costs and adversely affect our reputation sales and financial condition we do not carry insurance against recall costs or the adverse business effect of a recall and our product liability insurance may not cover retrofit or other remedy costs as a result of the nature of many of our products and their use in construction projects claims including product warranty claims and claims resulting from a natural disaster may be made against us with regard to damage or destruction of structures incorporating our products whether or not our products failed any such claims if asserted could require us to expend material time and efforts defending the claim and may materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition costs associated with resolving such claims such as repair or replacement of the affected parts could be material and may exceed any amounts reserved in our consolidated financial statements while we generally attempt to limit our contractual liability and our exposure to price or expense increases we may have uncapped liabilities or significant exposure under some contracts and could suffer material losses under such contracts we enter into many types of contracts with our customers suppliers and other third parties including in connection with our expansion into new markets and new product lines under some of these contracts our overall liability may not be limited to a specified maximum amount or we may have significant potential exposure to price or expense increases if we receive claims under these contracts or experience significant price increases or comparable expense increases we may incur liabilities significantly in excess of the revenues associated with such contracts which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations our software provides some design functions to customers and we increasingly are involved both in product sales and engineering services any software errors or deficiencies or failures in our engineering services could have material adverse effects on our operations and financial condition our design software increasingly facilitates the creation by customers of complex construction and building designs and we increasingly are involved both in product sales and engineering services our software is extremely complex and is continually being modified and improved as a result it may contain defects or errors and new versions may introduce new defects and errors while we have attempted to limit our potential liability for the failure of any designs created by our software as a result of defects in our software the structures could be unsafe or could suffer severe damage such as collapse or fire and personal injury or death could result errors in construction unconnected with our design could also cause personal injury or death and unsafe structural conditions even if our software design is sufficient to the extent that a structure designed by our software suffers any failure or deficiency we could be required to correct deficiencies and may become involved in litigation even if our software design was not the cause of such deficiency further if any damage or injury is not covered by our insurance and we are held to be liable we could be required to correct such damage and to compensate persons who might have suffered injury and our reputation business and financial condition could be materially and adversely affected while we engage in testing and upgrades there can be no assurance that despite our testing and upgrades errors will not be found in new and existing products resulting in loss of revenues or delay in market acceptance diversion of development resources damage to our reputation adverse litigation or increased service and warranty costs any of which would have a material adverse effect upon our business operating results and financial condition we are also increasingly involved in providing engineering solutions to our clients the risks associated with providing these services are materially different than the risks we historically faced when we only produced products if our engineers prepare approve or seal drawings that contain defects or otherwise are involved in any design or construction that contains flaws regardless of whether our engineers caused such flaws we may be held liable for professional negligence or other damages which could involve material claims we have a few large customers the loss of any one of which could negatively affect our sales and profits our largest customers accounted for a significant portion of net sales for the years ended december    and  any reduction in or termination of our sales to these customers would at least temporarily and possibly on a longer term basis cause a material reduction in our net sales income from operations and net income such a reduction in or elimination of our sales to any of our largest customers would increase our relative dependence on our remaining large customers  in addition our distributor customers have increasingly consolidated over time which has increased the material adverse effect of losing any one of them and may increase their bargaining power in negotiations with us these trends could negatively affect our sales and profitability increases in prices of raw materials could negatively affect our sales and profits our principal raw material is steel including stainless steel the steel industry can have large fluctuations numerous factors beyond our control such as general economic conditions competition worldwide demand material and labor costs energy costs foreign exchange rates import duties and other trade restrictions influence prices for our raw materials further the domestic steel market is heavily influenced by three major united states manufacturers we have not always been able and in the future we might not be able to increase our product prices in amounts that correspond to increases in costs of raw materials without materially and adversely affecting our sales and profits we have historically not hedged against changes in prices of steel or other raw materials in recent years however we have increased our anticipatory purchases of steel in an effort to mitigate the effects of rising steel prices this strategy coupled with changing economic conditions has resulted in substantial fluctuations in our inventory in recent years which can materially and adversely affect our margins cash flow and profits we depend on third parties for transportation services and the lack of availability of transportation andor increases in cost could materially adversely affect our business and operations our business depends on the transportation of both finished goods to our customers and distributors and the transportation of raw materials to us we rely on third parties for transportation services of these items which services are occasionally in high demand especially at the end of calendar quarters andor subject to price fluctuations if the required supply of transportation services is unavailable when needed our manufacturing processes may be interrupted or we may be unable to sell our products at full value or at all this could harm our reputation negatively impact our customer relationships and have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operation in addition a material increase in transportation rates or fuel surcharges could have a material adverse effect on our profitability technological and intellectual property risks our recent efforts to increase our technology offerings and integrate new software and application offerings may prove unsuccessful and may affect our future prospects our industry has experienced increased complexity in some home design and builders are more aggressively trying to reduce their costs one of our responses has been to design and market sophisticated software to facilitate the design and marketing of our product systems we have continued to commit substantial resources to our software development endeavors in recent years and expect that trend to continue in  we have a limited operating history in the technology space and may not be able to create commercially successful software and applications even if we are able to create initially successful ideas the technology industry is subject to rapid changes we may not be able to adapt quickly enough to keep up with changing demands and our software may become obsolete while we see having a software interface with the construction industry as a potential growth area we also face competition from other companies that are focused solely or primarily on the development of software and applications these companies may have significantly greater expertise and resources to devote to software development and we may be unable to compete with them in that space if we cannot protect our technology we will not be able to compete effectively our ability to compete effectively with other companies depends in part on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology in part through patents copyrights trade secrets and other intellectual property protections we might not be able to protect or rely on our patents and copyrights patents might not issue pursuant to pending patent applications our software copyright and other protections might not be adequate to protect our software and application code others might independently develop the same or similar technology develop around the patented aspects of any of our products  or proposed products or otherwise obtain access to or circumvent our proprietary technology we also rely on unpatented proprietary technology to maintain our competitive position we might not be able to protect our trade secrets our knowhow or other proprietary information if we are unable to maintain the proprietary nature of our significant products our sales and profits are likely to be materially reduced in attempting to protect our proprietary information we sometimes initiate lawsuits against competitors and others that we believe have infringed or are infringing our rights in such an event the defendant may assert counterclaims to complicate or delay the litigation or for other reasons litigation may be very costly and may result in adverse judgments that affect our sales and profits materially and adversely claims that we infringe intellectual property rights of others may materially increase our expenses and reduce our profits other parties have in the past and may in the future claim that our products or processes infringe their intellectual property rights we may incur substantial costs and liabilities in investigating defending and resolving such claims whether or not they are meritorious which may materially reduce our profitability and materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition litigation can be disruptive to normal business operations and may result in adverse rulings or decisions if any such infringement claim is asserted against us we may be required to obtain a license or crosslicense modify our existing technology or design a new noninfringing technology any of which could be costly and timeconsuming a ruling against us in an infringement lawsuit could include an injunction barring our production or sale of any infringing product a damages award against us could include an award of royalties or lost profits and if the court finds willful infringement treble damages and attorneys’ fees if we are unable to protect our information systems against data corruption cyberbased attacks or network security breaches our operations could be disrupted and our reputation and profitability could be negatively affected we depend on information technology networks and systems including the internet to process transmit and store electronic information we depend on our information technology infrastructure for electronic communications among our locations around the world and between our personnel and our subsidiaries customers and suppliers we collect and retain large volumes of internal and customer vendor and supplier data including some personally identifiable information for business purposes we also maintain personally identifiable information about our employees the integrity and protection of our customer vendor supplier employee and other company data is critical to our business the regulatory environment governing information security and privacy laws is increasingly demanding and continues to evolve maintaining compliance with applicable security and privacy regulations may increase our operating costs or adversely affect our business operations unauthorized parties may also attempt to gain access to our systems or facilities through fraud trickery or other forms of deceiving our employees contractors or other agents or representatives security breaches of our infrastructure could create system disruptions shutdowns or unauthorized disclosures of confidential information despite the security measures we have in place our facilities and systems and those of the retailers dealers licensees and other third party distributors with which we do business may be vulnerable to security breaches cyberattacks acts of vandalism computer viruses misplaced or lost data programming andor human errors or other similar events any security breach involving the misappropriation loss or other unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer employee supplier or company information whether by us or by the retailers dealers licensees and other third party distributors with which we do business could result in losses severely damage our reputation expose us to the risks of litigation and liability including regulatory liability disrupt our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations and financial condition we publicly post our privacy policies and practices concerning our processing use and disclosure of personally identifiable information on our website the publication of our privacy policy and other statements we publish that provide assurances about privacy and security can subject us to potential federal state or other regulatory action if they are found to be deceptive or misrepresentative of our practices we may experience delays or outages in our information technology system and computer networks we may be subject to information technology system failures and network disruptions these may be caused by delays or disruptions due to system updates natural disasters malicious attacks accidents power disruptions  telecommunications failures acts of terrorism or war computer viruses physical or electronic breakins or similar events or disruptions despite our security measures our systems could be vulnerable to disruption and any such disruption could negatively affect our financial condition and results of operations regulatory risks failure to comply with industry regulations could result in reduced sales and increased costs we are subject to environmental laws and regulations governing emissions into the air discharges into water and generation handling storage transportation treatment and disposal of waste materials we are also subject to other federal and state laws and regulations regarding health and safety matters our manufacturing operations involve the use of solvents chemicals oils and other materials that are regarded as hazardous or toxic we also use complex and heavy machinery and equipment that can pose severe safety hazards especially if not properly and carefully used some of our products also incorporate materials that are hazardous or toxic in some forms such as zinc and lead used in some steel galvanizing processes chemicals used in our acrylic and epoxy anchoring products and chemicals used in our concrete repair strengthening and protecting products the gun powder used in our powderactuated tools is explosive we have in the past and may in the future need to take steps to remedy our failure to properly label store transport use and manufacture such toxic and hazardous materials if we do not obtain all material licenses and permits required by environmental health and safety laws and regulations we may be subject to regulatory action by governmental authorities if our policies and procedures are flawed or our employees fail or neglect to follow our policies and procedures in all respects we might incur liability relevant laws and regulations could change or new ones could be adopted that require us to incur substantial expense to comply complying or failing to comply with conflict minerals regulations could materially and adversely affect our supply chain our relationships with customers and suppliers and our financial results we are currently subject to conflict mineral disclosure regulations in the us and may be affected by new regulations concerning conflict and similar minerals adopted by other jurisdictions where we operate while we have been successful to date in adapting to such regulations we have and will continue to incur added costs to comply with the disclosure requirements including costs related to determining the source of such minerals used in our products we may not be able to ascertain the origins of such minerals that we use and may not be able to satisfy requests from customers to certify that our products are free of conflict minerals these requirements also could constrain the pool of suppliers from which we source such minerals we may be unable to obtain conflictfree minerals at competitive prices such consequences will increase costs and may materially and adversely affect our manufacturing operations and profitability capital expenditures expansions acquisitions and divestitures risks our acquisition growth strategy presents unique risks for our business and any acquisition could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results we pursue acquisitions of product lines or businesses as one of our key growth strategies we compete for acquisitions with other potential acquirers some of which have greater financial or operational resources than we do as a result we may not be able to identify suitable acquisition candidates or strategic opportunities any acquisitions we undertake involve numerous risks including for example • inadequate access to information andor due diligence of acquired businesses • diversion of management’s attention from other business concerns • overvaluation of acquired businesses • difficulties assimilating the operations and products of acquired businesses including expensive and time consuming integration costs such as employee redeployment relocation or severance combining teams and processes in various functional areas reorganization or closures of facilities and relocation or disposition of excess equipment • inaccurate accounting or public reporting arising from integration of the financial statements and disclosures of acquired businesses • undisclosed existing or potential liabilities of acquired businesses  • slow acceptance or rejection of acquired businesses’ products by our customers • risks of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience • litigation involving activities properties or products of acquired businesses • increased cost of regulatory compliance and enforcement • consumer and other claims related to products of acquired businesses and • the potential loss of key employees of acquired businesses in addition future acquisitions may involve issuance of additional equity securities that dilute the value of our existing equity securities increase our debt cause impairment related to goodwill and cause impairment of and amortization expenses related to other intangible assets which could materially and adversely affect our profitability any acquisition could materially and adversely affect our business and operating results and as a result our business and operating results may differ from any guidance that we may provide we may decide to dispose of assets and incur material expenses in doing so we have terminated in the past and may terminate in the future product lines or businesses if we determine that the cost of operating them is not warranted by their expected profitability for example we closed our sales offices in china thailand and dubai in  there are significant costs with such divestitures which could materially and adversely affect our sales assets profitability and financial condition our capital expenditures may not be adequate to maintain our competitive position and may not be implemented in a timely or costeffective manner our capital expenditures are limited by our liquidity and capital resources and the amount we have available for capital spending is limited by the need to pay our other expenses and to maintain adequate cash reserves and borrowing capacity to meet unexpected demands that may arise productivity improvements through process reengineering design efficiency and manufacturing cost improvements may be required to offset potential increases in labor and raw material costs and competitive price pressures if we are unable to make sufficient capital expenditures or to maximize the efficiency of the capital expenditures we do make our competitive position may be harmed and we may be unable to manufacture the products necessary to compete successfully in our targeted market segments additional financing if needed to fund our working capital growth or acquisitions may not be available on reasonable terms or at all if our cash requirements for working capital or to fund our growth or acquisitions increase to a level that exceeds the amount of cash that we generate from operations and have available through our current credit arrangements we will need to seek additional financing additional or new borrowings may not be available on reasonable terms or at all our ability to raise money by issuing and selling shares of our common or preferred stock depends on general market conditions and the demand for our stock if we sell stock our existing stockholders could experience substantial dilution our inability to secure additional financing could prevent the expansion of our business internally and through acquisitions if we change significantly the location nature or extent of some of our manufacturing operations we may reduce our net income if we decide to change significantly the location nature or extent of a portion of our manufacturing operations we may need to record an impairment of our goodwill our goodwill totaled  million at december    recording an impairment of our goodwill correspondingly reduces our net income other changes or events in the future could further impair our recorded goodwill which could also materially and adversely affect our profitability international operations risks our international operations may be materially and adversely affected by factors beyond our control economic social and political conditions laws practices and customs vary widely among the countries where we produce or sell our products our operations outside of the united states are subject to a number of risks and potential costs including for example lower profit margins less protection of intellectual property and economic political and social uncertainty in some countries our sales and profits depend in part on our ability to develop and implement policies and strategies that effectively anticipate and manage these and other risks in the countries where we do business these and other risks may materially and adversely affect our operations in any particular country and our business as a whole  international construction standards techniques and methods differ from those in the united states laws and regulations applicable in new markets may be unfamiliar to us compliance may be substantially more costly than we anticipate as a result we may need to redesign our products or invent or design new products to compete effectively and profitably in international markets inflation in emerging markets may also make our products more expensive there and increases the market and credit risks that we are exposed to other significant challenges to conducting business in foreign countries include among other factors local acceptance of our products political instability changes in import and export regulations changes in tariff and freight rates fluctuations in foreign exchange rates currency controls cash repatriation restrictions and differing economic outcomes international operations expose us to foreign exchange rate risk we have foreign exchange rate risk in our international operations and through purchases from foreign vendors we do not currently hedge this risk changes in currency exchange rates could materially and adversely affect our sales and profitability because of our international operations we could be adversely affected by violations of applicable us federal and state or foreign laws and regulations such as the united states foreign corrupt practices act and similar worldwide antibribery anticorruption and antikickback laws as a result of our expanded international operations we face increasing compliance and regulatory oversight related to operating in foreign countries the foreign and us laws and regulations that are applicable to our operations are complex and may increase the costs of regulatory compliance or limit or restrict the products or services we sell or subject our business to the possibility of regulatory actions or proceedings the united states foreign corrupt practices act and other similar laws and regulations generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to foreign governmental officials for the purpose of obtaining or retaining business while our policies mandate compliance with applicable laws and regulations including antibribery laws and other anticorruption laws we cannot guarantee that we will be successful in preventing our employees or other agents from taking actions in violation of these laws or regulations such violations or allegations of such violations could disrupt our business and result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition results of operations and cash flows our international operations depend on our successful management of our subsidiaries outside of the united states we conduct our international business through wholly owned subsidiaries managing distant subsidiaries and fully integrating them into our business is challenging we cannot directly supervise every aspect of the operations of our subsidiaries operating outside the united states as a result we rely on local managers and staff cultural factors and language differences can result in misunderstandings among internationally dispersed personnel the risk that unauthorized conduct may go undetected may be greater in subsidiaries outside of the united states these problems could adversely affect our sales and profits failure to comply with export import and sanctions laws and regulations could affect us materially and adversely we are subject to a number of export import and economic sanction regulations including the international traffic in arms regulations “itar” the export administration regulations “ear” and us sanction regulations administered by the us department of treasury office of foreign assets “ofac” foreign governments where we have operations also implement export import and sanction laws and regulations some of which may be inconsistent or conflict with itar and ear where we face such inconsistencies it may be impossible for us to comply with all applicable regulations if we do not obtain all necessary import and export licenses required by applicable export and import regulations including itar and ear or do business with sanctioned countries or individuals we may be subject to fines penalties and other regulatory action by governmental authorities including among other things having our export or import privileges suspended even if our policies and procedures for exports imports and sanction regulations comply but our employees fail or neglect to follow them in all respects we might incur similar liability any changes in applicable export import or sanction laws or regulations or any legal or regulatory violations could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition  our manufacturing facilities in china complicate our supply and inventory management we maintain manufacturing capability in various parts of the world in part to allow us to serve our customers with prompt delivery of needed products such customer service is a significant factor in our efforts to compete with larger companies that have greater resources than we have in recent years we have substantially expanded our manufacturing in china nearly all of our manufacturing output in china was and is currently intended for export to other parts of the world because of the great distances between our manufacturing facilities in china and the markets to which the products made there will be shipped we may have difficulty providing adequate service to our customers which may put us at a competitive disadvantage our attempts to provide prompt delivery may necessitate that in china we produce and keep on hand substantially more inventory of finished products than would otherwise be needed inventory fluctuations can materially and adversely affect our margins cash flow and profits any tariffs duties taxes penalties imposed by the united states on imports from china would negatively affect our inventory management and profits we are subject to us and international tax laws that could affect our financial results we generally conduct international operations through our whollyowned subsidiaries our income tax liabilities in the different countries where we operate depend in part on internal settlement prices and administrative charges among us and our subsidiaries these arrangements require us to make judgments with which tax authorities may disagree tax authorities may impose additional tariffs duties taxes penalties and interest on us transactions that we have arranged in light of current tax rules could have material and adverse consequences if tax rules change and changes in tax rules or imposition of any new or increased tariffs duties and taxes could materially and adversely affect our sales profits and financial condition as of december    we held  million in cash outside the us as a result of operations from our international subsidiaries and any repatriation of funds currently held in foreign jurisdictions to the us may result in higher effective tax rates for us in addition there have been proposals from congress to change us tax laws that would significantly impact how us multinational corporations like us are taxed on foreign earnings recent changes in applicable law regarding the transfer of personally identifiable information by us companies doing business in the european union could lead us to spend significant resources trying to comply with the newly developed rules we may not succeed in meeting such requirements and we may face governmental actions and suffer business losses we have in the past relied on adherence to the us department of commerce’s safe harbor policy principles and compliance with the safe harbor frameworks as agreed to and set forth by the european commission and the united states which established a means for legitimating the transfer of personally identifiable information by us companies doing business in the european union “eu” to the us as a result of an october   european union court of justice “ecj” opinion the safe harbor framework no longer provides a lawful basis to transfer data from the eu to the us on february   the european commission and the united states agreed on a new framework for transatlantic data sharing the privacy shield the privacy shield aims to strengthen protections of european personal data and monitoring and enforcement of such protections in the us compared to that provided under the prior safe harbor frameworks in light of that ecj opinion and the privacy shield we have made and continue to engage in additional compliance efforts when transferring certain data from the eu we may be unsuccessful in complying with the new eu data transfer requirements and as a result we may be at risk of enforcement actions taken by an eu data protection authority until such point in time that we ensure all data transfers to us from the eu are in compliance with applicable law we may find it necessary to establish systems to maintain euorigin data in the european economic area which may involve substantial expense and distraction from other aspects of our business capital structure and stock risks a stockholder controls approximately  of the outstanding shares of our common stock which may reduce other stockholders ability to influence our affairs as of december    sharon simpson controlled directly and indirectly approximately  of the then outstanding shares of our common stock ms simpson therefore has significant influence with respect to our corporate matters requiring stockholder approval such as the election of our directors and proposals that come before the stockholders at the annual meeting or other special meetings  further if all or a substantial portion of her shares of our common stock is sold it could depress the price of our common stock any issuance of preferred stock may dilute your investment and reduce funds available for dividends our board of directors is authorized by our certificate of incorporation to determine the terms of one or more series of preferred stock and to authorize the issuance of shares of any such series on such terms as our board of directors may approve any such issuance could be used to impede an acquisition of our business that our board of directors does not approve further dilute the equity investments of holders of our common stock and reduce funds available for the payment of dividends to holders of our common stock future sales of our common stock could adversely affect our stock price our board of directors has the authority to issue from time to time authorized and unissued shares of our common stock our issuance of substantial amounts of new shares of our common stock could adversely affect the prevailing market price for our common stock all of the outstanding shares of our common stock are freely tradable without restriction under the securities act of  as amended the securities act other than shares of our common stock held by our “affiliates” as that term is defined in rule  under the securities act there were  million shares held by our affiliates as of february    in addition as of december    options to purchase  million shares of our common stock were outstanding and exercisable and restricted stock units with respect to  million shares of our common stock were unvested if a substantial number of shares of our common stock are sold in the public market pursuant to rule  by our affiliates or issued upon the exercise of our outstanding options the trading price of our common stock in the public market could be adversely affected delaware law and our corporate governance documents contain antitakeover provisions that could deter takeover attempts that might otherwise be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us section  of the delaware general corporation law may make the acquisition of the company and the removal of our incumbent officers and directors more difficult for potential acquirers by prohibiting stockholders holding  or more of our outstanding voting stock from acquiring us without the consent of our board of directors for at least three years from the date they first hold  or more of the voting stock as of february   we also have the following protective measures among others • under our current classified board structure only a portion of our board of directors is elected at each annual meeting • stockholders cannot call special meetings of the stockholders and cannot take action by written consent • a change in the composition of our board of directors that is not approved by the existing board of directors could trigger a default under our existing credit facilities these measures reduce the opportunity for a third party to launch a proxy contest to take control of the company to once per year these provisions may discourage delay or prevent a merger or acquisition of the company including a transaction that may offer a premium price for our common stock we will continue to incur increased costs as a result of being a publiclytraded company including costs arising from the scrutiny of our business practice and governance as a publiclytraded company as a us public company we are generally subject to the reporting and other requirements of applicable federal and state securities laws rules and regulations and scrutiny by stockholders and proxy advisors compliance with these laws rules and regulations and attending to stockholder requests requires us to continue to incur significant legal accounting and other expenses and costs makes some activities more difficult timeconsuming or costly and increases demands on our systems and resources and may continue to do so for example we recently expended significant time and resources in terminating our stockholder rights plan creating a compensation recovery policy and an antihedging and antipledging policy redesigning our executive compensation program and responding to other requests from our stockholders we continue to implement strategic and board initiatives to comply with recent and updated bestpractices related to our  public company status and respond to stockholder feedback and expect that will have to continue to allocate significant time and resources to such endeavors in addition as a result of disclosure of information in filings required of a public company our business and financial condition will become more visible which may result in threatened or actual litigation including by competitors and other third parties if such claims are successful our business and operating results could be harmed and even if the claims do not result in litigation or are resolved in our favor these claims and the time and resources necessary to resolve them could divert the resources of our management and adversely affect our business brand and reputation and results of operations employee risks we depend on key management and technical personnel the loss of whom could harm our business we depend on our key management and technical personnel the loss of one or more key employees could materially and adversely affect us our success also depends on our ability to attract and retain highly qualified technical sales and marketing and management personnel necessary for the maintenance and expansion of our activities we face strong competition for such personnel and may not be able to attract or retain such personnel in addition when we experience periods with little or no profits a decrease in compensation based on our profits may make it difficult to attract and retain highly qualified personnel in order to attract and retain executives and other key employees we must provide a competitive compensation package including cash and stockbased compensation our primary form of stockbased compensation is restricted stock units “rsus” we have issued a substantial number of rsus in various forms to our management and staff we cannot guarantee that such stockbased incentive awards are tax deductible as a result we may be required to pay additional tax on stockbased compensation to our employees if the anticipated value of our stockbased incentive awards does not materialize so that they cease to be viewed as valuable if our profits decrease or if our total compensation package is not viewed as competitive our ability to attract retain and motivate executives and key employees could be weakened the failure to successfully hire and retain executives and key employees or the loss of any executives and key employees could have a significant impact on our operations any work stoppage or interruption by employees could materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition a significant number of our employees are represented by labor unions and covered by collective bargaining agreements that will expire in   and  although we believe that our relations with our employees are generally good no assurance can be given that we will be able to successfully extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements as they expire from time to time if we fail to extend or renegotiate our collective bargaining agreements if disputes with our unions arise or if our unionized workers engage in a strike or other work stoppage or interruption we could experience a significant disruption of or inefficiencies in our operations or incur higher labor costs which could have a material adverse effect on our business results of operations financial position and liquidity other risks natural disasters could decrease our manufacturing capacity some of our current manufacturing facilities are located in geographic regions that have experienced major natural disasters such as earthquakes floods and hurricanes our disaster recovery plan may not be adequate or effective we do not carry earthquake insurance other insurance that we carry is limited in the risks covered and the amount of coverage our insurance would not be adequate to cover all of our resulting costs business interruption and lost profits when a major natural disaster occurs a natural disaster rendering one or more of our manufacturing facilities totally or partially unusable whether or not covered by insurance would materially and adversely affect our business and financial condition climate change could materially and adversely affect our business we cannot predict the effects that climate change may have on our business they might for example  • depress or reverse economic development • reduce the demand for construction • increase the cost and reduce the availability of fresh water • destroy forests increasing the cost and reducing the availability of wood products used in construction • increase the cost and reduce the availability of raw materials and energy • increase the cost of capital • increase the cost and reduce the availability of insurance covering damage from natural disasters • lead to claims regarding the content or adequacy of our public disclosures and • lead to new laws and regulations that increase our expenses and reduce our sales any of these consequences and other consequences of climate change that we do not foresee could materially and adversely affect our sales profits and financial condition we may have exposure to greater than anticipated tax liabilities we provide guidance on our anticipated tax rates failure to meet these anticipated rates could cause us to miss analyst forecasts and could result in material declines in our stock price our future income taxes could be adversely affected by earnings being lower than anticipated in jurisdictions that have lower statutory tax rates and higher than anticipated in jurisdictions that have higher statutory tax rates by changes in the valuation of our deferred tax assets and liabilities as a result of changes in foreign tax exchanges or changes in tax laws regulations or accounting principles as well as certain discrete items the determination of our worldwide provision for income taxes and other tax liabilities requires significant judgment and there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain although we believe our estimates are reasonable the ultimate tax outcome may differ from the amounts recorded in our financial statements and may materially affect our financial results in the period or periods for which such determination is made contracts that we file as exhibits to our public reports contain recitals representations and warranties that may not be factually correct the parties to any agreement or other instrument that we file as an exhibit to this or any other report did not necessarily intend that any recital representation warranty or other statement of purported fact in the instrument establish or confirm any fact even if it is worded as such often such statements are used to allocate contractual risk between the parties and the statements often are subject to standards of materiality that differ from the standards applicable to our reports in addition such statements may have been qualified by other materials that we have not filed with or incorporated by reference into this or any other report or document such exhibits should be read in the context of our other disclosures in our reports and it should not be assumed that any statement representation or warranty of any party is necessarily factually accurate impairment charges on goodwill or other intangible assets adversely affect our financial position and results of operations we are required to perform impairment tests on our goodwill indefinitelived intangible assets and definitelived intangible assets annually or at any time when events occur that could affect the value of such assets to determine whether a goodwill impairment has occurred we compare fair value of each of our reporting units with its carrying value in the past these tests have led us to incur significant impairment charges significant and unanticipated changes in circumstances such as significant adverse changes in business climate adverse actions by regulatory authorities unanticipated competition loss of key customers or changes in technology or markets can require a charge for impairment that can materially and adversely affect our reported net income and our stockholders’ equity failure of our internal control over financial reporting or our accounting systems could harm our business and financial results because of the inherent limitations of internal control our internal control over financial reporting might not detect or prevent misstatement of our consolidated financial statements we have used a commercially available microsoft accounting software system in connection with our operations in the united states europe and asia defects in that thirdparty system our other accounting systems or their implementation could result in errors in our consolidated financial statements our growth and entry into globally dispersed markets puts significant additional pressure on our internal control system failure to maintain an effective internal control system could limit our ability to report our financial results accurately and timely or to detect and prevent fraud cause investors to lose confidence in the accuracy and  completeness of our financial reports and subject us to regulatory investigations as a result our business and the market price of our common stock could be materially and adversely affected changes in accounting standards could materially and adversely affect our financial results the accounting rules applicable to public companies are subject to frequent revision future changes in accounting standards guidance and interpretations could require us to change the way we measure revenue expense or balance sheet amounts which could result in material and adverse change to our reported results of operations or

include those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k particularly item a — risk factors overview   to avoid fractional percentages all percentages presented in this  overview  section were rounded to the nearest whole number except for the estimated fullyear  gross profit margin the companys strategy is to grow its building material product offerings and geographic sales footprint so it is not so heavily dependent on north america housing starts it is focused on expanding sales in wood products by introducing new products into markets it currently operates in or entering new geographic markets such as countries in europe new wood products such as fasteners may be internally developed or acquired the company is also focused on growing its concrete products business in all segments it operates in and will also search for new acquisition opportunities such as concrete repair the companys strategy is to grow into new markets and products while leveraging its strengths in engineering sales and distribution and strong brand name the company designs manufactures and sells building construction products that are of high quality and performance easy to use and costeffective for customers it operates in three business segments determined by geographic region north america europe and asiapacific see note  — segment information • the north america segment sells both wood and concrete construction products and has been highly dependent on housing starts the company has made efforts to be less dependent on new housing construction by expanding its line of concrete construction products north america concrete construction product net sales increased  in  from  net sales primarily due to improved economic conditions partly offset by the negative effects of foreign currency translation to improve operating efficiencies during the third quarter of  the company initiated a multiyear plan to increase its north america connector factory production efficiency aiming to achieve a  factory utilization rate on two full shifts by moving highvolume wood connector production from both its san bernardino county and western canada facilities to its other major manufacturing locations in north america as of december   the company had relocated  of the highvolume connector production and  of the related product dies which is ahead of schedule once the transition is completed based on current information and subject to future events and circumstances the company estimates this consolidation will save approximately  million per year mostly in production costs both the san bernardino county and western canada locations will continue as sales and distribution locations and maintain the capability to manufacture custom orders to continue to meet the companys service and product availability commitments to customers in the southwestern region of the united states and western region of canada • the europe segment also sells both wood and concrete construction products and until recently relied primarily on wood construction products europe concrete construction product net sales increased  in  from  net sales primarily due to improved economic conditions and expanded sales activities into new countries partly offset by the negative effects of foreign currency translation as the result of a generally strengthening united states dollar in january  to increase fastener product offerings the company acquired gbo fastening systems ab gbo fastening systems for approximately  million based on preliminary unaudited information received from gbo fastening systems’ management the company currently believes that for the fiscal year ended december   gbo fastening systems had approximately  million in net sales based on current information and subject to future events and circumstances the company estimates that  integration expenses related to gbo fastening systems will be approximately  million to  million see note  — subsequent events to the companys consolidated financial statements • the asiapacific segment also sells both wood and concrete construction products the company has closed its sales offices located in china thailand and dubai as well as eliminated its selling activities in hong kong due to continued losses in the regions as a result concrete construction product net sales decreased over  in  from  while wood construction product net sales increased  in  from   the company believes that the asiapacific segment is not significant to the companys overall performance • based on current information and subject to future events and circumstances the company estimates that its fullyear  gross profit margin will be between approximately  and   • based on current information and subject to future events and circumstances the company currently anticipates that it is possible for the market price of steel to rise during the first quarter of  • based on current information and subject to future events and circumstances the company estimates that its fullyear  effective tax rate will be between  and  the company continues to invest in its strategic initiatives such as expanding its offering of concrete construction products including specialty chemicals wood construction products particularly its truss plate and fasteners and software solutions in support of these initiatives the company expects to commit resources to improve and increase manufacturing capabilities and is prepared to invest resources to acquire products or businesses that meet the companys goals such as the recent acquisitions of gbo fastening systems ab gbo fastening systems and cg visions inc cg visions in addition the company also expects to continue to invest time and resources in its stockholder engagement and other boarddriven initiatives including harmonizing its corporate governance and executive compensation to reflect current best practices and latest developments   in january  the company acquired gbo fastening systems for approximately  million gbo fastening systems is headquartered in gunnebo sweden with fastener production and surface treatment capabilities in sweden and poland gbo fastening systems has over  employees located in sweden poland norway and romania gbo fastening systems manufactures and sells a complete line of european approved cemarked structural fasteners and provides unique fastener dimensioning software for wood construction applications mostly in northern and eastern europe which the company expects to eventually distribute and sell in western europe the company also expects that the acquisition will enable the company to develop and expand distribution into northern europe its wood construction products manufactured in the companys manufacturing facilities in western europe further the company expects to access gbo fastening systems expertise in product development and testing and proficiency in fastener manufacturing surface treatment and painting to strengthen gbo fastening systems global presence and contribute engineering expertise in automatic fastening systems and fastener collation to help gbo fastening systems broaden both its fastener and structural connectors lines based on preliminary unaudited information received from gbo fastening systems’ management the company currently believes that for the fiscal year ended december   gbo fastening systems had approximately  million in net sales and  million in income from operations before interest nonrecurring expenses and income taxes based on such information and subject to future events and circumstances the company believes it is reasonable to expect that the annual return on investment with respect gbo fastening systems will exceed its cost of capital within  to  years although the company will incur integration expenses that are expected to result in operating losses during the next  years in january  the company acquired cg visions inc cg visions for up to approximately  million including an earnout of  million subject to meeting sales targets and subject to specified holdback provisions and postclosing adjustment cg visions was founded in  in lafayette indiana to bring new ideas and experience in the digital media and construction fields cg visions provides its scalable technologies and services to a number of the top  midsized to large builders in the united states of america this acquisition is expected to enable the company to build closer partnerships with builders by offering software and services to help them control costs and increase efficiency at all stages of the home building process the company expects to look for opportunities to incorporate its products into cg visions building information modeling bim packages and apply cg visions’ expertise to the companys existing and future software initiatives based on preliminary unaudited information received from cg visions’ management team the company currently believes that for the fiscal year ended december   cg visions had approximately  million in net sales and  million in income from operations before interest and income taxes based on such information and subject to future events and circumstances the company believes that it is reasonable to expect that the annual return on investment with respect to the company’s investment in cg visions will exceed its cost of capital within  to  years while we believe that the unaudited thirdparty information in connection with our recent acquisitions provides investors with useful information about the financial performance of our acquisition targets and allow for greater transparency with respect to information relied on by our management in evaluating and executing such acquisitions investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of such unaudited information as an analytical tool for example these measures may be different from financial measures used by the company andor other companies limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes in july  the companys board of directors approved a plan to replace the companys current inhouse enterprise resource planning erp and accounting platforms with a fully integrated erp platform from sap america inc sap management plans to replace the current platforms in multiple phases over a period of three to four years minimize project scope expansion and focus on configuring instead of customizing the standard sap modules with an emphasis on creating a global template that will accommodate all company product lines and market segments based on current information and subject to future events and  circumstances management estimates that the new platform will cost approximately  million including capital expenditures which will increase annual operating expenses during the implementation phase from  to  when fully implemented however the company anticipates that the new platform could result in annual savings approximately equal to  of net sales from improved production scheduling and inventory management as well as lower labor administrative and compliance costs the company generally manufactures products and incurs costs in the areas where sales occur therefore for each of the company’s foreign operations the local currency is the functional currency and each foreign operation transacts primarily in its functional currency the company does not currently have or plan to enter into foreign currency contracts to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange rates   the administrative  all other segment primarily includes expenses such as selfinsured workers compensation claims costs for employees of the company’s venting business which was sold in  stockbased compensation for certain members of management interest expense foreign exchange gains or losses and income tax expense as well as income and expenses related to real estate activities such as rental income and depreciation expense on the company’s facility in vacaville california which the company has leased to a third party for a year term expiring in august  unlike lumber or other products that have a more direct correlation to housing starts the company’s products are used to a greater extent in areas that are subject to natural forces such as seismic or wind events the company’s products are used in a sequential process that follows the construction process residential and commercial construction begins with the foundation followed by the wall and the roof systems and the installation of the company’s products flow into a project or a house according to these schedules foundation product sales could be considered a leading indicator for the company sales of these products in the fourth quarter of  increased compared to the same period in  the company’s sales also tend to be seasonal with operating results varying from quarter to quarter with some exceptions the company’s sales and income have historically been lower in the first and fourth quarters than in the second and third quarters of the year as customers purchase construction materials in the late spring and summer months for the construction season in addition weather conditions such as extended wet or cold weather in any region of north america or europe which affect and sometimes delay installation of some of the company’s products could negatively affect the company’s net sales and results of operations political and economic events can also affect the company’s sales and

to the  release of an uncertain tax position as well as a solar tax credit for installing solar panels at one of the companys facilities which were nonrecurring    critical accounting policies and estimates   the critical accounting policies described below affect the company’s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the companys consolidated financial statements if the company’s business conditions change or if it uses different assumptions or estimates in the application of these and other accounting policies the company’s future results of operations could be adversely affected   inventory valuation   inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value market cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition as follows   • raw materials and purchased finished goods — principally valued at cost determined on a weighted average basis and • inprocess products and finished goods — cost of direct materials and labor plus attributable overhead based on a normal level of activity   the company applies net realizable value and obsolescence to the gross value of inventory the company estimates net realizable value based on estimated selling price less further costs to completion and disposal the company impairs slowmoving products by comparing inventories on hand to projected demand if onhand supply of a product exceeds projected demand or if the company believes the product is no longer marketable the product is considered obsolete inventory the company revalues obsolete inventory to its net realizable value the company has consistently applied this methodology the company believes that this approach is prudent and makes suitable impairments for slowmoving and obsolete inventory when impairments are established a new cost basis of the inventory is created unexpected change in market demand building codes or buyer preferences could reduce the rate of inventory turnover and require the company to recognize more obsolete inventory   revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete net of applicable provision for discounts returns and incentives whether actual or estimated based on the company’s experience this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the sales agreement or purchase order ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable the company’s general shipping terms are fob shipping point where title is transferred and revenue is recognized when the products are shipped to customers when the company sells fob destination point title is transferred and the company recognizes revenue on delivery or customer acceptance depending on terms of the sales agreement service sales representing aftermarket repair and maintenance engineering activities software license sales and service and lease income though significantly less than  of net sales and not material to the consolidated financial statements are recognized as the services are completed or the software products and services are delivered if actual costs of sales returns incentives and discounts were to significantly exceed the recorded estimated allowance the company’s sales would be adversely affected   business combinations   the company recognizes separately from goodwill the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed at their acquisition date fair values goodwill as of the acquisition date is measured as the excess of consideration transferred and the net of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed while the company uses its best estimates and assumptions as a part of the purchase price allocation process to value assets acquired and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date the company’s estimates are inherently uncertain and subject to refinement as a result during the measurement period which may be up to one year from the acquisition date the company records adjustments to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed with the corresponding offset to goodwill on the conclusion of the measurement period or final determination of the values of assets acquired or liabilities assumed whichever comes first the company records subsequent adjustments if any to its consolidated statements of operations none of the subsequent adjustments for the fiscal years ended    and  were material   accounting for business combinations requires the company’s management to make significant estimates and assumptions especially at the acquisition date with respect to intangible assets although the company believes that the assumptions and estimates it has made in the past have been reasonable and appropriate they are based in part on historical experience and information obtained from the management of the acquired companies and are inherently uncertain    examples of critical estimates in valuing certain of the intangible assets that the company has acquired include   • future expected cash flows from customer relationships and acquired unpatented technologies and patents • the acquired company’s brand and competitive position and assumptions about the period of time the acquired brand will continue to be used in the combined company’s product portfolio and • discount rates   unanticipated events and circumstances may affect the accuracy or validity of such assumptions estimates or actual results   for a given acquisition the company may identify preacquisition contingencies as of the acquisition date and may extend its review and evaluation of these preacquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period up to one year from the acquisition date to obtain sufficient information to assess whether the company includes these contingencies as a part of the purchase price allocation and if so to determine their estimated amounts   if the company determines that a preacquisition contingency that is not incometax related is probable and estimable as of the acquisition date the company records its best estimate for such a contingency as a part of the preliminary purchase price allocation the company often continues to gather information and evaluate its preacquisition contingencies throughout the measurement period if the company changes the amounts recorded or identifies additional preacquisition contingencies during the measurement period such amounts are included in the purchase price allocation during the measurement period and subsequently in the company’s results of operations in addition the company estimates uncertain tax positions and income tax related valuation allowances assumed in connection with a business combination initially as of the acquisition date the company reevaluates these items quarterly with any adjustments to its preliminary estimates being recorded to goodwill if the company is within the measurement period the company continues to collect information to determine estimated values subsequent to the measurement period or the company’s final determination of the uncertain tax positions estimated value or taxrelated valuation allowances whichever comes first changes to these uncertain tax positions and taxrelated valuation allowances will affect the company’s provision for income taxes in its consolidated statement of operations and could have a material effect on the company’s results of operations and financial position   goodwill impairment testing   the company tests goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit level on an annual basis in the fourth quarter for the company the company also reviews goodwill for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable these events or circumstances could include a significant change in the business climate legal factors operating performance indicators competition or disposition or relocation of a significant portion of a reporting unit   the reporting unit level is generally one level below the operating segment which is at the country level except for the united states australia and sp clever reporting units   the company determined that the united states reporting unit includes four components northwest united states southwest united states northeast united states and southeast united states collectively the “us components” the company aggregates the us components into a single reporting unit because management concluded that they are economically similar and that the goodwill is recoverable from the us components working in concert the us components are economically similar because of a number of factors including selling similar products to shared customers and sharing assets and services such as intellectual property manufacturing assets for certain products research and development projects manufacturing processes management of inventory excesses and shortages and administrative services these activities are managed centrally at the us components level and costs are allocated among the four us components   the company determined that the australia reporting unit includes four components australia new zealand south africa and united arab emirates collectively the “au components” the company aggregates the au components into a single reporting unit because management concluded that they are economically similar and that the goodwill is recoverable from the au components working in concert the au components are economically similar because of a number of factors including that new zealand south africa and united arab emirates operate as extensions of their australian parent company selling similar products and sharing assets and services such as intellectual property manufacturing assets for certain products management of inventory excesses and shortages and administrative services these activities are managed centrally at the au components level and costs are allocated among the au components   the company determined that the sp clever reporting unit includes eight components sp switzerland sp poland sp austria sp the netherlands sp portugal sp germany sp france and sp nordic collectively the sp components”  the company aggregates the sp components into a single reporting unit because management concluded that they are economically similar and that the goodwill is recoverable from the sp components working in concert the sp components are economically similar because of a number of factors including sharing assets and services such as intellectual property manufacturing assets for certain products research and development projects manufacturing processes management of inventory excesses and shortages and administrative services these activities are managed centrally at the sp components level and costs are allocated among the sp components   for certain reporting units the company may first assess qualitative factors related to the goodwill of the reporting unit to determine whether it is necessary to perform a twostep impairment test if the company judges that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill no further testing is required if the company judges that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill management will perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step of the companys annual goodwill impairment test step  the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value the fair value calculation uses both the income approach discounted cash flow method and the market approach equally weighted if the company judges that the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit a second step of the impairment test must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the company judges that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the company would record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the implied fair value of the goodwill and the carrying value   determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is a judgment involving significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates operating margins and working capital requirements used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates selected multiples control premiums and future economic and market conditions level  fair value inputs the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates   assumptions about a reporting unit’s operating performance in the first year of the discounted cash flow model used to determine whether or not the goodwill related to that reporting unit is impaired are derived from the company’s budget the fair value model considers such factors as macroeconomic conditions revenue and expense forecasts product line changes material labor and overhead costs tax rates working capital levels and competitive environment future estimates however derived are inherently uncertain but the company believes that this is the most appropriate source on which to base its fair value calculations   the company uses these parameters only to provide a basis for the determination of whether or not the goodwill related to a reporting unit is impaired no inference whatsoever should be drawn from these parameters about the company’s future financial performance and they should not be taken as projections or guidance of any kind   the    and  annual testing of goodwill for impairment did not result in impairment charges the impairment charge taken in the third quarter of  was associated with assets in the germany reporting unit acquired from bierbach gmbh  co kg bierbach in  the factors that led to the third quarter impairment were a failure to retain bierbachs historical customers and increased competition which led to the reduction in the contingent consideration liability related to the bierbach acquisition and resulted in management performing an impairment test to evaluate the recoverability of the germany reporting units goodwill the test resulted in the impairment of all of the reporting unit’s goodwill in the amount of  million in connection with the impairment of the goodwill the company also reviewed associated longlived assets in germany such as property and equipment and intangible assets for recoverability by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets to their carrying values no impairment of longlived assets was required as a result of that review during the third quarter of  effect of new accounting standards see note  — recently adopted accounting standards and note  — recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted to the

other matters arising in the ordinary course of business periodically we evaluate the status of each matter and assess our potential financial exposure the company records a provision for a liability when we believe that a it is probable that a loss has been incurred and b the amount is reasonably estimable significant judgment is required to determine both probability and the estimated amount the

manufacturing co inc and subsidiaries notes to consolidated financial statements    operations and summary of significant accounting policies   nature of operations   simpson manufacturing co inc through its subsidiary simpson strongtie company inc and its other subsidiaries collectively the “company” designs engineers and is a leading manufacturer of wood construction products including connectors truss plates fastening systems fasteners and shearwalls and concrete construction products including adhesives specialty chemicals mechanical anchors powder actuated tools and fiber reinforcing materials the company markets its products to the residential construction industrial commercial and infrastructure construction remodeling and doityourself markets   the company operates exclusively in the building products industry the company’s products are sold primarily in the united states canada europe the south pacific and in asia up until  when the company closed the sales offices there revenues have some geographic market concentration in the united states a portion of the company’s business is therefore dependent on economic activity within the north america segment the company is dependent on the availability of steel its primary raw material   outofperiod adjustment in the first quarter of  the company recorded an outofperiod adjustment which increased gross profit income from operations and net income in total by  million   million and  million  respectively the adjustment resulted from an overstatement of prior periods workers compensation expense net of cash profit sharing expense and was not material to the current periods or any prior periods financial statements principles of consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of simpson manufacturing co inc and its subsidiaries investments in  or less owned entities are accounted for using either cost or the equity method the company consolidates all variable interest entities vies where it is the primary beneficiary there were no vies as of december   or   all significant intercompany transactions have been eliminated   use of estimates   the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america as amended from time to time gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   revenue recognition   the company recognizes revenue when the earnings process is complete net of applicable provision for discounts returns and incentives whether actual or estimated based on the company’s experience this generally occurs when products are shipped to the customer in accordance with the sales agreement or purchase order ownership and risk of loss pass to the customer collectability is reasonably assured and pricing is fixed or determinable the company’s general shipping terms are fob shipping point where title is transferred and revenue is recognized when the products are shipped to customers when the company sells fob destination point title is transferred and the company recognizes revenue on delivery or customer acceptance depending on terms of the sales agreement service sales representing aftermarket repair and maintenance engineering activities software license sales and service and lease income though significantly less than  of net sales and not material to the consolidated financial statements are recognized as the services are completed or the software products and services are delivered if actual costs of sales returns incentives and discounts were to significantly exceed the recorded estimated allowances the company’s sales would be adversely affected sales incentive and advertising allowances   the company records estimated reductions to revenues for sales incentives primarily rebates for volume discounts and allowances for cooperative advertising    allowances for sales discounts   the company records estimated reductions to revenues for discounts taken on early payment of invoices by its customers   cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid investments with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less at the time of purchase to be cash equivalents allowance for doubtful accounts   the company assesses the collectability of specific customer accounts that would be considered doubtful based on the customer’s financial condition payment history credit rating and other factors that the company considers relevant or accounts that the company assigns for collection the company reserves for the portion of those outstanding balances that the company believes it is not likely to collect based on historical collection experience the company also reserves  of the amounts that it deems uncollectable due to a customer’s deteriorating financial condition or bankruptcy if the financial condition of the company’s customers were to deteriorate resulting in probable inability to make payments additional allowances may be required   inventory valuation   inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value cost includes all costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location and condition as follows   • raw materials and purchased finished goods for resale — principally valued at cost determined on a weighted average basis and • inprocess products and finished goods — cost of direct materials and labor plus attributable overhead based on a normal level of activity   the company applies net realizable value and obsolescence to the gross value of the inventory the company estimates net realizable value based on estimated selling price less further costs to completion and disposal the company impairs slowmoving products by comparing inventories on hand to projected demand if onhand supply of a product exceeds projected demand or if the company believes the product is no longer marketable the product is considered obsolete inventory the company revalues obsolete inventory to its net realizable value the company has consistently applied this methodology the company believes that this approach is prudent and makes suitable impairments for slowmoving and obsolete inventory when impairments are established a new cost basis of the inventory is created unexpected change in market demand building codes or buyer preferences could reduce the rate of inventory turnover and require the company to recognize more obsolete inventory   warranties and recalls   the company provides product warranties for specific product lines and records estimated recall expenses in the period in which the recall occurs none of which has been material to the consolidated financial statements in a limited number of circumstances the company may also agree to indemnify customers against legal claims made against those customers by the end users of the company’s products historically payments made by the company if any under such agreements have not had a material effect on the company’s consolidated results of operations cash flows or financial position fair value of financial instruments   the “fair value measurements and disclosures” topic of the financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification ™  “asc” establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs used to measure fair value this hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows level  inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly through market corroboration for substantially the full term of the financial instrument level  inputs are unobservable inputs based on the company’s assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value a financial asset’s or liability’s classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement    as of december    the company’s investments consisted of only money market funds and as of december   its investments consisted of only united states treasury securities and money market funds which are the company’s primary financial instruments maintained in cash equivalents and carried at cost approximating fair value based on level  inputs the balance of the company’s primary financial instruments was as follows   in thousands at december      united states treasury securities and money market funds       the carrying amounts of trade accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued liabilities approximate fair value due to the shortterm nature of these instruments the fair value of the company’s contingent consideration related to acquisitions is classified as level  within the fair value hierarchy as it is based on unobserved inputs and assumptions in  the fair value of the contingent consideration related to the acquisition of bierbach gmbh  co kg bierbach a germany company was decreased from  million to  million as a result of not retaining bierbachs historical customers and increased competition   property plant and equipment   property plant and equipment are carried at cost major renewals and betterments are capitalized maintenance and repairs are expensed on a current basis when assets are sold or retired their costs and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the resulting gains or losses are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations   the “intangibles—goodwill and other” topic of the fasb asc provides guidance on capitalization of the costs incurred for computer software developed or obtained for internal use the company capitalizes qualified external costs and internal costs related to the purchase and implementation of software projects used for business operations and engineering design activities capitalized software costs primarily include purchased software and external consulting fees capitalized software projects are amortized over the estimated useful lives of the software   depreciation and amortization   depreciation of software machinery and equipment is provided using accelerated methods over the following estimated useful lives  software  to  years machinery and equipment  to  years   buildings and site improvements are depreciated using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives which range from  to  years leasehold improvements are amortized using the straightline method over the shorter of the expected life or the remaining term of the lease amortization of purchased intangible assets with finite useful lives is computed using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets   inprocess research and development assets   inprocess research and development “iprd” assets represent capitalized incomplete research projects that the company acquired through business combinations such assets are initially measured at their acquisitiondate fair values and are required to be classified as indefinitelived assets until the successful completion of the associated research and development efforts during the development period after the date of acquisition these assets will not be amortized until the research and development projects are completed and the resulting assets are ready for their intended use the company performs an impairment test annually and more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate it that is more likely than not that the asset is impaired on successful completion of the research and development project the company makes a determination about the thenremaining useful life and begins amortization as of december   the company had no iprd assets cost of sales   the types of costs included in cost of sales include material labor factory and tooling overhead shipping and freight costs major components of these expenses are material costs such as steel packaging and cartons personnel costs and facility costs such as rent depreciation and utilities related to the production and distribution of the

included as product research and development expenses are typically related to salaries and benefits professional fees and supplies in    and   the company incurred software development expenses related to its expansion into the plated truss market and some of the software development costs were capitalized see note  — property plant and equipment the company amortizes acquired patents over their remaining lives and performs periodic reviews for impairment the cost of internally developed patents is expensed as incurred   selling costs   selling costs include expenses associated with selling merchandising and marketing the company’s products major components of these expenses are personnel sales commissions facility costs such as rent depreciation and utilities professional services information technology costs sales promotion advertising literature and trade shows   advertising costs   advertising costs are included in selling expenses are expensed when the advertising occurs and were  million   million and  million in     and   respectively   general and administrative costs   general and administrative costs include personnel information technology related costs facility costs such as rent depreciation and utilities professional services amortization of intangibles and bad debt charges   income taxes   income taxes are calculated using an asset and liability approach the provision for income taxes includes federal state and foreign taxes currently payable and deferred taxes due to temporary differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities in addition future tax benefits are recognized to the extent that realization of such benefits is more likely than not   sales taxes   the company presents taxes collected and remitted to governmental authorities on a net basis in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations   foreign currency translation   the local currency is the functional currency of most of the company’s operations in europe canada asia australia new zealand and south africa assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange rate on the balance sheet date revenues and expenses are translated using average exchange rates prevailing during the year the translation adjustment resulting from this process is shown separately as a component of stockholders’ equity foreign currency transaction gains or losses are included in general and administrative expenses    sales office closing the company substantially completed the liquidation of its

sp germany sp france and sp nordic collectively the sp components” the company aggregates the sp components into a single reporting unit because management concluded that they are economically similar and that the goodwill is recoverable from the sp components working in concert the sp components are economically similar because of a number of factors including sharing assets and services such as intellectual property manufacturing assets for certain products research and development projects manufacturing processes management of inventory excesses and shortages and administrative services these activities are managed centrally at the sp components level and costs are allocated among the sp components   for certain reporting units the company may first assess qualitative factors related to the goodwill of the reporting unit to determine whether it is necessary to perform a twostep impairment test if the company judges that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is greater than the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill no further testing is required if the company judges that it is more likely than not that the fair value of the reporting unit is less than the carrying amount of the reporting unit including goodwill management will perform a twostep impairment test on goodwill in the first step step  the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying value the fair value calculation uses the income approach discounted cash flow method and the market approach equally weighted if the company judges that the carrying value of the net assets assigned to the reporting unit including goodwill exceeds the fair value of the reporting unit a second step of the impairment test must be performed to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit’s goodwill if the company judges that the carrying value of a reporting unit’s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value the company would record an impairment charge equal to the difference between the implied fair value of the goodwill and the carrying value   determining the fair value of a reporting unit or an indefinitelived purchased intangible asset is a judgment involving significant estimates and assumptions these estimates and assumptions include revenue growth rates operating margins and working capital requirements used to calculate projected future cash flows riskadjusted discount rates selected multiples control premiums and future economic and market conditions level  fair value inputs the company bases its fair value estimates on assumptions that it believes to be reasonable but that are unpredictable and inherently uncertain actual future results may differ from those estimates    assumptions about a reporting unit’s operating performance in the first year of the discounted cash flow model used to determine whether or not the goodwill related to that reporting unit is impaired are derived from the company’s budget the fair value model considers such factors as macroeconomic conditions revenue and expense forecasts product line changes material labor and overhead costs tax rates working capital levels and competitive environment future estimates however derived are inherently uncertain but the company believes that this is the most appropriate source on which to base its fair value calculation   the company uses these parameters only to provide a basis for the determination of whether or not the goodwill related to a reporting unit is impaired no inference whatsoever should be drawn from these parameters about the company’s future financial performance and they should not be taken as projections or guidance of any kind   the    and  annual testing of goodwill for impairment did not result in impairment charges the impairment charge taken in the third quarter of  was associated with assets in the germany reporting unit acquired from bierbach in  the factors that led to the third quarter impairment were a failure to retain bierbachs historical customers and increased competition which led to the reduction in the contingent consideration liability related to the bierbach acquisition and resulted in management performing an impairment test to evaluate the recoverability of the germany reporting units goodwill the test resulted in the impairment of all of the reporting unit’s goodwill in the amount of  million  in connection with the impairment of the goodwill the company also reviewed associated longlived assets in germany such as property and equipment and intangible assets for recoverability by comparing the projected undiscounted net cash flows associated with those assets to their carrying values no impairment of longlived assets was required as

an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern exists under asu  the emergence of substantial doubt about a company’s ability to continue as a going concern is the trigger for providing footnote disclosure therefore for each annual and interim reporting period management should evaluate whether there are conditions that give rise to substantial doubt within one year from the financial

 core requirement is to recognize the assets and liabilities that arise from leases including those leases classified as operating leases the amendments require a lessee to recognize in the statement of financial position a liability to make lease payments the lease liability and a rightofuse asset representing its right to use the underlying asset for the lease term for leases with a term of  months or less a lessee is permitted to make an accounting policy election by class of underlying asset not to recognize lease assets and lease liabilities if a lessee makes this election it should recognize lease expense for such leases generally on a straightline basis over the lease term the lessor accounting application is largely unchanged from that applied previously under gaap in transition lessees and lessors are required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the earliest period presented using a modified retrospective approach the amendments in this asu are

hawaii first circuit granted the company’s motions to dismiss and for summary judgment resulting in the dismissal of all of the plaintiff homeowners’ claims against the company and the company is not currently a party to the proceedings the dismissed claims against the company remain subject to potential appeal by the plaintiffs further gentry may in the future seek to sue the company for indemnity or contribution if gentry is ultimately found liable for any loss suffered by the plaintiff homeowners the company initially understood from gentry there were no significant damages claims related to ewa by gentry development in may  the plaintiff homeowners filed a second amended complaint to name a new representative plaintiff because the original representative plaintiffs had not suffered damage in august  gentry advised the company for the first time that other plaintiff homeowners had documented serious corrosion of mudsill anchors and straptie holdowns in a substantial number of homes the plaintiff homeowners and gentry are currently proceeding in arbitration and the hawaii state court lawsuit has been stayed pending the conclusion of arbitration gentry has not asserted any third party claim against the company but has reserved the right to seek to do so in the nishimura case and in the arbitration the plaintiff homeowners seek damages according to proof at

make straptie holdowns that suffer from such corrosion but does not identify the company’s products specifically the company is not currently a party to the vitale lawsuit but the lawsuit in the future could potentially involve the company’s straptie holdowns given the preliminary nature and the complexities involved in the nishimura and vitale proceedings the company is unable to estimate

is not feasible to predict the outcome of proceedings to which the company is not currently a party or reasonably estimate a possible loss or range of possible loss for the company related to such

the company’s disclosure controls and procedures or the company’s internal control over financial reporting will necessarily prevent all fraud and material errors internal control over financial reporting no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met in addition the design of a control system must reflect the facts that there are resource constraints and that the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs the inherent limitations in internal control over financial reporting include the realities that judgments can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of simple error or mistake controls also can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management override of controls the design of any system of internal control is also based in part on assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be only reasonable not absolute assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential events and conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of
