founder of reserveage organics a boca raton floria based manufacturer of nutritional supplements credit courtesy company this is the story of entrepreneur naomi whittel as told to incs liz welch my executive assistant was the first to suggest that i go on qvc i brushed it off but a very good friend of mine in the skin care world introduced me to the buyers there and after a threehour meeting i realized i was wrong the network said it would put me on the air only after a rigorous scientific and legal process i was impressed but my staff was not my sales team thought i was turning my back on

directly to the qvc customer as well as the whole foods customer who was flipping channels and maybe even the ceo of gnc in the end my decision was based on pure instinct my debut was in september  i was selling our antiaging resveratrol supplements i was very nervous and very overwhelmed qvc has an inhouse talent trainershe told me to talk to the camera as if it were my sister or best friend the

experts she sought to provide best inclass nutritional supplements that are backed by gold standard science every one of our products takes its inspiration from clinically researched ingredients and the world’s healthiest cultures my quest of curiosity a wanderlust if you will began when i was a very young girl growing up in a family of chemists and scientists who immersed themselves in a biodynamic organic lifestyle long before it was a trend we always turned to pure whole ingredients taken from the earth for solutions this has become my lifelong passion and purpose and is why i founded reserveage™ nutrition i welcome you to join me in my journey to wellness read more » our founder naomi whittel was having dinner with her cousin dr eric lafforgue when their conversation turned to the french paradox why do the french who enjoy a rich diet filled with cheese pastries and great wine also enjoy good health the answer may be their daily consumption of red wine which contains resveratrol a powerful antioxidant that has been shown in studies to help support the “longevity gene” at that moment the cousins decided to harness the antioxidant power of resveratrol and

entertainment examiner nicolette mallow to talk entrepreneurship and becoming a ceo at the age of  whittel also shared some helpful tips and insights related to wellness the interview was held within the press room at prevention magazines third annual r summit held at acl live at the moody theater in austin texas nicolette mallow on stage you spoke of age and numbers you emphasized that a number doesnt define us no matter how young or advanced in age listening to you talk about starting a company that went global and being the ceo at  years old is so inspiring to all female or male entrepreneurs however i also recall during the presentation you mentioned that sometimes in the past you hid the fact you were the ceo because you felt your age might cause others to not take you seriously how did you overcome the fear of being the youngest its important for us all to learn from our elders or those with the experience of time that exceeds our own but i have often felt the same way as an artistic professional when im the youngest and often the only female in a group where everyone else is older it can be hard to be taken seriously and it can feel discouraging how did you break free of all that and succeed naomi whittel being a young entrepreneur can be difficult in hindsight i wish that i hadnt always kept it a secret that i was the ceo but its a learning process for everyone starting out first off in order to succeed you have to be willing to fail and to be bold to take risks failure is a huge part of success but so long as you hold fast to your purpose and sustain boldness in all you do in due time your visions and dreams will transpire its also imperative to have a voice and to be honest with yourself to know your strengths and weaknesses not long ago i was in a meeting with other entrepreneurs and we were discussing investments we needed to raise money for something that day and it seemed daunting to the others at first no one was willing to invest but i saw no reason to not make a move and act i was the first one and the youngest to offer up a check to invest once i made the first move the others were interested in the investment and we raised the money that day boldness goes a long way once you harness your internal power and know how to use it in a healthy way once you find a vision and hold onto it falling into success becomes natural nm speaking of healthy in regards to nutrition and wellness it can be daunting for those just starting out with a mission to achieve a better diet or a healthier lifestyle there are thousands of books recipes and products out there for people to try where to begin what is your advice for anyone wanting to change their lifestyle and nutritional diet but they dont know where to start nw yes there is a lot of information there i would advise the first step to be the elimination of processed foods processed foods do not carry natural nutrients or often any nutrients and therefore the body is not getting anything vital or healthy from these processed foods processed foods can do more harm than good solely because processed foods often carry a lot of chemicals and damaging artificial substances within them too people arent always aware that what they are eating isnt actually food at all i was fortunate to grow up in a home of science and chemistry with parents focused on a biodynamic organic lifestyle however i want everyone to join me on the journey to wellness no matter how or when their journey begins nm my last question is for those of us who sustain an overall healthy diet exercise drink plenty of fluids take nutritional supplements and hydrate our skin hair and nails for those of us who feel we are nearly doing it all what is something else that we can do to improve our diet and overall wellness nw intermittent fasting is something even the pros can forget to do fasting periodically from  pm to noon has amazing benefits on the body intermittent fasting has proven to control blood sugar and insulin it can promote weight loss and reduce cholesterol levels intermittent fasting can even assist with cellular repair or inflammation in the body reducing
