capital researchsummarystock is trading with volatility following q earningsa discussion of the key metricsa quiet strength to the quartercys investments nysecys has just reported earnings and the stock is experiencing some volatility following what i believed to be a decent but not great quarter from this mreit that i have been covering for years since the results were a bit mixed the reaction is mixed given this reaction i feel it is prudent examine the results to understand what is going on here lets dive right into the earnings and key metrics we look for in mreits let me first say that the company surpassed earnings expectations that i had for the quarter i was looking for  per share in core plus drop income and net interest income of  to  million we saw net interest income come in at  million which was actually down  million versus the  million in net interest income in q  while the beat versus expectations on this number is decent the drop was expected given the fed rate hike two months ago causing costs of funds to rise what we care about of course is not net income per se but core income this is because its a better measure of the ability to cover the dividend remember the dividend has been cut several times and failure to cover the dividend was one of the reasons i turned sour on the name as you know the bestofbreed names have been outearning their dividends in many cases consistently core earnings plus drop income came in at  million or  per share which was down a penny per share from last quarter but beat my expectations of  it is however important to note that we see that this was made up of core earnings of  million or  per share thus drop income was  million or  per share the key point is that the dividend was covered here several key metrics played a big role in these earnings figures first total interest income increased to  million total interest income has been on the decline for two years plus but this was the second quarter in a row of improvement here on this metric prepayments were a strong reason for this decline so it is a positive to see the trend reverse the reason for this is because prepayments are out of control for so many mreits even if the situation has improved just look at  for cys back in q the constant prepayment rate jumped to  up from  in q  in q and up significantly from the  in q for q  we saw the prepayment rate drop dramatically to  and here in q prepayments dropped to  helping deliver a winning quarter the average cost of funds has been on the rise in the sector and here in q it rose rather dramatically by  basis points for cys it came in at  versus  in q a result due in large part to the fed rate hike average yields were up helping offset this rising cost of funds coming in at  doing the math you can see that this higher yield on investments was not enough to outpace the increase in cost of funds which means the spread was pressured the spread net of hedge including drop income was  for q  down  basis points compared to  in q  with the motion in rates at the end of the quarter there were certainly adjustments made that will impact q as well i will also say plainly that this was overall a positive quarter for cys but it was not fantastic this explains the mixed buying and selling on the street and the volatility the stock is experiencing with this rise in share prices the stock has moved up significantly still the street has assigned a premium valuation to the name as it is still trading at a premiumtobook value net of the  dividend book value came in at  this was a quiet strength in the quarter as book value rose from  last quarter of course book value is still down incredibly over the last few years all that said the name has seen improvement but with a premiumtobook and prior quarters with failed dividend coverage i would not be a buyer here quad  capital has been a leading contributor with seeking alpha since early  if you like the material and
