october   and  under the monthly distribution plan estimated longterm return to unit holders under the semi annual distribution plan was  per annum on october   and  under the monthly distribution plan estimated current return is calculated by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which take into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of all of the bonds in the trust and  takes into account a compounding factor and the expenses and sales charge associated with each unit of the trust since the market values and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of the trust will change there is no assurance that the present estimated current return and estimated longterm return indicated above will be realized in the future estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of the estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while the estimated current return calculations include only net annual interest income and public offering price the above figures are based on estimated per unit cash flows

amounts required for such purchases the bonds the trustee thereafter credited the account of the sponsor for units of each trust representing the entire ownership of the fund which units are being

issued by or on behalf of the state for which such trust is named collectively the state trusts and counties municipalities authorities and political subdivisions thereof the commonwealth of puerto rico and other territories or municipalities of the united states or authorities or political subdivisions thereof the interest on which obligations is in the opinion of recognized bond counsel to the

maine mississippi and nebraska trusts will be a preference item for purposes of the alternative minimum tax and certain bonds in the oklahoma trusts are subject to oklahoma state income taxes the current market value of certain of the obligations in a discount trust were significantly below face value when the obligations were acquired by such trust the prices at which the obligations are

with the name designation of the first trust advantage the advantage trusts the portfolio insurance obtained by the insured trusts is effective only while the bonds thus insured are held in such trusts while insurance on preinsured bonds is effective so long as such bonds are outstanding see why and how are the insured trusts insured there is of course no guarantee that the funds objectives will be achieved an investment in the fund should be made with an understanding of the risks which an investment in fixed rate longterm debt obligations may entail including the risk that the value of the units will decline with increases in interest rates neither the public offering price of the units of an insured trust nor any evaluation of such units for purposes of repurchases or redemptions reflects any element of value for the insurance obtained by such trust unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default see public offeringhow is the public offering price determined on the other hand the value of insurance page  obtained by the bond issuer the sponsor or others is reflected and included in the market value of such bonds insurance obtained by an insured trust or by the bond issuer the sponsor or others is not a substitute for the basic credit of an issuer but supplements the existing credit and provides additional security therefor if an issue is accepted for insurance a noncancelable policy for the scheduled payment of interest and principal on the bonds is issued by the insurer a single premium is paid by the bond issuer the underwriters the sponsor or others for preinsured bonds and a monthly premium is paid by each insured trust for the insurance obtained by such trust except for bonds in such trust which are insured by the bond issuer the underwriters the sponsor or others in which case no premiums for insurance are paid by such trust upon the sale of a bond insured under the insurance policy obtained by an insured trust the trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance from financial guaranty andor ambac indemnity with respect to such bond upon the payment of a single predetermined insurance premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond accordingly any bond in an insured trust of the fund is eligible to be sold on an insured basis standard  poors and moodys investors service inc have rated the claimspaying ability of financial guaranty and ambac indemnity aaa and aaa respectively see why and how are the insured trusts insured in selecting bonds the following facts among others were considered i the standard  poors rating or fitch investors service incs rating of the bonds was in no case less than bbb in the case of an insured trust or an arkansas kansas or maine advantage trust and a in the case of other advantage trusts or the moodys investors service inc rating of the bonds was in no case less than baa in the case of an insured trust or an arkansas kansas or maine advantage trust and a in the case of other advantage trusts including provisional or conditional ratings respectively or if not rated the bonds had in the opinion of the sponsor credit characteristics sufficiently similar to the credit characteristics of interestbearing taxexempt obligations that were so rated as to be acceptable for acquisition by the fund see description of bond ratings ii the prices of the bonds relative to other bonds of comparable quality and maturity iii with respect to the insured trusts the availability and cost of insurance of the principal and interest on the bonds and iv the diversification of bonds as to purpose of issue and location of issuer subsequent to the initial date of deposit a bond may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required as of the initial date of deposit neither event requires elimination of such bond from the portfolio but may be considered in the sponsors determination as to whether or not to direct the trustee to dispose of the bond see rights of unit holders how may bonds be removed from the fund the portfolio appearing in part one contains bond ratings when available for the bonds listed at the date shown certain of the bonds in the trusts may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the trust were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type the market discount of previously issued bonds will increase when interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase and decrease when such interest rates fall other things being equal a discount bond held to maturity will have a larger portion of its total return in the form of taxable income and capital gain and less in the form of taxexempt interest income than a comparable bond newly issued at current market rates see what is the federal tax status of unit holders appearing in part three for each trust certain of the bonds in the trusts may be original issue discount bonds under current law the original issue discount which is the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue price of the bonds is deemed to accrue on a daily basis and the accrued portion is treated as taxexempt interest income for federal income tax purposes on sale or redemption any gain realized that is in excess of the earned portion of original issue discount will be taxable as capital gain unless the gain is attributable to market discount in which case the accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income see what is the federal tax status of unit holders appearing in part three for each trust the current value of an original discount bond reflects the present value of its stated redemption price at maturity the market value tends to increase in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity certain of the original issue discount bonds may be zero coupon bonds including bonds known as multiplier bonds money multiplier bonds page  capital appreciation bonds capital accumulator bonds compound interest bonds and money discount maturity payment bonds zero coupon bonds do not provide for the payment of any current interest and generally provide for payment at maturity at face value unless sooner sold or redeemed zero coupon bond features include  not paying interest on a semiannual basis and  providing for the reinvestment of the bonds semiannual earnings at the bonds stated yield to maturity while zero coupon bonds are frequently marketed on the basis that their fixed rate of return minimizes reinvestment risk this benefit can be negated in large part by weak call protection certain of the bonds in the trusts may have been acquired at a market premium from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the premium bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the trusts were higher than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type the current returns of bonds trading at a market premium are initially higher than the current returns of comparable bonds of a similar type issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes payable because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at maturity but through current income payments early redemption of a premium bond at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a reduction in yield redemptions are more likely to occur at times when the bonds have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original issue discount bonds a premium over the accreted value to the extent that the bonds were deposited in the fund at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed this will represent a loss of capital when compared to the original public offering price of the units because premium bonds generally pay a higher rate of interest than bonds priced at or below par the effect of the redemption of premium bonds would be to reduce estimated net annual unit income by a greater percentage than the par amount of such bonds bears to the total par amount of bonds in the trust although the actual impact of any such redemptions that may occur will depend upon the specific bonds that are redeemed it can be anticipated that the estimated net annual unit income will be significantly reduced after the dates on which such bonds are eligible for redemption the trust may be required to sell zero coupon bonds prior to maturity at their current market price which is likely to be less than their par value in order to pay expenses of the trust or in case the trust is terminated see rights of unit holdershow may bonds be removed from the fund and other informationhow may the indenture be amended or terminated certain of the bonds in the trusts may be general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity all other bonds in the trusts are revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are secured by the issuers pledge of its faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds on the other hand are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific revenue source there are of course variations in the security of the different bonds in the fund both within a particular classification and between classifications depending on numerous factors certain of the bonds in the trusts may be healthcare revenue bonds healthcare revenue bonds are obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from services provided by hospitals or other healthcare facilities including nursing homes a healthcare issuers ability to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent on various factors including occupancy levels of the facility demand government regulations wages of employees overhead expenses competition from other similar providers malpractice insurance costs and the degree of governmental competition from other similar providers malpractice insurance costs and the degree of governmental financial assistance including medicare and medicaid and other similar third party payer programs certain of the bonds in the trusts may be housing revenue bonds housing revenue bonds are obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from mortgage loans on single family residences or housing projects for low to moderate income families housing revenue bonds are generally payable at any time and therefore their average life will ordinarily be less than their stated maturities the ability of such issuers to make debt service payments on these obligations is dependent on various factors including occupancy levels rental income mortgage default rates taxes operating expenses governmental regulations and the appropriation of subsidies page  certain of the bonds in the trusts may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water andor sewerage services water and sewerage bonds are generally payable from user fees problems faced by such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs and the impact of nogrowth zoning ordinances certain of the bonds in the trusts may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from the sale of electric energy utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility commissions which among other things establish the rates which may be charged and the appropriate rate of return the problems faced by such issuers include the difficulty in obtaining approval for timely and adequate rate increases from the governing public utility commission the difficulty in financing large construction programs increased federal state and municipal government regulations the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations increased competition recent reductions in estimates of future demand for electricity in certain areas of the country the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation certain of the bonds in the trusts may be lease obligations issued primarily by governmental authorities that have no taxing power or other means of directly raising revenues rather the governmental authorities are financing vehicles created solely for the construction of buildings ie schools administrative offices convention centers and prisons or the purchase of equipment ie police cars and computer systems that will be used by a state or local government the lessee these obligations are subject to the ability and willingness of the lessee government to meet its lease rental payments which include debt service on the obligations lease obligations are subject in almost all cases to annual appropriation risk ie the lessee government is not legally obligated to budget and appropriate for the rental payments beyond the current fiscal year or construction and abatement riskrental obligations cease in the event that delays in building damage destruction or condemnation of the project prevents its use by the lessee certain of the bonds in the trusts may be industrial revenue bonds irbs taxexempt securities issued by states municipalities public authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring constructing or improving various industrial projects debt service payments on irbs are dependent on various factors including the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project and if applicable corporate guarantor revenues generated from the project and if applicable corporate guarantor revenues generated from the project and regulatory and environmental restrictions certain of the bonds in the trusts may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports bridges turnpikes port authorities convention centers and arenas the ability of issuers to make debt service payments on airport obligations is dependent on the capability of airlines to meet their obligations under use agreements due to increased competition deregulation increased fuel costs and other factors many airlines may have difficulty meeting their obligations under these use agreements similarly payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects such as user fees from ports tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings therefore payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance decreased use of a facility lower cost of alternative modes of transportation scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents certain of the bonds in the trusts may be obligations of issuers which govern the operation of schools colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes general problems relating to college and university obligations would include the prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and new government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers certain of the bonds in the trusts may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities resource recovery facilities are designed to page  process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity resource recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain circumstances including but not limited to destruction or condemnation of a project contracts relating to a project becoming void unenforceable or impossible to perform changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of a project administrative or judicial actions which render contracts relating to the projects void unenforceable or impossible to perform or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities certain trusts may contain bonds of issuers located in the commonwealth of puerto rico or issuers which will be affected by general economic conditions of puerto rico puerto ricos unemployment rate remains significantly higher than the us unemployment rate furthermore the economy is largely dependent for its development upon us policies and programs that are being reviewed and may be eliminated the economy of puerto rico is closely integrated with that of the mainland united states during fiscal  approximately  of puerto ricos exports were to the us mainland which was also the source of approximately  of puerto ricos imports the economy of puerto rico is dominated by the manufacturing and service sectors the manufacturing sector has experienced fundamental changes over the years as a result of increased emphasis on higher wage high technology industries such as pharmaceuticals electronics computers microprocessors professional and scientific instruments and certain high technology machinery and equipment the service sector including finance insurance and real estate also plays a major role in the economy it ranks second only to manufacturing in contribution to the gross domestic product and leads all sectors in providing employment in recent years the service sector has experienced significant growth in response to the expansion of the manufacturing sector the puerto rican economy is affected by a number of commonwealth and federal investment incentive programs aid for puerto ricos economy has traditionally depended heavily on federal programs and current federal budgetary policies suggest that an expansion of aid to puerto rico is unlikely an adverse effect on the puerto rican economy could result from other us policies including further reduction in transfer payment programs such as food stamps curtailment of military spending and policies which could lead to a stronger dollar one of the factors assisting the development of the puerto rican economy has been the tax incentives offered by the federal and puerto rico governments puerto ricos future will be determined by the leadership and initiatives of both the private and public sector to compensate for the loss of the federal tax credit under section  of the us tax code this important credit which enabled companies to repatriate profits at a  reduction in federal taxes was terminated as of july  existing us companies operating in puerto rico were given a ten year grace period but new us manufacturing companies coming to puerto rico will have to pay us deferral taxes when repatriating their profits to the mainland the foregoing information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the financial difficulties which may impact certain issuers of bonds and does not purport to be a complete or exhaustive description of all adverse conditions to which the issuers of the bonds are subject additionally many factors including national economic social and environmental policies and conditions which are not within the control of the issuers of bonds could affect or could have an adverse impact on the financial condition of puerto rico and various agencies and political subdivisions located in puerto rico the sponsor is unable to predict whether or to what extent such factors or other factors may affect the issuers of bonds the market value or marketability of the bonds or the ability of the respective issuers of the bonds acquired by the trusts to pay interest on or principal of the bonds interest on certain of the bonds in certain arkansas idaho kansas maine mississippi and nebraska trusts will be an item of tax preference for purposes of the alternative minimum tax amt the investment by nonamt individual taxpayers in amt municipal bonds generally results in a higher yield to such bondholders than nonamt municipal bonds since a portion of the interest from certain arkansas idaho kansas maine mississippi and nebraska trusts is an amt preference item certain arkansas idaho kansas maine mississippi and nebraska trusts may be more appropriate for investors who are not subject to amt investors should be aware that many of the bonds in the trusts are subject to continuing requirements such as the actual use of bond page  proceeds or manner of operation of the project financed from bond proceeds that may affect the exemption of interest on such bonds from federal income taxation although at the time of issuance of each of the bonds in the trusts an opinion of bond counsel was rendered as to the exemption of interest on such obligations from federal income taxation there can be no assurance that the respective issuers or other obligors on such obligations will fulfill the various continuing requirements established upon issuance of the bonds a failure to comply with such requirements may cause a determination that interest on such obligations is subject to federal income taxation perhaps even retroactively from the date of issuance of such bonds thereby reducing the value of the bonds and subjecting unit holders to unanticipated tax liabilities because certain of the bonds may from time to time under certain circumstances be sold or redeemed or will mature in accordance with their terms and because the proceeds from such events will be distributed to unit holders and will not be reinvested no assurance can be given that a trust will retain for any length of time its present size and composition neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any bond certain of the bonds contained in the trusts may be subject to being called or redeemed in whole or in part prior to their stated maturities pursuant to optional redemption provisions sinking fund provisions special or extraordinary redemption provisions or otherwise a bond subject to optional call is one which is subject to redemption or refunding prior to maturity at the option of the issuer a bond subject to sinking fund redemption is one which is subject to partial call from time to time at par or in the case of a zero coupon bond at the accreted value from a fund accumulated for the scheduled retirement of a portion of an issue prior to maturity special or extraordinary redemption provisions may provide for redemption at par or for original issue discount bonds at issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to redemption date plus if applicable some premium of all or a portion of an issue upon the occurrence of certain circumstances the exercise of redemption or call provisions will except to the extent the proceeds of the called bonds are used to pay for unit redemptions result in the distribution of principal and may result in a reduction in the amount of subsequent interest distributions it may also affect the longterm return and the current return on units of each trust redemption pursuant to call provisions is more likely to occur and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur when the bonds have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original issue discount bonds a premium over the accreted value unit holders may recognize capital gain or loss upon any redemption or call like other investment companies financial and business organizations and individuals around the world the fund could be adversely affected if the computer systems used by the sponsor evaluator portfolio supervisor or trustee or other service providers to the fund do not properly process and calculate daterelated information and data involving dates of january   and thereafter this is commonly known as the year  problem the sponsor evaluator portfolio supervisor and trustee are taking steps that they believe are reasonably designed to address the year  problem with respect to computer systems that they use and to obtain reasonable assurances that comparable steps are being taken by the funds other service providers at this time however there can be no assurance that these steps will be sufficient to avoid any adverse impact to the fund the sponsor is unable to predict what impact if any the year  problem will have on issuers of the bonds contained in the fund to the best knowledge of the sponsor there is no litigation pending as of the date hereof in respect of any bonds which might reasonably be expected to have a material adverse effect upon the trusts at any time after the date hereof litigation may be initiated on a variety of grounds with respect to bonds in a trust such litigation as for example suits challenging the issuance of pollution control revenue bonds under recentlyenacted environmental protection statutes may affect the validity of such bonds or the taxfree nature of the interest thereon while the outcome of litigation of such nature can never be entirely predicted the fund has received opinions of bond counsel to the issuing authority of each bond on the date of issuance to the effect that such bonds have been validly issued and that the interest thereon is exempt from federal income taxes and state and local taxes in addition other factors may arise from time to time which potentially may impair the ability of issuers to meet obligations undertaken with respect to the bonds page  what are estimated longterm return and estimated current return at the date of this prospectus the estimated current return and the estimated longterm return under the monthly quarterly if applicable and semiannual if applicable distribution plans are as set forth in part one attached hereto for each trust estimated current return is computed by dividing the estimated net annual interest income per unit by the public offering price any change in either amount will result in a change in the estimated current return for each trust the public offering price will vary in accordance with fluctuations in the prices of the underlying bonds and the net annual interest income per unit will change as bonds are redeemed paid sold or exchanged in certain refundings or as the expenses of each trust change therefore there is no assurance that the estimated current return indicated in part one for each trust will be realized in the future estimated longterm return is calculated using a formula which  takes into consideration and determines and factors in the relative weightings of the market values yields which take into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of all of the bonds in the trust and  takes into account a compounding factor the expenses and sales charge associated with each unit of a trust since the market values and estimated retirements of the bonds and the expenses of the trust will change there is no assurance that the estimated longterm return indicated in part one for each trust will be realized in the future estimated current return and estimated longterm return are expected to differ because the calculation of estimated longterm return reflects the estimated date and amount of principal returned while estimated current return calculations include only net annual interest income and public offering price neither rate reflects the true return to unit holders which is lower because neither includes the effect of certain delays in distributions to unit holders a comparison of taxfree and equivalent taxable estimated current returns and estimated longterm returns with the returns on various taxable investments is one element to consider in making an investment decision the sponsor may from time to time in its advertising and sales materials compare the then current estimated returns on the trust and returns over specified periods on other similar trusts sponsored by nike securities lp with returns on taxable investments such as corporate or us government bonds bank cds and money market accounts or money market funds each of which has investment characteristics that may differ from those of the trust how are purchased interest and accrued interest treated purchased interest for the first trust combined series  each trust contains an amount of purchased interest purchased interest is a portion of the unpaid interest that has accrued on the bonds from the later of the last payment date on the bonds or the date of issuance thereof through the first settlement date and is included in the calculation of the public offering price purchased interest will be distributed to unit holders as units are redeemed or securities are sold mature or are called see summary of essential information appearing in part one for each trust for the amount of purchased interest per unit for each trust purchased interest is an element of the determination of the price unit holders will receive in connection with the sale or redemption of units prior to the termination of the trust accrued interest accrued interest is the accumulation of unpaid interest on a bond from the last day on which interest thereon was paid interest on bonds generally is paid semiannually although each trust accrues such interest daily because of this a trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected by the trustee for this reason with respect to sales settling subsequent to the first settlement date the public offering price of units will have added to it the proportionate share of accrued interest to the date of settlement unit holders will receive on the next distribution date of the trust the amount if any of accrued interest paid on their units for the first trust combined series  except through an advancement of its own funds the trustee has no cash for distribution to unit holders until it receives interest payments on the bonds in a trust the trustee will recover its advancements without interest or other costs to such trust from interest received on the bonds in the trust when these advancements have been recovered regular distributions of interest to unit holders will commence see rights of unit holdershow are interest and principal distributed interest account balances are established with generally positive cash balances so that it will not be necessary on a regular basis for the trustee to advance its own funds in connection with interest distributions page  for the first trust combined series  in an effort to reduce the amount of purchased interest which would otherwise have to be paid by unit holders the trustee may advance a portion of the accrued interest to the sponsor as the unit holder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the amount of accrued interest to be added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement other than the purchased interest already included therein less any distributions from the interest account subsequent to the first settlement date see rights of unit holdershow are interest and principal distributed for the first trust combined series  and subsequent series in an effort to reduce the amount of accrued interest which would otherwise have to be paid in addition to the public offering price in the sale of units to the public the trustee will advance the amount of accrued interest as of the first settlement date and the same will be distributed to the sponsor as the unit holder of record as of the first settlement date consequently the amount of accrued interest to be added to the public offering price of units will include only accrued interest from the first settlement date to the date of settlement less any distributions from the interest account subsequent to the first settlement date see rights of unit holdershow are interest and principal distributed because of the varying interest payment dates of the bonds accrued interest at any point in time will be greater than the amount of interest actually received by a trust and distributed to unit holders if a unit holder sells or redeems all or a portion of his units he will be entitled to receive his proportionate share of the purchased interest if any and accrued interest from the purchaser of his units since the trustee has the use of the funds including purchased interest if any held in the interest account for distributions to unit holders and since such account is noninterestbearing to unit holders the trustee benefits thereby why and how are the insured trusts insured the following discussion is applicable only to the insured trusts the bonds in the portfolio of an advantage trust are not insured by

financial guaranty andor ambac indemnity has applied its own standards which are not necessarily the same as the criteria used in regard to the selection of bonds by the sponsor this decision is made prior to the initial date of deposit as bonds not covered by such insurance are not deposited in an insured trust unless such bonds are preinsured bonds the insurance obtained by page  an insured trust covers bonds deposited in such trust and physically delivered to the trustee in the case of bearer bonds or registered in the name of the trustee or its nominee or delivered along with an

an insured trust the trustee has the right to obtain permanent insurance upon the payment of an insurance premium from the proceeds of the sale of such bond except as indicated below insurance obtained by an insured trust has no effect on the price or redemption value of units it is the present intention of the evaluator to attribute a value to such insurance obtained by an insured trust including the right to obtain permanent insurance for the purpose of computing the price or redemption value of units only if the bonds covered by such insurance are in default in payment of principal or interest or in the sponsors opinion in significant risk of such default the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of a bond which is in default in payment of principal or interest or in significant risk of such default assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premium attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of such bonds not covered by permanent insurance see public offeringhow is the public offering price determined herein for a more complete description of

see description of bond ratings the obtaining of this rating by each insured trust should not be construed as an approval of the offering of the units by standard  poors or as a guarantee of the

to which expenses of each trust or sales by each trust of bonds for less than the purchase price paid by such trust will reduce payment to unit holders of the interest and principal required to be paid on such bonds such rating will be in effect for a period of thirteen months from the initial date of deposit of an insured trust and will unless renewed terminate at the end of such period there is no guarantee that the aaa investment rating with respect to the units of an insured trust will be maintained an objective of portfolio insurance obtained by such insured trust is to obtain a higher yield on the bonds in the portfolio of such trust than page  would be available if all the bonds in such portfolio had the standard  poors aaa andor moodys investors service inc aaa ratings and at the same time to have the protection of insurance of scheduled payment of interest and principal on the bonds there is of course no certainty that this result will be achieved bonds in a trust for which insurance has been obtained by the bond issuer the underwriters the sponsor or others all of which were rated aaa by standard  poors andor aaa by moodys investors service inc may or may not have a higher yield than uninsured bonds rated aaa by standard  poors or aaa by moodys investors service inc in selecting bonds for the portfolio of each insured trust the sponsor has applied the criteria herein before described what is the federal tax status of unit holders see part three for each trust for information with respect to exemption from state or other local taxes see part three for each trust what are the expenses and charges with the exception of bookkeeping and other administrative services provided to the trusts for which the sponsor will be reimbursed in amounts as set forth under special trust information in each part one of this prospectus the sponsor will not receive any fee in connection with its activities relating to the trusts for series  and all subsequent series first trust advisors lp an affiliate of the sponsor will receive an annual supervisory fee which is not to exceed the amount set forth in part one for each trust for providing portfolio supervisory services for the trust such fee is based on the number of units outstanding in each trust on january  of each year except for trusts which were established subsequent to the last january  in which case the fee will be based on the number of units outstanding in such trusts as of the respective initial dates of deposit for each valuation of the bonds in a trust the evaluator will receive a fee as indicated in part one of this prospectus the trustee pays certain expenses of each trust for which it is reimbursed by such trust the trustee will receive for its ordinary recurring services to a trust an annual fee computed as indicated in part one of this prospectus for a discussion of the services performed by the trustee pursuant to its obligations under the indenture reference is made to the material set forth under rights of unit holders the trustees and evaluators fees are payable monthly on or before each distribution date from the interest account of each trust to the extent funds are available and then from the principal account of such trust since the trustee has the use of the funds being held in the principal and interest accounts for future distributions payment of expenses and redemptions and since such accounts are noninterestbearing to unit holders the trustee benefits thereby part of the trustees compensation for its services to the fund is expected to result from the use of these funds however the trustee may bear from its own resources certain expenses relating to a trust each of the above mentioned fees may be increased without approval of the unit holders by amounts not exceeding proportionate increases under the category all services less rent of shelter in the consumer price index published by the united states department of labor in addition with respect to the fees payable to the sponsor or an affiliate of the sponsor for providing bookkeeping and other administrative services and supervisory services such individual fees may exceed the actual costs of providing such services for a trust but at no time will the total amount received for such services rendered to all unit investment trusts of which nike securities lp is the sponsor in any calendar year exceed the actual cost to the sponsor or its affiliate of supplying such services in such year the annualized cost of the portfolio insurance obtained by the fund for each insured trust is indicated in part one for each trust in a series of the fund the portfolio insurance continues so long as such trust retains the bonds thus insured premiums are payable monthly in advance by the trustee on behalf of such trust as bonds in the portfolio are redeemed by their respective issuers or are sold by the trustee the amount of premium will be reduced in respect of those bonds no longer owned by and held in the trust which were insured by insurance obtained by such trust preinsured bonds for which insurance has been obtained page  from financial guaranty andor ambac indemnity or beginning with series  and all subsequent series other insurers are not insured by such trust the premium payable for permanent insurance will be paid solely from the proceeds of the sale of such bond in the event the trustee exercises the right to obtain permanent insurance on a bond the premiums for such permanent insurance with respect to each bond will decline over the life of the bond an advantage trust is not insured accordingly there are no premiums for insurance payable by such trust the following additional charges are or may be incurred by a trust all expenses including legal and annual auditing expenses of the trustee incurred in connection with its responsibilities under the indenture except in the event of negligence bad faith or willful misconduct on its part the expenses and costs of any action undertaken by the trustee to protect the trust and the rights and interests of the unit holders fees of the trustee for any extraordinary services performed under the indenture indemnification of the trustee for any loss liability or expense incurred by it without negligence bad faith or willful misconduct on its part arising out of or in connection with its acceptance or administration of the trust indemnification of the sponsor for any loss liability or expense incurred without gross negligence bad faith or willful misconduct in acting as depositor of the trust all taxes and other government charges imposed upon the bonds or any part of the trust no such taxes or charges are being levied or made or to the knowledge of the sponsor are contemplated and expenditures incurred in contacting unit holders upon termination of the trust the above expenses and the trustees annual fee when paid or owing to the trustee are secured by a lien on the trust in addition the trustee is empowered to sell bonds of a trust in order to make funds available to pay all these amounts if funds are not otherwise available in the interest and principal accounts of the trust unless the sponsor determines that such an audit is not required the indenture requires the accounts of each trust to be audited on an annual basis at the expense of the trust by independent auditors selected by the sponsor so long as the sponsor is making a secondary market for units the sponsor shall bear the cost of such annual audits to the extent such cost exceeds  per unit unit holders of a trust covered by an audit may obtain a copy of the audited financial statements from the trustee upon request public offering how is the public offering price determined although it is not obligated to do so the sponsor intends to maintain a market for the units and continuously to offer to purchase units at prices subject to change at any time based upon the aggregate bid price of the bonds in the portfolio of each trust plus the amount of purchased interest of a trust if any and interest accrued to the date of settlement all expenses incurred in maintaining a market other than the fees of the evaluator and the costs of the trustee in transferring and recording the ownership of units will be borne by the sponsor if the supply of units exceeds demand or for some other business reason the sponsor may discontinue purchases of units at such prices if a unit holder wishes to dispose of his units he should inquire of the sponsor as to current market prices prior to making a tender for redemption to the trustee prospectuses relating to certain other bond funds indicate an intention subject to change on the part of the respective sponsors of such funds to repurchase units of those funds on the basis of a price higher than the bid prices of the securities in the funds consequently depending upon the prices actually paid the repurchase price of other sponsors for units of their funds may be computed on a somewhat more favorable basis than the repurchase price offered by the sponsor for units of a trust in secondary market transactions as in the first trust combined series the purchase price per unit of such bond funds will depend primarily on the value of the securities in the portfolio of the applicable trust the public offering price of units of a trust will be determined by adding to the evaluators determination of the aggregate bid price of the bonds in a trust plus the amount of purchased interest of a trust if any and the appropriate sales charge determined in accordance with the schedule set forth below based upon the number of years remaining to the maturity of each bond in the portfolio of the trust adjusting the total to reflect the amount of any cash held in or advanced to the principal account of the trust and dividing the result by the number of units of such trust then outstanding the minimum sales charge on units page  will be  of the public offering price equivalent to  of the net amount invested for purposes of computation bonds will be deemed to mature on their expressed maturity dates unless a the bonds have been called for redemption or funds or securities have been placed in escrow to redeem them on an earlier call date in which case such call date will be deemed to be the date upon which they mature or b such bonds are subject to a mandatory tender in which case such mandatory tender will be deemed to be the date upon which they mature the offering price of bonds in the trust may be expected to be greater than the bid price of such bonds by approximately  of the aggregate principal amount of such bonds the effect of this method of sales charge computation will be that different sales charge rates will be applied to each of the various bonds in the trusts based upon the maturities of such bonds in accordance with the following schedule download table secondary offering period sales charge percentage percentage of public of net offering amount years to maturity price invested     months to  year    but less than     but less than     but less than     but less than     but

sponsor a dealer concession of  of the total sales charges for units sold by such dealer and dealers will not be eligible for additional concessions for units sold pursuant to the above schedule an investor may aggregate purchases of units of two or more consecutive series of a particular state national discount intermediate long intermediate or short intermediate trust for purposes of calculating the discount for volume purchases listed above additionally with respect to the employees officers and directors including their immediate family members defined as spouses children grandchildren parents grandparents mothersinlaw fathersinlaw sonsinlaw and daughters inlaw and trustees custodians or fiduciaries for the benefit of such person of the sponsor and brokerdealers and their subsidiaries and vendors providing services to the sponsor may purchase units of the trusts during the secondary market at the public offering price less the concession the sponsor typically allows brokerdealers any such reduced sales charge shall be the responsibility of the selling brokerdealer the reduced sales charge structure will apply on all purchases of units in a trust by the same person on any one day from the sponsor or any one brokerdealer and for purposes of calculating the applicable sales charge purchases of units in the fund will be aggregated with concurrent purchases by the same person from the sponsor or such brokerdealer of units in any series of taxexempt unit investment trusts sponsored by nike securities lp additionally units purchased in the name of the spouse of a purchaser or in the name of a child of such purchaser will be deemed for the purpose of calculating the applicable sales charge to be additional purchases by the purchaser the reduced sales charges will also be applicable to a trustee or other fiduciary purchasing securities for a single trust estate or single fiduciary account from time to time the sponsor may implement programs under which brokerdealers and other selling agents of the fund may receive nominal awards from the sponsor for each of their registered representatives who have sold a minimum number of uit units during a specified time period in addition at various times the sponsor may implement other programs under which the sales force of brokerdealers and other selling agents may be eligible to win other nominal awards for certain sales efforts or under which the sponsor will reallow to any such brokerdealer or other selling agent that sponsors sales contests or recognition programs conforming to criteria established by the sponsor or participates in page  sales programs sponsored by the sponsor an amount not exceeding the total applicable sales charges on the sales generated by such person at the public offering price during such programs also the sponsor in its discretion may from time to time pursuant to objective criteria established by the sponsor pay fees to qualifying brokerdealers and other selling agents for certain services or activities which are primarily intended to result in sales of units of the trusts such payments are made by the sponsor out of its own assets and not out of the assets of the trusts these programs will not change the price unit holders pay for their units or the amount that the trusts will receive from the units sold a comparison of taxfree and equivalent taxable estimated current returns and estimated longterm returns with the returns on various taxable investments is one element to consider in making an investment decision the sponsor may from time to time in its advertising and sales materials compare the then current estimated returns on the trust and returns over specified periods on other similar trusts sponsored by nike securities lp with returns on taxable investments such as corporate or us government bonds bank cds and money market accounts or money market funds each of which has investment characteristics that may differ from those of the trust us government bonds for example are backed by the full faith and credit of the us government and bank cds and money market accounts are insured by an agency of the federal government money market accounts and money market funds provide stability of principal but pay interest at rates that vary with the condition of the shortterm debt market the investment characteristics of the trust are described more fully elsewhere in this prospectus the aggregate price of the bonds in each trust is determined by the evaluator the evaluator on the basis of bid prices  on the basis of current market prices for the bonds obtained from dealers or brokers who customarily deal in bonds comparable to those held by the trust  if such prices are not available for any of the bonds on the basis of current market prices for comparable bonds  by determining the value of the bonds by appraisal or  by any combination of the above unless bonds are in default in payment of principal or interest or in the sponsors opinion in significant risk of such default the evaluator will not attribute any value to the insurance obtained by an insured trust on the other hand the value of insurance obtained by the issuer of bonds in a trust is reflected and included in the market value of such bonds the evaluator will consider in its evaluation of bonds which are in default in payment of principal or interest or in the sponsors opinion in significant risk of such default the defaulted bonds and which are covered by insurance obtained by an insured trust the value of the insurance guaranteeing interest and principal payments the value of the insurance will be equal to the difference between i the market value of defaulted bonds assuming the exercise of the right to obtain permanent insurance less the insurance premium attributable to the purchase of permanent insurance and ii the market value of such defaulted bonds not covered by permanent insurance in addition the evaluator will consider the ability of financial guaranty andor ambac indemnity to meet its commitments under an insured trusts insurance policy including the commitments to issue permanent insurance it is the position of the sponsor that this is a fair method of valuing the bonds and the insurance obtained by an insured trust and reflects a proper valuation method in accordance with the provisions of the investment company act of  the evaluator will be requested to make a determination of the aggregate price of the bonds in each trust on a bid price basis as of

page  description of bond ratings standard  poors a brief description of the applicable standard  poors rating symbols and their meanings follow a standard  poors corporate or municipal bond rating is a current assessment of the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific debt obligation this assessment may take into consideration obligors such as guarantors insurers or lessees the bond rating is not a recommendation to purchase sell or hold a security inasmuch as it does not comment as to market price or suitability for a particular investor the ratings are based on current information furnished by the issuer or obtained by standard  poors from other sources it considers reliable standard  poors does not perform an audit in connection with any rating and may on occasion rely on unaudited financial information the ratings may be changed suspended or withdrawn as a result of changes in or unavailability of such information or for other circumstances the ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations l likelihood of defaultcapacity and willingness of the obligor as to the timely payment of interest and repayment of principal in accordance with the terms of the obligation ll nature of and provisions of the obligation lll protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangements under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights aaabonds rated aaa have the highest rating assigned by standard  poors to a debt obligation capacity to pay interest and repay principal is extremely strong aabonds rated aa have a very strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal and differ from the highest rated issues only in small degree abonds rated a have a strong capacity to pay interest and repay principal although they are somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than bonds in higher rated categories bbbbonds rated bbb are regarded as having an adequate capacity to pay interest and repay principal whereas they normally exhibit adequate protection parameters adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity to pay interest and repay principal for bonds in this category than for bonds in higher rated categories plus  or minus  the ratings from aa to bbb may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories provisional ratings the letter p indicates that the rating is provisional a provisional rating assumes the successful completion of the project being financed by the bonds being rated and indicates that payment of debt service requirements is largely or entirely dependent upon the successful and timely completion of the project this rating however while addressing credit quality subsequent to completion of the project makes no comment on the likelihood of or the risk of default upon failure of such completion the investor should exercise hisher own judgment with respect to such likelihood and risk credit watch credit watch highlights potential changes in ratings of bonds and other fixed income securities it focuses on events and trends which place companies and government units under special surveillance by sps member analytical staff these may include mergers voter referendums actions by regulatory authorities or developments gleaned from analytical reviews unless otherwise noted a rating decision will be made within  days issues appear on credit watch where an event situation or deviation from trends occurred and needs to be evaluated as to its impact on credit ratings a listing however does not mean a rating change is inevitable since sp continuously monitors all of its ratings credit watch is not intended to include all issues under review thus rating changes will occur without issues appearing on credit watch  as

investors service inc rating symbols and their meanings follow aaabonds which are rated aaa are judged to be of the best quality they carry the smallest degree of investment risk and are generally referred to as gilt edge interest payments are protected by a large or by an exceptionally stable margin and principal is secure while the various protective elements are likely to change such changes as can be visualized are most unlikely to impair the fundamentally strong position of such issues their safety is so absolute that with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances characteristically their market value is affected solely by money market fluctuations aabonds which are rated aa are judged to be of high quality by all standards together with the aaa group they comprise what are generally known as high grade bonds they are rated lower than the best bonds because margins of protection may not be as large as in aaa securities or fluctuation of protective elements may be of greater amplitude or there may be other elements present which make the long term risks appear somewhat large than in aaa securities their market value is virtually immune to all but money market influences with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances abonds which are rated a possess many favorable investment attributes and are to be considered as upper medium grade obligations factors giving security to principal and interest are considered adequate but elements may be present which suggest a susceptibility to impairment sometime in the future the market value of arated bonds may be influenced to some degree by economic performance during a sustained period of depressed business conditions but during periods of normalcy arated bonds frequently move in parallel with aaa and aa obligations with the occasional exception of oversupply in a few specific instances a  and baa bonds which are rated a  and baa  offer the maximum in security within their quality group can be bought for possible upgrading in quality and additionally afford the investor an opportunity to gauge more precisely the relative attractiveness of offerings in the market place baabonds which are rated baa are considered as medium grade obligations ie they are neither highly protected nor poorly secured interest payments and principal security appear adequate for the present but certain protective elements may be lacking or may be characteristically unreliable over any great length of time such bonds lack outstanding investment characteristics and in fact have speculative characteristics as well the market value of baarated bonds is more sensitive to changes in economic circumstances and aside from occasional speculative factors applying to some bonds of this class baa market valuations will move in parallel with aaa aa and a obligations during periods of economic normalcy except in instances of oversupply moodys bond rating symbols may contain numerical modifiers of a generic rating classification the modifier  indicates that the bond ranks at the high end of its category the modifier  indicates a midrange ranking and the modifier  indicates that the issue ranks in the lower end of its generic rating category conbonds for which the security depends upon the completion of some act or the fulfillment of some condition are rated conditionally these are bonds secured by a earnings of projects under construction b earnings of projects unseasoned in operation experience c rentals which begin when facilities are completed or d payments to which some other limiting condition attaches parenthetical rating denotes probable credit stature upon completion of construction or elimination of basis of condition fitch investors

impact on these bonds and therefore impair timely payment the likelihood that the ratings of these bonds will fall below investment grade is higher than for bonds with higher ratings to provide more

validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from federal gross income were rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities in addition with respect to state trusts where applicable bond counsel to the issuing authorities rendered opinions as to the exemption of interest on such bonds when held by residents of the state in which the issuers of such bonds are located from state income taxes and certain state or local intangibles and local income taxes neither the sponsor chapman and cutler nor any of the special counsel to the fund for state tax matters have made any special review for the fund of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds or of the bases for the opinions rendered in connection therewith if the interest on a bond should be determined to be taxable the bond would generally have to be sold at a substantial discount in addition investors could be required to pay income tax on interest received prior to the date on which interest is determined to be taxable gain realized on the sale or redemption of the bonds by the trustee or of a unit by a unit holder is includable in gross income for federal income tax purposes and may be includable in gross income for state tax purposes such gain does not include any amounts received in respect of accrued interest or accrued original issue discount if any if a bond is acquired with accrued interest that portion of the price paid for the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the bond when this accrued interest is received it is treated as a return of capital and reduces the tax basis of the bond if a bond is purchased for a premium the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of the bond bond premium is amortized over the remaining term of the bond and the tax basis of the bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of the premium amortized in that tax year for purposes of the following opinions it is assumed that each asset of the trust is debt the interest on which is excluded from gross income for federal income tax purposes at the time of the closing for each trust chapman and cutler counsel for the sponsor rendered an opinion under then existing law substantially to the effect that  the trusts are not associations taxable as corporations for federal income tax purposes and interest and accrued original issue discount on bonds which is excludable from gross income under the internal revenue code of  the code will retain its status for federal income tax purposes when received by the trusts and distributed to a unit holder however such interest may be taken into account in computing the alternative minimum tax and the additional tax on branches of foreign corporations and the environmental tax the superfund tax as noted below see certain tax matters applicable to corporate unit holders all parts of the prospectus should be retained for future reference these securities have not been approved or disapproved by the securities and exchange commission nor has the commission passed upon the accuracy or adequacy of this prospectus any representation to the contrary is a criminal offense page   each unit holder is considered to be the owner of a pro rata portion of each asset of the respective trust under subpart e subchapter j of chapter  of the code and will have a taxable event when the trust disposes of a bond or when the unit holder redeems or sells his units if the unit holder disposes of a unit he is deemed thereby to have disposed of his entire pro rata interest in all assets of the trust involved including his pro rata portion of all the bonds represented by the unit the taxpayer relief act of  the  act includes provisions that treat certain transactions designed to reduce or eliminate risk of loss and opportunities for gain eg short sales offsetting notional principal contracts futures or forward contracts or similar transactions as constructive sales for purposes of recognition of gain but not loss and for purposes of determining the holding period unit holders should consult their own tax advisors with regard to any such constructive sale rules unit holders must reduce the tax basis of their units for their share of accrued interest received by the respective trust if any on bonds before the date the trust acquired ownership of the bonds and the amount of this reduction may exceed the amount of accrued interest paid to the seller and consequently such unit holders may have an increase in taxable gain or reduction in capital loss upon the disposition of such units gain or loss upon the sale or redemption of units is measured by comparing the proceeds of such sale or redemption with the adjusted basis of the units if the trustee disposes of bonds whether by sale payment on maturity redemption or otherwise gain or loss is recognized to the unit holder subject to various nonrecognition provisions of the code the amount of any such gain or loss is measured by comparing the unit holders pro rata share of the total proceeds from such disposition with the unit holders basis for his or her fractional interest in the asset disposed of in the case of a unit holder who purchases units such basis before adjustment for accrued original issue discount and amortized bond premium if any is determined by apportioning the cost of the units among each of the trust assets ratably according to value as of the valuation date nearest the date of acquisition of the units unit holders should consult their own tax advisers with regard to the calculation of basis the tax basis reduction requirements of the code relating to amortization of bond premium may under some circumstances result in the unit holder realizing a taxable gain when his units are sold or redeemed for an amount equal to or less than his original cost and  any insurance proceeds paid under individual policies obtained by issuers of bonds which represent maturing interest on defaulted bonds held by the trustee will be excludable from federal gross income if and to the same extent as such interest would have been so excludable if paid in the normal course by the issuer of the defaulted bonds provided that at the time such policies are purchased the amounts paid for such policies are reasonable customary and consistent with the reasonable expectation that the issuer of the bonds rather than the insurer will pay debt service on the bonds sections  and  of the code provide a complex set of rules governing the accrual of original issue discount these rules provide that original issue discount accrues either on the basis of a constant compound interest rate or ratably over the term of the bond depending on the date the bond was issued in addition special rules apply if the purchase price of a bond exceeds the original issue price plus the amount of original issue discount which would have previously accrued based upon its issue price its adjusted issue price to prior owners if a bond is acquired with accrued interest that portion of the price paid for the accrued interest is added to the tax basis of the bond when this accrued interest is received it is treated as a return of capital and reduces the tax basis of the bond if a bond is purchased for a premium the amount of the premium is added to the tax basis of the bond bond premium is amortized over the remaining term of the bond and the tax basis of the bond is reduced each tax year by the amount of the premium amortized in that tax year the application of these rules will also vary depending on the value of the bond on the date a unit holder acquires his unit and the price the unit holder pays for his unit unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these rules and their application see portfolio appearing in part one for each trust for information relating to bonds if any issued at an original issue discount the revenue reconciliation act of  the tax act subjects tax exempt bonds to the market discount rules of the code effective for bonds purchased after april   in general market discount is the amount if any by which the stated redemption price at maturity exceeds an investors purchase price except to the extent that such difference page  if any is attributable to original issue discount not yet accrued subject to statutory de minimis rule market discount can arise based on the price a trust pays for bonds or the price a unit holder pays for his or her units under the tax act accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income under prior law the accretion had been treated as capital gain market discount that accretes while a trust holds a bond would be recognized as ordinary income by the unit holders when principal payments are received on the bond upon sale or at redemption including early redemption or upon the sale or redemption of his or her units unless a unit holder elects to include market discount in taxable income as it accrues the market discount rules are complex and unit holders should consult their tax advisers regarding these rules and their application counsel for the sponsor has also advised that under section  of the code interest on indebtedness incurred or continued to purchase or carry units of a trust is not deductible for federal income tax purposes the internal revenue service has taken the position that such indebtedness need not be directly traceable to the purchase or carrying of units however these rules generally do not apply to interest paid on indebtedness incurred to purchase or improve a personal residence also under section  of the code certain financial institutions that acquire units generally would not be able to deduct any of the interest expense attributable to ownership of units legislative proposals have been made that would extend the financial institution rules to certain other corporations including securities dealers and other financial intermediaries investors with questions regarding these issues should consult with their tax advisers in the case of certain of the bonds in a trust the opinions of bond counsel indicate that interest on such bonds received by a substantial user of the facilities being financed with the proceeds of these bonds or persons related thereto for periods while such bonds are held by such a user or related person will not be excludable from federal gross income although interest on such bonds received by others would be excludable from federal gross income substantial user and related person are defined under the code and us treasury regulations any person who believes he or she may be a substantial user or related person as so defined should contact his tax adviser all statements of law in the prospectus concerning exclusion from gross income for federal state or other tax purposes are the opinions of counsel and are to be so construed at the respective times of issuance of the bonds opinions relating to the validity thereof and to the exclusion of interest thereon from federal gross income are rendered by bond counsel to the respective issuing authorities neither the sponsor nor chapman and cutler has made any special review for the fund of the proceedings relating to the issuance of the bonds or of the basis for such opinions in general section  of the code provides that  of social security benefits are includable in gross income to the extent that the sum of modified adjusted gross income plus  of the social security benefits received exceeds the base amount the base amount is  for unmarried taxpayers  for married taxpayers filing a joint return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times during the taxable year and who file separate returns modified adjusted gross income is adjusted gross income determined without regard to certain otherwise allowable deductions and exclusions from gross income and by including taxexempt interest to the extent that social security benefits are includible in gross income they will be treated as any other item of gross income in addition under the tax act for taxable years beginning after december   up to  of social security benefits are includible in gross income to the extent that the sum of modified adjusted gross income plus  of social security benefits received exceeds an adjusted base amount the adjusted base amount is  for unmarried taxpayers  for married taxpayers filing a joint return and zero for married taxpayers who do not live apart at all times during the taxable year and who file separate returns although taxexempt interest is included in modified adjusted gross income solely for the purpose of determining what portion if any of social security benefits will be included in gross income no taxexempt interest including that received from a trust will be subject to tax a taxpayer whose adjusted gross income already exceeds the base amount or the adjusted base amount must include  or  respectively of his social security benefits in gross income whether or not he receives any taxexempt interest a taxpayer whose modified adjusted gross income after inclusion of taxexempt interest does not exceed the base amount need not include any social security benefits in gross income page  for purposes of computing the alternative minimum tax for individuals and corporations

assets held for more than one year but not more than  months are taxed at a maximum marginal stated tax rate of  and capital gains realized from assets with certain exclusions held for more than  months are taxed at a maximum marginal stated tax rate of   in the case of certain taxpayers in the lowest tax bracket further capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are taxed at the same rate as ordinary income legislation is currently pending that provides the appropriate methodology that should be applied in netting the realized capital gains and losses such legislation is proposed to be effective retroactively for tax years ending after may   the date on which a unit is acquired ie the trade date is excluded for purposes of determining the holding period of the unit it should be noted that legislative proposals are introduced from time to time that affect tax rates and could affect relative differences at which ordinary income and capital gains are taxed in addition please note that capital gains may be recharacterized as ordinary income in the case of certain financial transactions that are considered conversion transactions effective for transactions entered into after april   unit holders and prospective investors should consult with their tax advisers regarding the potential effect of this provision on their investment in units under the code taxpayers

than that of the nation as a whole gradually eroding the states relative economic affluence statewide urban centers have experienced significant changes involving migration of the more affluent to the suburbs and an influx of generally less affluent residents regionally the older northeast cities have suffered because of the relative success that the south and the west have had in attracting people and business the city has also had to face greater competition as other major cities have developed financial and business capabilities which make them less dependent on the specialized services traditionally available almost exclusively in the city the state has for many years had a very high state and local tax burden relative to other states the burden of state and local taxation in combination with the many other causes of regional economic dislocation has contributed to the decisions of some businesses and individuals to relocate outside or not locate within the state however the states  budget reflected significant actions to reduce the burden of state taxation including adoption of a year  reduction in the states personal income tax during  new york led the nation in tax cuts at  bringing the total value of tax reductions in effect for the  year to over  billion annual savings are intended to grow to  billion by  when measured as a percentage of personal income stateimposed taxes in new york should be below the national median in  the budget for fiscal year  proposes an additional  million in tax reductions slowdown of regional economy a national recession commenced in mid  economic recovery started considerably later in the state than in the nation as a whole due in part to the significant retrenchment in the banking and financial services industries downsizing by several major corporations cutbacks in defense spending and an oversupply of office buildings in the last few years new york has shown signs of economic resurgence new york has gone from last in the nation in percentage of private sector employment growth to a level that is on par with the national average gaining  private sector jobs since december  overall employment growth was close to  for  national employment growth in  was estimated at  the new york economy in  is expected to grow at about the same rate as in  many uncertainties exist in forecasts of both the national

an extraordinary maximum deposit of  million from surplus  monies in recent years state actions affecting the level of receipts and disbursements as well as the relative strength of the state and regional economy actions of the federal government and other factors have created structural gaps for the state these gaps resulted from a significant disparity between recurring revenues and the costs of maintaining or increasing the level of support for state programs as noted the  enacted budget combines significant tax and program reductions which will in the current and future years lower both the recurring receipts base before the effect of any economic stimulus from such tax reductions and the historical annual growth in state program spending notwithstanding these changes the state can expect to continue to confront structural deficits in future years one major uncertainty to the  state financial plan continues to be risks related to the economy and tax collections which could produce either favorable or unfavorable variances during the balance of the year it is possible that recent changes could produce slower economic growth and a deterioration in state receipts an additional risk to the  state financial plan arises from the potential impact of certain litigation now pending against the state which could produce adverse effects on the states projections of receipts and disbursements  fiscal year general fund receipts in  will reflect the initial phases of the star property tax reduction program as well as the continuing impact of other  and earlier tax

determining state and local contributions to the state employee retirement system following the decision the state comptroller developed a plan to phase in a constitutional funding method and to restore prior funding levels of the retirement systems over a fouryear period the plan is not expected to require the state to make additional contributions with respect to the  fiscal year nor to materially and adversely affect the states financial condition thereafter through fiscal year  the state expects to contribute  million more to the retirement plans than would have been required under the prior funding method future fiscal years there can be no assurance that the state will not face substantial potential budget gaps in the future resulting from a significant disparity between tax revenues projected from a lower recurring receipts base and the spending required to maintain state programs at current levels to address any potential budgetary imbalance the state may need to take significant actions to align recurring receipts and disbursements indebtedness as of march   the total amount of longterm state general obligation debt authorized but unissued stood at  billion page

corporation mac the city accounts for approximately  of the states population and personal income and the citys financial health affects the state in numerous ways in response to the citys fiscal crisis in  the state took a number of steps to assist the city in returning to fiscal stability among other actions the state legislature i created mac to assist with long term financing for the citys shortterm debt and other cash requirements and ii created the state financial control board the control board to review and approve the citys budgets and city four year financial plans the financial plans also apply to certain city related public agencies the covered organizations from  to  the rate of economic growth in the city slowed substantially the citys economic improvement significantly accelerated in fiscal year  resulting in an unusually high acrosstheboard increase in tax receipts much of the increase can be traced to the performance of the securities industry but the citys economy has produced gains in retail trade tourism and in business services in  the city experienced the largest private sector job growth in the last  years pursuant to state law the city prepares a fouryear annual financial plan which is reviewed and revised on a quarterly basis and which includes the citys capital revenue and expense projections the city is required to submit its financial plans to review bodies including the control board if the city were to experience certain adverse financial circumstances including the occurrence or the substantial likelihood and imminence of the occurrence of an annual operating deficit of more than  million or the loss of access to the public credit markets to satisfy the citys capital and seasonal financial requirements the control board would be required by state law to exercise certain powers including prior approval of city financial plans proposed borrowings and certain contracts the city depends on the state for state aid both to enable the city to balance its budget and to meet its cash requirements if the state experiences revenue shortfalls or spending increases beyond its projections during its  fiscal year or subsequent years such developments could result in reductions in projected state aid to the city in addition there can be no assurance that state budgets in future fiscal years will be adopted by the april  statutory deadline page  and that there will not be adverse effects on the citys cash flow and additional city expenditures as a result of such delays the mayor is responsible for preparing the citys fouryear financial plan including the citys current financial plan the city projections set forth in its financial plan are based on various assumptions and contingencies which are uncertain and which may not materialize changes in major assumptions could significantly affect the citys ability to balance its budget as required by state law and to meet its annual cash flow and financing requirements such assumptions and contingencies include the condition of the regional and local economies the absence of wage increases in excess of the increases assumed in its financial plan employment growth provision of state and federal aid and mandate relief state legislative approval of future state budgets levels of education expenditures as may be required by state law adoption of future city budgets by the new york city council and approval by the governor or the state legislature and the cooperation of mac with respect to various other actions proposed in such financial plan attaining a balanced budget is also dependent upon the citys ability to market its securities successfully in the public credit markets the citys financing program for fiscal years  through  contemplates the issuance of  billion of general obligation bonds primarily to reconstruct and rehabilitate the citys infrastructure and physical assets and to make capital investments in addition the city issues revenue and tax anticipation notes to finance its seasonal working capital requirements the terms and success of projected public sales of city general obligation bonds and notes will be subject to prevailing market conditions at the time of the sale and no assurance can be given that the credit markets will absorb the projected amounts of public bond and note sales future developments concerning the city and public discussion of such developments the citys future financial needs and other issues may affect the market for outstanding city general obligation bonds and notes if the city were unable to sell its general obligation bonds and notes it would be prevented from meeting its planned operating and capital expenditures  financial plan on july   the city submitted to the control board the  financial plan which relates to the city the board of education and the city university of new york the  financial plan is based on the citys expense and capital budgets for the citys  fiscal year which were adopted on june   and sets forth proposed actions by the city for the  fiscal year to close substantial projected budget gaps resulting from lower than projected tax receipts and other revenues and greater than projected expenditures in addition to substantial proposed agency expenditure reductions and productivity efficiency and labor initiatives negotiated with the citys labor unions the  financial plan reflects a strategy to substantially reduce spending for entitlements for the  and subsequent fiscal years  financial plan in january  the new york city mayor announced the citys financial plan for fiscal years  for the second year in a row the new york city fouryear financial plan contains a record surplus of more than  billion since the adoption of the fiscal year  budget the city is now forecasting additional resources of  billion approximately  will be used to reduce the outyear gaps  will fund targeted educational public safety and other initiatives and  will be used to reduce taxes further to reduce the outyear gaps the city has imposed fiscal discipline on the rate of growth of city spending which has over the last four years been held below the rate of inflation for fiscal year  the proposed cityfunded spending increase will be held to  the budget stabilization account established for the first time in  will be maintained in fiscal year  at  million with an additional  million created for fiscal year  as a result of this fiscal planning the outyear gaps have been cut in half compared to six years ago fiscal year  was  billion and fiscal year  is  billion according to recent staff reports while economic recovery in new york city has been slower than in other regions of the country a surge in wall street profitability resulted in increased tax revenues and generated a substantial surplus for the city in city fiscal year   although several sectors of the citys economy have expanded recently especially tourism and business and professional services city tax revenues remain heavily dependent on the continued profitability of the securities industry and the course of the national economy these reports have also indicated that recent city budgets have been balanced in part through the use of nonrecurring resources that the citys financial plan tends to rely on actions outside its direct page  control that the city has not yet brought its longterm expenditure growth in line with recurring revenue growth and that the city is therefore likely to continue to face substantial gaps between forecast revenues and expenditures in future years that must be closed with reduced expenditures andor increased revenues given the foregoing factors there can be no assurance that the city will continue to maintain a balanced budget or that it can maintain a balanced budget without additional tax or other revenue increases or reductions in city services which could adversely affect the citys economic base litigation the city is a defendant in a significant number of lawsuits such litigation includes but is not limited to actions commenced and claims asserted against the city arising out of alleged constitutional violations torts breaches of contracts and other violations of law and condemnation proceedings while the ultimate outcome and fiscal impact if any on the proceedings and claims are not currently predictable adverse determinations in certain of them might have a material adverse effect upon the citys ability to carry out its financial plan the  financial plan includes

agencies certain agencies of the state have faced substantial financial difficulties which could adversely affect the ability of such agencies to make payments of interest on and principal amounts of their respective bonds the difficulties have in certain instances caused the state under socalled moral obligation provisions which are nonbinding statutory provisions for state appropriations to maintain various debt service reserve funds to appropriate funds on behalf of the agencies moreover it is expected that the problems faced by these agencies will continue and will require increasing amounts of state assistance in future years failure of the state to appropriate necessary amounts or to take other action to permit those agencies having financial difficulties to meet their obligations could result in a default by one or more of the agencies such default if it were to occur would be likely to have a significant adverse effect on investor confidence in and therefore the market price of obligations of the defaulting agencies in addition any default in payment on any general obligation of any agency whose bonds contain a moral obligation provision could constitute a failure of certain conditions that must be satisfied in connection with federal guarantees of city and mac obligations and could thus jeopardize the citys long term financing plans  state litigation the state is a defendant in numerous legal proceedings pertaining to matters incidental to the performance of routine governmental operations such litigation includes but is not limited to claims asserted against the state arising from alleged torts alleged breaches of contracts condemnation proceedings and other alleged violations of state and federal laws included in the states outstanding litigation are a number of cases challenging the constitutionality or the adequacy and effectiveness of a variety of significant social welfare programs primarily involving the states mental hygiene programs adverse judgments in these matters generally could result in injunctive relief coupled with prospective changes in page  patient care which could require substantial increased financing of the litigated programs in the future the state is also engaged in a variety of claims wherein significant monetary damages are sought in  a civil rights claim alleging intentional school segregation in yonkers has resulted in a  million judgment for plaintiffs that the state must pay adverse developments in the foregoing proceedings or new proceedings could adversely affect the financial condition of the state in the future  other municipalities certain localities in addition to new york city could have financial problems leading to requests for additional state assistance and the need to reduce their spending or increase their revenues the potential impact on the state of such actions by localities is not included in projections of state receipts and expenditures in the states  fiscal year fiscal difficulties experienced by the city of yonkers yonkers resulted in the reestablishment of the financial control board for the city of yonkers the yonkers board by the state in  the yonkers board is charged with oversight of the fiscal affairs of yonkers future actions taken by the governor or the state legislature to assist yonkers could result in increased state expenditures for extraordinary local assistance beginning in  the city of troy experienced a series of budgetary deficits that resulted in the establishment of a supervisory board for the city of troy in  the supervisory boards powers were increased in  when troy mac was created to help troy avoid default on certain obligations the legislation creating troy mac prohibits the city of troy from seeking federal bankruptcy protection while troy mac bonds are outstanding troy mac has issued bonds to effect a restructuring of the city of troys obligations eighteen municipalities received extraordinary assistance during the  legislative session through  million in special appropriations targeted for distressed cities aid that was largely continued in  twentyeight municipalities are scheduled to share the more than  million in targeted unrestricted aid allocated in the  budget an additional  million will be dispersed among all cities towns and villages a  increase in general purpose state aid municipalities and school districts have engaged in substantial short term and longterm borrowings in  the total indebtedness of all localities in the state other than new york city was approximately  billion approximately  million of that indebtedness represented borrowing to finance budgetary deficits and was issued pursuant to state enabling legislation state law requires the comptroller to review and make recommendations concerning the budgets of those local government units other than new york city authorized by state law to issue debt to finance deficits during the period that such deficit financing is outstanding eighteen localities had outstanding indebtedness for deficit financing at the close of their fiscal year ending in  from time to time federal expenditure reductions could reduce or in some cases eliminate federal funding of some local programs and accordingly might impose substantial increased expenditure requirements on affected localities if the state new york city or any of the agencies were to suffer serious financial difficulties jeopardizing their respective access to the public credit markets the marketability of notes and bonds issued by localities within the state including notes or bonds in the new york trust could be adversely affected localities also face anticipated and potential problems resulting from certain pending litigation judicial decisions and longrange economic trends the longrange potential problems of declining urban population increasing expenditures and other economic trends could adversely affect localities and require increasing state assistance in the future  other issuers of new york municipal obligations there are a number of other agencies instrumentalities and political subdivisions of the state that issue municipal obligations some of which may be conduit revenue obligations payable from payments from private borrowers these entities are subject to various economic risks and uncertainties and the credit quality of the securities issued by them may vary considerably from the credit quality of obligations backed by the full faith and credit of the state the foregoing

defined we first trust portfolios lp the sponsor have created hundreds of similar yet separate series of an investment company which we have named the first trust combined series the series to which this prospectus relates the first trust combined series  consists of a single portfolio known as build america bonds portfolio series  we anticipate depositing the first trust combined series  on or about august   however for a variety of reasons we may elect to postpone or cancel the deposit or if we proceed with the deposit we may elect to create fewer units than we currently anticipate the trust was created under the laws of the state of new york by a trust agreement the indenture dated the initial date of deposit this agreement entered into between first trust portfolios lp as sponsor the bank of new york mellon as trustee ftp services llc ftps as ftps unit servicing agent and first trust advisors lp as portfolio supervisor and evaluator governs the operation of the trust you may get more specific details concerning the nature structure and risks of this product in an information supplement by calling the sponsor at  ext  how we created the trust on the initial date of deposit we deposited municipal bonds andor contracts for municipal bonds including a letter of credit or the equivalent with the trustee and in turn the trustee delivered documents to us representing our ownership of the trust in the form of units units after the initial date of deposit we may deposit additional securities in the trust or cash including a letter of credit or the equivalent with instructions to buy more securities to create new units for sale if we create additional units we will attempt to the extent practicable to maintain the percentage relationship established among the securities on the initial date of deposit as set forth under schedule of investments adjusted to reflect the occurrence of an event which affects the capital structure of the issuer of a security or a sale of a security made as described in removing securities from the trust since the prices of the securities will fluctuate daily the ratio of securities in the trust on a market value basis will also change daily the portion of securities represented by each unit will not change as a result of the deposit of additional securities in the trust if we deposit cash you and new investors may experience a dilution of your investment this is because prices of securities will fluctuate between the time of the cash deposit and the purchase of the securities and because the trust pays the associated brokerage fees to reduce this dilution the trust will try to buy the securities as close to the evaluation time and as close to the evaluation price as possible in addition because the trust pays the brokerage fees associated with the creation of new units and with the sale of securities to meet redemption and exchange requests frequent redemption and exchange activity will likely result in higher brokerage expenses an affiliate of the trustee may receive these brokerage fees or the trustee may retain and pay us or our affiliate to act as agent for the trust to buy securities if we or an affiliate of ours act as agent to the trust we will be subject to the restrictions under the investment company act of  as amended the  act we cannot guarantee that the trust will keep its present size and composition for any length of time securities will mature or may be redeemed prior to the termination date or may be periodically sold under certain circumstances to satisfy trust obligations to meet redemption requests and as described in removing securities from the trust to maintain the sound investment character of the trust and the proceeds received by the trust will be used to meet trust obligations or distributed to unit holders but will not be reinvested however securities will not be sold to take advantage of market fluctuations or changes in anticipated rates of appreciation or depreciation or if they no longer meet the criteria by which they were selected you will not be able to dispose of or vote any of the securities in the trust as the holder of the securities the trustee will vote the securities and will endeavor to vote the securities such that the securities are voted as closely as possible in the same manner and the same general proportion as are the securities held by owners other than such trust neither we nor the trustee will be liable for a failure in any of the securities however if a contract for the purchase of any of the securities initially deposited in the trust fails unless we can purchase substitute securities replacement securities we will refund to you that portion of the purchase price and sales charge resulting from the failed contract on the next distribution date any replacement security the trust acquires will meet requirements specified in the indenture page  portfolio objectives the trust seeks to distribute income and preserve capital by investing in a professionally selected fixed portfolio of investment grade taxable municipal bonds under normal circumstances at least  of the trusts portfolio will consist of bonds issued under the build america bond provision of the american recovery and reinvestment act of  but the trust may also invest in other taxable municipal bonds build americas infrastructure with bonds a municipal bond is a debt obligation of a state andor local government entity which can be used to help build americas infrastructure by raising money to finance public projects such as new hospitals schools and improved roads with the signing into law of the american recovery and reinvestment act of  an entirely new type of taxable municipal bond was createdbuild america bonds or babs essentially build america bonds are identical to traditional taxexempt issues except the interest is taxable at the federal and possibly state and local level babs provided state and local governments with a new method of financing capital projects with the aid of a federal subsidy the subsidy was intended to ease the burden of budgetarypressured state and local governments and to stimulate spending on a variety of public projects the federal government reimburses the municipality  of the interest paid on the bonds  in the case of certain bonds thereby reducing their net interest cost the subsidy provided by the government allowed issuers to offer higher interest rates on bonds than they do on their taxfree debt while offsetting some or all of the additional financing burden the bab program expired at the end of  there is no assurance that the bab program will be continued in the future or if it is continued that the program terms will not be modified possibly significantly build america bonds ataglance o part of the us governments plan to fund infrastructure o us government will subsidize   in the case of certain bonds of the interest payment on taxable bonds issued as direct pay babs directly to the issuers of such securities o municipal bonds have historically low default rates and relatively low volatility o provide taxable income o generally high credit quality o interest will be treated as state taxexempt in those states that treat municipal bond interest as exempt from state income tax growth in bab issuance increased demand growth in babs issuance throughout the programs existence was spurred by investor demand since babs represented a new taxable fixed income option for investors to augment corporate asset backed federal agency and treasury bonds in addition babs have drawn interest from investors who are not typically purchasers of taxexempt bonds because they dont benefit from federal tax exemption such as foreign investors who have no us tax liability or pension funds that are not required to pay taxes the first babs were sold on april   and by the end of  a total of  billion in babs were issued in  another  billion had been issued since  all  states and the district of columbia have participated in the program securities industry and financial markets association sifma increased share of issuance states and local governments have always issued taxable debt accounting for an average of  of overall long term issuance since  municipal securities rulemaking board the emergence of babs however led to record levels of issuance of taxable municipal securities municipal securities rulemaking board from the first bab issuance on april   through the end of  babs accounted for  of longterm securities issued in the municipal market sifma in  babs share grew to account for  of long term municipal bond issuance the appeal of taxable municipal bonds lower default rates than corporate bonds municipal bonds have historically had a very low overall default rate as compared to corporate bonds according to data from moodys the historical default rate of moodysrated municipal bonds is lower than that of corporate bonds in every rating category in fact despite the economic struggles facing many states and municipalities investment grade municipal bonds have experienced significantly lower default rates than even the highest rated corporate bonds one reason for the historically lower default rates has been due to the relatively more stable revenue streams of municipalities which have the ability to levy taxes to offset declining revenues corporate revenues on the other hand can be more volatile as they have fewer ways to increase revenues during difficult economic periods page  attractive yields the subsidy provided by the government enables bab issuers to offer yields at attractive spreads over comparable traditional types of taxable bonds such as treasury bonds and corporate bonds although the interest on the bonds is taxable for federal purposes states are permitted to treat the interest as exempt from state taxes the taxable bond marketplace is often short on supply of longerdated taxable bonds which has made babs a popular option for both institutional and individual investors who are attracted to the higher yields relative to other taxable bonds investment grade taxable yields year

illustrative purposes only and should not be considered indicative of the yield of the trust an index cannot be purchased directly by investors professional evaluation and selection we believe thorough analysis of the credit quality of any bond is critically important in light of the challenges present in the municipal market today relying on a bonds rating does not adequately inform investors about the inherent credit quality of the bond at first trust we take a thorough approach to analyzing municipal securities that are under consideration for inclusion in our unit investment trusts our analysts use a multiple factor approach when evaluating the credit strength of a bond factors specific to different sectors of the municipal market enter into the analysis as well as comparisons to peers to do so our analysts assess the financial strength of the obligor by examining its fiscal health and economic health we determine the relative strength of protection afforded the bondholder by the legal and contractual elements of the bond documents and we look to other qualitative factors that could enhance or compromise the credit strength of the bond assessing municipal credit risk the goal of our credit analysis is primarily twofold o avoidance of potentially severe credit impairment especially default o determining probability of transitional credit events leading to credit quality volatility or degradation although municipal bonds have exhibited a very low rate of default defaults can and do happen however it is more common for the credit quality of a bond to become worse over timea negative credit transition by thoroughly analyzing every bond we seek to identify and avoid those bonds that have the potential for adverse credit developments in the future unlike other fixed income investment alternatives once a unit investment trust is established new bonds cannot be added or substituted for the trusts holdings therefore we approach the analysis of each and every security with the understanding that they will be held in any given portfolio for a long period of time the purpose of our credit analysis is to identify securities that we believe will stand the test of time for the duration of the life of the trust as of the initial date of deposit all of the securities were rated bbb or better by standard  poors andor another nationally recognized statistical rating organization see description of bond ratings after the initial date of deposit a securitys rating may be lowered this would not immediately cause the security to be removed from the trust but may be considered by us in determining whether to direct the trustee to dispose of such security see removing securities from the trust the trust has an expected life of approximately  years a diversified portfolio helps to offset the risks normally associated with such an investment although it does not eliminate them entirely of course as with any similar investments there can be no guarantee that the objectives of the trust will be achieved see risk factors for a discussion of the risks of investing in the trust estimated returns the estimated current and longterm returns set forth in the summary of essential information are estimates and are designed to be comparative rather than predictive we cannot predict your actual return which will vary with unit price how long you hold your investment and with changes in the portfolio interest income and expenses in addition neither rate reflects the true return you will receive which will be lower because neither includes the effect of certain delays in distributions with respect to when the securities pay interest and when distributions are paid by the trust estimated current return equals the estimated annual interest income to be received from the securities less estimated annual trust expenses divided by the public offering price per unit page  which includes the initial sales charge estimated longterm return is a measure of the estimated return over the estimated life of the trust and is calculated using a formula which  factors in the market values yields which take into account the amortization of premiums and the accretion of discounts and estimated retirements of the securities and  takes into account a compounding factor the sales charge and expenses unlike estimated current return estimated longterm return reflects maturities discounts and premiums of the securities in the trust we will provide you with estimated cash flows for the trust at no charge upon your request risk factors price volatility the trust invests in municipal bonds the value of the securities will decline with increases in interest rates not only because increases in rates generally decrease values but also because increased rates may indicate an economic slowdown an economic slowdown or a reduction in an issuers creditworthiness may result in the issuer being unable to maintain earnings at a level sufficient to maintain interest and principal payments the value of the securities will also fluctuate with changes in investors perceptions of an issuers financial condition or the general condition of the municipal bond market changes in inflation rates or when political or economic events affecting the issuers occur because the trust is not managed the trustee will not sell securities in response to or in anticipation of market fluctuations as is common in managed investments as with any investment we cannot guarantee that the performance of the trust will be positive over any period of time or that you wont lose money units of the trust are not deposits of any bank and are not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or any other government agency interest there is no guarantee that the issuers of the securities will be able to satisfy their interest payment obligations to the trust over the life of the trust current economic conditions the national bureau of economic research announced that the us economys recession which began in december  technically ended in june  despite this announcement economic activity remains below average levels the united states continues to experience increased unemployment and stock markets remain below pre recession levels the recession began with problems in the housing and credit markets many of which were caused by defaults on subprime mortgages and mortgagebacked securities eventually leading to the failures of some large financial institutions and has negatively impacted all sectors of the economy the current economic crisis has also affected the global economy with european and asian markets suffering historic losses due to the current state of uncertainty in the economy the value of the securities held by the trust may be subject to steep declines or increased volatility due to changes in performance or perception of the issuers extraordinary steps have been taken by the governments of several leading economic countries to combat the economic crisis however the impact of these measures is not yet known and cannot be predicted the markets for credit instruments including municipal securities have experienced periods of extreme illiquidity and volatility since the latter half of  liquidity in the municipal bond market the ability to buy and sell bonds readily has been reduced general market uncertainty and consequent repricing risk have led to market imbalances of sellers and buyers which in turn have resulted in significant valuation uncertainties in a variety of debt securities including municipal securities in addition during  several major dealers of municipal bonds exited the market via acquisition or bankruptcy these conditions resulted and in many cases continue to result in greater volatility less liquidity widening credit spreads and a lack of price transparency with many debt securities remaining illiquid and of uncertain value these market conditions may make valuation of some of the trusts securities uncertain andor result in sudden and significant valuation increases or declines in its holdings during times of reduced market liquidity such as at the present the trust may not be able to sell securities readily at prices reflecting the values at which the securities are carried on the trusts books sales of large blocks of securities by market participants such as the trust that are seeking liquidity can further reduce security prices in an illiquid market in response to the current national economic downturn governmental cost burdens may be reallocated among federal state and local governments in addition laws enacted in the future by congress or state legislatures or referenda could extend the time for payment of principal andor interest or impose other constraints on enforcement of such obligations or on the ability of municipalities to levy taxes issuers of municipal securities might seek protection under the bankruptcy laws on august   standard  poors ratings services lowered its long term sovereign credit rating on the united states of america to aa from aaa in reaching its decision standard  poors cited the prolonged controversy over raising the statutory debt ceiling and the related fiscal policy debate and their belief that further nearterm page  progress containing the growth in public spending especially on entitlements or on reaching an agreement on revenues is less likely than they previously assumed the impact of the downgrade of the us longterm sovereign credit rating by standard  poors is uncertain but will likely lead to increased interest rates and volatility in the short term municipal securities the trust invests in taxable municipal bonds municipal bonds are debt obligations issued by states or political subdivisions or authorities of states municipal bonds are typically designated as general obligation bonds which are general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity or revenue bonds which are payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes municipal bonds are longterm fixed rate debt obligations that generally decline in value with increases in interest rates when an issuers financial condition worsens or when the rating on a bond is decreased many municipal bonds may be called or redeemed prior to their stated maturity an event which is more likely to occur when interest rates fall in such an occurrence you may not be able to reinvest the money you receive in other bonds that have as high a yield or as long a maturity the market for municipal bonds is generally less liquid than for other securities and therefore the price of municipal bonds may be more volatile and subject to greater price fluctuations than securities with greater liquidity in addition an issuers ability to make income distributions generally depends on several factors including the financial condition of the issuer and general economic conditions any of these factors may negatively impact the price of municipal bonds held by the trust and would therefore impact the price of both the securities and the units the current economic downturn is negatively affecting towns counties and school districts across the nation in recognition of this fact moodys recently assigned a negative outlook to the creditworthiness of all local governments in the united states acts of terrorism and any resulting damage may not be covered by insurance on the bonds issuers of the bonds may therefore be at risk of default due to losses sustained as a result of terrorist activities build america bonds most of the securities in the trust are build america bonds the build america bonds market is smaller and less diverse than the broader municipal securities market in addition because babs are a new form of municipal financing and because bonds issued after december   will not qualify as babs it is difficult to predict the extent to which a market for such bonds will develop meaning that babs may experience greater illiquidity than other types of municipal securities because issuers of direct pay babs held in the trust receive reimbursement from the us treasury with respect to interest payments on the bonds there is a risk that those municipal issuers will not receive timely payment from the us treasury and may remain obligated to pay the full interest due on direct pay babs held by the trust furthermore it is possible that a municipal issuer may fail to comply with the requirements to receive the direct pay subsidy or that a future congress may terminate the subsidy altogether in addition the internal revenue code contains a general offset rule the irs offset rule which allows for the possibility that the subsidy payments received by issuers of the babs may be subject to offset against amounts owed by them to the federal government moreover the internal revenue service irs may audit the agencies issuing babs and such audits may among other things examine the price at which babs are initially sold to investors if the irs concludes that a build america bond was mispriced based on its audit it could disallow a portion or all of the interest subsidy received by the issuer of the build america bond the irs offset rule and the disallowance of any interest subsidy as a result of an irs audit could potentially adversely affect a babs issuers credit rating and adversely affect the issuers ability to repay or refinance babs this in turn could adversely affect the ratings and value of the babs held by the trust and the value of the trusts units and could impair the issues ability to make scheduled interest payments because the babs program is new certain aspects of the babs program may be subject to additional federal or state level guidance or subsequent legislation for example the irs or us treasury could impose restriction or limitations on the payments received aspects of the babs program for which the irs and us treasury have solicited public comment include but have not been limited to methods for making direct payments to issuers the tax procedural framework for such payments and compliance safeguards it is not known what additional procedures will be implemented with respect to direct pay babs if any nor is it known what effect such possible procedures would have on the babs market insurance risk certain of the securities in the trust are covered by insurance policies obtained by the issuers or underwriters of the bonds from insurance companies the schedule of investments identifies the insurer of each security insurance guarantees the timely payment when due of all principal and interest on the insured securities such insurance is effective so long as the insured security is outstanding and the insurer remains in business insurance relates only to the particular security and not to the units offered hereby or to their market value insured securities have received the rating described in the schedule of investments by standard  poors in recognition of such insurance there can be no assurance that any insurer listed will be able to satisfy its commitments in the event claims are made in the future certain significant providers of insurance for municipal page  securities have recently incurred significant losses as a result of exposure to subprime mortgages and other lower credit quality investments that have experienced recent defaults or otherwise suffered extreme credit deterioration as a result such losses have reduced the insurers capital and called into question their continued ability to perform their obligations under such insurance if they are called upon to do so in the future while an insured municipal security will typically be deemed to have the rating of its insurer if the insurer of a municipal security suffers a downgrade in its credit rating or the market discounts the value of the insurance provided by the insurer the rating of the underlying municipal security will be more relevant and the value of the municipal security would more closely if not entirely reflect such rating in such a case the value of insurance associated with a municipal security would decline and may not add any value insurance companies are subject to extensive regulation and supervision where they do business by state insurance commissioners who regulate the standards of solvency which must be maintained the nature of and limitations on investments reports of financial condition and requirements regarding reserves for unearned premiums losses and other matters a significant portion of the assets of insurance companies is required by law to be held in reserve against potential claims on policies and is not available to general creditors although the federal government does not regulate the business of insurance federal initiatives including pension regulation controls on medical care costs minimum standards for nofault automobile insurance national health insurance tax law changes affecting life insurance companies and repeal of the antitrust exemption for the insurance business can significantly impact the insurance business because the insurance on the securities if any will be effective so long as the securities are outstanding such insurance will be taken into account in determining the market value of the securities and therefore some value attributable to such insurance will be included in the value of the units of the trust the insurance does not however guarantee the market value of the securities or of the units discount bonds discount bonds are bonds which have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the trust were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type the market discount on previously issued bonds will increase when interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase and decrease when such interest rates fall other things being equal original issue discount bonds  of the securities are considered original issue discount bonds these bonds typically pay a lower interest rate than comparable bonds that were issued at or above their par value under current law the original issue discount which is the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue price of the bonds is deemed to accrue on a daily basis and the accrued portion is treated as taxable interest income for federal income tax purposes unit holders may receive ordinary income dividends from the trust if the trust sells or redeems bonds that were acquired at a market discount or sells bonds at a short term capital gain in general the internal revenue service will treat bonds as market discount bonds when the cost of the bond plus any original issue discount that has not yet accrued is less than the amount due to be paid at the maturity of the bond any gain realized that is in excess of the earned portion of original issue discount will be taxable as capital gain unless the gain is attributable to market discount in which case the accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income the current value of an original issue discount bond reflects the present value of its stated redemption price at maturity in a stable interest rate environment the market value of these bonds tends to increase more slowly in early years and greater increments as the bonds approach maturity the issuers of these bonds may be able to call or redeem a bond before its stated maturity date and at a price less than the bonds par value premium bonds premium bonds are bonds which have been acquired at a market premium from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the premium bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the trust were higher than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type the current returns of such bonds are initially higher than the current returns of comparable bonds issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes payable because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at maturity but through current income payments early redemption of a premium bond at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a reduction in yield redemptions are more likely to page  occur at times when the bonds have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original issue discount bonds a premium over the accreted value to the extent that the securities were deposited in the fund at a price higher than the price at which they are redeemed this will represent a loss of capital when compared to the original public offering price of the units the trust may be required to sell zero coupon bonds prior to maturity at their current market price which is likely to be less than their par value in order to pay expenses of the trust or in case the trust is terminated see removing securities from the trust and amending or terminating the indenture legislationlitigation from time to time various legislative initiatives are proposed which may have a negative impact on the prices of certain of the municipal bonds represented in the trust in addition litigation regarding any of the issuers of the municipal bonds such as litigation affecting the validity of certain municipal bonds or the qualification of bonds as build america bonds eligible for a federal subsidy payment may negatively impact the value of these securities we cannot predict what impact any pending or proposed legislation or pending or threatened litigation will have on the value of the securities or on the issuers public offering the public offering price you may buy units at the public offering price the price per unit of which is comprised of the following  the aggregate underlying value of the securities  the amount of any cash in the interest and principal accounts of the trust  net interest accrued but unpaid on the securities after the first settlement date to the date of settlement and  the sales charge the price you pay for your units will differ from the amount stated under summary of essential information due to various factors including fluctuations in the prices of the

trust accrued interest accrued interest represents unpaid interest on a bond from the last day it paid interest interest on the securities generally is paid semiannually although the trust accrues such interest daily because the trust always has an amount of interest earned but not yet collected the public offering price of units will have added to it the proportionate share of accrued interest

charge during the initial offering period equals  of the public offering price equivalent to  of the net amount invested secondary market the maximum sales charge during the secondary market is

consequences of owning units of the trust this section is current as of the date of this prospectus tax laws and interpretations change frequently and these summaries do not describe all of the tax consequences to all taxpayers for example these summaries generally do not describe your situation if you are a corporation a nonus person a brokerdealer or other investor with special circumstances in addition this section does not describe your state or foreign tax consequences this federal income tax summary is based in part on the advice of counsel to the sponsor the internal revenue service irs could disagree with any conclusions set forth in this section in addition our counsel was not asked to review and has not reached a conclusion with respect to the federal income tax treatment of the assets to be deposited in the trust this may not be sufficient for you to use for the purpose of avoiding penalties under federal tax law as with any investment you should seek advice based on your individual circumstances from your own tax advisor trust status the trust intends to qualify as a regulated investment company commonly known as a ric under the federal tax laws if the trust page  qualifies as a ric and distributes its income as required by the tax law the trust generally will not pay federal income taxes for federal income tax purposes you are treated as the owner of trust units and not of the assets held by the trust taxability issues are taken into account at the trust level your federal income tax treatment of income from the trust is based on the distributions paid by the trust income from the trust trust distributions are generally taxable after the end of each year you will receive a tax statement that separates the trusts distributions into ordinary dividends capital gains dividends and returns of capital income reported is generally net of expenses but see deductibility of trust expenses below ordinary income distributions are generally taxed at your ordinary tax rate generally you will treat all capital gains dividends as longterm capital gains regardless of how long you have owned your units to determine your actual tax liability for your capital gains dividends you must calculate your total net capital gain or loss for the tax year after considering all of your other taxable transactions as described below in addition the trust may make distributions that represent a return of capital for tax purposes and thus will generally not be taxable to you the tax status of your distributions from the trust is not affected by whether you reinvest your distributions in additional units or receive them in cash the income from the trust that you must take into account for federal income tax purposes is not reduced by amounts used to pay a deferred sales charge if any the tax laws may require you to treat distributions made to you in january as if you had received them on december  of the previous year under the health care and education reconciliation act of  income from the trust may also be subject to a new  medicare tax imposed for taxable years beginning after  this tax will generally apply to your net investment income if your adjusted gross income exceeds certain threshold amounts which are  in the case of married couples filing joint returns and  in the case of single individuals dividends received deduction a corporation that owns units generally will not be entitled to the dividends received deduction with respect to dividends received from the trust because the dividends received deduction is generally not available for distributions from regulated investment companies sale or redemption of units if you sell or redeem your units you will generally recognize a taxable gain or loss to determine the amount of this gain or loss you must subtract your tax basis in your units from the amount you receive in the transaction your tax basis in your units is generally equal to the cost of your units generally including sales charges in some cases however you may have to adjust your tax basis after you purchase your units for units purchased on or after january   or  if the units are acquired in a reinvestment plan in  the information statement you receive in regard to the sale or redemption of your units may contain information about your basis in the units and whether any gain or loss recognized by you should be considered long term or short term capital gain the information reported to you is based upon rules that do not take into consideration all facts that may be known to you or your advisors you should consult with your tax advisors about any adjustments that may need to be made to the information reported to you capital gains and losses if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally  generally  for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets these capital gains rates are generally effective for taxable years beginning before january   for later periods if you are an individual the maximum marginal federal tax rate for net capital gain is generally   for certain taxpayers in the  and  tax brackets the  rate is reduced to  for net capital gains from most property acquired after december   with a holding period of more than five years and the  rate is reduced to  for net capital gains from most property regardless of when acquired with a holding period of more than five years net capital gain equals net longterm capital gain minus net shortterm capital loss for the taxable year capital gain or loss is longterm if the holding period for the asset is more than one year and is shortterm if the holding period for the asset is one year or less you must exclude the date you purchase your units to determine your holding period however if you receive a capital gain dividend from the trust and sell your units at a loss after holding it for six months or less the loss will be recharacterized as long term capital loss to the extent of the capital gain dividend received the tax rates for capital gains realized from assets held for one year or less are generally the same as for ordinary income the internal revenue code treats certain capital gains as ordinary income in special situations deductibility of trust expenses expenses incurred and deducted by the trust will generally not be treated as income taxable to you in some cases however you may be required to treat your portion of these trust expenses as income in these cases you may be able to take a deduction for these expenses however certain miscellaneous itemized deductions such as investment expenses may be deducted by individuals only to the extent that all of page  these deductions exceed  of the individuals adjusted

the sponsor you will receive free of charge supplemental information about this series which has been filed with the sec and to which we have referred throughout this information states more specific risk information about the trust description of bond ratings  as published by standard  poors standard  poors a standard  poors issue credit rating is a forwardlooking opinion about the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to a specific financial obligation a specific class of financial obligations or a specific financial program including ratings on mediumterm note programs and commercial paper programs it takes into consideration the creditworthiness of guarantors insurers or other forms of credit enhancement on the obligation and takes into account the currency in which the obligation is denominated the opinion reflects standard  page  poors view of the obligors capacity and willingness to meet its financial commitments as they come due and may assess terms such as collateral security and subordination which could affect ultimate payment in the event of default issue credit ratings can be either longterm or shortterm shortterm ratings are generally assigned to those obligations considered short term in the relevant market in the united states for example that means obligations with an original maturity of no more than  days including commercial paper shortterm ratings are also used to indicate the creditworthiness of an obligor with respect to put features on long term obligations the result is a dual rating in which the shortterm rating addresses the put feature in addition to the usual longterm rating mediumterm notes are assigned longterm ratings longterm issue credit ratings issue credit ratings are based in varying degrees on the following considerations  likelihood of payment capacity and willingness of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on an obligation in accordance with the terms of the obligation  nature of and provisions of the obligation  protection afforded by and relative position of the obligation in the event of bankruptcy reorganization or other arrangement under the laws of bankruptcy and other laws affecting creditors rights the issue rating definitions are an assessment of default risk but may incorporate an assessment of relative seniority or ultimate recovery in the event of default junior obligations are typically rated lower than senior obligations to reflect the lower priority in bankruptcy as noted above such differentiation may apply when an entity has both senior and subordinated obligations secured and unsecured obligations or operating company and holding company obligations aaa an obligation rated aaa has the highest rating assigned by standard  poors the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong aa an obligation rated aa differs from the highest rated obligations only in small degree the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is very strong a an obligation rated a is somewhat more susceptible to the adverse effects of changes in circumstances and economic conditions than obligations in higher rated categories however the obligors capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is still strong bbb an obligation rated bbb exhibits adequate protection parameters however adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances are more likely to lead to a weakened capacity of the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation obligations rated bb b ccc cc and c are regarded as having significant speculative characteristics bb indicates the least degree of speculation and c the highest while such obligations will likely have some quality and protective characteristics these may be outweighed by large uncertainties or major exposures to adverse conditions bb an obligation rated bb is less vulnerable to nonpayment than other speculative issues however it faces major ongoing uncertainties or exposure to adverse business financial or economic conditions which could lead to the obligors inadequate capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation b an obligation rated b is more vulnerable to nonpayment than obligations rated bb but the obligor currently has the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation adverse business financial or economic conditions will likely impair the obligors capacity or willingness to meet its financial commitment on the obligation ccc an obligation rated ccc is currently vulnerable to nonpayment and is dependent upon favorable business financial and economic conditions for the obligor to meet its financial commitment on the obligation in the event of adverse business financial or economic conditions the obligor is not likely to have the capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation cc an obligation rated cc is currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment c a c rating is assigned to obligations that are currently highly vulnerable to nonpayment obligations that have payment arrearages allowed by the terms of the documents or obligations of an issuer that is the subject of a bankruptcy petition or similar action which have not experienced a payment default among others the c rating may be assigned to subordinated debt preferred stock or other obligations on which cash payments have been suspended in accordance with the instruments terms or when preferred stock is the subject of a distressed exchange offer whereby some or all of the issue is either page  repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other instruments having a total value that is less than par d an obligation rated d is in payment default the d rating category is used when payments on an obligation are not made on the date due even if the applicable grace period has not expired unless standard  poors believes that such payments will be made during such grade period the d rating also will be used upon the filing of a bankruptcy petition or the taking of a similar action if payments on an obligation are jeopardized an obligations rating is lowered to d upon completion of a distressed exchange offer whereby some or all of the issue is either repurchased for an amount of cash or replaced by other instruments having a total value that is less than par plus or minus the ratings from aa to ccc may be modified by the addition of a plus or minus sign to show relative standing within the major rating categories expected ratings are designated on the schedule of investments by an e after the rating code expected ratings are intended to anticipate sps forthcoming rating assignments expected ratings are generated by bloomberg based on sources it considers reliable or established sp rating practices expected ratings exist only until sp assigns a rating to the issue page  first trustr the first trustr combined series  build america bonds portfolio series

participation in leasepurchase obligations of certain states or united states territories the trust is therefore susceptible to general or particular economic political or regulatory factors that may affect issuers of such obligations the following information constitutes only a brief summary of some of the many complex factors that may have an effect the information does not apply to conduit obligations on which the public issuer itself has no financial responsibility this information is derived from official statements of certain national issuers published in connection with their issuance of securities and from other publicly available information and is believed to be accurate no independent verification has been made of any of the following information the timely payment of principal of and interest on certain of the securities may be guaranteed by bond insurance purchased by certain of the issuers or other parties insurance risk certain of the bonds in the trust are insured in the case of insured bonds insurance has been obtained either by the issuer of bonds in the trust by a prior owner of such bonds or by the sponsor prior to the deposit of such bonds in the trust guaranteeing prompt payment of interest and principal when due in respect of such bonds in the trust the premium for any preinsured bond insurance has been paid by such issuer by a prior owner of such bonds or the sponsor and any such policy or policies are noncancellable and will continue in force so long as the bonds so insured are outstanding and the respective preinsured bond insurer remains in business if the provider of an original issuance insurance policy is unable to meet its obligations under such policy or if the rating assigned to the claimspaying ability of any such insurer deteriorates the insurers have no obligation to insure any issue adversely affected by either of the above described events page  in order to be in an insured trust bonds must be insured by an insurer in determining eligibility for insurance insurers have applied their own standards which correspond generally to the standards they normally use in establishing the insurability of new issues of municipal bonds and which are not necessarily the criteria used in the selection of bonds by the sponsor to the extent the standards of the insurers are more restrictive than those of the sponsor the previously stated trust investment criteria have been limited with respect to the bonds this decision is made prior to the date of deposit as debt obligations not eligible for insurance are not deposited in an insured trust thus all of the bonds in the portfolios of the insured trusts are insured by the issuer of the bonds by a prior owner of such bonds or by the sponsor prior to the deposit of such bonds in a trust in the event of nonpayment of interest or principal when due in respect of a bond an insurer shall make such payment after the respective insurer has been notified that such nonpayment has occurred or is threatened but not earlier than the date such payment is due the insurer as regards any payment it may make will succeed to the rights of the trustee in respect thereof all policies issued by the insurers are substantially identical insofar as obligations to an insured trust are concerned each insurer is subject to regulation by the department of insurance in the state in which it is qualified to do business such regulation however is no guarantee that each insurer will be able to perform on its contract of insurance in the event a claim should be made thereunder at some time in the future at the date hereof it is reported that no claims have been submitted or are expected to be submitted to any of the insurers which would materially impair the ability of any such company to meet its commitment pursuant to any contract of bond or portfolio insurance there have been a number of recent developments with respect to ratings actions impacting insurance companies by the rating agencies standard  poors ratings group a division of the mcgrawhill companies inc sp moodys investors service inc moodys and fitch ratings ltd fitch in light of the ongoing nature of ratings actions or announcements by the rating agencies you should consult announcements by the rating agencies the websites of the rating agencies and the websites of the insurers for the then current publicly available information these ratings actions have had a significant impact on the ability of insurers to compete in the financial guarantee business municipal securities certain of the bonds may be general obligations of a governmental entity that are backed by the taxing power of such entity other bonds in the funds may be revenue bonds payable from the income of a specific project or authority and are not supported by the issuers power to levy taxes general obligation bonds are secured by the issuers pledge of its faith credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest revenue bonds on the other hand are payable only from the revenues derived from a particular facility or class of facilities or in some cases from the proceeds of a special excise tax or other specific revenue source there are of course variations in the security of the different bonds in the funds both within a particular classification and between classifications depending on numerous factors a description of certain types of revenue bonds follows healthcare revenue securities certain of the bonds may be healthcare revenue bonds ratings of bonds issued for healthcare facilities are sometimes based on feasibility studies that contain projections of occupancy levels revenues and expenses a facilitys gross receipts and net income available for debt service may be affected by future events and conditions including among other things demand for services the ability of the facility to provide the services required physicians confidence in the facility management capabilities competition with other hospitals efforts by insurers and governmental agencies to limit rates legislation establishing state ratesetting agencies expenses government regulation the cost and possible unavailability of malpractice insurance and the termination or restriction of governmental financial assistance including that associated with medicare medicaid and other similar third party payor programs pursuant to recent federal legislation medicare reimbursements are currently calculated on a prospective basis utilizing a single nationwide schedule of rates prior to such legislation medicare reimbursements were based on the actual costs incurred by the health facility the current legislation may adversely affect reimbursements to hospitals and other facilities for services provided under the medicare program multifamily mortgage revenue securities certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from housing projects for low to moderate income families the ability of such issuers to make debt service payments will be affected by events and conditions affecting financed projects including among other things the achievement and maintenance of sufficient occupancy levels and adequate rental income increases in taxes employment and income conditions prevailing in local labor markets utility costs and other page  operating expenses the managerial ability of project managers changes in laws and governmental regulations the appropriation of subsidies and social and economic trends affecting the localities in which the projects are located the occupancy of housing projects may be adversely affected by high rent levels and income limitations imposed under federal and state programs multifamily mortgage revenue bonds are subject to redemption and call features including extraordinary mandatory redemption features upon prepayment sale or nonorigination of mortgage loans as well as upon the occurrence of other events certain issuers of multifamily housing bonds have considered various ways to redeem bonds they have issued prior to the stated first redemption dates for such bonds in one situation the new york city housing development corporation in reliance on its interpretation of certain language in the indenture under which one of its bond issues was created redeemed all of such issue at par in spite of the fact that such indenture provided that the first optional redemption was to include a premium over par and could not occur prior to  water and sewerage revenue securities certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are derived from the sale of water andor sewerage services water and sewerage bonds are generally payable from user fees problems faced by such issuers include the ability to obtain timely and adequate rate increases population decline resulting in decreased user fees the difficulty of financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations the increasing difficulty of obtaining or discovering new supplies of fresh water the effect of conservation programs and the impact of nogrowth zoning ordinances all of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees utility revenue securities certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers whose revenues are primarily derived from the sale of energy utilities are generally subject to extensive regulation by state utility commissions which among other things establish the rates which may be charged and the appropriate rate of return on an approved asset base the problems faced by such issuers include the difficulty in obtaining approval for timely and adequate rate increases from the governing public utility commission the difficulty in financing large construction programs the limitations on operations and increased costs and delays attributable to environmental considerations increased competition recent reductions in estimates of future demand for electricity in certain areas of the country the difficulty of the capital market in absorbing utility debt the difficulty in obtaining fuel at reasonable prices and the effect of energy conservation all of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees in addition federal state and municipal governmental authorities may from time to time review existing legislation and impose additional regulations governing the licensing construction and operation of nuclear power plants which may adversely affect the ability of the issuers of such bonds to make payments of principal andor interest on such bonds lease obligation revenue securities certain of the bonds may be lease obligations issued for the most part by governmental authorities that have no taxing power or other means of directly raising revenues rather the governmental authorities are financing vehicles created solely for the construction of buildings schools administrative offices convention centers and prisons for example or the purchase of equipment police cars and computer systems for example that will be used by a state or local government the lessee thus these obligations are subject to the ability and willingness of the lessee government to meet its lease rental payments which include debt service on the obligations lease obligations are subject in almost all cases to the annual appropriation risk ie the lessee government is not legally obligated to budget and appropriate for the rental payments beyond the current fiscal year these obligations are also subject to construction and abatement risk in many statesrental obligations cease in the event that delays in building damage destruction or condemnation of the project prevents its use by the lessee in these cases insurance provisions designed to alleviate this risk become important credit factors in the event of default by the lessee government there may be significant legal andor practical difficulties involved in the reletting or sale of the project some of these issues particularly those for equipment purchase contain the socalled substitution safeguard which bars the lessee government in the event it defaults on its rental payments from the purchase or use of similar equipment for a certain period of time this safeguard is designed to insure that the lessee government will appropriate even though it is not legally obligated to do so but its legality remains untested in most if not all states industrial revenue securities certain of the bonds may be industrial revenue bonds irbs including pollution control revenue bonds which are taxable or taxexempt securities issued by states municipalities public authorities or similar entities to finance the cost of acquiring constructing or improving various industrial projects these projects are usually operated by corporate entities issuers are obligated only to pay amounts due on the irbs to the extent that funds are available page  from the unexpended proceeds of the irbs or receipts or revenues of the issuer under an arrangement between the issuer and the corporate operator of a project the arrangement may be in the form of a lease installment sale agreement conditional sale agreement or loan agreement but in each case the payments to the issuer are designed to be sufficient to meet the payments of amounts due on the irbs regardless of the structure payment of irbs is solely dependent upon the creditworthiness of the corporate operator of the project or corporate guarantor corporate operators or guarantors may be affected by many factors which may have an adverse impact on the credit quality of the particular company or industry these include cyclicality of revenues and earnings regulatory and environmental restrictions litigation resulting from accidents or environmentallycaused illnesses extensive competition and financial deterioration resulting from a complete restructuring pursuant to a leveraged buyout takeover or otherwise such a restructuring may result in the operator of a project becoming highly leveraged which may impact on such operators creditworthiness which in turn would have an adverse impact on the rating andor market value of such bonds further the possibility of such a restructuring may have an adverse impact on the market for and consequently the value of such bonds even though no actual takeover or other action is ever contemplated or affected the irbs in a fund may be subject to special or extraordinary redemption provisions which may provide for redemption at par or with respect to original issue discount bonds at issue price plus the amount of original issue discount accreted to the redemption date plus if applicable a premium the sponsor cannot predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of irbs or other bonds in the funds prior to the stated maturity of such bonds transportation facility revenue securities certain of the bonds may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the ownership and operation of facilities such as airports bridges turnpikes port authorities convention centers and arenas the major portion of an airports gross operating income is generally derived from fees received from signatory airlines pursuant to use agreements which consist of annual payments for leases occupancy of certain terminal space and service fees airport operating income may therefore be affected by the ability of the airlines to meet their obligations under the use agreements the air transport industry is experiencing significant variations in earnings and traffic due to increased competition excess capacity increased costs deregulation traffic constraints and other factors and several airlines are experiencing severe financial difficulties the sponsor cannot predict what effect these industry conditions may have on airport revenues which are dependent for payment on the financial condition of the airlines and their usage of the particular airport facility similarly payment on bonds related to other facilities is dependent on revenues from the projects such as user fees from ports tolls on turnpikes and bridges and rents from buildings therefore payment may be adversely affected by reduction in revenues due to such factors as increased cost of maintenance decreased use of a facility lower cost of alternative modes of transportation scarcity of fuel and reduction or loss of rents education revenue securities certain of the bonds may be obligations of issuers which are or which govern the operation of schools colleges and universities and whose revenues are derived mainly from ad valorem taxes or for higher education systems from tuition dormitory revenues grants and endowments general problems relating to school bonds include litigation contesting the state constitutionality of financing public education in part from ad valorem taxes thereby creating a disparity in educational funds available to schools in wealthy areas and schools in poor areas litigation or legislation on this issue may affect the sources of funds available for the payment of school bonds in the trusts general problems relating to college and university obligations would include the prospect of a declining percentage of the population consisting of college age individuals possible inability to raise tuitions and fees sufficiently to cover increased operating costs the uncertainty of continued receipt of federal grants and state funding and new government legislation or regulations which may adversely affect the revenues or costs of such issuers all of such issuers have been experiencing certain of these problems in varying degrees resource recovery facility revenue securities certain of the bonds may be obligations which are payable from and secured by revenues derived from the operation of resource recovery facilities resource recovery facilities are designed to process solid waste generate steam and convert steam to electricity resource recovery bonds may be subject to extraordinary optional redemption at par upon the occurrence of certain circumstances including but not limited to destruction or condemnation of a project contracts relating to a project becoming void unenforceable or impossible to perform changes in the economic availability of raw materials operating supplies or facilities necessary for the operation of a project or technological or other unavoidable changes adversely affecting the operation of a project administrative or judicial actions which render contracts relating to the projects void unenforceable or impossible to perform or impose unreasonable burdens or excessive liabilities the sponsor cannot page  predict the causes or likelihood of the redemption of resource recovery bonds in the funds prior to the stated maturity of the securities discount securities certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a market discount from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the discount bonds at the time they were purchased and deposited in the funds were lower than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase the market discount of previously issued bonds will become greater and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds decline the market discount of previously issued bonds will be reduced other things being equal investors should also note that the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will increase in value faster than bonds purchased at a market premium if interest rates decrease conversely if interest rates increase the value of bonds purchased at a market discount will decrease faster than bonds purchased at a market premium in addition if interest rates rise the prepayment risk of higher yielding premium bonds and the prepayment benefit for lower yielding discount bonds will be reduced market discount attributable to interest changes does not indicate a lack of market confidence in the issue neither the sponsor nor the trustee shall be liable in any way for any default failure or defect in any of the bonds original issue discount securities certain of the bonds are considered original issue discount bonds under current law the original issue discount which is the difference between the stated redemption price at maturity and the issue price of the bonds is deemed to accrue on a daily basis and the accrued portion is treated as taxable interest income for federal income tax purposes on sale or redemption any gain realized that is in excess of the earned portion of original issue discount will be taxable as capital gain unless the gain is attributable to market discount in which case the accretion of market discount is taxable as ordinary income the current value of an original issue discount bond reflects the present value of its stated redemption price at maturity the market value tends to increase in greater increments as the bonds approach maturity when issued securities when as and if issued bonds are bonds that trade before they are actually issued this means that the sponsor can only deliver them to the trust when the bonds are actually issued delivery of these securities may be delayed or may not occur interest on these securities does not begin accruing to the trust until the sponsor delivers them to the trust you may have to adjust your tax basis if the sponsor delivers any of these securities after their expected delivery date any adjustment would reflect interest that accrued between the time you purchased your units and the delivery of the securities to the trust this could lower your first year estimated current return in addition you may experience gains or losses on these securities from the time you purchase units even though the trust has not received them zero coupon securities zero coupon bonds which include bonds known as multiplier bonds money multiplier bonds capital appreciation bonds capital accumulator bonds compound interest bonds and money discount maturity payment bonds do not provide for the payment of any current interest and generally provide for payment at maturity at face value unless sooner sold or redeemed zero coupon bonds may be subject to more price volatility than conventional bonds while some types of zero coupon bonds such as multipliers and capital appreciation bonds define par as the initial offering price rather than the maturity value they share the basic zero coupon bond features of  not paying interest on a semiannual basis and  providing for the reinvestment of the bonds semiannual earnings at the bonds stated yield to maturity while zero coupon bonds are frequently marketed on the basis that their fixed rate of return minimizes reinvestment risk this benefit can be negated in large part by weak call protection ie a bonds provision for redemption at only a modest premium over the accreted value of the bond premium securities certain of the bonds may have been acquired at a market premium from par value at maturity the coupon interest rates on the premium bonds at the time they were purchased by the fund were higher than the current market interest rates for newly issued bonds of comparable rating and type if such interest rates for newly issued and otherwise comparable bonds decrease the market premium of previously issued bonds will be increased and if such interest rates for newly issued comparable bonds increase the market premium of previously issued bonds will be reduced other things being equal the current returns of bonds trading at a market premium are initially higher than the current returns of comparable bonds of a similar type issued at currently prevailing interest rates because premium bonds tend to decrease in market value as they approach maturity when the face amount becomes payable because part of the purchase price is thus returned not at maturity but through current income payments early redemption of a premium bond at par or early prepayments of principal will result in a reduction in yield redemption pursuant to call provisions generally will and redemption pursuant to sinking fund provisions may occur at page  times when the redeemed bonds have an offering side valuation which represents a premium over par or for original issue discount bonds a premium over the accreted value special tax securities certain of the bonds may be special tax bonds payable from and secured by the revenues derived by a municipality from a particular tax examples of special taxes are a tax on the rental of a hotel room on the purchase of food and beverages on the purchase of fuel on the rental of automobiles or on the consumption of liquor special tax bonds are not secured by the general tax revenues of the municipality and they do not represent general obligations of the municipality payment on special tax bonds may be adversely affected by a reduction in revenues realized from the underlying special tax also should spending on the particular goods or services that are subject to the special tax decline the municipality may be under no obligation to increase the rate of the special tax to ensure that sufficient revenues are raised from the shrinking taxable base tax allocation securities certain of the bonds may be tax allocation bonds tax allocation bonds are typically secured by incremental tax revenues collected on property within the areas where redevelopment projects financed by bond proceeds are located bond payments are expected to be made from projected increases in tax revenues derived from higher assessed values of property resulting from development in the particular project area and not from an increase in tax rates special risk considerations include variations in taxable values of property in the project area successful appeals by property owners of assessed valuations substantial delinquencies in the payment of property taxes or imposition of any constitutional or legislative property tax rate decrease page
