north soon near term resistance is between  which is within striking distance intermediate resistance is around  and if breached would signal much higher prices afterwards fundamentals store  was just opened and the next earnings report will be in about  weeks good news here would certainly trigger a rally that should enable dlth to breach these resistance levels and be positioned to challenge old highs especially if the earnings provide a positive surprisemorereplyreplies aavadlth has just seen the last of the selling looks like a potential push higher is in store check out awesomestocks its a pretty reliable service of course you have to do your own due diligence but they generally point you in the right directionreplyeeddypgilall american retailer that has control over its productreplyeeddypgil then upreplyjjoedlth doing a good job trying to fill the gap most likely with back and fills along the way but near term resistance has been broken and the short term target is now  to  which could happen quickly julyaugust in order to test intermediate resistance around  or so we need to get a positive earnings report plus continued bullishness in the general market positive attitudes towards retail due to the target news will also help with overall sentimentreplyeeddypgilclosest to ll bean as you can get in publicly traded company  people still like to touch fabric before buyingreplyjjoeheres an interesting thought and it might be premature since in the last quarter sga were higher than expected due to new store openings and related expenses what if dlth doesnt open as many new stores in this current quarter top line sales has not disappointed at all in fact generally beats consensus on a regular basis if they dont open up the forecasted number of new stores this quarter then the bottom line wont be adversely affected as in the last quarter and might surprise nicely on the upside of course bulls want more stores to open as it is a sign their strategy is working and they are taking advantage of these new market opportunities but it has also been a drag on the bottom line if they can not find the locations they want in these new markets fast enough and the build out takes a little longer it will just mean less expenses more profits with the continued growth on the top line could be an interesting surprise in the next quarterly report lets watch to see just how many new stores they open this quarter i havent heard of a new opening in quite a while now which has spawned my thoughts heremorereplyreplies jjimish today anyone know why just the target news or something elsereplyreplies jjoedlth now attempting to fill the gap that was created during the earnings miss might take some time to do so successfully and if accomplished next area of resistance is  range might need to wait for next earnings release in september to have reason to rally into this resistance area or breach it with a positive report if there is more negative news on retail this could cause resistance to the recovery if another earnings miss occurs new lows would likely result as well management guidance for the balance of the year was fairly positive and optimistic if the earnings meets or exceeds expectations breaking above resistance is likelymorereplyeeddypgilgreat one to buy shares in leading up to winterreplyeeddypgila great companyreplymmega

approximately  million or approximately  million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full based on the initial public offering price of  per share and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses we intend to make a final distribution to shareholders who were shareholders immediately prior to this offering including some of our directors and officers relating to the termination of our “s” corporation status in an amount equal to  of our cumulative undistributed taxable income from the date of our formation through november   which we currently estimate to be  million the final “s” corporation distribution will include an amount of income based on our expected results of operations for the full  calendar year which is our  tax year prorated from january   through the date of our conversion to a “c” corporation unless otherwise required by law this prorated amount may be increased based on our actual results of operations for the  calendar year we intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under a shortterm note in the aggregate principal amount of  million which we intend to use to fund part of this final distribution the shortterm note will bear interest at the one month london interbank offered rate plus  per annum which was  of the date of this prospectus and will be due and payable upon the receipt of proceeds from this offering we intend to fund the balance of this final distribution with our cash on hand our revolving line of credit or the net proceeds from this offering we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay borrowings under our revolving line of credit used to fund this balance which would be  million based on the total estimated distribution of  million the revolving line of credit bears interest at the same rate as the shortterm note described above and matures in july  we estimate net proceeds in excess of the final “s” corporation distribution to be approximately  million after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us we intend to use such excess proceeds to fund growth initiatives and other general corporate purposes including approximately  million to  million to fund new retail store expansion and approximately  million to  million to fund infrastructure expenditures including a new order management system asset management system assortment planning system and ecommerce platform and office and distribution facilities our expected uses of net proceeds from this offering are based on our present plans objectives and business condition we have not specifically determined the timing of these expenditures and our management will have discretion over when these proceeds are used the amounts and timing of our actual use of net proceeds will vary depending on a number of factors including our cash flow from operations the number of retail stores we open as part of our planned future retail store expansion the timing of opening these new retail stores the cost and payback period of these new retail stores and the systems information technology and operational infrastructure necessary to support these new retail stores we expect it will take approximately  million to  million in capital expenditures and starting inventory to open a new retail store if we open a large number of stores relatively close in time or if new retail stores have a higher opening cost or a longer payback period than our existing retail stores our cash flow from operations may not be sufficient to support these openings and we may need to use the net proceeds from this offering more quickly to support this growth and the continuing operations of these new retail stores subject to the factors above we may determine to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to fund additional systems information technology operational infrastructure and facilities to support our direct business rather than investing in retail store expansion we operate primarily in the apparel footwear and accessories industry which is highly competitive we compete with a diverse group of directtoconsumer companies and retailers including men’s and women’s specialty apparel chains department stores outdoor specialty stores apparel catalog

our core competencies of product development storytelling and serving customers duluth trading was founded in  when two brothers in the home construction industry were tired of dragging tools from job to job using discarded fivegallon drywall compound buckets the two brothers were never satisfied with the status quo and believed “there’s gotta be a better way” so they invented the bucket boss®—a ruggedly durable canvas tool organizer that fits around a drywall bucket and transformed the way construction workers organized their tools capitalizing on their initial success these brothers launched a catalog that later became known as duluth trading company under the initial philosophy of “job tough job smart” this catalog was dedicated to improving and expanding on existing methods of tool storage organization and transport in december  gempler’s inc an agricultural and horticultural supply catalog business founded and owned by stephen l schlecht acquired duluth trading and brought the two mail order companies together both catalogs had customers who worked outside and embraced the spirit of handson selfreliant americans in february  the gempler’s catalog business was sold to ww grainger nysegww and proceeds from that sale have been used to fund the growth of duluth trading with that transaction gempler’s inc changed its corporate name to duluth holdings inc from what began as an idea aimed at those working in the building trades duluth trading has become a widely recognized brand and proprietary line of innovative and functional apparel and gear we have created strong brand awareness built a loyal customer base and generated robust net sales momentum we have done so by sticking to our roots of “there’s gotta be a better way” and through our relentless focus on
