washington post reported that the power company was planning to change the route of one  kv transmission line to appease critics in northern virginia from a route that would cut through protected forest and farmland to a southern route that would bypass nature preserves and civil war sites by running adjacent to existing power lines however us congressional representative frank wolf r  va and governor tim kaine d remained opposed to the line saying that there was no real need and that dominion was trying to bring cheap electricity from the midwest dominion contested saying that the line would bring needed electricity to growing northern virginia the proposal was accepted by the state corporation commission scc on october   on february   the scc approved a controversial proposal for a  kv dominion virginia transmission line that would travel above ground for  miles  km along a wooded portion of the washington  old dominion railroad trail between leesburg and clarks gap in loudoun county which dominion again claimed was necessary for power reliability less than three weeks later on march  and march   the senate and the house of delegates of the virginia general assembly unanimously passed emergency legislation that ordered the scc to approve the underground construction of the line along that section of the trail as part of a fourpart statewide pilot program for the

the plants carbon dioxide emissions are currently projected to be  million tons per year high levels of mercury emitted from the plant which is controlled by activated carbon injection to reduce the
