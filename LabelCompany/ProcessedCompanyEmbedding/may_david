reviews and synthesizes the varying definitions of product quality arising from philosophy economics marketing and operations management he then goes on to build an eight­dimensional framework to elaborate on these definitions using this framework he addresses the empirical relationships between quality and variables such as price advertising market share cost and profitability advertisement product quality is rapidly becoming an important competitive issue the superior reliability of many japanese products has sparked considerable soulsearching among american managers in addition several surveys have voiced consumers dissatisfaction with the existing levels of quality and service of the products they buy in a recent study of the business units of major north american companies managers ranked “producing to high quality standards” as their chief current concern despite the interest of managers the academic literature on quality has not been reviewed extensively the problem is one of coverage scholars in four disciplines — philosophy economics marketing and operations management — have considered the subject but each group has viewed it from a different vantage point philosophy has focused on definitional issues economics on profit maximization and market equilibrium marketing on the determinants of buying behavior and customer satisfaction and operations management on engineering practices and manufacturing control the result has been a host of competing perspectives each based on a different analytical framework and each employing its own terminology at the same time a number of common themes are apparent all of them have important management implications on the conceptual front each discipline has wrestled with the following questions is quality objective or subjective is it timeless or socially determined empirically interest has focused on the correlates of quality what for example is the connection between quality and price between quality and advertising between quality and cost between quality and market share more generally do quality improvements lead to higher or lower profits five approaches to defining quality five major approaches to the definition of quality can be identified  the transcendent approach of philosophy  the productbased approach of economics  the userbased approach of economics marketing and operations management and  the manufacturingbased and  valuebased approaches of operations management table  presents representative examples of each approach table  five definitions of quality i transcendent

encyclopedia jump to navigation search eight dimensions of product quality management can be used at a strategic level to analyze quality characteristics the concept was defined by david a garvin some of the dimensions are mutually reinforcing whereas others are not—improvement in one may be at the expense of others understanding the tradeoffs desired by customers among these dimensions can help build a competitive advantage garvins eight dimensions can be summarized as follows performance performance refers to a products primary operating characteristics this dimension of quality involves measurable attributes brands can usually be ranked objectively on individual aspects of performance features features are additional characteristics that enhance the appeal of the product or service to the user reliability reliability is the likelihood that a product will not fail within a specific time period this is a key element for users who need the product to work without fail conformance conformance is the precision with which the product or service meets the specified standards durability durability measures the length of a product’s life when the product can be repaired estimating durability is more complicated the item will be used until it is no longer economical to operate it this happens when the repair rate and the associated costs increase significantly serviceability serviceability is the speed with which the product can be put into service when it breaks down as well as the competence and the behavior of the serviceperson aesthetics aesthetics is the subjective dimension indicating the kind of response a user has to a product it represents the individual’s personal preference perceived quality perceived quality is the quality attributed to a good or service based on indirect measures contents  performance  features  reliability  conformance  durability  serviceability  aesthetics or style  quality in japanese culture  perceived quality  see also  references performanceedit performance refers to a products primary operating characteristics this dimension of quality involves measurable attributes so brands can usually be ranked objectively on individual aspects of performance overall performance rankings however are more difficult to develop especially when they involve benefits that not every consumer needs performance is often a source of contention between customers and suppliers particularly when deliverables are not adequately defined within specifications the performance of a product often influences the profitability or reputation of the enduser as such many contracts or specifications include damages related to inadequate performance the question of whether performance differences are quality differences may depend on circumstantial preferencesbut preferences based on functional requirements not taste some performance standards are based on subjective preferences but the preferences are so universal that they have the force of an objective standard featuresedit features are additional characteristics that enhance the appeal of the product or service to the user similar thinking can be applied to features a second dimensions of quality that is often a secondary aspects of performance features are the bells and whistles of products and services those characteristics that supplement their basic functioning examples include free drinks on a plane permanentpress cycles on a washing machine and automatic tuners on a color television set the line separating primary performance characteristics from secondary features is often difficult to draw reliabilityedit reliability is the likelihood that a product will not fail within a specific time period this is a key element for users who need the product to work without fail this dimension reflects the probability of a product malfunctioning or failing within a specified time period among the most common measures of reliability are the mean time to first failure the mean time between failures and the failure rate per unit time because these measures require a product to be in use for a specified period they are more relevant to durable goods than to products and services that are consumed instantly reliability normally becomes more important to consumers as downtime and maintenance become more expensive farmers for example are especially sensitive to downtime during the short harvest season reliable equipment can mean the difference between a good year and spoiled crops but consumers on other markets are more attuned than ever to product reliability too computers and copying machines certainly compare on this basis reliability may be closely related to performance for instance a product specification may define parameters for uptime or acceptable failure rates reliability is a major contributor to brand or company image and is considered a fundamental dimension of quality by most endusers ie recent market research shows that especially for women reliability has become an automobiles most desired attribute conformanceedit the outcome of two example processes to show the meaning of the two approaches to conformance the dimension of conformance depicts to what extent a product’s design and operating characteristics meet established standards this dimension owes the most to the traditional approaches to quality pioneered by experts like juran all products and services involve specifications of some sort when products are developed these specifications are set and a target is set for instance the materials used or the dimension of the product not only the target but also the tolerance the range of permitted deviation from the target is defined one problem with this approach is that there is little interest in whether the specifications have been met exactly as long as the tolerance limits are met on the one hand this can lead to the socalled “tolerance stackup” when two or more parts are to be fit together the size of their tolerances often determine how well they will match should one part fall at a lower limit of its specification and a matching part at its upper limit a tight fit is unlikely the link is likely to wear more quickly than one made from parts whose dimensions have been centered more exactly this problem can be addressed by taking a different approach to measuring quality instead of measuring a simple conformance to specifications the degree to which parts or products diverge from the ideal target is measured using this approach process  see picture is better even though some items fall beyond specification limits the traditional approach would have favoured process  because it produces more items within the specification limit it was demonstrated that the problem of “tolerance stackup” is worse when the dimensions of parts are more distant from the target than when they cluster around it even if some parts fall outside the tolerance this approach requires a fresh look at the common process quality factor of defect rate to take into account the fact that two parts may each pass the tolerance test separately but be unusable when the attempt is made to join them together in service businesses measures of conformance normally focus on accuracy and timeliness and include counts of processing errors unanticipated delays and other frequent mistakes durabilityedit durability measures the length of a product’s life when the product can be repaired estimating durability is more complicated the item will be used until it is no longer economical to operate it this happens when the repair rate and the associated costs increase significantly technically durability can be defined as the amount of use one gets from a product before it deteriorates after so many hours of use the filament of a light bulb burns up and the bulb must be replaced repair is impossible economists call such products onehoss shays oliver wendel holmes poem in other cases consumers must weigh the expected cost in both dollars and personal inconvenience of future repairs against the investment and operating expenses of a newer more reliable model durability then may be defined as the amount of use one gets from a product before it breaks down and replacement is preferable to continued repair this approach to durability has two important implications first it suggests that durability and reliability are closely linked a product that often fails is likely to be scrapped earlier than one that is more reliable repair costs will be correspondingly higher and the purchase of a competitive brand will look that much more desirable second this approach implies that durability figures should be interpreted with care an increase in product life may not be the result of technical improvements or the use of longerlived materials rather the underlying economic environment simply may have changed serviceabilityedit serviceability involves the consumers ease of obtaining repair service example access to service centers andor ease of selfservice the responsiveness of service personnelexample ease of getting an appointment willingness of repair personnel to listen to the customer and the reliability of service example whether the service is performed right the first time competence and ease of repair is the speed with which the product can be put into service when it breaks down as well as the competence and the behavior of the service personnel consumers are concerned not only about a product breaking down but also about the time before service is restored the timeliness with which service appointment are kept the nature of dealings with service personnel and the frequency with which service calls or repairs fail to correct outstanding problems in those cases where problems are not immediately resolved and complaints are filed a companys complaint handling procedures are also likely to affect customers ultimate evaluation of product and service quality some of these variables reflect differing personal standards of acceptable service others can be measured quite objectively customers may remain dissatisfied even after completion of repairs how these complaints are handled is important to a companys reputation for quality and service eventually profitability is likely to be affected as well companies differ widely in their approaches to complaint handling and in the importance they attach to this element of serviceability some do their best to resolve complaints others use legal gimmicks the silent treatment and similar ploys to rebuff dissatisfied customers for example recently general electric procter  gamble and other companies have sought to preempt consumer dissatisfaction by installing tollfree telephone hot lines to their customer relations departments important attributes for serviceability dimension are service warranty parts warranty parts availability number of reasonable distance to dealer service centers distance to service parts centerdealer distance to service parts center individual length of wait for service appointment schedule of preventive maintenance employees listen to customers information regarding repairs courteous service centers repaired correctly first time service time relative to other dealers warranty claims handled without argument average repair costyear extended warranty underestimation of service cost and provision of loan car aesthetics or styleedit the aesthetic properties of a product contribute to the identity of a company or a brand faults or defects in a product that diminish its aesthetic properties even those that do not reduce or alter other dimensions of quality are often cause for rejection aesthetics refers to how the product looks feels sounds tastes or smells it is clearly a matter of personal judgement and a reflection of individual preference nevertheless there appear to be some patterns in consumers rankings of products on the basis of taste a recent study of quality in  food categories for example found that high quality was most often associated with attributes such as rich and full flavor tastes natural tastes fresh good aroma appetizing lookscitation needed aesthetics also refers to the outside feel of the product the aesthetics dimension differs from subjective criteria pertaining to performance in that aesthetic choices are not nearly universal not all people prefer rich and full flavor or even agree on what that means companies therefore have to search for a niche on this dimension of quality it is impossible to please everyone quality in japanese cultureedit in japanese culture there are two types of quality atarimae hinshitsu and miryokuteki hinshitsu atarimae hinshitsu　（たり） – the idea that things will work as they are supposed to eg a pen will write the functional requirement actually for example a wall or flooring in a house have functional parts in the house as a product when the functionality is met the atarimae quality requirement is met miryokuteki hinshitsu （）– the idea that things should have an aesthetic quality which is different from atarimae hinshitsu eg a pen will write in a way that is pleasing to the writer and leave behind ink that is pleasing to the reader the floor and wall example can be expanded to include the color texture shine polish etc which are the miryokuteki aspects such aspects comprise a very important part of the quality and add value to the product in the design of goods or services atarimae hinshitsu and miryokuteki hinshitsu together ensure that a creation will both work to customers expectations and also be desirable to have perceived qualityedit perception is not always reality consumers do not always have complete information about a products or services attributes indirect measures may be their only basis for comparing brands a products durability for example can seldom be observed directly it usually must be inferred from various tangible and intangible aspects of the product in such circumstances images advertising and brand names inferences about quality rather than the reality itself can be critical for this reason both honda which makes cars in marysville ohio and sony which builds color televisions in san diego have been reluctant to publicize that their products are made in america reputation is the primary stuff of perceived quality its power comes from an unstated analogy that the quality of products today is similar to the quality of products of yesterday or the quality of goods in a new product line is similar to the quality of a companys established products see alsoedit quality quality management quality control eight

period this is a key element for users who need the product to work without fail this dimension reflects the probability of a product malfunctioning or failing within a specified time period among the most common measures of reliability are the mean time to first failure the mean time between failures and the failure rate per unit time because these measures require a product to be in use for a specified period they are more relevant to durable goods than to products and services that are consumed instantly reliability normally becomes more important to consumers as downtime and maintenance become more expensive farmers for example are especially sensitive to downtime during the short harvest season reliable equipment can mean the difference between a good year and spoiled crops but consumers on other markets are more attuned than ever to product reliability too computers and copying machines certainly compare on this basis reliability may be closely related to performance for instance a product specification may define parameters for uptime or acceptable failure rates reliability is a major contributor to brand or company image and is considered a fundamental dimension of quality by most endusers ie recent market research shows that especially for women reliability has become an automobiles most desired attribute conformanceedit the outcome of two example processes to show the meaning of the two approaches to conformance the dimension of conformance depicts to what extent a product’s design and operating characteristics meet established standards this dimension owes the most to the traditional approaches to quality pioneered by experts like juran all products and services involve specifications of some sort when products are developed these specifications are set and a target is set for instance the materials used or the dimension of the product not only the target but also the tolerance the range of permitted deviation from the target is defined one problem with this approach is that there is little interest in whether the specifications have been met exactly as long as the tolerance limits are met on the one hand this can lead to the socalled “tolerance stackup” when two or more parts are to be fit together the size of their tolerances often determine how well they will match should one part fall at a lower limit of its specification and a matching part at its upper limit a tight fit is unlikely the link is likely to wear more quickly than one made from parts whose dimensions have been centered more exactly this problem can be addressed by taking a different approach to measuring quality instead of measuring a simple conformance to specifications the degree to which parts or products diverge from the ideal target is measured using this approach process  see picture is better even though some items fall beyond specification limits the traditional approach would have favoured process  because it produces more items within the specification limit it was demonstrated that the problem of “tolerance stackup” is worse when the dimensions of parts are more distant from the target than when they cluster around it even if some parts fall outside the tolerance this approach requires a fresh look at the common process quality factor of defect rate to take into account the fact that two parts may each pass the tolerance test separately but be unusable when the attempt is made to join them together in service businesses measures of conformance normally focus on accuracy and timeliness and include counts of processing errors unanticipated delays and other frequent mistakes durabilityedit durability measures the length of a product’s life when the product can be repaired estimating durability is more complicated the item will be used until it is no longer economical to operate it this happens when the repair rate and the associated costs increase significantly technically durability can be defined as the amount of use one gets from a product before it deteriorates after so many hours of use the filament of a light bulb burns up and the bulb must be replaced repair is impossible economists call such products onehoss shays oliver wendel holmes poem in other cases consumers must weigh the expected cost in both dollars and personal inconvenience of future repairs against the investment and operating expenses of a newer more reliable model durability then may be defined as the amount of use one gets from a product before it breaks down and replacement is preferable to continued repair this approach to durability has two important implications first it suggests that durability and reliability are closely linked a product that often fails is likely to be scrapped earlier than one that is more reliable repair costs will be correspondingly higher and the purchase of a competitive brand will look that much more desirable second this approach implies that durability figures should be interpreted with care an increase in product life may not be the result of technical improvements or the use of longerlived materials rather the underlying economic environment simply may have changed

determine how well they will match should one part fall at a lower limit of its specification and a matching part at its upper limit a tight fit is unlikely the link is likely to wear more quickly than one made from parts whose dimensions have been centered more exactly this problem can be addressed by taking a different approach to measuring quality instead of measuring a simple conformance to specifications the degree to which parts or products diverge from the ideal target is measured using this approach process  see picture is better even though some items fall beyond specification limits the traditional approach would have favoured process  because it produces more items within the specification limit it was demonstrated that the problem of “tolerance stackup” is worse when the dimensions of parts are more distant from the target than when they cluster around it even if some parts fall outside the tolerance this approach requires a fresh look at the common process quality

can usually be ranked objectively on individual aspects of performance overall performance rankings however are more difficult to develop especially when they involve benefits that not every consumer needs performance is often a source of contention between customers and suppliers particularly when deliverables are not adequately defined within specifications the performance of a product often influences the profitability or reputation of the enduser as such many contracts or specifications include damages related to inadequate performance the question of whether performance differences are quality differences may depend on circumstantial preferencesbut preferences based on functional requirements not taste some performance standards are based on subjective preferences but the preferences are so universal that they have the force of an objective standard featuresedit features are additional characteristics that enhance the appeal of the product or service to the user similar thinking can be applied to features a second dimensions of quality that is often a secondary aspects of performance features are the bells and whistles of products and services those characteristics that supplement their basic functioning examples include free drinks on a plane permanentpress cycles on a washing machine and automatic tuners on a color television set the line separating primary performance characteristics from secondary features is often difficult to draw reliabilityedit reliability is the likelihood that a product will not fail within a specific time period this is a key element for users who need the product to work without fail this dimension reflects the probability of a product malfunctioning or failing within a specified time period among the most common measures of reliability are the mean time to first failure the mean time between failures and the failure rate per unit time because these measures require a product to be in use for a specified period they are more relevant to durable goods than to products and services that are consumed instantly reliability normally becomes more important to consumers as downtime and maintenance become more expensive farmers for example are especially sensitive to downtime during the short harvest season reliable equipment can mean the difference between a good year and spoiled crops but consumers on other markets are more attuned than ever to product reliability too computers and copying machines certainly compare on this basis reliability may be closely related to performance for instance a product specification may define parameters for uptime or acceptable failure rates reliability is a major contributor to brand or company image and is considered a fundamental dimension of quality by most endusers ie recent market research shows that especially for women reliability has become an automobiles most desired attribute conformanceedit the outcome of two example processes to show the meaning of the two approaches to conformance the dimension of conformance depicts to what extent a product’s design and operating characteristics meet established standards this dimension

socratic dialogue home  econlog  archives  permanent link and comments i was on an email discussion this morning with some freemarket economists and some economically literate fans of free markets one of them surprised me with this statement i always tell my students the henry ford  a day story in  a great example of management looking out for labor and a win win formula for success it stopped marxisms two big arguments that capitalists exploit workers and that capitalism alienates workers forcing them to produce products they cant afford themselves but when ford overnight raised workers pay to  a day it was the first big example of sharing the profits  and ford workers could buy model ts for the first time thus destroying the marxist argument of alienation theres nothing necessarily incorrect in his actual statement above but there is something misleading it may well be the case that ford workers could buy model ts for the first time because of the increased wages but he makes it sound as if that was henry fords motive thats unlikely to have been fords motive because the number of ford workers was probably well under  of the number of potential buyers would it really make sense to pay more than necessary to get workers so that your number of potential buyers can increase slightly especially when the downside is that with the higher wages come higher costs and your larger potential market is likely to shrink i think it was a fortunate accident that fords workers were able to buy fords the reason ive read for fords success is that ford was plagued with high turnover and high absenteeism and paying above market reduced turnover and absenteeism substantially one can imagine this being particularly important in a relatively new industry and certainly an industry with a relatively new production methodthe assembly linebecause there was probably a bigger gain than normal from keeping people on the job who gradually got very good at it if you still think the pay them more so they can buy the product argument makes sense then consider what henry hazlitt wrote on this issue in his  classic economics in one lesson some sponsors of the theory seem to imply that the workers in each industry should receive enough to buy back the particular product they make but they surely cannot mean that the makers of cheap dresses should get enough to buy back cheap dresses and the makers of mink coats enough to buy back mink coats or that the men in the ford plant should receive enough to buy fords and the men in the cadillac plant enough to buy cadillacs so a question for the person i quoted above based on hazlitts quote is this were cadillac workers more alienated than ford workers a few years ago i used hazlitt as a supplement to my main text and we covered this chapter remember that my students are largely military officers and disproportionately naval officers one us navy student had a great example to make hazlitts point he pointed out its not a good idea to pay workers making aircraft carriers high enough wages that each of them could buy an aircraft carrier heres an earlier discussion of the issue comments and sharing categories business economics  labor market email comments  to date latest comment michael makovi writes also the buy back the product argument is literally incoherent wages enough to buy the product over what time period should a person who makes a car be paid enough to buy a new car every year every day every century in fact everyone is paid enough to buy the product if you just assume a sufficiently long time horizon every worker who contributes to building an aircraft carrier is paid enough to buy an aircraft carrier if he just works long enough which may be a thousand years but whos counting not the socialists they literally dont consider this issue as far as i know posted july    pm garrett writes boeing workers should make enough to buy airliners posted july    pm fralupo writes michael makovi i think youre not considering consumer behavior consumers have their own preferences and these change with income a person earning half your wage isnt going to match your consumption habits just at half the speed even if they were your clone intuitively someone living paychecktopaycheck may not be willing to wipe out their savings in exchange for a machine that adds costs to their lives and has a declining resale value in terms used in economics a people earning low wages usually have higher discount rates than people earning high wages and so purchases of expensive durable goods will seem more attractive to people as their wages rise b going back to first year economics a consumers indifference curve for automobiles may intersect with their budget constraint at q and this is less likely the more income someone has posted july    pm hunter writes the ford example is one that drives me crazy as dr henderson noted the wage increase was to retain experienced workers this helped keep the prices low enough that the workers who didnt work for ford were able to buy the product posted july    pm michael makovi writes fralupo i think adding consumer preferences just makes socialism even worse for example some socialists will advocate worker control of the firm the problem is many workers dont want to control the firm theyd prefer to make certain guaranteed wages rather than uncertain varying profits and losses whether the firm makes a profit or a loss this firm theyd rather just receive their salary and as many professors can attest having to serve on a governing committee can be awfully bothersome many workers would probably prefer to avoid the burden of having to help run the company so i think theres a general problem with socialism viz that many consumers dont want what socialists think they ought to want posted july    pm john hare writes fralupo a people earning low wages usually have higher discount rates than people earning high wages and so purchases of expensive durable goods will seem more attractive to people as their wages rise i would argue that low wage people should do as you say an unfortunate number of them live paycheck to paycheck due to poor choices rent to own big screen tv instead of cash for a smaller or used unit for example in my case i bought a silverado back when making  an hour stupid and still embarrassing if i think about it  posted july    pm mr econotarian writes we should keep in mind that the ford assembly line was very different from traditional handcrafted carriage manufacture he needed workers who were very ontheball because a small screwup could stop the line and it is likely that assembly line work though more efficient was probably very boring to do one small task hundreds of times per day compared with doing a wider range of handcrafting at a more relaxed pace ford also had a kind of secret service who investigated the moral character of his employees he paid a lot but he expected a lot as well i believe ford did sell is  day as some kind of benificence to his employees but it was only the improved productivity of the assembly line that could allow it and the stringent requirements of the assembly line also demanded it to bring in the best workers posted july    pm paul zrimsek writes my favorite argument against the pay them more so they can buy the product version is even in the bestcase scenario where every penny of the wage increase goes towards a model t all ford has done is find an indirect method of giving away cars posted july    pm matt writes tim worstall had a bit of fun with this a few years back car production in the year before the pay rise was  in the year of it  as we can see above the total labour establishment was only  anyway even if all of his workers bought a car every year it wasnt going to make any but a marginal difference to the sales of the firm we can go further too as weve seen the rise in the daily wage was from  to  including the bonuses etc say  working days in the year and  workers and we get a rise in the pay bill of   million over the year a model t cost between  and  depends on which year were talking about  cars sold at that price gives us   million to   million in income to the company it should be obvious that paying the workforce an extra  million so that they can then buy  millions worth of company production just isnt a way to increase your profits its a great way to increase your losses though posted july    pm jon murphy writes if the goal is to pay workers enough to buy back the product and many minimum wage workers work in fast food or other food service jobs where the products are often  or just a little more wouldnt that necessarily imply reducing the minimum wage posted july    pm khodge writes itd be cool to own my own aircraft carrier and it would flesh out the resume quite nicely but i was unable to run a flower shop so i think ill pass posted july    am pkn writes uneducated as he was henry ford understood production with a turnover rate approaching  in his work force the slowdown on the assembly line as they trained new workers was very costly hence the  wage it ended turnover and production increased accordingly and profits increased posted july    am michael writes might it have had a psychological impact cars unlike airliners were a new product that ford workers could surely see a use for in their own lives getting paid enough to actually being able to afford to buy one might improve workers job satisfaction posted july    am hasdrubal writes jon murphy if the goal is to pay workers enough to buy back the product and many minimum wage workers work in fast food or other food service jobs where the products are often  or just a little more wouldnt that necessarily imply reducing the minimum wage the funny thing is  minimum wage proponents suddenly remember the actual reason why ford raised wages when talking about low wage jobs and assume it was the wage not the worker the wage was attracting that led to the improvements its one of those great stories it can mean anything you want it to depending on how you tell it posted july    am jon murphy writes hasdrubal agreed although there is an aspect of the argument minimum wage proponents who try to tout the minimum wage as an efficiency wage miss the efficiency wage increases productivity by increasing unemployment an efficiency wage is not much more than a selfimposed price floor whose job is to limit workers shirking on the job the idea is if a firm pays abovemarket wages then a worker will work harder for fear of losing his job and being forced to take less pay somewhere else if all firms pay this efficiency wage a worker will work harder because there is now unemployment in the labor market there are others who are willing and able to take his job so when minimum wage proponents make the efficiency wage argument they are implicitly allowing indeed calling for unemployment to increase posted july    am mike davis writes nothing like hijacking one of david’s posts for a short rant… the “pay them enough to buy what they make” is an obviously silly argument but our econ  answer “pay them their marginal revenue product” isnt helpfulit doesnt do much to explain fords wages and leaves students vulnerable to bogus stories like this as an opening sentence in a long novel on labor markets “wmrp” is only slightly better than “it was a dark and stormy night” maybe it’s true maybe it’s not but it’s boring and misses all the color passion and drama that are part of the story of real labor markets things like efficiency wages various types of human capital signaling and the non pecuniary aspects of work matter much more than the first derivative of a profit function with labor as an independent variable there’s nothing wrong with teaching simple optimization these are useful life skills that every freshman or mba student should have but when teaching labor don’t leave out the sex and violence parts of the novel just because it’s hard to think up good multiple choice questions …rant concluded btw not accusing david of ignoring this stuff

may well be the case that ford workers could buy model ts for the first time because of the increased wages but he makes it sound as if that was henry fords motive thats unlikely to have been fords motive because the number of ford workers was probably well under  of the number of potential buyers would it really make sense to pay more than necessary to get workers so that your number of potential buyers can increase slightly especially when the downside is that with the higher wages come higher costs and your larger potential market is likely to shrink i think it was a fortunate accident that fords workers were able to buy fords the reason ive read for fords success is that ford was plagued with high turnover and high absenteeism and paying above market reduced turnover and absenteeism substantially one can imagine this being particularly important in a relatively new industry and certainly an industry with a relatively new production methodthe assembly linebecause there was probably a bigger gain than normal from keeping people on the job who gradually got very good at it if you still think the pay them more so they can buy the product argument makes sense then consider what henry hazlitt wrote on this issue in his  classic economics in one lesson some sponsors of the theory seem to imply that the workers in each industry should receive enough to buy back the particular product they make but they surely cannot mean that the makers of cheap dresses should get enough to buy back cheap dresses and the makers of mink coats enough to buy back mink coats or that the men in the ford plant should receive enough to buy fords and the men in the cadillac plant enough to buy cadillacs so a question for the person i quoted above based on hazlitts quote is this were cadillac workers more alienated than ford workers a few years ago i used hazlitt as a supplement to my main text and we covered this chapter remember that my students are largely military officers and disproportionately naval officers one us navy student had a great example to make hazlitts point he pointed out its not a good idea to pay workers making aircraft carriers high enough wages that each of them could buy an aircraft carrier heres an earlier discussion of the issue comments and sharing categories business economics  labor market email comments  to date latest comment michael makovi writes also the buy back the product argument is literally incoherent wages enough to buy the product over what time period should a person who makes a car be paid enough to buy a new car every year every day every century in fact everyone is paid enough to buy the product if you just assume a sufficiently long time horizon every worker who contributes to building an aircraft carrier is paid enough to buy an aircraft carrier if he just works long enough which may be a thousand years but whos counting not the socialists they literally dont consider this issue as far as i know posted july    pm garrett writes boeing workers should make enough to buy airliners posted july    pm fralupo writes michael makovi i think youre not considering consumer behavior consumers have their own preferences and these change with income a person earning half your wage isnt going to match your consumption habits just at half the speed even if they were your clone intuitively someone living paychecktopaycheck may not be willing to wipe out their savings in exchange for a machine that adds costs to their lives and has a declining resale value in terms used in economics a people earning low wages usually have higher discount rates than people earning high wages and so purchases of expensive durable goods will seem more attractive to people as their wages rise b going back to first year economics a consumers indifference curve for automobiles may intersect with their budget constraint at q and this is less likely the more income someone has posted july    pm hunter writes the ford example is one that drives me crazy as dr henderson noted the wage increase was to retain experienced workers this helped keep the prices low enough that the workers who didnt work for ford were able to buy the product posted july    pm michael makovi writes fralupo i think adding consumer preferences just makes socialism even worse for example some socialists will advocate worker control of the firm the problem is many workers dont want to control the firm theyd prefer to make certain guaranteed wages rather than uncertain varying profits and losses whether the firm makes a profit or a loss this firm theyd rather just receive their salary and as many professors can attest having to serve on a governing committee can be awfully bothersome many workers would probably prefer to avoid the burden of having to help run the company so i think theres a general problem with socialism viz that many consumers dont want what socialists think they ought to want posted july    pm john hare writes fralupo a people earning low wages usually have higher discount rates than people earning high wages and so purchases of expensive durable goods will seem more attractive to people as their wages rise i would argue that low wage people should do as you say an unfortunate number of them live paycheck to paycheck due to poor choices rent to own big screen tv instead of cash for a smaller or used unit for example in my case i bought a silverado back when making  an hour stupid and still embarrassing if i think about it  posted july    pm mr econotarian writes we should keep in mind that the ford assembly line was very different from traditional handcrafted carriage manufacture he needed workers who were very ontheball because a small screwup could stop the line and it is likely that assembly line work though more efficient was probably very boring to do one small task hundreds of times per day compared with doing a wider range of handcrafting at a more relaxed pace ford also had a kind of secret service who investigated the moral character of his employees he paid a lot but he expected a lot as well i believe ford did sell is  day as some kind of benificence to his employees but it was only the improved productivity of the assembly line that could allow it and the stringent requirements of the assembly line also demanded it to bring in the best workers posted july    pm paul zrimsek writes my favorite argument against the pay them more so they can buy the product version is even in the bestcase scenario where every penny of the wage increase goes towards a model t all ford has done is find an indirect method of giving away cars posted july    pm matt writes tim worstall had a bit of fun with this a few years back car production in the year before the pay rise was  in the year of it  as we can see above the total labour establishment was only  anyway even if all of his workers bought a car every year it wasnt going to make any but a marginal difference to the sales of the firm we can go further too as weve seen the rise in the daily wage was from  to  including the bonuses etc say  working days in the year and  workers and we get a rise in the pay bill of   million over the year a model t cost between  and  depends on which year were talking about  cars sold at that price gives us   million to   million in income to the company it should be obvious that paying the workforce an extra  million so that they can then buy  millions worth of company production just isnt a way to increase your profits its a great way to increase your losses though posted july    pm jon murphy writes if the goal is to pay workers enough to buy back the product and many minimum wage workers work in fast food or other food service jobs where the products are often  or just a little more wouldnt that necessarily imply reducing the minimum wage posted july    pm khodge writes itd be cool to own my own aircraft carrier and it would flesh out the resume quite nicely but i was unable to run a flower shop so i think ill pass posted july    am pkn writes uneducated as he was henry ford understood production with a turnover rate approaching  in his work force the slowdown on the assembly line as they trained new workers was very costly hence the  wage it ended turnover and production increased accordingly and profits increased posted july    am michael writes might it have had a psychological impact cars unlike airliners were a new product that ford workers could surely see a use for in their own lives getting paid enough to actually being able to afford to buy one might improve workers job satisfaction posted july    am hasdrubal writes jon murphy if the goal is to pay workers enough to buy back the product and many minimum wage workers work in fast food or other food service jobs where the products are often  or just a little more wouldnt that necessarily imply reducing the minimum wage the funny thing is  minimum wage proponents suddenly remember the actual reason why ford raised wages when talking about low wage jobs and assume it was the wage not the worker the wage was attracting that led to the improvements its one of those great stories it can mean anything you want it to depending on how you tell it posted july    am jon murphy writes hasdrubal agreed although there is an aspect of the argument minimum wage proponents who try to tout the minimum wage as an efficiency wage miss the efficiency wage increases productivity by increasing unemployment an efficiency wage is not much more than a selfimposed price floor whose job is to limit workers shirking on the job the idea is if a firm pays abovemarket wages then a worker will work harder for fear of losing his job and being forced to take less pay somewhere else if all firms pay this efficiency wage a worker will work harder because there is now unemployment in the labor market there are others who are willing and able to take his job so when minimum wage proponents make the efficiency wage argument they are implicitly allowing indeed calling for unemployment to increase posted july    am mike davis writes nothing like hijacking one of david’s posts for a short rant… the “pay them enough to buy what they make” is an obviously silly argument but our econ  answer “pay them their marginal revenue product” isnt helpfulit doesnt do much to explain fords wages and leaves students vulnerable to bogus stories like this as an opening sentence in a long novel on labor markets “wmrp” is only slightly better than “it was a dark and stormy night” maybe it’s true maybe it’s not but it’s boring and misses all the color passion and drama that are part of the story of real labor markets things like efficiency wages various types of human capital signaling and the non pecuniary aspects of work matter much more than the first derivative of a profit function with labor as an independent variable there’s nothing wrong with teaching simple optimization these are useful life skills that every freshman or mba student should have but when teaching labor don’t leave out the sex and violence parts of the novel just because it’s hard to think up good multiple choice questions …rant concluded btw not accusing david of ignoring this stuff in his teaching and writing posted july    pm post a comment read
