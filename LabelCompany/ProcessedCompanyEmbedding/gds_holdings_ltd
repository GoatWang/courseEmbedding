contributions to our prc subsidiaries to fund their capital expenditures or working capital we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis if at all we offer a broad range of data center services and as a result we may compete with a wide range of data center service providers for some or all of the services we offer we face competition from the stateowned telecommunications carriers namely china telecom china unicom and china mobile as of december   these carriers had a  share in aggregate of the high performance data center services market in china based on area committed according to  research one of the main purposes for which these carriers develop data centers is in order to facilitate the sale of related telecommunications services in locations outside of the key economic hubs these three carriers may sometimes be the only available provider of data center services we distinguish ourselves from these carriers because we are carrierneutral enabling our customers to connect within our facilities with all three carriers based on their cost andor network and application requirements we compete on the basis of our data center quality operating track record and differentiated managed and cloud service capabilities although we compete with carriers for colocation customers our customers also rely on the connectivity that carriers provide we believe that we also have a mutually beneficial relationship with these carriers since our data center services often help carriers attract more customers for their telecommunications services we also compete with other carrierneutral data center service providers including • domestic carrier neutral data center service providers we compete with domestic carrierneutral data center service providers with a presence in some or all of our markets such as sinnet dr peng and vianet we believe that we are well positioned in terms of our operational track record and our ability to deliver highperformance data center services in all key markets maintain consistently high facility and service quality continue capacity expansion in all key markets to accommodate growing demand and provide differentiated managed service offerings with a unique value proposition • international carrier neutral data center service providers we compete to a lesser extent with foreign carrierneutral data center service providers such as equinix kddi and nttcom each of which has a presence in shanghai andor beijing and primarily serve their international customers we believe that we distinguish ourselves by our larger capacity and more extensive market presence across the key economics hubs in china deep operating knowledge and long track record in the china market and longterm relationships with the telecommunications carriers company description we are a leading developer and operator of highperformance data centers in china our facilities are strategically located in chinas primary economic hubs where demand for highperformance data center services is concentrated our data centers have large net floor area high power capacity density and efficiency and multiple redundancy across all critical systems we are carrier and cloud neutral which enables our customers to connect to all major prc telecommunications carriers and to access a number of the largest prc cloud service providers whom we host in our facilities we offer colocation and managed services including a unique and innovative managed cloud value proposition we have a year track record of service delivery successfully fulfilling the requirements of some of the largest and most demanding customers for outsourced data center services in china our base of approximately  customers consists predominantly of large internet companies financial institutions telecommunications and it service providers and large domestic private sector and multinational corporations as of september   we had an aggregate net floor area of  sqm in service  of which was committed and an aggregate net floor area of  sqm under construction according to  research an independent research firm we are the largest service provider in the highperformance carrierneutral data center services market in china with  market share as measured by area committed as of september   the market for highperformance data center services in china is experiencing strong growth according to  research the market is expected to increase from us billion in  to us billion in  representing a compound annual growth rate or cagr of  over the same period the highperformance carrierneutral data center services market in china is expected to grow with a higher cagr of  demand is driven by the confluence of several secular economic and industry trends including rapid growth of the internet ecommerce and big data rising adoption of cloud computing and server virtualization which requires data centers with higher power capacity density and efficiency increasing criticality of information technology and data in the enterprise environment which requires data centers with higher reliability and growing reliance by enterprises on outsourcing as a solution to the increasing complexity and cost of managing missioncritical it infrastructure we believe that as a result of this strong demand and the challenges of sourcing developing and operating new facilities that meet the required standard there is a relative scarcity of highperformance data center capacity in china according to  research as of december   when comparing the ratio of square meters of colocation area in service to gdp the us had a ratio of  sqm per us billion in gdp while china only had a ratio of  our portfolio of data centers and secured expansion capacity are strategically located to address this growing demand we operate our datacenters to service our customers predominantly in shanghai beijing shenzhen guangzhou and chengdu the primary financial commercial industrial and communications hubs in each region of china according to  researchapproximately  of the market in terms of revenue for highperformance data center services in china was concentrated in these markets in  we have also established a presence in hong kong which we believe is another important marketfor our customers our data centers are located in close proximity to thecorporate headquarters and key operation centers of many large enterprisesproviding convenient access for our customers furthermore the extensive multicarrier telecommunications networks in these markets enable our customers to enhance the performance and lower the cost of connectivity to our facilities our data centers are largescale highly reliable and highly efficient facilities that provide a flexible modular and secure operating environment in which our customers can house power and cool the computer systems and networking equipment that support their missioncritical it infrastructure we install large power capacity and optimize power usage efficiency which enables our customers to deploy their it infrastructure more

respective industries within our customer base we host a number of major cloud service providers including aliyun the cloud computing unit of alibaba which is present in several of our data centers

rate of over  per annum among our internet and financial institution customers for colocation services in our current data centers over the past two years as of september   we operated eight selfdeveloped data centers with an aggregate net floor area of  sqm in service we also operated capacity at approximately ten thirdparty data centers with an aggregate net floor area of  sqm in service which we lease on a wholesale basis and use to provide colocation and managed services to our customers as of the same date we had a further five new selfdeveloped data centers and two phases

development and entered into a memorandum of understanding for a lease of three data center shell buildings that we expect to provide us with additional net floor area of approximately  sqm our net revenue and results of operations are largely determined by the degree to which data center space is committed or precommitted as well as its utilization we had commitment rates of   and  as of december   and  and september   respectively we had utilization rates of   and  as of december   and  and september   respectively the difference between commitment rate and utilization rate is
