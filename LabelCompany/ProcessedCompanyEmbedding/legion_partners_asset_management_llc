investment approach we are deep value longterm oriented active investors our competitive advantage stems from an ability to combine the strengths and reputations of institutional partners and high net worth investors with a wellaligned active management strategy in corporate governance legion partners is committed to executing a corporate governance or activism style of investing this strategy generally incorporates deep value security selection a longterm oriented ownership horizon and some form of active engagement or eventdriven catalyst to ultimately realize additional value for the benefit and interests of longerterm shareholders activist strategies may involve obtaining representation on a portfolio companys board of directors implementing various efforts to impact a portfolio company’s policies or strategic direction or in some cases simply advocating specific business activities for the fundamental benefit of a portfolio company we believe that in certain circumstances poor governance and ineffective corporate leadership have led to considerable deterioration of longterm value these instances include individual company situations sectors and industries and to an extent the broader capital markets appropriate corporate governance and proper oversight from longterm oriented equity owners have meaningful potential to protect value by lowering risk and in fact provide a major catalyst to reverse value destruction under select conditions responsible activism has historically been able to unlock significant shareholder value and generate highly attractive returns for investors our private equity approach to investing in public markets is distinctly efficient and well aligned with the interests of longterm shareholders in addition our active involvement
