times during the poor agricultural economy in the early to mids and the effects of a long strike with the uaw over proposed work rule changes ihs new ceo donald lennox directed the management organization to begin exiting many of its ihs historical business sectors in an effort to survive some of the sales of profitable business endeavors were executed to raise cash for shortterm survival while other divisions were sold due to lack of immediate profitability during this period of questionable economic survival in an effort to raise needed cash and to reduce losses the management team

the amount of nitrogen oxides and soot emanating from diesel engines despite the change in the compliance arena the regulations would not begin to be phased in until  with full implementation slated for  ustian had multiple engineering paths available among them were selective catalytic reduction scr exhaust gas recirculation egr or the use of nitrogen oxide absorbers all required more engineering and development to achieve compliance ustian believed truckers did not want to bother with an extra tank of fluid aftertreatment as a result he convinced the company to spend  million to fund egr development on october   navistar formally announced their intent to move forward with egr as the companys strategy the company statement included ustian mentioning “i have publicly been an advocate of customer friendly emissions control solutions which do not add additional costs to our truck and bus customers while scr is a means to achieve the nox reduction requirement for  it comes with a steep cost to our customers our ability to achieve our goals without adding customer cost and inconvenience is a competitive advantage for international” on november   navistar revealed it would use epa credits in order to comply with the  legislation in february  ustian touted the benefits of egr technology as a key differentiator for the companys engines however by now the rest of the industry had chosen to use the compliant scr technology ustian disagreed with scr saying the other thing that egr avoids is the risks of an scr strategy read the label on this and it will show you that there are challenges with keeping control of using this technology ‘store between  degrees and  degrees’ so essentially it says you can’t throw it outside you can’t operate it in conditions above  degrees or below  degrees you can but it will put the burden onto the customers”  nonconformance penaltiesedit the epa recognized navistars imminent noncompliance and created a system of nonconformance penalties ncps that included a  fine for every noncompliant engine that navistar sold to bridge the gap navistar began using epa credits it had previously earned for being compliant in lieu of paying fines in august  navistar stated they would run out of epa credits soon only days earlier the epa announced increased new penalties of  per engine in march  navistar sued the epa claiming that the agency’s guidance documents for scr implementation were invalid because they were adopted without a public process and with input only from the scr engine makers navistar and the epa settled the lawsuit a year later further masking the egr problem were high military sales in the companys  k report navistar cited orders for mraps as offsetting flat commercial sales due to the recession move to lisle iledit in september  despite uncertainty over egr and a sluggish economy navistar leadership revived an effort to relocate the company headquarters from warrenville il to nearby lisle il the new headquarters was expected to retain or create  permanent jobs and about  construction jobs navistar president dan ustian said roughly  engineers would be hired immediately navistar aimed to invest  million in the  millionsquarefoot lisle campus which would include product development the state gave navistar incentives of nearly  million including tax credits in march  navistar announced the move to lisle renovations were completed in the fall but the company gradually moved from warrenville to lisle in summer  you cant build a campus like this anywhere for anywhere near the price we paid for this and even though you might get more incentives when you look at the whole picture you really cant beat it said don sharp navistar vice president in  navistar began

 the tdtc closed and the remaining workers were let go in january  the epa adopted an interim final rule that allowed navistar to continue selling the engines subject to ncps several navistar competitors sued and in june  the same appeals court ruled that epa’s interim rule was invalid because it did not give the public notice and an opportunity for comment in the mean time navistars egr decision had led to significant reliability and quality problems truck drivers began losing trust and confidence as navistar vehicles were breaking down frequently consequently they abandoned navistar trucks in favor of competitors trucks tension mountsedit in june  speculation mounted about a possible takeover of the struggling truck maker this came as hedge fund mhr fund management llc disclosed a  stake in the company slightly higher than billionaire activist investor carl icahns  stake as a result navistar adopted a poison pill defense if the plan were triggered by an outside investor taking a stake of  percent or more in the company then navistar would issue its shareholders rights that would let them buy new common stock in the company at a discount of  percent for each share

business decisions and poor corporate governance icahn noted from  that this board has authorized spending shareholder money on lawsuits against suppliers competitors and regulators marketing plans to convince customers that noncompliant engines are actually compliant accumulating noncore assets such as a recreational vehicle manufacturer and a goldplated corporate headquarters that cost over  million the one thing this board refused to spend money on was a backup plan involving the industry standard technology navistar now must rely on in a september  interview cummins ceo tom linebarger said all we did was act nice to them navistar even when they didnt talk nicely about us he smiled recalling harsh comments that navistar executives had made about scr being used by all its competitors

proposed work rule changes ihs new ceo donald lennox directed the management organization to begin exiting many of its ihs historical business sectors in an effort to survive some of the sales of profitable business endeavors were executed to raise cash for shortterm survival while other divisions were sold due to lack of immediate profitability during this period of questionable economic

engine strategyedit in  then ceo dan ustian faced numerous epa regulations to reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides and soot emanating from diesel engines despite the change in the compliance arena the regulations would not begin to be phased in until  with full implementation slated for  ustian had multiple engineering paths available among them were selective catalytic reduction scr exhaust gas recirculation egr or the use of nitrogen oxide absorbers all required more engineering and development to achieve compliance ustian believed truckers did not want to bother with an extra tank of fluid aftertreatment as a result he convinced the company to spend  million to fund egr development on october   navistar formally announced their intent to move forward with egr as the companys strategy the company statement included ustian mentioning “i have publicly been an advocate of customer friendly emissions control solutions which do not add additional costs to our truck and bus customers while scr is a means to achieve the nox reduction requirement for  it comes with a steep cost to our customers our ability to achieve our goals without adding customer cost and inconvenience is a competitive advantage for international” on november   navistar revealed it would use epa credits in order to comply with the  legislation in february  ustian touted the benefits of egr technology as a key differentiator for the companys engines however by now the rest of the industry had chosen to use the compliant scr technology ustian disagreed with scr saying the other thing that egr avoids is the risks of an scr strategy read the label on this and it will show you that there are challenges with keeping control of using this technology ‘store between  degrees and  degrees’ so essentially it says you can’t throw it outside you can’t operate it in conditions above  degrees or below  degrees you can but it will put the burden onto the customers”  nonconformance penaltiesedit the epa recognized navistars imminent noncompliance and created a system of nonconformance penalties ncps that included a  fine for every noncompliant engine that navistar sold to bridge the gap navistar began using epa credits it had previously earned for being compliant in lieu of paying fines in august  navistar stated they would run out of epa credits soon only days earlier the epa announced increased new penalties of  per engine in march  navistar sued the epa claiming that the agency’s guidance documents for scr implementation were invalid because they were adopted without a public process and with input only from the scr engine makers navistar and the epa settled the lawsuit a year later further masking the egr problem were high military sales in the companys  k report navistar cited orders for mraps as offsetting flat commercial sales due to the recession move to lisle iledit in september  despite uncertainty over egr and a sluggish economy navistar leadership revived an effort to relocate the company headquarters from warrenville il to nearby lisle il the new headquarters was expected to retain or create  permanent jobs and about  construction jobs navistar president dan ustian said roughly  engineers would be hired immediately navistar aimed to invest  million in the  millionsquarefoot lisle campus which would include product development the state gave navistar incentives of nearly  million including tax credits in march  navistar announced the move to lisle renovations were completed in the fall but the company gradually moved from warrenville to lisle in summer  you cant build a campus like this anywhere for anywhere near the price we paid for this and even though you might get more incentives when you look at the whole picture you really cant beat it

the company’s test track on oxford street in late july  the tdtc closed and the remaining workers were let go in january  the epa adopted an interim final rule that allowed navistar to continue selling the engines subject to ncps several navistar competitors sued and in june  the same appeals court ruled that epa’s interim rule was invalid because it did not give the public notice and an opportunity for comment in the mean time navistars egr decision had led to significant reliability and quality problems truck drivers began losing trust and confidence as navistar vehicles were breaking down frequently consequently they abandoned navistar trucks in favor of competitors trucks tension mountsedit in june  speculation mounted about a possible takeover of the struggling truck maker this came as hedge fund mhr fund management llc disclosed a  stake in the company slightly higher than billionaire activist investor carl icahns  stake as a result navistar adopted a poison pill

an open letter to navistars board blasting them for abysmal business decisions and poor corporate governance icahn noted from  that this board has authorized spending shareholder money on lawsuits against suppliers competitors and regulators marketing plans to convince customers that noncompliant engines are actually compliant accumulating noncore assets such as a recreational vehicle manufacturer and a goldplated corporate headquarters that cost over  million the one thing this board refused to spend money on was a backup plan involving the industry standard technology navistar now must rely on in a september  interview cummins ceo tom linebarger said all we did was act nice to them navistar even when they didnt talk nicely about us he smiled recalling harsh comments that

proposed work rule changes ihs new ceo donald lennox directed the management organization to begin exiting many of its ihs historical business sectors in an effort to survive some of the sales of profitable business endeavors were executed to raise cash for shortterm survival while other divisions were sold due to lack of immediate profitability during this period of questionable economic survival in an effort to raise needed cash and to reduce losses the management team led by mr lennox at ih shed many of its operating divisions construction equipment division to dresser industries solar gas turbines division to caterpillar cub cadet lawn and garden equipment to mtd products and lastly the agricultural division to tenneco which merged it with their ji case subsidiary the scout

errors on december   navistar executives announced further delay of its restatement and  results the announcement prompted the new york stock exchange nyse to announce the delisting of the company

engine strategyedit in  then ceo dan ustian faced numerous epa regulations to reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides and soot emanating from diesel engines despite the change in the compliance arena the regulations would not begin to be phased in until  with full implementation slated for  ustian had multiple engineering paths available among them were selective catalytic reduction scr exhaust gas recirculation egr or the use of nitrogen oxide absorbers all required more engineering and development to achieve compliance ustian believed truckers did not want to bother with an extra tank of fluid aftertreatment as a result he convinced the company to spend  million to fund egr development on october   navistar formally announced their intent to move forward with egr as the companys strategy the company statement included ustian mentioning “i have publicly been an advocate of customer friendly emissions control solutions which do not add additional costs to our truck and bus customers while scr is a means to achieve the nox reduction requirement for  it comes with a steep cost to our customers our ability to achieve our goals without adding customer cost and inconvenience is a competitive advantage for international” on november   navistar revealed it would use epa credits in order to comply with the  legislation in february  ustian touted the benefits of egr technology as a key differentiator for the companys engines however by now the rest of the industry had chosen to use the compliant scr technology ustian disagreed with scr saying the other thing that egr avoids is the risks of an scr strategy read the label on this and it will show you that there are challenges with keeping control of using this technology ‘store between  degrees and  degrees’ so essentially it says you can’t throw it outside you can’t operate it in conditions above  degrees or below  degrees you can but it will put the burden onto the customers”  nonconformance penaltiesedit the epa recognized navistars imminent noncompliance and created a system of nonconformance penalties ncps that included a  fine for every noncompliant engine that navistar sold to bridge the gap navistar began using epa credits it had previously earned for being compliant in lieu of paying fines in august  navistar stated they would run out of epa credits soon only days earlier the epa announced increased new penalties of  per engine in march  navistar sued the epa claiming that the agency’s guidance documents for scr implementation were invalid because they were adopted without a public process and with input only from the scr engine makers navistar and the epa settled the lawsuit a year later further masking the egr problem were high military sales in the companys  k report navistar cited orders for mraps as offsetting flat commercial sales due to the recession move to lisle iledit in september  despite uncertainty over egr and a sluggish economy navistar leadership revived an effort to relocate the company headquarters from warrenville il to nearby lisle il the new headquarters was expected to retain or create  permanent jobs and about  construction jobs navistar president dan ustian said roughly  engineers would be hired immediately navistar aimed to invest  million in the  millionsquarefoot lisle campus which would include product development the state gave navistar incentives of nearly  million including tax credits in march  navistar announced the move to lisle renovations were completed in the fall but the company gradually moved from warrenville to lisle in summer  you cant build a campus like this anywhere for anywhere near the price we paid for this and even though you might get more incentives when you look at the whole picture you really cant beat it said don sharp navistar vice president in  navistar began phasing out its truck development and technology center tdtc in fort wayne indiana in early december  the company laid off  employees mostly engineers and designers who were united auto workers members in total  out of  fort wayne employees eventually accepted offers to relocate to illinois the other  workers either retired or chose to remain in indiana and find work elsewhere the cost to move employees and consolidate operations was estimated to be  million the only navistar employees remaining after december  were  people manning the company’s test track on oxford street in late july  the tdtc closed and the remaining workers were let go in january  the epa adopted an interim final rule that allowed navistar to continue selling the engines subject to ncps several navistar competitors sued and in june  the same appeals court ruled that epa’s interim rule was invalid because it did not give the public notice and an opportunity for comment in the mean time navistars egr decision had led to significant reliability and quality problems truck drivers began losing trust and confidence as navistar vehicles were breaking down frequently consequently they abandoned navistar trucks in favor of competitors trucks tension mountsedit in june  speculation mounted about a possible takeover of the struggling truck maker this came as hedge fund mhr fund management llc disclosed a  stake in the company slightly higher than billionaire activist investor carl icahns  stake as a result navistar adopted a poison pill defense if the plan were triggered by an outside investor taking a stake of  percent or more in the company then navistar would issue its shareholders rights that would let them buy new common stock in the company at a discount of  percent for each share held the investor could buy  worth of new shares for  the investor who took the  percent stake or more would not have the right to buy additional shares in august  navistar announced it would use cummins engines and scr technology after  years with the company dan ustian retired immediately in august  and left his position on the board as well former textron ceo lewis campbell was named interim ceo and troy clarke was promoted to chief operating officer ustians severance package began at  million the companys proxy statement during this time estimated the total package to be  million contingent on a share price of  on oct   the end of the companys fiscal year on september   billionaire and key stock holder carl icahn sent an open letter to navistars board blasting them for abysmal business decisions and poor corporate governance icahn noted from  that this board has authorized spending shareholder money on lawsuits against suppliers competitors and regulators marketing plans to convince customers that noncompliant engines are actually compliant accumulating noncore assets such as a recreational vehicle manufacturer and a goldplated corporate headquarters that cost over  million the one thing this board refused to spend money on was a backup plan involving the industry standard technology navistar now must rely on in a september  interview cummins ceo tom linebarger said all we did was act nice to them navistar even when they didnt talk nicely about us he smiled recalling harsh comments that navistar executives had made about scr being used by all its competitors in october  chief product officer deepak kapur stepped down followed by group vice president of product development ramin younessi in december  cio don sharp also left the company in april  layoffs and consolidationedit august  featured a voluntary separation program vsp as well as involuntary layoffs this was due to the

regulations would not begin to be phased in until  with full implementation slated for  ustian had multiple engineering paths available among them were selective catalytic reduction scr exhaust gas recirculation egr or the use of nitrogen oxide absorbers all required more engineering and development to achieve compliance ustian believed truckers did not want to bother with an extra tank of fluid aftertreatment as a result he convinced the company to spend  million to fund egr development on october   navistar formally announced their intent to move forward with egr as the companys strategy the company statement included ustian mentioning “i have publicly been an advocate of customer friendly emissions control solutions which do not add additional costs to our truck and bus customers while scr is a means to achieve the nox reduction requirement for  it comes with a steep cost to our customers our ability to achieve our goals without adding customer cost and inconvenience is a competitive advantage for international” on november   navistar revealed it would use epa credits in order to comply with the  legislation in february  ustian touted the benefits of egr technology as a key differentiator for the companys engines however by now the rest of the industry had chosen to use the compliant scr technology ustian disagreed with scr saying the other thing that egr avoids is the risks of an scr strategy read the label on this and it will show you that there are challenges with keeping control of using this technology ‘store between  degrees and  degrees’ so essentially it says you can’t throw it outside you can’t operate it in conditions above  degrees or below  degrees you can but it will put the burden onto the customers”  nonconformance penaltiesedit the epa recognized navistars imminent noncompliance and created a system of nonconformance penalties ncps that included a  fine for every noncompliant engine that navistar sold to bridge the gap navistar began using epa credits it had previously earned for being compliant in lieu of paying fines in august  navistar stated they would run out of epa credits soon only days earlier the epa announced increased new penalties of  per engine in march  navistar sued the epa claiming that the agency’s guidance documents for scr implementation were invalid because they were adopted without a public process and with input only from the scr engine makers navistar and the epa settled the lawsuit a year later further masking the egr problem were high military sales in the companys  k report navistar cited orders for mraps as offsetting flat commercial sales due to the recession move to lisle iledit in september  despite uncertainty over egr and a sluggish economy navistar leadership revived an

the company’s test track on oxford street in late july  the tdtc closed and the remaining workers were let go in january  the epa adopted an interim final rule that allowed navistar to continue selling the engines subject to ncps several navistar competitors sued and in june  the same appeals court ruled that epa’s interim rule was invalid because it did not give the public notice and an opportunity for comment in the mean time navistars egr decision had led to significant reliability and quality problems truck drivers began losing trust and confidence as navistar vehicles were breaking down frequently consequently they abandoned navistar trucks in favor of competitors trucks tension mountsedit in june  speculation mounted about a possible takeover of the struggling truck

an open letter to navistars board blasting them for abysmal business decisions and poor corporate governance icahn noted from  that this board has authorized spending shareholder money on lawsuits against suppliers competitors and regulators marketing plans to convince customers that noncompliant engines are actually compliant accumulating noncore assets such as a recreational vehicle manufacturer and a goldplated corporate headquarters that cost over  million the one thing this board refused to spend money on was a backup plan involving the industry standard technology navistar now must rely on in a september  interview cummins ceo tom linebarger said all we did was act nice to them navistar even when they didnt talk nicely about us he smiled recalling harsh comments that

profitable business endeavors were executed to raise cash for shortterm survival while other divisions were sold due to lack of immediate profitability during this period of questionable economic

engine strategyedit in  then ceo dan ustian faced numerous epa regulations to reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides and soot emanating from diesel engines despite the change in the compliance arena the regulations would not begin to be phased in until  with full implementation slated for  ustian had multiple engineering paths available among them were selective catalytic reduction scr exhaust gas recirculation egr or the use of nitrogen oxide absorbers all required more engineering and development to achieve compliance ustian believed truckers did not want to bother with an extra tank of fluid aftertreatment as a result he convinced the company to spend  million to fund egr development on october   navistar formally announced their intent to move forward with egr as the companys strategy the company statement included ustian mentioning “i have publicly been an advocate of customer friendly emissions control solutions which do not add additional costs to our truck and bus customers while scr is a means to achieve the nox reduction requirement for  it comes with a steep cost to our customers our ability to achieve our goals without adding customer cost and inconvenience is a competitive advantage for international” on november   navistar revealed it would use epa credits in order to comply with the  legislation in february  ustian touted the benefits of egr technology as a key differentiator for the companys engines however by now the rest of the industry had chosen to use the compliant scr technology ustian disagreed with scr saying the other thing that egr avoids is the risks of an scr strategy read the label on this and it will show you that there are challenges with keeping control of using this technology ‘store between  degrees and  degrees’ so essentially it says you can’t throw it outside you can’t operate it in conditions above  degrees or below  degrees you can but it will put the burden onto the customers”  nonconformance penaltiesedit the epa recognized navistars imminent noncompliance and created a system of nonconformance penalties ncps that included a  fine for every noncompliant engine that navistar sold to bridge the gap navistar began using epa credits it had previously earned for being compliant in lieu of paying fines in august  navistar stated they would run out of epa credits soon only days earlier the epa announced increased new penalties of  per engine in march  navistar sued the epa claiming that the agency’s guidance documents for scr implementation were invalid because they were adopted without a public process and with input only from the scr engine makers navistar and the epa settled the lawsuit a year later further masking the egr problem were high military sales in the companys  k report navistar cited orders for mraps as offsetting flat commercial sales due to the recession move to lisle iledit in september  despite uncertainty over egr and a sluggish economy navistar leadership revived an effort to relocate the company headquarters from warrenville il to nearby lisle il the new headquarters was expected to retain or create  permanent jobs and about  construction jobs navistar president dan ustian said roughly  engineers would be hired immediately navistar aimed to invest  million in the  millionsquarefoot lisle campus which would include product development the state gave navistar incentives of nearly  million including tax credits in march  navistar announced the move to lisle renovations were completed in the fall but the company gradually moved from warrenville to lisle in summer  you cant build a campus like this anywhere for anywhere near the price we paid for this and even though you might get more incentives when you look at the whole picture you really cant beat it

the company’s test track on oxford street in late july  the tdtc closed and the remaining workers were let go in january  the epa adopted an interim final rule that allowed navistar to continue selling the engines subject to ncps several navistar competitors sued and in june  the same appeals court ruled that epa’s interim rule was invalid because it did not give the public notice and an opportunity for comment in the mean time navistars egr decision had led to significant reliability and quality problems truck drivers began losing trust and confidence as navistar vehicles were breaking down frequently consequently they abandoned navistar trucks in favor of competitors trucks tension mountsedit in june  speculation mounted about a possible takeover of the struggling truck maker this came as hedge fund mhr fund management llc disclosed a  stake in the company slightly higher than billionaire activist investor carl icahns  stake as a result navistar adopted a poison pill

an open letter to navistars board blasting them for abysmal business decisions and poor corporate governance icahn noted from  that this board has authorized spending shareholder money on lawsuits against suppliers competitors and regulators marketing plans to convince customers that noncompliant engines are actually compliant accumulating noncore assets such as a recreational vehicle manufacturer and a goldplated corporate headquarters that cost over  million the one thing this board refused to spend money on was a backup plan involving the industry standard technology navistar now must rely on in a september  interview cummins ceo tom linebarger said all we did was act nice to them navistar even when they didnt talk nicely about us he smiled recalling harsh comments that

proposed work rule changes ihs new ceo donald lennox directed the management organization to begin exiting many of its ihs historical business sectors in an effort to survive some of the sales of profitable business endeavors were executed to raise cash for shortterm survival while other divisions were sold due to lack of immediate profitability during this period of questionable economic

engine strategyedit in  then ceo dan ustian faced numerous epa regulations to reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides and soot emanating from diesel engines despite the change in the compliance arena the regulations would not begin to be phased in until  with full implementation slated for  ustian had multiple engineering paths available among them were selective catalytic reduction scr exhaust gas recirculation egr or the use of nitrogen oxide absorbers all required more engineering and development to achieve compliance ustian believed truckers did not want to bother with an extra tank of fluid aftertreatment as a result he convinced the company to spend  million to fund egr development on october   navistar formally announced their intent to move forward with egr as the companys strategy the company statement included ustian mentioning “i have publicly been an advocate of customer friendly emissions control solutions which do not add additional costs to our truck and bus customers while scr is a means to achieve the nox reduction requirement for  it comes with a steep cost to our customers our ability to achieve our goals without adding customer cost and inconvenience is a competitive advantage for international” on november   navistar revealed it would use epa credits in order to comply with the  legislation in february  ustian touted the benefits of egr technology as a key differentiator for the companys engines however by now the rest of the industry had chosen to use the compliant scr technology ustian disagreed with scr saying the other thing that egr avoids is the risks of an scr strategy read the label on this and it will show you that there are challenges with keeping control of using this technology ‘store between  degrees and  degrees’ so essentially it says you can’t throw it outside you can’t operate it in conditions above  degrees or below  degrees you can but it will put the burden onto the customers”  nonconformance penaltiesedit the epa recognized navistars imminent noncompliance and created a system of nonconformance penalties ncps that included a  fine for every noncompliant engine that navistar sold to bridge the gap navistar began using epa credits it had previously earned for being compliant in lieu of paying fines in august  navistar stated they would run out of epa credits soon only days earlier the epa announced increased new penalties of  per engine in march  navistar sued the epa claiming that the agency’s guidance documents for scr implementation were invalid because they were adopted without a public process and with input only from the scr engine makers navistar and the epa settled the lawsuit a year later further masking the egr problem were high military sales in the companys  k report navistar cited orders for mraps as offsetting flat commercial sales due to the recession move to lisle iledit in september  despite uncertainty over egr and a sluggish economy navistar leadership revived an effort to relocate the company headquarters from warrenville il to nearby lisle il the new headquarters was expected to retain or create  permanent jobs and about  construction jobs navistar president dan ustian said roughly  engineers would be hired immediately navistar aimed to invest  million in the  millionsquarefoot lisle campus which would include product development the state gave navistar incentives of nearly  million including tax credits in march  navistar announced the move to lisle renovations were completed in the fall but the company gradually moved from warrenville to lisle in summer  you cant build a campus like this anywhere for anywhere near the price we paid for this and even though you might get more incentives when you look at the whole picture you really cant beat it said don sharp navistar vice president in  navistar began phasing out its truck development and technology center tdtc in fort wayne indiana in early december  the company laid off  employees mostly engineers and designers who were united auto workers members in total  out of  fort wayne employees eventually accepted offers to relocate to illinois the other  workers either retired or chose to remain in indiana and find work elsewhere the cost to move employees and consolidate operations was estimated to be  million the only navistar employees remaining after december  were  people manning the company’s test track on oxford street in late july  the tdtc closed and the remaining workers were let go in january  the epa adopted an interim final rule that allowed navistar to continue selling the engines subject to ncps several navistar competitors sued and in june  the same appeals court ruled that epa’s interim rule was invalid because it did not give the public notice and an opportunity for comment in the mean time navistars egr decision had led to significant reliability and quality problems truck drivers began losing trust and confidence as navistar vehicles were breaking down frequently consequently they abandoned navistar trucks in favor of competitors trucks tension mountsedit in june  speculation mounted about a possible takeover of the struggling truck maker this came as hedge fund mhr fund management llc disclosed a  stake in the company slightly higher than billionaire activist investor carl icahns  stake as a result navistar adopted a poison pill defense if the plan were triggered by an outside investor taking a stake of  percent or more in the company then navistar would issue its shareholders rights that would let them buy new common stock in the company at a discount of  percent for each share held the investor could buy  worth of new shares for  the investor who took the  percent stake or more would not have the right to buy additional shares in august  navistar announced it would use cummins engines and scr technology after  years with the company dan ustian retired immediately in august  and left his position on the board as well former textron ceo lewis campbell was named interim ceo and troy clarke was promoted to chief operating officer ustians severance package began at  million the companys proxy statement during this time estimated the total package to be  million contingent on a share price of  on oct   the end of the companys fiscal year on september   billionaire and key stock holder carl icahn sent an open letter to navistars board blasting them for abysmal business decisions and poor corporate governance icahn noted from  that this board has authorized spending shareholder money on lawsuits against suppliers competitors and regulators marketing plans to convince customers that noncompliant engines are actually compliant accumulating noncore assets such as a recreational vehicle manufacturer and a goldplated corporate headquarters that cost over  million the one thing this board refused to spend money on was a backup plan involving the industry standard technology navistar now must rely on in a september  interview cummins ceo tom linebarger said all we did was act nice to them navistar even when they didnt talk nicely about us he smiled recalling harsh comments that navistar executives had made about scr being used by all its competitors in october  chief product officer deepak kapur stepped down followed by group vice president of product development ramin

times during the poor agricultural economy in the early to mids and the effects of a long strike with the uaw over proposed work rule changes ihs new ceo donald lennox directed the management organization to begin exiting many of its ihs historical business sectors in an effort to survive some of the sales of profitable business endeavors were executed to raise cash for shortterm survival while other divisions were sold due to lack of immediate profitability during this period of questionable economic survival in an effort to raise needed cash and to reduce losses the management team

the industry in  amtran was rebranded as ic integrated coach after a few months as international truck and bus after nearly a century of business in chicago navistar announced its plans on  september

the amount of nitrogen oxides and soot emanating from diesel engines despite the change in the compliance arena the regulations would not begin to be phased in until  with full implementation slated for  ustian had multiple engineering paths available among them were selective catalytic reduction scr exhaust gas recirculation egr or the use of nitrogen oxide absorbers all required more engineering and development to achieve compliance ustian believed truckers did not want to bother with an extra tank of fluid aftertreatment as a result he convinced the company to spend  million to fund egr development on october   navistar formally announced their intent to move forward with egr as the companys strategy the company statement included ustian mentioning “i have publicly been an advocate of customer friendly emissions control solutions which do not add additional costs to our truck and bus customers while scr is a means to achieve the nox reduction requirement for  it comes with a steep cost to our customers our ability to achieve our goals without adding customer cost and inconvenience is a competitive advantage for international” on november   navistar revealed it would use epa credits in order to comply with the  legislation in february  ustian touted the benefits of egr technology as a key differentiator for the companys engines however by now the rest of the industry had chosen to use the compliant scr technology ustian disagreed with scr saying the other thing that egr avoids is the risks of an scr strategy read the label on this and it will show you that there are challenges with keeping control of using this technology ‘store between  degrees and  degrees’ so essentially it says you can’t throw it outside you can’t operate it in conditions above  degrees or below  degrees you can but it will put the burden onto the customers”  nonconformance penaltiesedit the epa recognized navistars imminent noncompliance and created a system of nonconformance penalties ncps that included a  fine for every noncompliant engine that navistar sold to bridge the gap navistar began using epa credits it had previously earned for being compliant in lieu of paying fines in august  navistar stated they would run out of epa credits soon only days earlier the epa announced increased new penalties of  per engine in march  navistar sued the epa claiming that the agency’s guidance documents for scr implementation were invalid because they were adopted without a public process and with input only from the scr engine makers navistar and the epa settled the lawsuit a year later further masking the egr problem were high military sales in the companys  k report navistar cited orders for mraps as offsetting flat commercial sales due to the recession move to lisle iledit in september  despite uncertainty over egr and a sluggish economy navistar leadership revived an effort to relocate the company headquarters from warrenville il to nearby lisle il the new headquarters was expected to retain or create  permanent jobs and about  construction jobs navistar president dan ustian said roughly  engineers would be hired immediately navistar aimed to invest  million in the  millionsquarefoot lisle campus which would include product development the state gave navistar incentives of nearly  million including tax credits in march  navistar announced the move to lisle renovations were completed in the fall but the company gradually moved from warrenville to lisle in summer  you cant build a campus like this anywhere for anywhere near the price we paid for this and even though you might get more incentives when you look at the whole picture you really cant beat it said don sharp navistar vice president in  navistar began phasing out its truck development and technology center tdtc in fort wayne indiana in early december  the company laid off  employees mostly engineers and designers who were united auto workers members in total  out of  fort wayne employees eventually accepted offers to relocate to illinois the other  workers either retired or chose to remain in indiana and find work elsewhere the cost to move employees and consolidate operations was estimated to be  million the only navistar employees remaining after december  were  people manning the company’s test track on oxford street in late july  the tdtc closed and the remaining workers were let go in january  the epa adopted an interim final rule that allowed navistar to continue selling the engines subject to ncps several navistar competitors sued and in june  the same appeals court ruled that epa’s interim rule was invalid because it did not give the public notice and an opportunity for comment in the mean time navistars egr decision had led to significant reliability and quality problems truck drivers began losing trust and confidence as navistar vehicles were breaking down frequently consequently they abandoned navistar trucks in favor of competitors trucks tension mountsedit in june  speculation mounted about a possible takeover of the struggling truck maker this came as hedge fund mhr fund management llc disclosed a  stake in the company slightly higher than billionaire activist investor carl icahns  stake as a result navistar adopted a poison pill defense if the plan were triggered by an outside investor taking a stake of  percent or more in the company then navistar would issue its shareholders rights that would let them buy new common stock in the company at a discount of  percent for each share

contingent on a share price of  on oct   the end of the companys fiscal year on september   billionaire and key stock holder carl icahn sent an open letter to navistars board blasting them for abysmal business decisions and poor corporate governance icahn noted from  that this board has authorized spending shareholder money on lawsuits against suppliers competitors and regulators marketing plans to convince customers that noncompliant engines are actually compliant accumulating noncore assets such as a recreational vehicle manufacturer and a goldplated corporate headquarters that cost over  million the one thing this board refused to spend money on was a backup plan involving the industry standard technology navistar now must rely on in a september  interview cummins ceo tom linebarger said all we did was act nice to them navistar even when they didnt talk nicely about us he smiled recalling harsh comments that navistar executives had made about scr being used by all its competitors

harvester fell on hard times during the poor agricultural economy in the early to mids and the effects of a long strike with the uaw over proposed work rule changes ihs new ceo donald lennox directed the management organization to begin exiting many of its ihs historical business sectors in an effort to survive some of the sales of profitable business endeavors were executed to raise cash for shortterm survival while other divisions were sold due to lack of immediate profitability during this period of questionable economic survival in an effort to raise needed cash and to reduce losses the management team led by mr lennox at ih shed many of its operating divisions construction equipment division to dresser industries solar gas turbines division to caterpillar cub cadet lawn and garden equipment to mtd products and lastly the agricultural division to tenneco which merged it with their ji case subsidiary the scout and light truck parts business was sold to scoutlight line

numerous epa regulations to reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides and soot emanating from diesel engines despite the change in the compliance arena the regulations would not begin to be phased in until  with full implementation slated for  ustian had multiple engineering paths available among them were selective catalytic reduction scr exhaust gas recirculation egr or the use of nitrogen oxide absorbers all required more engineering and development to achieve compliance ustian believed truckers did not want to bother with an extra tank of fluid aftertreatment as a result he convinced the company to spend  million to fund egr development on october   navistar formally announced their intent to move forward with egr as the companys strategy the company statement included ustian mentioning “i have publicly been an advocate of customer friendly emissions control solutions which do not add additional costs to our truck and bus customers while scr is a means to achieve the nox reduction requirement for  it comes with a steep cost to our customers our ability to achieve our goals without adding customer cost and inconvenience is a competitive advantage for international” on november   navistar revealed it would use epa credits in order to comply with the  legislation in february  ustian touted the benefits of egr technology as a key differentiator for the companys engines however by now the rest of the industry had chosen to use the compliant scr technology ustian disagreed with scr saying the other thing that egr avoids is the risks of an scr strategy read the

international brand military vehicles through its affiliate navistar defense  transition from agricultural rootsedit international harvester fell on hard times during the poor agricultural economy in the early to mids and the effects of a long strike with the uaw over proposed work rule changes ihs new ceo donald lennox directed the management organization to begin exiting many of its ihs historical business sectors in an effort to survive some of the sales of profitable business endeavors were executed to raise cash for shortterm survival while other divisions were sold due to lack of immediate profitability during this period of questionable economic survival in an effort to raise needed cash and to reduce losses the management team led by mr lennox at ih shed many of its operating divisions construction equipment division to dresser industries solar gas turbines division to caterpillar cub cadet lawn and garden equipment to mtd products and lastly the agricultural division to tenneco which merged it with their ji case subsidiary the scout and light truck parts business was sold to scoutlight line distributors inc in  after the agricultural division sale in  all that remained of ih was the truck and engine divisions the company changed its name in  to navistar international corporation the international harvester name and ih logo were assets of the agricultural division and consequently were part of the sale to tenneco the ih name and logo are still in use having been incorporated into the case ih brand name in the early s ih developed a series

who took over production and sales of general motors’ popular pseries stepvan chassis when gm dropped it a manufacturer of stepvan and motor home chassis to seemingly reenter the delivery van market

michigan is the contracting activity present failed engine strategy layoffs consolidation and turnaroundedit failed engine strategyedit in  then ceo dan ustian faced numerous epa regulations to reduce the amount of nitrogen oxides and soot emanating from diesel engines despite the change in the compliance arena the regulations would not begin to be phased in until  with full implementation slated for  ustian had multiple engineering paths available among them were selective catalytic reduction scr exhaust gas recirculation egr or the use of nitrogen oxide absorbers all required more engineering and development to achieve compliance ustian believed truckers did not want to bother with an extra tank of fluid aftertreatment as a result he convinced the company to spend  million to fund egr development on october   navistar formally announced their intent to move forward with egr as the companys strategy the company statement included ustian mentioning “i have publicly been an advocate of customer friendly emissions control solutions which do not add additional costs to our truck and bus customers while scr is a means to achieve the nox reduction requirement for  it comes with a steep cost to our customers our ability to achieve our goals without adding customer cost and inconvenience is a competitive advantage for international” on november   navistar revealed it would use epa credits in order to comply with the  legislation in february  ustian touted the benefits of egr technology as a key differentiator for the companys engines however by now the rest of the industry had chosen to use the compliant scr technology ustian disagreed with scr saying the other thing that egr avoids is the risks of an scr strategy read the label on this and it will show you that there are challenges with keeping control of using this technology ‘store between  degrees and  degrees’ so essentially it says you can’t throw it outside you can’t operate it in conditions above  degrees or below  degrees you can but it will put the burden onto the customers”  nonconformance penaltiesedit the epa recognized navistars imminent noncompliance and created a system of nonconformance penalties ncps that included a  fine for every noncompliant engine that navistar sold to bridge the gap navistar began using epa credits it had previously earned for being compliant in lieu of paying fines in august  navistar stated they would run out of epa credits soon only days earlier the epa announced increased new penalties of  per engine in march  navistar sued the epa claiming that the agency’s guidance documents for scr implementation were invalid because they were adopted without a public process and with input only from the scr engine makers navistar and the epa settled the lawsuit a year later further masking the egr problem were high military sales in the companys  k report navistar cited orders for mraps as offsetting flat commercial sales due to the recession move to lisle iledit in september  despite uncertainty over egr and a sluggish economy navistar leadership revived an effort to relocate the company headquarters from warrenville il to nearby lisle il the new headquarters was expected to retain or create  permanent jobs and about  construction jobs navistar president dan ustian said roughly  engineers would be hired immediately

than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be
