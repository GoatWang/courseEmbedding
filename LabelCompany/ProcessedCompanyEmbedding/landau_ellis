sophia freund prizes for academic achievementnewcomen and hoopes prizes for outstanding senior thesiscertificate in latin american studies spanish professional profile chris landau is a senior partner in the firm’s appellate litigation practice and was one of the founders of that practice almost twentyfive years ago he has briefed and argued appeals involving a wide range of subject matters in courts all across the country including the united states supreme court every one of the federal courts of appeals and many state appellate courts chris served twice as a law clerk at the us supreme court first to justice antonin scalia – and then to justice clarence thomas – over the past two terms the us supreme court has granted review of five petitions in a row in which chris served as counsel of record in  the chief justice appointed chris to a threeyear term as a member of the judicial conference advisory committee on appellate rules which makes recommendations for changes to the federal rules of appellate procedure  chris is a strong believer in the value of an appellate generalist by the time a case reaches the appellate level the client and counsel may have lived with the case or the subjectmatter for so long that they can lose perspective on how it fits into the broader fabric of american law for the most part however our judges are generalists and will approach the case from that broader perspective a good appellate lawyer can help bridge the gap between subjectmatter specialists and generalist judges whether a particular case started at kirkland or another firm chris works closely with the subjectmatter specialists with the client or the trial team to maximize the chances for appellate success having focused on appellate litigation for a quarter century chris is a recognized leader in the field indeed when a group of federal judges decided to bring a lawsuit alleging that the constitution does not allow congress to withhold judicial salary adjustments previously established by law they turned to chris and he succeeded in overturning prior binding precedent to vindicate the judges’ constitutional claim see beer v united states  fd  fed cir  en banc and chris is a “lawyer’s lawyer” he is intimately and personally involved in every aspect of a case from developing the strategy of which issues to pursue or not pursue on appeal to the drafting of the briefs to the oral argument at the end of the day there is no substitute for such close involvement and attention to each client’s needs representative matters focus on appellate

robert g krupka partner kirkland  ellis llpkirkland  ellis llp what do inhouse attorney positions pay top law firm salaries  back to all articles the life and career of christopher landau partner kirkland  ellis llp by regan morris  views christopher landau  grew up traveling the world the son of a diplomat mr landau was born in spain and spent much of his childhood in south america intrigued by international relations landau planned to follow in his fathers footsteps even while in law school i cannot say since i was six years old i had a burning desire to be an attorney he said im always a little bit suspicious of people who say thats their path i went to law school because i thought it would be good training for pursuing a career in any number of fields in fact just a few weeks into law school landau was miserable he wasnt familiar with the legal lingo and wondered what he was doing and why landau knew law school was a good way to sharpen his analytical skills but he didnt really want to practice as an attorney he stuck it out and even began to enjoy it and he excelled landau graduated magna cum laude in  and won the sears prize awarded to the two students with the highest gpas their second year he was also articles editor at the harvard law review when asked how he went from struggling to understand the lingo to top of the class landau pauses searching for the right words its funny it took a while he said ill always do whats at hand but i certainly didnt—well it just didnt come naturally to me his hard work paid off landau clerked for judge clarence thomas on the us court of appeals dc circuit in  and then was asked to clerk for justice antonin scalia on the supreme court from  to  when justice thomas moved up to the supreme court landau joined him again and now he runs kirkland  ellis appellate practice but it was the experiences clerking that convinced landau to pursue a career in law instead of diplomacy i enjoyed being able to figure out and work my way through complicated cases and reach the right result under the law he said its very challenging and a big responsibility to get it right and i just really enjoyed that role i enjoyed trying to help out and give advice to my justices about things i think for me at least academics was fun and interesting but i like to actually feel like my work is making a positive effect having a positive effect in the real world on peoples lives kenneth starr gave landau his first big break when starr was on the dc circuit court of appeals landau also did a stint at the justice department i worked in the justice department for a few months and one of my jobs was to work on the confirmation of clarence thomas in the dc circuit he was nominated to the appeals court where he served for a about a year and a half before he went to the supreme court he said i worked on his confirmation then he asked me to be a law clerk of his on the dc circuit landau still considered taking the foreign service exam to pursue a diplomatic career but he changed his mind the law proved to be an interesting career he moved to kirkland  ellis  years ago he said he is often pleased that his practice has an international perspective im somewhat pleasantly surprised at how a lot of these international issues do come up in my practice he said one of my big cases now is about a dispute over the right to drill for oil between australia and east timor halfway around the world and theres some really interesting and tricky international law there he will also be arguing a case in ninth circuit in a few weeks concerning the enforcement of a judgment from nicaragua against several american companies for  million landaus rise from unsure student to appellant expert should encourage anyone doubting himherself in law school or early in hisher career he said he believes its common for young attorneys to feel nervous about their jobs and that it gets easier over time now an experienced attorney known for strong oral arguments landau said he used to worry about being called on in law school in law school it was my first exposure to the socratic method and i remember always being terrified of being called on he said i was one of the quiet people in law school honing his argument skills took practice he said he observed his mentors in the supreme court and elsewhere looking back on my first few oral arguments as an attorney i certainly got very uptight and it was not a skill that came naturally to me he said now im much more relaxed when i get up and do a case but that was certainly a skill i acquired although landau has worked on several cases and briefs in the supreme court he will soon be arguing his first case there as lead counsel buckeye check cashing inc v cardegna is a federal arbitration act case that will decide whether the act allows a party to avoid arbitration by claiming the underlying contract containing an arbitration clause is illegal and were saying no landau said if youre not saying that the arbitration agreement within the contract is illegal then the court has to enforce the arbitration agreement and the arbitrator has to decide whether the underlying contract is illegal you cant leapfrog over the arbitration clause just by saying the underlying contract is illegal landau who lived in france for a year before law school and is fluent in french and spanish said he found his niche in appellate work and encourages others to keep looking until they find what makes them happy ive always focused on appellate practice and along the way worked my way up and now im running that practice he said i think the great thing about our profession is there are so many ways to take a law degree and take legal training and create a career that you enjoy and if at first you dont succeed never give up he said i would say its important to show everyone else that you care about your work that you take pride in your work and that youre there when the chips are down and you can pull through in a crunch he said it gets so much easier as you get experience in this business—maybe thats true in any business—that your comfort level just goes up
