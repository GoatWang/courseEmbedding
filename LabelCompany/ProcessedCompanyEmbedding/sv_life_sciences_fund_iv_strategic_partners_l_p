executive compensation compensation discussion and analysis this compensation discussion and analysis cda describes our compensation program for our named executive officers named executive officers during the year ended december   the following discussion focuses on our compensation program and compensationrelated decisions for  and also addresses why we believe our compensation program is appropriate for the company business overview for  the company is a medical device company that is pioneering the use of robotics to improve minimally invasive surgery by addressing the clinical challenges associated with current laparoscopic and robotic options the company is focused on the commercialization and further development of its senhance system a multiport robotic system that brings the advantages of robotic surgery to patients while enabling surgeons with innovative technology the company also developed the surgibot system a singleport robotically enhanced laparoscopic surgical platform the senhance system has been granted a ce mark in europe for laparoscopic abdominal and pelvic surgery as well as limited thoracic operations excluding cardiac and vascular surgery but is not available for sale in the us the surgibot system is not available for sale in any market the senhance system is a multiport robotic surgery system which allows multiple arms to control robotic instruments and a camera the system features advanced technology to enable surgeons with haptic feedback and the ability to move the camera via eye movement the system replicates laparoscopic motion that is familiar to experienced surgeons and features dhd vision technology the senhance system also offers responsible economics to hospitals by offering robotic technology with reusable instruments with minimal additional costs per surgery the surgibot system is designed to utilize flexible instruments through articulating channels controlled directly by the surgeon with robotic assistance while the surgeon remains patientside within the sterile field in june  the company submitted a k application to the fda for the surgibot system on april   the fda notified the company that the surgibot system did not meet the criteria for substantial equivalence based on the data and information submitted by transenterix in the k submission after interactions with the fda the company determined that a new k application would need to be submitted in order to obtain clearance for the surgibot system based on this fact the company evaluated the operational and financial feasibility of pursuing two k applications in parallel and elected to primarily focus the companys near term regulatory efforts on the k submission for the senhance system and its current strategy is to focus the companys resources on the commercialization of and regulatory clearance for the senhance system consequently in may  the company implemented a restructuring plan the restructuring plan resulted in  reducing the companys workforce  abandoning certain equipment  cancelling certain contracts  writing off inventory related to the surgibot system and  writing off certain patents compensation philosophy the company believes it is vital to link executive compensation to corporate performance and to create incentives for management to enhance company value in accordance with its compensation philosophy the company seeks to attract and retain employees through salary levels that are competitive with the local market and similarly situated companies but generally to follow the market rather than lead the market particularly with respect to cash compensation and offer attractive equity and cashbased incentive components to align compensation with company performance objectives the company desires over time to move total direct compensation toward the median of comparable companies while remaining more aggressive in the use of equitybased compensation but not in a market leader position the company believes this approach allows it to attract and retain candidates that support the company culture of being motivated by aggressive goals and optimism about the future while permitting the company to preserve the use of cash for incentive compensation    table of contents the company is the result of a reverse merger of a privately held venturebacked company and a publicly traded company consummated on september   the merger and the subsequent acquisition of the senhance system in  the compensation committees focus for  was to establish a program to provide compensation to the executives aligned with the companys need to integrate the senhance system development and early commercialization activities and the surgibot system development activities with a focus on performancebased incentive compensation designed to incentivize the named executive officers to pursue regulatory approval for the surgibot system in the

bonus levels for the other named executive officers and executive team the compensation committee at least annually discusses such recommendations with the chief executive officer the compensation committee may in its sole discretion approve in whole or in part the recommendations of the chief executive officer in  the compensation committee approved the chief executive officers

discretionary authority may be exercised by the proxy holders named in the enclosed proxy to vote for a substitute nominee proposed by the board of directors if any nominee becomes unavailable for election proposal two  advisory vote on executive compensation say on pay in july  the doddfrank wall street reform and consumer protection act of  the doddfrank act was enacted under the doddfrank act the company is providing the stockholders a vote to approve on an advisory nonbinding basis the compensation paid to our named executive officers in  as disclosed in this proxy statement in accordance with the secs rules this proposal commonly known as a sayonpay proposal gives the stockholders the opportunity to express their views on our named executive officers compensation this vote is not intended to address any specific element of our executive compensation programs but rather to address our overall approach to the compensation of our named executive officers as described in this proxy statement the board is asking the stockholders to indicate their support for our executive compensation program as described in this proxy statement by voting for the following resolution resolved that the stockholders approve on an advisory basis the compensation of the named executive officers for  as disclosed in this proxy statement pursuant to the compensation disclosure rules of the securities and exchange commission including the compensation discussion and analysis the summary compensation table and the other compensation tables and disclosure advisory nature of the vote because this vote is advisory it will not be binding upon the company the compensation committee or the board however the compensation committee and the board value the opinions of the stockholders and to the extent there is any significant vote against the companys compensation practices for the named executive    table of contents officers as disclosed in this proxy statement the board will consider this stockholders vote and the compensation committee will evaluate whether any actions are necessary to address the stockholders concerns when considering future executive compensation arrangements vote required and recommendation proposal two requires the affirmative vote of a majority of the shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote the board of directors recommends that stockholders vote for the proposal unless otherwise specified the enclosed proxy will be voted for approval of proposal two proposal three  advisory vote on the frequency of say on pay the doddfrank act also requires us to provide the stockholders with an advisory vote on how frequently in the future the company should seek an advisory vote approving the compensation of our named executive officers as disclosed pursuant to the secs compensation disclosure rules in voting on this proposal three stockholders may indicate whether they would prefer an advisory vote on named executive officers compensation once every one two or three years if desired as set forth in the attached proxy a stockholder may abstain from voting on proposal three the board has considered the doddfrank act requirements for such sayonpay frequency vote and has determined that an advisory vote on executive compensation that occurs every year is the most appropriate alternative for the company the appropriate frequency of an advisory vote on executive compensation is the subject of diverging opinions and views and the board believes there is reasonable basis for each of the three options less frequency would encourage a more longterm rather than shortterm analysis of our executive compensation programs and would avoid the burden that annual votes would impose on stockholders required to evaluate the executive compensation program each year on the other hand greater frequency provides stockholders the opportunity to react promptly to emerging trends in compensation and gives the board and the compensation committee the opportunity to evaluate the compensation program each year in light of timely input from stockholders advisory nature of the vote because this vote is advisory it will not be binding upon the company the compensation committee or the board however the compensation committee and the board of directors values the stockholders opinions and will consider the outcome of the vote when determining the frequency of future advisory votes on executive compensation vote required and recommendation the alternative of one year two years or three years that receives the affirmative vote of the majority of shares present in person or by proxy and entitled to vote will be deemed the choice of the stockholders if no one frequency selection alternative receives such majority vote the alternative receiving the most votes will be deemed the choice of the stockholders the board of directors recommends that stockholders vote for one year in proposal three unless otherwise specified the enclosed proxy will be voted for one year    table of contents proposal four  amendment to the amended and restated incentive

launch activities in the us related to the senhance system in conjunction with the acquisition of the senhance system the company increased its employee base including adding a number of members of its senior management team in anticipation of the need for additional senior management team members to assist in commercialization of the companys products and products in development management recognizes that additional employees advisors and consultants may be hired or retained the company wants to position itself to be able to provide equity awards to such newly hired officers and other

discretion permit transfers for estate planning or other purposes subject to any applicable restrictions under rule b awards under the plan are generally granted without a requirement that the recipient pay consideration in the form of cash or property for the grant as distinguished from the exercise except to the extent required by law the committee may however grant awards in exchange for other awards under the plan awards under other company plans or other rights to payment from the company and may grant awards in addition to and in tandem with other rights or awards acceleration of

addition the committee may provide in an award agreement that the performance goals relating to any performance award will be deemed to have been met upon the occurrence of any change in control    table of contents amendment and termination the board may amend alter suspend discontinue or terminate the plan or the committees authority to grant awards without further stockholder approval except that stockholder approval must be obtained for any amendment or alteration if that approval is required by law or regulation or under the rules of any stock exchange or quotation system on which our shares of common stock are then listed or quoted thus stockholder approval may not necessarily be required for every amendment to the plan which might increase the cost of the plan or alter the eligibility of persons to receive awards stockholder approval will not be deemed to be required under laws or regulations such as those relating to isos that condition favorable treatment of participants on such approval although the board may in its discretion seek stockholder approval in any circumstance in which it deems such approval advisable unless earlier terminated by the board the plan will terminate at the earliest of a when no shares of common stock remain available for issuance under the plan b termination of the plan by the board or c the tenth anniversary of the effective date of the plan awards outstanding upon expiration of the plan will remain in effect until they have been exercised or terminated or have expired material us federal income tax consequences of awards the following is a summary of material us federal income tax considerations relating to the plan the summary is based on us federal income tax laws and regulations presently in effect which are subject to change possibly retroactively tax laws are complex and may vary depending on individual circumstances and from locality to locality this discussion does not purport to be a complete description of the us federal income tax aspects of the plan and does not address state local or foreign tax consequences all participants in the plan are urged to consult their own tax advisors regarding the us federal state local and foreign income and other tax consequences of participating in the plan based on the participants personal circumstances nonqualified stock options under the code the grant of a nonqualified stock option is generally not taxable to the optionee on exercise of a nonqualified stock option granted under the plan an optionee will recognize ordinary income equal to the excess if any of the fair market value of the shares acquired over the exercise price the optionees tax basis in those shares will be equal to their fair market value on the date of exercise of the option and the optionees holding period for those shares will begin on that date upon an optionees sale of shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of a nonqualified stock option any difference between the sale price and the fair market value of the shares on the date when the stock option was exercised will be treated as longterm or shortterm capital gain or loss if an optionee pays for shares of stock on exercise of an option by delivering shares of common stock the optionee will not recognize gain or loss on the shares delivered even if the fair market value of such shares differs from the optionees tax basis in such shares the optionee however will be taxed on the exercise of the option in the manner described above as if he had paid the exercise price in cash the tax basis of the shares received upon exercise will be the tax basis of the shares delivered as payment share for share to the extent the number of shares received equals the number of shares delivered as payment in addition the holding period of the shares received will include the holding period of the shares delivered as payment the optionees tax basis and holding period for any shares received in excess of the number of shares delivered by the optionee will be the same as if the optionee had exercised the option solely in exchange for cash upon an optionees exercise of a nonqualified stock option the company or the applicable subsidiary will generally be entitled to a deduction for us federal income tax purposes at such time and in the same amount recognized as ordinary income to the optionee subject to the possible limitations on deductibility under sections g and m of the code for compensation paid to executives designated in those sections and provided that the company effects withholding with respect to the deemed compensation    table of contents incentive stock options the plan provides for the grant of stock options that qualify as incentive stock options isos as defined in section  of the code under the code an optionee generally is not subject to tax upon the grant or exercise of an iso in addition if the optionee holds a share of stock received on exercise of an iso for at least two years from the date the option was granted and at least one year from the date the option was exercised the required holding period the difference if any between the amount realized on a sale or other taxable disposition of that share and the holders tax basis in that share will be longterm capital gain or loss if however an optionee disposes of a share of stock acquired on exercise of an iso before the end of the required holding period a disqualifying disposition the optionee generally will recognize ordinary income in the year of the disqualifying disposition equal to the excess if any of the fair market value of the share on the date the iso was exercised or if less the amount realized on such disqualifying disposition over the exercise price if the amount realized on a disqualifying disposition exceeds the fair market value of the share on the date of exercise of the option the excess gain recognized will be shortterm or longterm capital gain depending upon the length of time the shares have been held after the date of exercise if an optionee exercises an iso by delivering shares of stock acquired by an earlier exercise of an iso and the previously acquired shares have not been held for the required holding period the optionee will recognize ordinary income on the disqualifying disposition for purposes of the alternative minimum tax the amount by which the fair market value of a share of stock acquired on exercise of an iso exceeds the exercise price of that option generally will be an adjustment included in the optionees alternative minimum taxable income for the year in which the option is exercised if however there is a disqualifying disposition of the share in the year in which the option is exercised there will be no adjustment with respect to that share if there is a disqualifying disposition in a later year no income with respect to the disqualifying disposition is included in the optionees alternative minimum taxable income for that year the company is not entitled to take a deduction for us federal income tax purposes with respect to the grant or exercise of an incentive stock option or the disposition of a share acquired on exercise of an incentive stock option after the required holding period however if there is a disqualifying disposition of a share the company is entitled to a deduction in an amount equal to the ordinary income includible in income by the optionee subject to the possible limitations on deductibility under sections g and m of the code for compensation paid to executives designated in those sections and provided that the company effects withholding with respect to the deemed compensation restricted stock generally the recipient of a stock award will recognize ordinary compensation income at the time the stock is received equal to the excess if any of the fair market value of the stock received over any amount paid by the recipient in exchange for the stock if however the stock is not vested when it is received under the plan for example if the employee is required to work for a period of time in order to have the right to sell the stock the recipient generally will not recognize income until the stock becomes vested at which time the recipient will recognize ordinary compensation income equal to the excess if any of the fair market value of the stock on the date it becomes vested over any amount paid by the recipient in exchange for the stock a recipient may however file a section b election with the internal revenue service within  days of his or her receipt of the stock award to recognize ordinary compensation income at the time the shares are awarded in an amount equal to their fair market value at that time notwithstanding that such share are not vested and may be subsequently forfeited if you make such an election you will not recognize any additional taxable income at the time the shares become vested but if the shares are later forfeited you will not be allowed a tax deduction for the forfeited shares    table of contents the recipients basis for the determination of gain or loss upon the subsequent disposition of shares acquired as stock awards will be the amount paid for such shares plus any ordinary income recognized either when the stock is received or when the stock becomes vested upon the disposition of any stock received as a stock award under the plan the difference between the sales price and the recipients basis in the shares will be treated as a capital gain or loss and generally will be characterized as longterm capital gain or loss if the shares have been held for more than one year from the date as of which he or she would be required to recognize any compensation income the company will be entitled to a deduction for us federal income tax purposes equal to the amount of ordinary income taxable to the recipient subject to the possible limitations on deductibility under sections g and m of the code for compensation paid to executives designated in those sections and provided that the company effects withholding with respect to the deemed compensation deferred stock a participant who receives an award of deferred stock will generally not recognize any income on the grant of such award however the participant will recognize ordinary compensation income on the receipt of the actual stock equal to the fair market value of the stock received if at the time of transfer the stock received is subject to a substantial risk of forfeiture the tax treatment will be the same as the tax treatment of restricted stock as discussed above the company will be entitled to a deduction for us federal income tax purposes equal to the amount of ordinary income taxable to the recipient subject to the possible limitations on deductibility under sections g and m of the code for compensation paid to executives designated in those sections and provided that the company effects withholding with respect to the deemed compensation other stock awards the us federal income tax consequences of any other stock awards will depend upon the specific facts and circumstances of each award including in particular the nature of any restrictions imposed with respect to the awards bonus stock and awards in lieu of obligations a participant who receives a stock payment in lieu of a cash payment that would otherwise have been made will generally be taxed as if the cash payment has been received and the company generally will be entitled to a deduction for the same amount performancebased awards a participant who has been granted a performancebased award generally will not recognize taxable income at the time of grant and the company will not be entitled to a deduction for us federal income tax purposes at that time when an award is paid whether in cash or shares of common stock the participant generally will recognize ordinary income and the company will be entitled to a corresponding deduction the recipients tax basis in any shares acquired pursuant to a performancebased award is the amount recognized by him or her as income attributable to such shares upon a subsequent disposition of the shares the recipient will generally realize a capital gain or loss as applicable stock appreciation rights the company may grant stock appreciation rights sars separate from any other award or in tandem with options under the plan generally the recipient of an sar will not recognize any taxable income at the time    table of contents the sar is granted when the sar is exercised the recipient receives the appreciation inherent in the sars in cash and such cash will be taxable as ordinary compensation income to the recipient at the time that the cash is received if the recipient receives the appreciation inherent in the sars in shares of stock the recipient will recognize ordinary compensation income equal to the excess of the fair market value of the stock on the day it is received over any amounts paid by the recipient for the stock the company will be entitled to a deduction for us federal income tax purposes in an amount equal to the amount recognized by the recipient as ordinary income subject to the possible limitations on deductibility under sections g and m of the code for compensation paid to executives designated in those sections and provided that the company effects withholding with respect to the deemed compensation sars may be issued in tandem with a stock option under this type of arrangement the exercise of a sar will result in the cancellation of an option and the exercise of an option will result in a cancellation of a sar if the recipient of a tandem sar elects to surrender the underlying option in exchange for cash or shares of stock equal to the appreciation inherent in the underlying option the tax consequences to the recipient will be the same as discussed above relating to the sars if the recipient elects to exercise the underlying option the holder will be taxed at the time of exercise as if he or she had exercised a nonqualified stock option as previously discussed above as a result the recipient will recognize ordinary income for federal tax purposes measured by the excess of the then fair market value of the shares of stock over the exercise price dividend equivalents generally the recipient of a dividend equivalent award will recognize ordinary compensation income at the time the dividend equivalent award is received equal to the fair market value of the amount received the company generally will be entitled to a deduction for us federal income tax purposes equal to the amount of ordinary income that the employee is required to recognize as a result of the dividend equivalent award subject to the possible limitations on deductibility under sections g and m of the code for compensation paid to executives designated in those sections and provided that the company effects withholding with respect to the deemed compensation tax withholding ordinary income recognized in connection with the receipt or exercise of an award under the plan is subject to income and employment tax wage withholding unless the participant is not an employee of the company or any subsidiary or affiliate the company or any subsidiary or affiliate may deduct from all payments made under the plan an amount which may include shares of common stock to satisfy any federal state local or foreign withholding obligations with respect to any award section a of the code section a of the code governs the taxation of deferred compensation awards received under the plan are intended to be exempt from the requirements of section a where possible however there can be no assurance that awards designed to be exempt from section a will in fact be exempt an award that is subject to section a and fails to satisfy its requirements will subject the holder of the award to immediate taxation an interest penalty and an additional  tax on the amount underlying the award section  limitations in general under section m of the code income tax deductions of publiclyheld corporations may be limited to the extent total compensation for certain executive officers exceeds  in any one year under section m the deduction limit does not apply to certain performancebased compensation established by an independent compensation committee that is adequately disclosed to and approved by stockholders in particular stock options will satisfy the performancebased compensation exception if the awards are made by    table of contents a qualifying compensation committee the plan sets the maximum number of shares that can be granted to any person within a specified period the compensation is based solely on an increase in the stock price after the grant date and certain other requirements are met the company has attempted to structure the plan in such a manner that the remuneration attributable to stock options and other awards which meet the requirements of section m will not be subject to the  limitation the company has not however requested a ruling from the irs or an opinion of counsel regarding this issue  section g of the code under certain circumstances the accelerated vesting or exercise of options or the accelerated lapse of restrictions on stock awards in connection with a change in control could be deemed an excess parachute payment for purposes of the parachute tax provisions of section g of the code in that event the grantee could be subject to a  excise tax and the company or applicable subsidiary could be denied a tax deduction with respect to a portion of the grants importance of consulting tax adviser the information set forth above is a summary only and does not purport to be complete in addition the information is based upon current us federal income tax rules and therefore is subject to change when those rules change moreover because the tax consequences to any recipient may depend on his or her particular situation each recipient should consult his or her tax adviser as to the federal state local and other tax
