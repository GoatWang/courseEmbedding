commands the ic dod the department of homeland security and other government agencies we continue to carefully follow federal budget legislative and contracting trends and activities and evolve our strategies to take these into consideration since march  the federal government has been operating under sequestration required by the bca under sequestration constraints on discretionary expenditures have taken place each of the governments fiscal years since  and unless the bca is amended or repealed will continue through the governments fiscal year  at the end of october  the bipartisan budget act of  bba was passed and signed into law raising the discretionary spending caps under the bca by  billion and  billion in the governments fiscal years  and  respectively prior to the end of the governments fiscal year  no appropriations legislation for the governments fiscal year  was enacted as a result at the end of september  a continuing resolution was signed into law which kept the government operating until december   when congress reconvened following the november general election a second continuing resolution was passed and signed into law by the president that keeps the government operating until april   subsequent to the inauguration of the new administration congress is expected to address the fiscal year  budget and the funding of the government through september  we expect the impact of the above legislation and actions congress will take on contracts and task orders we hold and may receive to continue throughout our fy we are continuously reviewing our operations in an attempt to identify those programs that are potentially at risk from the consequences of sequestration beyond the coverage of the bba so that we can make appropriate contingency plans should that be necessary we are experiencing reduced funding on some of our programs and may experience further reductions but we do not expect the cancellation of any of our major programs we also continue to face some uncertainties due to the current general business environment and we continue to see protests of major contract awards and delays in government procurement activities in addition many of our federal government contracts require us to employ personnel with security clearances specific levels of education and specific past work experience depending on the level of clearance security clearances can be difficult and timeconsuming to obtain and competition for skilled personnel in the information technology services industry is intense in addition a shift of expenditures away from programs that we support could cause federal government agencies to reduce their purchases under contracts to exercise their right to terminate contracts at any time without penalty or to decide not to exercise options to renew contracts additional factors that could affect our federal government contracting business include an increase in setasides for small businesses and budgetary priorities limiting or delaying federal government spending in general results of operations for the three months ended december   and  revenue the table below sets forth revenue by customer type with

detainees allege that the companies directed and participated in torture war crimes crimes against humanity sexual assault as well as cruel inhuman and degrading treatment at abu ghraib prison the us government had hired caci and titan to provide interrogation and translation services at military prisons in iraq in  the us court of appeals for the dc circuit ruled in caci’s favor in the lawsuit and ordered its dismissal the us supreme court then declined to review that decision  caci employee steven stephanowicz and several military officers were investigated in the taguba inquiry a subsequent investigation of military intelligence operations at abu ghraib found that contractors were involved in  percent of the abu ghraib proven incidents and identified  employees as individually culpable but none have been prosecuted caci responseedit according to cacis website the company provided a range of information technology it and intelligence services in iraq these services included intelligence analysis background investigations screenings interrogation property management and recordkeeping and installation of computer systems software and hardware only a small portion of these employees worked as interrogators the company states that no caci employee or former employee has been indicted for any misconduct in connection with this work and no caci employee or former employee appears in any of the photos released from abu ghraib caci also adds that they are no longer providing interrogation services in iraq which concluded in the early fall of  upon the conclusion of a contract with the department of the army caci also adds nonetheless we do not condone tolerate or endorse any illegal behavior by our employees in any circumstance or at any time we will act forcefully if the evidence shows that any of our employees acted improperly but we will not rush to judgment on the basis of speculation innuendo partial reports or incomplete investigations caci also claims on their website that us government reports generally concluded that civilian interrogators performed their duties in an appropriate fashion and made a major contribution to the us mission in iraq caci further claims a march  report by us navy inspector general and vice admiral albert t church shows that despite the publicity surrounding abu ghraib we found very few instances of abuse involving contractors caci chairman of the board dr jack london defended the company with a book caci our good name lawsuitedit in may  four former abu ghraib prison detainees brought separate lawsuits in four us courts against caci and l communications as well as against three civilians one of these former inmates emad aljanabi sued l and caci for allowing their employees to abuse him physically and mentally at the prison in a statement released on its website caci has stated that these lawsuits are baseless and they reject emphatically this latest plaintiffs allegations and claims calling on numerous and thorough government investigations in these allegations on march   us district judge gerald bruce lee rejected claims by caci that it could not be sued because its interrogators were performing duties prescribed by the contract with the us government caci responded that it vowed to pursue all of its legal alternatives to defend itself and vindicate the companys good name and that from day one caci has rejected the outrageous allegations against the company in this lawsuit and continues to do so on september   the us court of appeals ruled that caci did in fact fall under us military chain of command and thus had government contractor immunity subsequently the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit reheard the appeal with all active judges participating and in an  decision held that the appeal was premature the action was remanded to the district court for further proceedings on remand the plaintiffs were able to conduct full discovery into their claims after that discovery the plaintiffs had not identified any evidence that showed that anyone affiliated with caci had any contact with the plaintiffs in june  judge lee dismissed the suit due to lack of jurisdiction on appeal the us court of appeals for the th circuit found that the lower court had erred in dismissing the suit in june  as it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case because the alleged incidents occurred overseas the appellate court vacated the district court’s decision and remanded the case for a determination of whether plaintiffs’ claims were barred by the political question doctrine  in june  the us district court again dismissed the case against caci holding that caci’s actions were controlled by the us military and that assessing torture and war crimes claims would require impermissible review of the us military’s judgment and thus the issues in the case present a “political question” that the judiciary cannot appropriately answer  in october  the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit reinstated the case the court concluded that caci’s actions are protected from judicial review under the political question doctrine if they were lawful when committed and occurred under actual control of the us military or involved sensitive military judgments the court remanded the case to the us district court to reexamine its subject matter

titan corporation now engility in us federal court the plaintiffs former detainees allege that the companies directed and participated in torture war crimes crimes against humanity sexual assault as well as cruel inhuman and degrading treatment at abu ghraib prison the us government had hired caci and titan to provide interrogation and translation services at military prisons in iraq in  the us court of appeals for the dc circuit ruled in caci’s favor in the lawsuit and ordered its dismissal the us supreme court then declined to review that decision  caci employee steven stephanowicz and several military officers were investigated in the taguba inquiry a subsequent investigation of military intelligence operations at abu ghraib found that contractors were involved in  percent of the abu ghraib proven incidents and identified  employees as individually culpable but none have been prosecuted caci responseedit according to cacis website the company provided a range of information technology it and intelligence services in iraq these services included intelligence analysis background investigations screenings interrogation property management and recordkeeping and installation of computer systems software and hardware only a small portion of these employees worked as interrogators the company states that no caci employee or former employee has been indicted for any misconduct in connection with this work and no caci employee or former employee appears in any of the photos released from abu ghraib caci also adds that they are no longer providing interrogation services in iraq which concluded in the early fall of  upon the conclusion of a contract with the department of the army caci also adds nonetheless we do not condone tolerate or endorse any illegal behavior by our employees in any circumstance or at any time we will act forcefully if the evidence shows that any of our employees acted improperly but we will not rush to judgment on the basis of speculation innuendo partial reports or incomplete investigations caci also claims on their website that us government reports generally concluded that civilian interrogators performed their duties in an appropriate fashion and made a major contribution to the us mission in iraq caci further claims a march  report by us navy inspector general and vice admiral albert t church shows that despite the publicity surrounding abu ghraib we found very few instances of abuse involving contractors caci chairman of the board dr jack london defended the company with a book caci our good name lawsuitedit in may  four former abu ghraib prison detainees brought separate lawsuits in four us courts against caci and l communications as well as against three civilians one of these former inmates emad aljanabi sued l and caci for allowing their employees to abuse him physically and mentally at the prison in a statement released on its website caci has stated that these lawsuits are baseless and they reject emphatically this latest plaintiffs allegations and claims calling on numerous and thorough government investigations in these allegations on march   us district judge gerald bruce lee rejected claims by caci that it could not be sued because its interrogators were performing duties prescribed by the contract with the us government caci responded that it vowed to pursue all of its legal alternatives to defend itself and vindicate the companys good name and that from day one caci has rejected the outrageous allegations against the company in this lawsuit and continues to do so on september   the us court of appeals ruled that caci did in fact fall under us military chain of command and thus had government contractor immunity subsequently the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit reheard the appeal with all active judges participating and in an  decision held that the appeal was premature the action was remanded to the district court for further proceedings on remand the plaintiffs were able to conduct full discovery into their claims after that discovery the plaintiffs had not identified any evidence that showed that anyone affiliated with caci had any contact with the plaintiffs in june  judge lee dismissed the suit due to lack of jurisdiction on appeal the us court of appeals for the th circuit found that the lower court had erred in dismissing the suit in june  as it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case because the alleged incidents occurred overseas the appellate court vacated the district court’s decision and remanded the case for a determination of whether plaintiffs’ claims were barred by the political question doctrine  in june  the us district court again dismissed the case against caci holding that caci’s actions were controlled by the us military and that assessing torture and war crimes claims would require impermissible review of the us military’s judgment and thus the issues in the case present a “political question” that the judiciary cannot appropriately answer  in october  the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit reinstated the case the court concluded that caci’s actions are protected from judicial review under the political question doctrine if they were lawful when committed and occurred under actual control of the us military or involved sensitive military judgments the court remanded the case to the us

international and titan corporation now engility in us federal court the plaintiffs former detainees allege that the companies directed and participated in torture war crimes crimes against humanity sexual assault as well as cruel inhuman and degrading treatment at abu ghraib prison the us government had hired caci and titan to provide interrogation and translation services at military prisons in iraq in  the us court of appeals for the dc circuit ruled in caci’s favor in the lawsuit and ordered its dismissal the us supreme court then declined to review that decision  caci employee steven stephanowicz and several military officers were investigated in the taguba inquiry a subsequent investigation of military intelligence operations at abu ghraib found that contractors were involved in  percent of the abu ghraib proven incidents and identified  employees as individually culpable but none have been prosecuted caci responseedit according to cacis website the company provided a range of information technology it and intelligence services in iraq these services included intelligence analysis background investigations screenings interrogation property management and recordkeeping and installation of computer systems software and hardware only a small portion of these employees worked as interrogators the company states that no caci employee or former employee has been indicted for any misconduct in connection with this work and no caci employee or former employee appears in any of the photos released from abu ghraib caci also adds that they are no longer providing interrogation services in iraq which concluded in the early fall of  upon the conclusion of a contract with the department of the army caci also adds nonetheless we do not condone tolerate or endorse any illegal behavior by our employees in any circumstance or at any time we will act forcefully if the evidence shows that any of our employees acted improperly but we will not rush to judgment on the basis of speculation innuendo partial reports or incomplete investigations caci also claims on their website that us government reports generally concluded that civilian interrogators performed their duties in an appropriate fashion and made a major contribution to the us mission in iraq caci further claims a march  report by us navy inspector general and vice admiral albert t church shows that despite the publicity surrounding abu ghraib we found very few instances of abuse involving contractors caci chairman of the board dr jack london defended the company with a book caci our good name lawsuitedit in may  four former abu ghraib prison detainees brought separate lawsuits in four us courts against caci and l communications as well as against three civilians one of these former inmates emad aljanabi sued l and caci for allowing their employees to abuse him physically and mentally at the prison in a statement released on its website caci has stated that these lawsuits are baseless and they reject emphatically this latest plaintiffs allegations and claims calling on numerous and thorough government investigations in these allegations on march   us district judge gerald bruce lee rejected claims by caci that it could not be sued because its interrogators were performing duties prescribed by the contract with the us government caci responded that it vowed to pursue all of its legal alternatives to defend itself and vindicate the companys good name and that from day one caci has rejected the outrageous allegations against the company in this lawsuit and continues to do so on september   the us court of appeals ruled that caci did in fact fall under us military chain of command and thus had government contractor immunity subsequently the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit reheard the appeal with all active judges participating and in an  decision held that the appeal was premature the action was remanded to the district court for further proceedings on remand the plaintiffs were able to conduct full discovery into their claims after that discovery the plaintiffs had not identified any evidence that showed that anyone affiliated with caci had any contact with the plaintiffs in june  judge lee dismissed the suit due to lack of jurisdiction on appeal the us court of appeals for the th circuit found that the lower court had erred in dismissing the suit in june  as it lacked jurisdiction to hear the case because the alleged incidents occurred overseas the appellate court vacated the district court’s decision and remanded the case for a determination of whether plaintiffs’ claims were barred by the political question doctrine  in june  the us district court again dismissed the case against caci holding that caci’s actions were controlled by the us military and that assessing torture and war crimes claims would require impermissible review of the us military’s judgment and thus the issues in the case present a “political question” that the judiciary cannot appropriately answer  in october  the us court of appeals for the fourth circuit reinstated the case the court concluded that caci’s actions are protected from judicial review under the political question doctrine if they were lawful when committed and occurred under actual control of the us military or involved sensitive military judgments the court remanded the case to the us
