zach weissshare this story there are so many things to say about vintage seiko automatic chronographs that it’s almost hard to find a place to start they are iconic well made collectable gorgeous historically significant and…affordable while it’s hard to give exact numbers generally speaking a seiko  or  will run you between  and  condition and scarcity depending which is fantastic because there are a plethora of models out there some of which are more famous than others and the relatively low price makes it possible to own a few while it’s tempting to write about them all there have already been various articles guides and forum posts on the topic so i’ll defer to those for brevityback in  john biggs put together a guide of classic seiko movements including the  which is a good starting point felix over at hodinkee did a splendid job putting together a guide a couple of month’s ago of specific significant models focused on the  and  movements and if you want to see an awesome photo archive of many models from early hand wound ’s through the  movements to the  which had minute and hour chrono registers on a single subdial go here but be warned…that archive can be dangerous to your bank account as you are likely to find many models you want then you can search any of the forums and many thorough discussions amongst collectors will appear advertisement it’s admittedly a bit silly to try to review a watch that is  years old so take the proceeding article as a handson with a single watch that has qualities to it shape build wearabillity movement functionality that are true to a series of watches the condition price reliability of this watch is true only to this specific watch so don’t expect to have the exact same experience that being said when you get your xxxx you’ll have some basic expectations on what it’s like to wear it and usesince this is ww affordability and value are key components we look for in watches and as we discussed in our recent review of the magrette moana pacific chronograph finding a modern mechanical chronograph at an affordable price is a challenge eta rules the market and their least expensive chronograph movement the valjoux  tends to be in watches starting at around  new steinharts being a notable exception and this price will only continue to grow in the next few years as those movements become less available ironically one of the best places to find an affordable chronograph is actually in the past… well that is to say in a vintage watch while there are many reasons to be interested in vintage seiko chronographs i dare say that simply being able to get a reliable automatic chronograph for a few hundred bucks was on the top of my listso i had been debating purchasing a  or  for sometime specifically looking at the  “bullhead” model but just never pulled the trigger when i came across a sales post on a forum with a model i hadn’t seen before i was quickly drawn in what makes the  also the  which dates to  different from other ’s is that it has a numerical dial other models tend to have applied markers or hash marks is it more attractive no not really i simply found appealing the numbers add a bit more noise to the dial which i felt work well with sporty racing overtones of the watch that being said i didn’t get it for the dial but rather because it was in good condition from a seller who knew what they were talking about and at a fair pricefor  the watch clearly has the original dial chapter ring minute and hour hands this can be told from the consistent patina across all three the dial isn’t in like new condition at all and for a  year old watch that is a good thing but the ageing hasn’t been so aggressive as to indicate damage poor treatment or simply not look nice the case crystal crown and chrono pushers too are original and have not seen much polishing or buffing the only parts i suspect have been retouched or are aftermarket are the chronograph seconds and minute hands the shapes are correct but the color is too bright they are a sharp and vivid red that jump off the dial and just don’t show the same ageing as the rest of the watch the thing is they look great so i don’t personally careof course none of that would matter if the  movement at the heart of the watch was in bad condition this is where trusting your seller comes into play and is a reason why i like buying from forums rather than ebay the seller who had been a forum member for sometime had sold watches before and clearly knew the watch and watches in general said the movement was recently serviced and in good working condition there was also a picture of the movement from which i could see with my own eyes no corrosion dirt or other damage  with that in mind i took a leap and purchased the watch advertisement the  is a fun movement with great features it’s a jewel automatic with quickset daydate function chronograph seconds and a minute register with a frequency of  bph there is no continuous seconds hand on the watch which takes a moment to get used to there is also no hour register making this a very oldschool single register chrono one interesting feature of the  is how the daydate are set the crown is pushed in two clicks to change the day and one click to change the date while a very quick way to set the date it has its obvious draw backs making it not too surprising that it’s a design one doesn’t seen anymore for one thing when you progress the day you automatically progress the date so it’s likely you will have to go through a whole month to get to the correct date it also seems likely that one could accidently depress the crown even though it’s recessed that being said the time remains accurate and the chronograph works well the pushers have a proper amount of stiffness to them so they don’t get accidentally actuated the chronograph starts immediately resets with a snap and always returns to zero considering the movement in this watch is about  years old that says a lot about the build quality of these movements when properly maintainedthe case of the  measures  x  x  mm with mm lugs making it a fairly large sport watch for the time and a small to medium watch by contemporary standards the case has a barrel shape which flows smoothly around and has no hard edges save the chrono pushers which stand out the crown itself has been recessed and is flush to the case in order to set the time the crown must be pulled out from underneath it’s definitely a case that speaks to the ’s models like the  aka the pogue have a flatter shape with slab sides and a harsh break before the lugs so this fluid case design is not true for all  models the look of the case is very soft and appealing the lack of any hard angles or lines make it appear a bit smaller than it is the body of the case is evenly bushed on top and side surfaces and polished underneath the bezel which sits a bit above the case is polished as well adding some nice reflection to the top surface the mineral crystal protrudes another  mm off of the case and has a steep beveled edge though i don’t know the total dimensions of the crystal it has a reassuring thickness the case back is screw down and is marked with “stainless steel  waterproof” in a semicircular banner shape that encircles a seiko logo the serial number and “japan a” are located beneath that overall it’s simply a very nice case design that was well built advertisement as i mentioned before the  features a numerical dial with hours and no applied markers making it an anomaly amongst the  and  watches it’s actually a very simple almost plain dial the face is matte black and all numerals and markers are white the hours are also marked with lume dots though those stopped glowing sometime ago at  is the daydate window which is divided into two smaller windows both day and date are represented in white on a black except sunday which is red making them congruent with the dial design the day is displayed in either kanji or english and since i tend to know what day it is i have been using the watch in kanji as the symbols are more attractive than the font for the english the beveled chapter ring on the outer edge has a tachymeter scale in white textmarkings on a matte black surface under twelve it reads “seiko speedtimer” and then a seiko  shield logo at  there is more text that reads “sports” in italics and underneath that “water m proof” for the seiko chronograph nerds out there this makes it a “proofproof” model water proof on both dial and case back which indicates that it was an earlier model the minute counter at  is marked in a thick white circle with breaks for the minutes and numerals every  minutes the numerical dial is remarkably legible at a glance and though lacking in the colors and detailing that many  models have the sheer purposefulness of it is aesthetically pleasing as well it also serves to offset the bright red chronograph hands even morethe watch is remarkably ergonomic and comfortable to wear it simply sits very nicely on the wrist the lack of protruding lugs keeps the mass of the watch centered and the recessed crown guarantees nothing will cut into the wrist it’s refreshing to wear a large watch from an era when watches were generally smaller as this seems designed for wear rather than attention aesthetically the  is a very sharp looking watch as are most of the  models it’s both sporty and mature lending itself easily to daily wear the watch did not come with the original bracelet but instead an nos brown leather racingstrap with small perforated holes i have to thank the seller for putting such a perfect strap on the watch as i have had no motivation to change itso am i satisfied with the venture into vintage chronographs absolutely like i said at first there are may reasons to be interested in vintage seiko chronographs so you can pick and choose what’s most important to you like me you might be interested in adding an automatic chronograph to your collection without breaking the bank you might also be interested in that ’s aesthetic defined by the barrel cases and single register function there are very few contemporary watches that offer that sort of styling most notably would be the oris chronoris single register which goes for about  making it hard to even compareperhaps simply owning one of the first automatic chronographs ever designed is enough for you which is very understandable get these historically significant watches while you can and they still operate as long as you pay attention to the details in the sale that is to say original versus aftermarket parts servicing of the movement overall price and conditioning these watches represent a lot of bang for your buck they also make for a very easy introduction to buying vintage as you can research just about every detail of every model before purchasing the only trouble is that they are addictive since getting this one i’ve been more seriously eyeing the  “bullhead” as well as the  “panda”…not to mention the  “seiko monaco” which is a watch i’m surprised hasn’t gotten more attention needless to say this wont be the last vintage seiko chronograph to be featured on ww advertisement images from this post author zach weisszach is the cofounder and executive editor of wornwound before diving head

js i just purchased the ufo where can i order that strap wildcard is it normal for most of these vintage seiko chronos to be coming from japan and the phillipines on ebay i know they were manufactured there but i just want to make sure im not getting ripped off jojo yes for the most part you’ll see most vintage seikos coming from the philippines not sure why that is maybe there was just a bigger market for seikos there at those times probably had a few “left” there in se asia by servicemen not sure for the most part anything coming out of se asia for seikos at least will have aftermarket parts in some form if you are going for original original you’ll want to be more careful and do as zach suggested and buy from trusted forum members buy the seller before you buy the watch kurt elster
