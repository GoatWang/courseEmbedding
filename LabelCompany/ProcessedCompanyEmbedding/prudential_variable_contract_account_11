account was established on march   by the prudential insurance company of america prudential under the laws of the state of new jersey and is registered as an openend diversified management investment company under the investment company act of  as amended vca has been designed for use by employers contractholders in making retirement arrangements on behalf of their employees participants the investment objective of the account is longterm growth of capital the accounts investments are composed primarily of common stocks although variable annuity payments differ according to the investment performance of the account they are not affected by mortality or expense experience because prudential assumes the expense risk and the mortality risk under the contracts   note    summary of significant accounting policies securities valuation    securities listed on a securities exchange are valued at the last sale price on such exchange on the day of valuation or if there was no sale on such day at the mean between the last reported bid and ask prices or at the last bid price on such day in the absence of an asked price securities traded via nasdaq are valued at the official closing price provided by nasdaq securities that are actively traded in the overthecounter market including listed securities for which the primary market is believed by prudential investments llc pi or manager in consultation with the subadvisers to be overthecounter are valued by an independent pricing agent or principal market maker options on securities and indices traded on an exchange are valued at the mean between the most recently quoted bid and asked prices on such exchange futures contracts and options thereon traded on a commodities exchange or board of trade are valued at the last sale price at the close of trading on such exchange or board of trade or if there was no sale on the applicable commodities exchange or board of trade on such day at the mean between the most recently quoted bid and asked prices on such exchange or board of trade or at the last bid price in the absence of an asked price any security for which a reliable market quotation is unavailable is valued at fair value by a valuation committee appointed by the accounts committee members   investments in mutual funds are valued at their net asset value as of the close of the new york stock exchange on the date of the valuation   shortterm investments which mature in more than  days are valued based on current market quotations shortterm investments having maturities of  days or less are valued at amortized cost which approximates market value amortized cost is computed using the cost on the date of purchase adjusted for constant accretion of discount or amortization of premium to maturity   securities transactions and net investment income    securities transactions are recorded on the trade date realized gains losses on sales of securities are calculated on the identified cost basis dividend income is recorded on the exdividend date and interest income is recorded on the accrual basis net investment income and realized and unrealized gain losses other than administrative fees are allocated to the participants and prudential on a daily basis in proportion to their respective ownership in vca expenses are recorded on the accrual basis which may require the use of certain estimates by management   options    the fund may either purchase or write options in order to hedge against adverse market movements or fluctuations in value caused by changes in prevailing interest rates with respect to securities which the fund currently owns or intends to purchase the funds principal reason for writing options is to realize through receipt of premiums a greater current return than would be realized on the underlying security alone when the fund purchases an option it pays a premium and an amount equal to that premium is recorded as an asset when the fund writes an option it receives a premium and an amount equal to that premium is recorded as a liability the asset or liability is adjusted daily to reflect the current market value of the option   if an option expires unexercised the fund realizes a gain or loss to the extent of the premium received or paid if an option is exercised the premium received or paid is an adjustment to the proceeds from the sale or the cost of the purchase in determining whether the fund has realized a gain or loss the difference between the premium and the amount received or paid on effecting a closing purchase or sale transaction is also treated as a realized gain or loss gain or loss on purchased options is included in net realized gain or loss on investment transactions gain or loss on written options is presented separately as net realized gain or loss on written options   the fund as writer of an option may have no control over whether the underlying securities may be sold called or purchased put as a result the fund bears the market risk of an unfavorable change in the price of the security underlying the written option the fund as purchaser of an option bears the risk of the potential inability of the counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts   written options involve elements of both market and credit risk in excess of the amounts reflected in the statements of assets and liabilities   federal income taxes    the operations of vca are part of and are taxed with the operations of prudential under the current provisions of the internal revenue code prudential does not expect to incur federal income taxes on earnings of vca to the extent the earnings are credited under the contracts as a result the unit value of vca has not been reduced by federal income taxes   note    investment management agreement and charges the account has a management agreement with pi pursuant to this agreement pi has responsibility for all investment advisory

toreductions from prudentials investment in the account this increase decrease includes reserve adjustments for mortality and expense risks assumed by prudential   note    participant loans loans are considered to be withdrawals from the account from which the loan amount was deducted though they are not considered a withdrawal from the medley program therefore no deferred sales charge is imposed upon them the principal portion of any loan repayment however will be treated as a contribution to the receiving account for purposes of calculating any deferred sales charge imposed upon any subsequent withdrawal if the participant defaults on the loan for example by failing to make required payments the outstanding balance of the loan will be treated as a withdrawal for purposes of the deferred sales charge the deferred sales charge will be withdrawn from the same accumulation accounts and in the same proportions as the loan amount was withdrawn if sufficient funds do not remain in those accumulation accounts the deferred sales charge will be withdrawn from the participants other accumulation accounts as well   withdrawals transfers and loans from vca are considered to be
