that is primarily devoted to the care of outpatients illinois clinics can be privately operated or publicly managed and funded and typically cover the primary health care needs of populations in local communities in contrast to larger hospitals which offer specialised treatments and admit inpatients for overnight stays some il clinics grow to be institutions as large as major hospitals or become associated with a hospital or medical school while retaining the name clinic some illinois clinics function as a place for people with injuries or illnesses to come and be seen by a triage nurse or other health worker in these il clinics the injury or illness may not be serious enough to warrant a visit to an emergency room but the person can be transferred to one if required treatment at these illinois clinics is often less expensive than it would be at a casualty department also unlike an er these clinics are often not open on a  x  x  basis they sometimes have access to diagnostic
