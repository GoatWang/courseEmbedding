reports second quarter by administrator  monday  january   elizabeth arden has reported preliminary financial results for its second fiscal quarter ended december   and is expecting to report net sales in the range of m to m this range of numbers would represent a decrease of  to  or  to  – excluding the unfavourable impact of foreign currency as compared to the prior year second quarter the company says that economic conditions in its higher margin travel retail and distributor markets worsened considerably in november and december which negatively impacted on its international results in overall terms net income for the second fiscal quarter ended december   excluding expenses related to the liz claiborne license agreement and restructuring expenses is expected to range between  to  per diluted share or  to  per diluted share excluding the estimated unfavourable impact of foreign currency of approximately  per diluted share this compares to prior guidance of  to  per diluted share excluding an unfavourable impact of foreign currency of  per diluted share e scott beattie chairman president and ceo of elizabeth arden inc commented ‘the consumer and retail environment worldwide was more challenging than we expected when we provided guidance in our first quarter earnings release the first week of november the performance of our us elizabeth arden prestige department store business was much weaker than we had anticipated though consistent with overall trends experienced in this channel ‘additionally economic conditions in our higher margin travel retail and distributor markets worsened considerably in november and december which negatively impacted our international results ‘our north america fragrance business fared relatively better but shipments also were below what we had expected when we provided our guidance while retail sales were generally consistent with our outlook for the holiday season for north american mass retailers replenishment orders for this channel were below our expectations ‘results also were impacted by our actions to limit credit risk by decreasing shipments to certain customers due to credit constraints at those customers despite the weak environment we maintained operating profit and improved margins for our north america fragrance business as a whole for the first half of this fiscal year as compared to the prior year’ beattie continued ‘while conditions remain extremely challenging the strength of our multichannel business model and brand portfolio led to increased market share in the north american fragrance market this quarter we improved our already strong competitive position in the mass retail fragrance market and with the addition of the liz claiborne brands in june doubled our market share in the us department store fragrance market ‘notwithstanding the environment we continued to invest in our key brands and have seen strong results in relative terms the recently launched viva la juicy fragrance was this fall seasons number one fragrance launch at us prestige department stores at the fragrance counter and the white diamonds and curve fragrances were once again the number one selling womens and mens prestige fragrances respectively at mass retailers’ beattie concluded ‘our priorities for the remainder of this fiscal year are to i reduce inventory in order to maximize cash flow ii focus our advertising and promotional expenditures on the brands markets and channels of distribution that provide the best return and eliminate marginal spending iii reassess new product innovation in light of the current environment and iv accelerate the cost savings and business process reengineering initiatives related to our global efficiency reengineering project in order to position our

results for free why should i pay for advertising your current customers may search for your business by name aiming it easy to find you in search results but customers youve yet to reach are more likely searching for general terms that wouldnt necessarily bring up your business in search results advertising next to relevant bing search results puts your business front and center with interested customers you otherwise might not reach what is the difference between seo and sem which one is right for me search engine optimization seo is adjusting your website to improve your natural ranking in search results you cannot pay to improve your website ranking on bing or yahoo thus we often refer to these results and unpaid or organic search results clicks from seo are free but seo also requires technical expertise and involves some factors over which you have only limited control search engine marketing sem is paid advertising that appears next to or above unpaid or organic search results these paid ads are purchased through bing ads you pay for sem clicks but sem gives you more control over when your website appears on results pages and you decide how much you want to pay and you can measure which ads are working and quickly improve your results you dont have to choose between seo and sem you can do both if my time is limited should i still try bing ads yes call a bing ads specialist at and we’ll set up your first campaign for you for free we’ll give you tips on getting the most out of your ads and set you up for success we’re here to help about bing ads where does my ad appear your ads could appear on the top or to the right of bing yahoo and msn search results and you can choose to target your ads to different geographic regions times or days of the week and even demographics what determines my ad position bing ads is a payperclick ppc advertising system you bid based on how much you are willing to pay per each click on your ad because webpages have a limited number of places to show ads we auction those spaces you are bidding against other advertisers to get your ads into the space you want so if you bid on the keyword shoe you will have to beat the bids of the other advertisers who are also bidding on shoe you determine how much you are willing to bid your ad position is based on several things including how closely your ad and website fit with the terms that are searched relevance how your bid compares to other bids in the bing ads auction how strongly your ad has performed in the past and how often it has been clicked clickthrough rate the stronger you are in these areas the better your chances of winning the top ad position how to use bing ads how can i use bing ads to drive more people to my website here are some tips to get better results review your budget and bid strategy if your ad keeps pausing your budget limit may be set too low competitive bids help your ad stay in a strong position to catch eyes and get more

your terms expect to see and ad for your business how can i keep my costs down while your first instinct may be to lower your budget first try lowering your maximum bids yes this could mean fewer
