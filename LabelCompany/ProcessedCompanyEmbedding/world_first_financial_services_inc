clearing house and fis laud federal reserve’s faster payments task force’s final report ​washington dc – today the clearing house tch and fis welcomed the federal reserve’s faster payments task force’s final report which presents a roadmap for achieving competitive safe ubiquitous and faster payments  the task force was created by the federal reserve and is comprised of more than  stakeholders with an interest in us payments  the task force was called on to collectively identify criteria for endtoend solutions that would produce effective st century payments systems and task force members were invited to put forward proposals that meet the task force’s recommendations    tch and fis were active participants in the task force’s initiative and submitted a joint proposal for evaluation of tch’s realtime payments rtp system which is targeted to launch  later this year  tch enlisted the help of fis to help achieve ubiquity by offering enhanced rtp services to more than  financial institutions  “the federal reserve faster payments task force’s final report marks a significant milestone in the path toward faster payments in the us” said russ waterhouse executive vice president product development and strategy at the clearing house  “the task force ran an inclusive and collaborative process that resulted in recommendations that will drive better private sector solutions that benefit businesses and consumers across the country its work was instrumental in helping us design and build our realtime payments system which we expect to start supporting transactions later this year” “fis has been implementing realtime payment schemes around the globe since  and we draw important lessons from these projects every day” said anthony jabbour coo banking and payments fis “speed ubiquity and ease of use lead to high adoption rates and relevant payment solutions that banks can offer to their retail small business and corporate clients fis understands the specialized risks inherent in a real time payments scheme and that’s why we focus on minimizing risk to support systems and ensure appropriate fraud prevention measures are taken into account all this is vital to gain largescale user uptake and thus turn a realtime payments vision into realtime business value for all” the task force defined  effectiveness criteria grouped into the six categories ubiquity efficiency safety and security speed fast legal and governance  these criteria were critical in helping tch as it worked to design and build its rtp system  tch and fis were pleased that their proposal was found to have met each of the criteria necessary for a modern st century payment system established by the task force   tch’s rtp system also aligns with the consumer financial protection bureau’s “consumer protection principles” for faster payment systems about the clearing housethe clearing house is a banking association and payments company that is owned by the
