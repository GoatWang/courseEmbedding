uswestworldthe xfiles courtesy of nbc emerald city review nbcs oz reboot has courage short on heart and brains by dave nemetz  january    am pdt  a sexy gritty reboot of the wizard of oz it sounds like something jack donaghy would dream up on  rock doesn’t it yet emerald city isn’t a second sitcom joke it’s a hour actual thing that nbc has created and while it displays some dazzling visual flair and is plenty ambitious in its scope like a certain famous scarecrow this ponderous revamp doesn’t seem to have much of a brain at all debuting friday jan  at c emerald city begins appropriately enough in kansas with a grownup dorothy gale true detective‘s adria arjona searching for the truth about her birth mother but we don’t have to wait long before a tornado sweeps dorothy away to a magical land of witches wizards giant statues and decadent palaces looking for a way back home she befriends a handsome swordsman she names lucas dracula‘s oliver jacksoncohen and seeks the counsel of the allpowerful wizard daredevil‘s vincent d’onofrio videosemerald city trailer the witches of oz wage war in new nbc drama while the classic wizard of oz tale is certainly rich enough to support a modern retelling syfy did just that in  with tin man starring zooey deschanel the scripts for emerald city seem to be marking off boxes on a “gritty reboot” checklist dorothy is a jaded nurse with severe mommy issues her scarecrow equivalent lucas is a brooding hunk who admits to killing people the munchkins are feral wildlinglike tribal warriors the wizard would rather murder dorothy than help her leave it’s all very grim and humorless — shouldn’t the wizard of oz be at least a little fun — and in case you were wondering not at all appropriate for children that said emerald city is definitely a feast for the eyes with dreamlike landscapes and beautifully elaborate costumes like the fluttering cape of red ribbons worn by the wicked witch of the east florence kasumba all  episodes are directed by tarsem singh the visionary behind jlo’s  thriller the cell and rem’s iconic “losing my religion” video so while emerald city has all the emotional depth of a music video at least there are pretty things to look at along the way since it has  hours to fill emerald city pads the original oz story with side characters from other l frank baum oz books like the young boy tip jordan loughran but with too many plotlines to tend to the narrative ends up feeling sluggish dragging its feet on the way to the titular city the dorothylucas coupling is meant to set off sparks a la once upon a time‘s emmahook but their romance is more dutiful than convincing and intriguing characters like the wicked witch of the west — here a sultry opium addict played by ana ularu — are left frustratingly undeveloped relatedjanuary tv premieres returns finales and more save the  dates given how muddled the final product is it’s not surprising that emerald city has been in development for more than three years and has been through multiple showrunners already you can almost hear the nbc executives standing offcamera shouting “more game of thronesy” but it’s still a disappointment to see a beloved fairy tale wasted like this the tvline bottom line dazzling visuals from director tarsem singh can’t make up for emerald city‘s sluggish pacing and relentlessly bleak tone if you like

of it is that nbc does that one minute leak in thing on its shows and i could easily see them occasionally giving grimm and its last season some extra time per episode sometimes you fall into interesting if awkward stuff like constantine sometimes you are figuring out how to add additional time to your grimm recording to avoid things like dracula i liked tin man i get how they could make the story harder heck they could easily have avoided a lot and just based this on return to oz that is already a darker and more sinister tale where while you are confused why people are mad at dorothy it starts to make some sense reply collette says january   at  am when did l frank baum’s masterpiece become a casserole cookbook  different ways with hamburger becomes  different yellow brick roads enough reply kate says january   at  am i don’t terribly mind it as the story to me read differently to different audiences but i think that is part of the reason why i wish they would go with the secondary tales rather than the main one i mean its part of the reason why wicked is so popular unintended there because there are like five minutes of covering the original story but from the other side point of view and it actually feeds into the return to oz landscape much better but even with tin man all they really did was set it in modern times and do much more the original story rather than the movie musical most are familiar with reply bliz says january   at  pm every single wizard of oz story is mind numbingly dumb and childish…nostalgia has taken over your reason and clouded your judgement…go eat some more memberberries why doncha reply caughtup says january   at  pm ditto reply um says january   at  am maybe if you all reviewed shows that are far far worse this harshly folks would take you seriously reply rex the wonder dog says january   at  am what shows for example reply anna says january   at  am im sort of confuse here who are emma and hook i dont remember anyone with those names in the books reply collette says january   at  am emma ostensibly snow white’s daughter  hook  from peter pan are characters on once upon a time a show that puts every children’s story in a giant blender and pours out an unpalatable mocktail reply anna says january   at  am thank you i dont see that show but now im even more confused is this a review article or a comparation article comparing emerald city and once upon a time i mean if they are using references to characters from another shows they have to be careful because not everyone may understand those mentions and now i wonder if how neutral this article is if is biased towards the other show making this look bad but then again many times reviewers go with their eyes and say bad things and tv shows and movies end being way better than they make it sound i will just have to wait and see reply emma says january   at  am hey man once upon a time was awesome … for the first two two and a half seasons well i love it unconditionally myself warts and all felt the same way about bbc’s merlin but objectively it has gone downhill over the years but i love it anyway and why do you say “ostensibly” in the show she is snow white’s daughter oh and anna emma and hook are one of the main couples in the show they’re quite popular you should give it a try it’s quite an enjoyable show just leave your logic at the door reply piers says january   at  am nah ouat was fun the first  seasons partially because of the hunt for easter eggs as for “ostensibly” maybe because in the original story she never existed deus ex machina gone mad i’m with collette on this one reply billy meacham says january   at  am i’m giving emerald city a chance since it has kingpin from marvels daredevil in it why does it have to be on fridays since i have last man standing dr ken macgyver hawaii five  rosewood sleepy hollow and blue bloods reply jared says january   at  am this just looks bad and tvline reviews are usually spot on i think i can skip this one reply scottj says january   at  am i’ll watch any show that keeps its episode count down although i”m far more likely to record this and binge watch once its finished reply jess says january   at  am still going to watch it reviews and i never agree anyways like with the movie armageddon i love that movie and critics and most people hated i liked it for what it was a way to escape my life for a little bit reply herman says january   at  am i’m guessing that the  in the d grade is for vincent d – he was born to play the wizard – because nothing else about this show sounds interesting to me plus the fact that nbc scheduled it on a friday after  years in development and multiple showrunners sounds like they don’t have high hopes see it now it’ll be gone soon reply bartimeus says january   at  am the reviewer seems to mostly just be upset wizard of oz is getting a dark and adult retelling so i can’t really take it seriously the show looks awesome and looks far more interesting than the original thing oz only ever slightly appealed to me even as a kid but i’m stoked for this reply rinaex says january   at  am imo the reviewer seems more annoyed that they decided do go with a whole bvs grimdark thing with nothing in the writing or acting to make it palatable reply katherine says january   at  am my original comment didn’t post so i’ll try again – i’m really surprised this review takes such a negative view of the show when tvline listed it as one of the best new winter shows to try just last week i’d link to that article but i think that’s what got my first comment deleted  anyway i know people have different opinions as to what’s good but it’s a pretty extreme difference between this review and rating it one of the best new shows to try reply curious for now says january   at  pm i’ll give it a try those amazing visuals are enough to pique my interest like everyone else i read the reviews but watch in the hopes i will enjoy something reviewers didn’t particularly like which happens about  the time or more after the boredom that is network tv in between christmas and new year resulting in numerous visits to netflix among others i’ll give something new a try it is nbc though and i haven’t been thrilled with the peacock for a long time we shall see fingers crossed reply kirads says january   at  pm wow pretty harsh review there everything i have seen about ec looks exceptional maybe i have a built in bias being a huge vincent d’onofrio fan for a very long time he doesn’t just play characters he inhabits them i am certainly going to watch and enjoy every breathtaking moment i can’t wait i should admit here not a purest when it comes to oz i do love the original movie a great deal reply bliz says january   at  pm every single wizard of oz story is mind numbingly dumb and childish…nostalgia has taken over your reason and clouded your judgement…go eat some more memberberries why doncha reply bliz says january   at  pm when did “original” become a dead species you know at one point or another allllll these things we keep redoing had to be made with imaginations so maybe lets try using our imaginations more as content makers and consumers……lets make some more breaking bads–not the show or genre itself but being original from an actual mind of someone currently living and working today that becomes a massive hit in masses…… reply jadedfaded says january   at  am saw but didn’t hear what i guess was the first episode– or the pilot– on an american airlines flight from phoenix to vancouver last night strange way for nbc to promote a new series i usually ignore inflight entertainment preferring to stare out the window or read a book but it was a night flight and i was too tired to read i didn’t have headphones so watched the whole thing in silence on a ″ screen six feet away– hardly ideal viewing conditions anyway i’d never heard of “emerald city” had no idea what the hell i was looking at at first but was able to figure out what was going on without too much trouble it helped that i recognized some names in the credits– it was just visually interesting enough to pique my interest young woman in kansas doctor or nurse gets whisked off by a tornado to a strange land along with a dog check meets a bunch of short humanoids who take her to their village check there she meets some huge barbariantype humanoids who subject her to a water torture of some kind hey what happened to the fauxmunchkins later she rescues a guy who’s hanging from a cross by the side of the road in pretty bad shape he looks nothing like ray bolger but what the hell… anyway they set off together on a yellow road check they meet a coollooking wicked witch with ruby gloves… lots of crosscutting to the wizard’s doings whatever they were mostly calmly strutting about hands behind his back like a ship’s captain and striving to look like he’s in charge vince d’onofrio with a bushy beard the glinda analogy  turns up at the wizard’s fortress and her apprentice nearly blows it up inadvertently joely richardson as “glinda” some kind of strange subplot involving fiona shaw as some healer woman with a very bad attitude and a captive kid a whole bunch of parallel plot lines fighting for supremacy ends on a sortof cliffhanger half an hour later they ran the damn thing again no clearer the second time i guess being able to hear the dialogue might have helped just a bit… if this show runs for more than one season it will be proof that magic really does exist reply emma says january   at  am i’ll give it a try mainly ’cause it’s directed by tarsem singh it’s true that the fall is literally the only good movie he’s ever made but man was it spectacular fingers crossed this is more the fall than mirror mirror plus i’m a sucker for these kind of reimaginings of fairy tales and childhood classics reply val says january   at  am well i do like emmahook as a couple and love story  reply mark d moss says january   at  am i haven’t seen the show so i can’t speak to the endgame conclusions made here … but i do know a bit about fairy tales and folklore so it’s worth pointing out how totally confused and wrong dave and pretty much all of the ouat fandom is about the source material being generally discussed as the foundation for the arguments made first of all while baum’s “oz” books were certainly fantasy and unquestionably aimed audiencewise at children they are as distinct from “fairy tales” as say tolkien’s “lotr” or lewis’ narnia books what the writer is confusing here is disney fluffy good wins over evil over simplified bowdlerized versionsreimaginings of classic folk tales themselves and the real source material that is almost always a lot darker twisty ambiguous and more juvenile dare i say richer bottom line if you learn nothing else “fairy tales” are collected folklore by the likes of hans christian andersen or the brothers grimm and many many lesserknown folklorist … fantasy literature like the oz books narnia lord of the rings — all by known authors — are not “fairy tales” having read the entire baum oz series to my daughter when she was little i can attest that the classic garlandmgm musical version as great as it is is also a pretty significant reimagining of the original text omitting lots adding lots and changing much of the story this isn’t to claim anything about the success or failure of this version again i haven’t seen it but protesting because it’s not “light” “fun” or “humorous” is simply ignorant reply rex the wonder dog says january   at  am sure be a lot of s in your post reply al says january   at  pm i’ll give it a shot for its debut but if it doesn’t grab me i’m out so far the reviews are making it sound like a bleaker once upon a time a show i fell off the boil for awhile ago and i’ve read some reviews suggesting the show is trying to push the envelope on what is acceptable re sex gore for network tv which suggests possible desperation that could interfere with the story but i am still curious to see how it looks they’re airing the first two episodes on debut night if  of the season isn’t enough to convince me i’ll be calling it a day reply lydia romano says january   at  pm i loved it reply lydia romano says january   at  pm i loved it thought that i would not like it but i did reply jeanna says january   at  pm i often agree with tvline but we differ here i found the show and the performers very compelling while i don’t completely grasp the dynamic between the west witch and the wizard i may very invested in the dorothy – lucas dynamic and very interested in pip’s storyline i’m in reply caughtup says january   at  pm that’s so frakkin up what a waste of tv money to destroy a classic your twisted stinkin rotten mind is soooo deranged you have think up something like this to capture people’s attention reply caughtup says january   at  pm well it’s so ooooo frakkined up that’s all i got to say about the shat reply scott says january   at  am i was really looking forward to it i had a hard time getting through it i will give it one thing though the visuals are amazing storyline is way to confusing and i found it boring at times will not be watching the rest of the episodes i’d pass on this one if i were you by the way i love once upon a time and this is nothing like it at all reply kree says january   at  am i loved it and couldn’t wait to tell my daughter about this awesome new show she beat me to it by calling me and telling me to watch it we are  years apart so it may appeal to all ages it is really good reply tina says february   at  am i really like the show is the wizard of oz no but it is still good reply lika says february   at  pm so…i suppose every run of the mill series seen on all basic major channels are better  god i am so glad one of these channels is doing something different and yessmart please don’t change their minds…its clever amazing costuming and settings too…so it isn’t” instant to make a point  thats the point  storyevolves” make stupid people and shows famous and everybody else who watches the soap opera idiot entertainment out there  i like the challenges and so do a lot of people reply mark says february   at  pm you may think it to be a smart show but your average viewer will be hard pressed to connect you want a smart rewrite watch “tin man” this is so far removed from the original take it needs an original name so as not to confuse the audience something like “dumb knockoff of a childhood tale” or “the envious wizard of green city” or “the ambiguous witches of oz” please don’t glorify a horrifyingly stupid “reimagining” of a great story reply mark says february   at  pm they tried so hard to recreate this story that they lost touch with the elements that made the original great and in doing so they have made the principle characters almost unrecognizable way to slaughter a perfect childhood tale nbc reply natalie says march   at  pm i absolutely loved it it’s totally different than original but i love that i am upset when it ends can’t wait for next episode actors are great storyline is good i hope it continues can’t wait to watch next series i’ve always loved wizard of oz and now love all the spinoffs great job nbc reply robin apple says march   at  am i’m a great fan of the series “grim” the cast is engaging and work together well making the viewer care about them the episodes are fascinating in the unique retelling of grim fairytales in a modern setting with characters that you can relate to along with the fantastic creatures the show creates this is a much more entertaining and less depressing than this forced retelling of the classic wizard of oz story that did not need to be changed or “improved on” i’d much rather watch grim than this dull series nbc has seen fit to run and in their infinite “wisdom” to cancel the previous series to show the latter dog of a series pretty sets do not a successful series make i couldn’t care less what happens to the characters of emerald city and if it returns i won’t be watching it but i will buy the dvd of the complete series of grim reply see more comments todays hottest storiesgreys vet krista vernoff returns for season  as coshowrunnermaria bello joins ncis season  will forge unique relationship
