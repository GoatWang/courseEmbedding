breeding  rice yield — evolutionary genomics evolutionary genomics rice has evolved over millions of years in nature adapting to environmental stresses and positive selection  man has selectively bred rice for thousands of years to increase yield and achieve other desirable traits  these changes have resulted in genetic changes through positive selectionevolutionary genomics’ adapted traits platform sifted through vast numbers of genes to identify the handful of important positively selected genetic changes that resulted in increased yield  the result was two genes that have been proven in field trials to provide an increase in yieldevolutionary genomics licensed the worldwide rights to the use of the genes to the first company to commercialize hybrid rice seed in north and south america evolutionary genomics evolutionary genomics if you give a family a loaf of bread they will eat today  if you give farmers better seeds they will feed the world for generationsdrought is the biggest obstacle to solving world hunger our adapted traits platform is uniquely suited to finding the genes that can help make crops more drought resistant and opening up new acres for production that were previously thought to be unusablewe have used the adapted traits platform to find genes responsible for increased crop yield pest and disease resistance salt tolerance and even sweetness  we believe that we can apply this same technology to help develop seeds for drought resistance crops genes for pestdisease resistance in soybeanseg identified and validated native genes and developed one synthetic gene that provide resistance to diseasepests without the use of chemicals or toxins  one gene has an issued patent and applications are pending on others   increase in sweetnesseg has identified and validated a gene in tomatoes that is responsible for a significant increase in sweetness and has applied for a patent  we have also identified and are in validation of genes for pest resistance cotton pest resistance and fiber length genes in developmenteg has discovered candidate genes in cotton that may be responsible for important traits like pest resistance and fiber length  validation testing will begin in   cotton project — evolutionary genomics evolutionary genomics in a recent project eg set out to find genes that impact traits of interest in cotton including pestdisease resistance fiber length and oil content  in the early stages of this project we gathered genes that show signs of having been positively selected over long periods of time  from these candidates we will narrow the group to a handful of genes that we can send to an independent lab for validation testing company profile — evolutionary genomics evolutionary genomics evolutionary genomics inc is a genomics research and development company focused on the identification and validation of genes that impact commercially valuable traits in crops for the agriculture industry  we have performed research on crops including rice corn soybeans wheat cotton cowpeas beans tomatoes and cassava  in addition to continuing our work in pestdisease resistance we intend to research drought tolerance in multiple crops  our core technology is our patented adapted traits platform which is used to perform molecular evolution analysis to identify positively selected genes that may have an impact on traits of interest  positively selected candidate genes must be further tested to validate their impact on the desired traitsin the past we relied on research grant funding from commercial entities governmental agencies industry associations and grant making foundations to partially or fully offset research costs and generate profit for the company  with the exception of our cassava research we retain intellectual property rights that allow us to market the genes found to seed companies within the agricultural industry in return for lump sum payments milestone payments and royalties on product sales using our intellectual property   we have applied our adapted traits platform in research projects including identifying genes responsible for increases in yield in corn increases in yield in rice drought tolerance and sugar content in tomatoes and pestdisease resistance in soybeans cassava beans tomatoes and cotton  these projects have resulted in grant revenue research services revenue and license revenue  we have also designed a comprehensive research study to address drought tolerance in multiple crops stocks index  markets index bulletin investor alert

policies   principals of consolidation  these consolidated financial statements include the accounts of evolutionary genomics inc and its wholly owned and majorityowned subsidiaries all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated   use of estimates  the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ materially from those estimates   cash  the company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with an original or remaining maturity of three months or less when purchased to be cash     accounts receivable accounts receivable are carried at cost less an allowance for doubtful accounts if an allowance is deemed necessary on a periodic basis the company evaluates its accounts receivable and determines the requirement for an allowance for doubtful accounts based upon the history of past writeoffs collections and current credit conditions a receivable is written off when it is determined that all reasonable collection efforts have been exhausted and the potential for recovery is considered remote the company recorded no allowance for doubtful accounts as of september   and december   recoveries of receivables previously written off are recorded when received the company does not charge interest on pastdue receivables      evolutionary genomics inc notes to financial statements september   unaudited     trading securities  the company’s shortterm investments are comprised of equity securities treasury bonds and bank certificates of deposit all of which are classified as trading securities and are carried at their fair value based on the quoted market prices of the securities at september   and december   net realized and unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in net earnings for purpose of determining realized gains and losses the cost of securities sold is based on specific identification   property and equipment  property and equipment are stated at cost net of accumulated depreciation depreciation is provided for by the straightline method over three to sevenyear estimated useful lives of software furniture and fixtures and equipment maintenance and repairs are expensed as incurred major renewals and betterments that extend the useful lives of property and equipment are capitalized when property and equipment are sold or retired the related cost and accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recognized   longlived assets  the longlived assets held and used by the company are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable in the event that facts and circumstances indicate that the cost of any longlived assets may be impaired an evaluation of recoverability is performed an impairment is considered to exist if the total estimated undiscounted cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset an impairment loss is measured and recorded to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated fair value no asset impairment was recorded during the three and nine months ended september   and    intangible assets  intangible assets include acquired research in progress and patents on the company’s core technology for gene identification patents are amortized over their expected useful life of  years using the straightline method acquired research in progress is an indefinitelived intangible asset until the development is complete at which time the useful life of the asset will be assigned costs incurred to renew intangible assets are expensed in the period incurred while costs incurred to extend the lives of patents are capitalized and amortized over the remaining useful life of the asset   investment in vetdc inc  as of november   the company committed to making a  investment for  shares of series a preferred stock in vetdc inc a delaware c corporation which is focused on developing pet therapeutic products vetdc inc is related to the company through common ownership and management the investment was made for purposes of capital appreciation and from the company’s excess cash reserves the company accounts for its investment in vetdc inc using the cost method the carrying amount of the investment as of september   and december   was  and  respectively vetdc inc is the only cost method investment that the company owns the company is exempt from estimating interim fair values because the investment does not meet the definition of a publicly traded company the fair value of the investment was not measured as of september   and december   because no identified events or changes in circumstances have occurred that may have a significant adverse effect on the fair value of the investment     billings in excess of costs  the liability account billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts represents billings in excess of revenues recognized and earned   revenue recognition  the company recognizes revenue where persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists delivery has occurred the price is fixed or determinable and

tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected tax consequences of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their reported amounts management regularly assesses the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent management believes that it is more likely than not that a deferred tax asset will not be realized a valuation allowance is established when a valuation allowance is established increased or decreased an income tax charge or benefit is included in the consolidated financial statements and net deferred tax assets are adjusted accordingly as of september   and december   a full valuation allowance has been established on the net deferred tax asset   under the income tax topic of the asc in order to recognize an uncertain tax benefit the taxpayer must be more likely than not of sustaining the position and the measurement of the benefit is calculated as the largest amount that is more than  likely to be realized upon resolution of the benefit the company has no accruals for uncertain tax benefits   stockbased compensation  the company accounts for stock option awards in accordance with asc  the estimated grantdate fair value of stockbased awards adjusted for those awards that are not expected to vest forfeitures is expensed over the requisite service period which is typically equivalent to the vesting term of the award     the company’s accounting policy for equity instruments issued to consultants and vendors in exchange for goods and services received follows the provisions of asc topic  accordingly the measurement date for the fair value of the equity instruments issued is determined at the earlier of i the date at which a commitment for performance by the consultant or vendor is reached or ii the date at which the consultant or vendor’s performance is complete in the case of equity instruments issued to consultants the fair value of the equity instrument is recognized over the term of the consulting agreement   research and development  research and development costs are expensed as incurred in instances where we enter into agreements with third parties for research and development activities we may prepay for services at the initiation of the contract we record the prepayment as a prepaid asset and amortize the asset into research and development expense over the period of time the contracted research and development services are performed   net loss per common share  basic net loss income per common share excludes any dilutive effects of equity instruments  we compute basic net loss income per common share using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period  we compute diluted net loss income per common share using the weighted average number of common shares and common stock equivalents outstanding during the period for the nine months ended september   common stock equivalents including  shares of convertible preferred stock options for  shares of common stock and warrants for  shares of common stock were excluded because their effect was antidilutive   subsequent events  the company has evaluated all subsequent events through the date of this filing     note  new accounting standards   in november  the fasb issued asu  “income taxes topic  related to the balance sheet classification of deferred taxes” which will require entities to present deferred tax assets dtas and deferred tax liabilities dtls as noncurrent in a classified balance sheet the asu simplifies the current guidance asc  which requires entities to separately present dtas and dtls as current and noncurrent in a classified balance sheet the asu is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after december   and interim periods within those annual periods the company is evaluating the impact of the standard on its consolidated financial statements but upon adoption it is not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements        evolutionary genomics inc notes to financial statements september   unaudited     in may  and further amended in august  march  and april  asus no  no  no  and no  were issued related to revenue from contracts with customers which  supersedes existing revenue recognition guidance  in august  the fasb approved a one year delay of the effective date to reporting periods beginning after december   while permitting companies to voluntarily adopt the new standard as of the original effective date the core principle of the comprehensive new guidance is to recognize revenues when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which an entity expects to be entitled for those goods or services the guidance defines a five step process to achieve this core principle and in doing so more judgment and estimates may be required within the revenue recognition process than are required under existing us gaap the new standard permits two implementation approaches one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards the company is currently evaluating the impacts of adoption and the implementation approach to be used   in august  the fasb issued asu  “presentation of financial statements — going concern subtopic  disclosure of uncertainties about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern” “asu ” which requires management to evaluate in connection with preparing financial statements for each annual and interim reporting period whether there are conditions or events considered in the aggregate that raise substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a going concern within one year after the date that the financial statements are issued or within one year after the date that the financial statements are available to be issued when applicable and provide related disclosures asu  is effective for the annual period ending after december   and for annual and interim periods thereafter early adoption is permitted the company believes the adoption of this guidance will not have a material effect on its consolidated financial statements   in february  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  leases topic  the new standard establishes a rightofuse rou model that requires a lessee to record a rou asset and a lease liability on the balance sheet for all leases with terms longer than  months leases will be classified as either finance or operating with classification affecting the pattern of expense recognition in the income statement the new standard is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years a modified retrospective transition approach is required for lessees for capital and operating leases existing at or entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period presented in the financial statements with certain practical expedients available we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption   in march  the fasb issued asu no  investments—equity method and joint ventures topic  this standard eliminates the requirement that when an existing cost method investment qualifies for use of the equity method an investor must restate its historical financial statements as if the equity method had been used during all previous periods under the new guidance at the point an investment qualifies for the equity method any unrealized gain or loss in accumulated other comprehensive incomeloss aoci will be recognized through earnings the standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   although early adoption is permitted we are currently evaluating the impact of adoption   in march  the fasb issued asu no  compensation—stock compensation topic  this standard makes several modifications to topic  related to the accounting for forfeitures employer tax withholding on sharebased compensation and the financial statement presentation of excess tax benefits or deficiencies asu  also clarifies the statement of cash flows presentation for certain components of sharebased awards the standard is effective for interim and annual reporting periods beginning after december   although early adoption is permitted we are currently assessing how the adoption of this standard will impact our consolidated financial statements   in january  the fasb issued asu  financial instruments  overall recognition and measurement of financial assets and financial liabilities  this asu is intended to improve the recognition and measurement of financial instruments among other things this asu requires certain equity investments to be measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income this guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods therein the company is currently assessing the impact this guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements        evolutionary genomics inc notes to financial statements september   unaudited     in march  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  derivatives and hedging topic  – contingent put and call options in debt instruments  “asu ” which will reduce diversity of practice in identifying embedded derivatives in debt instruments asu  clarifies that the nature of an exercise contingency is not subject to the “clearly and closely” criteria for purposes of assessing whether the call or put option must be separated from the debt instrument and accounted for separately as a derivative public business entities must apply the new requirements for fiscal years beginning after december   and interim periods within those fiscal years the company is currently assessing the impact that adopting this new accounting standard will have on its consolidated financial statements   note  fair value measurements   the company complies with the provisions of fasb asc no  “fair value measurements and disclosures” “asc ” in measuring fair value and in disclosing fair value measurements at the measurement date asc  defines fair value establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements required under other accounting pronouncements fair value is an exit price representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date fair value measurements also reflect the assumptions market participants would use in pricing an asset or liability based on the best information available assumptions include the risks inherent in a particular valuation technique such as a pricing model andor the risks inherent in the inputs to the model   asc  provides three levels of the fair value hierarchy as described below   level  inputs – quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level  inputs – observable marketbased inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities   level  inputs – unobservable inputs that are supported by little or no market activity   when determining the fair value measurements for assets or liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at andor marked to fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability when possible the company looks to active and observable markets to price identical assets when identical assets are not traded in active markets the company looks to market observable data for similar assets   the following tables summarize the basis used to measure certain financial assets and liabilities at fair value on a recurring basis in the consolidated balance sheets                                         total     quoted prices in active markets for identical items level      significant other observable inputs level      significant unobservable inputs level    balance at december

       evolutionary genomics inc notes to financial statements september   unaudited     the following summarizes the valuation technique for assets and liabilities measured and recorded at fair value

or closest to the respective period end date the carrying value of financial instruments including cash receivables accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates their fair value at september   and december   due to the relatively shortterm nature of these instruments   note  property and equipment   property and equipment is comprised of the following as of september   and december
