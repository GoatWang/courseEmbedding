comment report abusetranscript of mentor presentationblack woman leader projectblack women status achievement  impact vicki r palmer why mrs palmer mrs palmer as a change agent in her own words i chose to shadow vicki r palmer for my black woman leader project i became acquainted with mrs palmer after being awarded the palmer scholarship through an internship with coca cola refreshments the corporation established the scholarship program in honor of mrs palmer a twenty year veteran of the spelman college board of trustees during her tenure as the executive vice president of financial services and administration for cocacola enterprises the award is presented to five students who exhibit academic promise and a commitment to service following the completion a paid summer internship at ccr after our first meeting it was clear to me that mrs palmer was an extraordinary and uncommonly gifted african american woman  professional accomplishments after a prosperous twenty two year career with coca cola mrs palmer established the palmer group llc a general consulting firm she serves on the board of directors for haverty furniture companies and the first horizon national corporation mrs palmer has been recognized by black enterprise magazine as one of the nation’s “ women of power and influence” and as one of the “top  blacks in corporate america” the atlanta business league saluted her with its prestigious millennium pacesetter award she was named an outstanding georgia citizen by georgia’s secretary of state and women looking ahead magazine named her one of “georgia’s  most powerful women” in her own words one of the most pivotal moments of my career was when i was named vicepresident and treasurer of cocacola enterprises at the age of  the year was  and it was virtually unheard of for a black female to be treasurer of a fortune  company i would say that the second most pivotal moment was when i was named to my first corporate board in my case it was an extraordinary story the very first place i worked was a bank in memphis tn where i became the first african american and the first female to complete their corporate training program i only worked for the bank for two years as i was recruited away by federal express which is headquartered in memphis roll the clock forward almost  years later when i became the first woman and the only african american to sit on the board of that bank on october  of this year mrs palmer held a luncheon at phipps plaza to raise money for spelman college scholarships attendees included dr beverly tatum rosalind brewer the president and ceo of sams club mrs carolyn young wife of andrew young latanya richardson wife of samuel l jakson philanthropist millie smith and keshia knight pulliam who served as the mistress of ceremony for the occasion mrs palmer was gracious enough to include the palmer scholars and the spelman college glee club in the event the fundraiser raised  for spelman college scholarships my mother instilled in me a tremendous work ethic a great sense of responsibility and an enormous amount of faith she told me that my faith in god would sustain me all the days of my life if i held on to even the smallest measure of that faith she suffered so much during her short life yet she never complained i was always clear that any obstacles that came my way would pale by comparison to what she endured by the time she died her dreams for me had become my dreams i was determined not to let her down thus began my journey for excellence personal achievements despite her exceptional corporate career mrs palmer’s greatest accomplishments rest in the manner in which she’s been able to help others succeed “young people are the joy of my life” she’s said “it’s all about giving back and what better way to give back than to spend time with young people my life is richly blessed by many exceptional young people” palmer continues “i hope all of us reach out to the phenomenal youth in our community” aside from spelman college mrs palmer is on the board of governors for woodward academy here in atlanta as well the board of trustees for rhodes college her alma mater as my career began to blossom i always pursued excellence and i always believed in hard work what i came to realize is that the combination of these two things is incredibly powerful i began to see that the possibilities for my career were exceptional if i continued to work harder than anyone else and was patient the more i accomplished the more motivated i became i truly wanted to reach a place in the corporate world where i could make a difference to the bottom line success of the company but also make a difference in the lives of the employees who looked like me i like to think i accomplished both mrs palmer on motivation there certainly have been moments where i felt marginalized as a result of my race or gender what i learned over the years was that each person has to decide for him or herself how to handle these situations even in  they still occur although one hopes with less frequency the great news is more people who look like you and me are beginning to hold that book excellence and hard work remain the best way to the top add exceptional communications skills a willingness to be a team player and a super mentor to the mix and you just might get close to
