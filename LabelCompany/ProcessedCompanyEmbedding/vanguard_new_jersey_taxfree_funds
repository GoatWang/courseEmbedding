fund’s performance could be hurt bystatespecific risk the chance that developments in new jersey such as tax legislative or political changes will adversely affect the securities held by the fund or that are available for investment by the fund because the fund invests primarily in securities issued by new jersey and its municipalities it is more vulnerable to the credit risk and unfavorable developments in new jersey than are funds that invest in municipal securities of many states unfavorable developments in any economic sector may have farreaching ramifications on the overall new jersey municipal marketinterest rate risk the chance that bond prices will decline because of rising interest rates interest rate risk should be high for the fund because it invests primarily in longterm bonds whose prices are much more sensitive to interest rate changes than are the prices of shortterm bondscall risk the chance that during periods of falling interest rates issuers of callable bonds may call redeem securities with higher coupon rates or interest rates before their maturity dates the fund would then lose any price appreciation above the bond’s call price and would be forced to reinvest the unanticipated proceeds at lower interest rates resulting in a decline in the fund’s income such redemptions and subsequent reinvestments would also increase the fund’s
