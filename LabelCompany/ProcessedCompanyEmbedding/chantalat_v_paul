crossappeal from judgments of the circuit court for richland county� kent c houck judge� reversed and cause remanded with directions ����������������������� before gartzke pj dykman and sundby jj ����������������������� gartzke pj� st paul fire  casualty company appeals from a judgment for  in favor of richland valley products for breach of contract and for bad faith denial of richlands insurance claim and from a judgment in favor of richland valley products awarding taxable costs in the amount of � we conclude that the dispositive issue is whether as a matter of law st pauls policy covered richlands loss� because we conclude the loss is not covered we reverse without reaching the other issues presented in the appeal and richlands crossappeal ����������������������� both parties moved for summary judgment� st paul sought dismissal of the complaint on grounds of policy exclusions and richland sought summary judgment on grounds that coverage exists� the trial court denied st pauls motion and granted richlands� ����������������������� because both parties moved for summary judgment we may assume that the pertinent facts regarding coverage are undisputed� powalka v state mut life assurance co  wisd    nwd   � moreover richland does not dispute st pauls statement of the pertinent facts� the facts being undisputed whether coverage exists is a question of law� thompson v threshermens mut ins co  wisd    nwd   ct app � we decide the coverage issue independently of the trial courts opinion� id ����������������������� richland has manufactured ice cream bars and other ice cream and frozen water novelties since early � its plant contains various machines to manufacture and package novelties including a twentyyearold used molding machine called the gram ii machine ����������������������� some of richlands manufacturing machines including the gram ii must be kept at temperatures well below freezing in order to make novelties of good quality� to that end the gram ii has a helical coil composed of a number of coil pipes� the coil is submerged in a large vat filled with a brine solution of water and calcium chloride� the coil is connected to the plants refrigeration system and filled with ninetynine percent pure liquid ammonia� the ammonia is kept at a temperature of about minus eightyfive fahrenheit well below the temperature of the brine� the coil keeps the brine at a temperature low enough to cool the molds to a proper temperature� because heat moves from the brine to the coil ammonia is circulated through the coil system so that it can be recooled at the point of origin ����������������������� the gram ii is connected to the plants central refrigeration system� the system pumps liquid ammonia refrigerant through a network of piping to other production machinery and the cold storage inventory area� ����������������������� on august   richland began experiencing difficulty in maintaining low temperatures in the gram ii and other machines� it investigated the problem and notified st paul and another of its insurers of a loss� those companies and richland hired engineers to determine the cause of the problem� the engineers determined that the problem happened in the following manner ����������������������� when the gram ii machine was originally built a cooling coil was welded to support struts in the machine� when the welder attached the coil to its support struts the welder allowed the strut or welding material to penetrate the walls of the coil leaving holes in the coil� after welding the coil was galvanized and the holes were coated with a thin skin of metal� the coating eventually deteriorated exposing the holes ����������������������� when the holes appeared brine entered the coil� the brine and ammonia in the coil mixed and calcium chloride and ammonium chloride salts crystallized and precipitated out of the solution� the salts clogged the piping system and spread to other parts of the refrigeration system� the clogging reduced the systems efficiency forcing richland to shut down its entire manufacturing operation in order to eliminate the clogging ����������������������� st pauls output protection policy mop policy contains the following coverage provisions what this agreement covers� well protect insured property against risks of direct physical loss or damage except as excluded in the exclusionslosses we wont cover section of this agreement ����������������������� the policy contains the following failurefaulty work exclusion clause mechanical breakdown� we wont cover loss to covered property caused or made worse by� mechanical breakdown failure derangement of mechanical parts rupture caused by centrifugal force or defects due to faulty work design materials or manufacture   but if a loss not otherwise excluded results well pay for the loss that results directly from the covered cause ����������������������� the mop policy also contains the following contamination exclusion clause corrosion  inherent nature  animals� we wont cover loss or damage caused or made worse by�   mold wet or dry rot rust corrosion or contamination including fungal or bacterial contamination      if a loss that would otherwise be covered results from one of these causes well pay for the direct loss that results ����������������������� we begin with a statement of the principles we must employ when deciding if coverage exists� whether coverage exists requires judicial construction of the policy� that requires an examination of the language of the policy in wisconsin the construction of contracts of insurance should be made with an aim toward effecting the true intent of the parties and the extent of policy coverage� limpert v smith  wisd   nwd   schuhknecht v robers  wis   nw  � the test is not what the insurer intended the words to mean but what a reasonable person in the position of the insured would have understood them to mean �ehlers v colonial penn ins co  wisd    nwd   citation omitted� when a policy is clear and unambiguous on its face the terms of that policy should not be rewritten by construction to bind an insurer to a risk it never contemplated or was willing to cover and for which it was never paid� limpert  wisd at � however when the terms of the policy are ambiguous or obscure the policy must be strictly construed against the drafter of the policy the insurance company� wisconsin builders inc v general ins co  wisd    nwd  � words or phrases in a contract are ambiguous when they are reasonably or fairly susceptible to more than one construction� stanhope  wisd at  gonzalez v city of franklin  wisd    nwd    ����������������������� with these principles in mind we continue with our analysis of the policy before us in light of the uncontroverted facts on which coverage exists or falls   �� contamination ����������������������� richlands serious losses have been traced to the welders error when gram ii was manufactured� the welders error caused the defect in the coil which led to the brines entering the coil and mixing with the ammonia� because the defect was due to faulty workmanship and manufacture the resulting loss is excluded under the failurefaulty work exclusion unless a loss not otherwise excluded resulted� we therefore examine the contamination exclusion� the question is as st paul contends whether loss or damage was caused or made worse by contamination ����������������������� the trial court concluded that because each side in this litigation reads the term contamination differently it is ambiguous and must be construed against the insurer st paul� that is not the test for ambiguity� a policy term is ambiguous only if it is reasonably susceptible to more than one construction� garriguenc v love  wisd    nwd   � a policy term is not ambiguous merely because the parties disagree as to its meaning� us fire ins co v ace baking co  wisd    nwd   ct app  bartel v carey  wisd    nwd   ct app � ����������������������� the term contamination as used in st pauls policy is unambiguous� other jurisdictions have almost uniformly construed the term in insurance policies in light of modern dictionary definitions and concluded that it is unambiguous� as said in american casualty co of reading pa v myrick  fd   th cir  contamination connotes a condition of impurity resulting from mixture or contact with a foreign substance and that it means to make inferior or impure by mixture an impairment of impurity loss of purity resulting from mixture or contact a definition the court found consistent with common understanding and websters new international dictionary� even if exclusions from allrisk policies are construed narrowly and in favor of the insured the term contamination is plain� auten v employers nat ins co  swd   tx ct app � contamination occurs when a condition of impairment or impurity results from mixture or contact with a foreign substance� id at  citing american casualty co of reading pa  fd at � the ohio court of appeals said regarding a contamination exclusion giving the word contaminate its usual and ordinary meaning it means to render unfit for use by the introduction of unwholesome or undesirable elements� hartory v state auto mut ins co  ned   ohio ct app  citing websters third new international dictionary   see also raybestosmanhattan v indus risk insurers  ad   pa super ct  citing dictionary definition ����������������������� contamination may describe damage to food as in american casualty co of reading pa  fd at  where ammonia rendered refrigerated food stuffs unfit for human consumption but contamination is by no means limited to food spoilage� in hig inc v st paul fire  marine ins co  fsupp  dc mass  affd  fd  st cir  plaintiffs manufactured small switching devices or relays� during their manufacture the relays were placed in an industrial oven� oil vapor was accidently drawn into the oven and covered the relays in it� the hig court said that contamination cannot be restricted to food spoilage occurring as the result of bacteria� rather contamination connotes a condition of impurity resulting from mixture or a contact with a foreign substance� id at � it means to make unfit for use by introduction of unwholesome or undesirable elements id at  citing websters third international dictionary and implies intrusion of or contact with an outside source as its cause� id at � the court said what happened in this instance is clearly a case of contamination� an undesirable element oil vapor was introduced into the relays from an outside source and it was precisely the intrusion of this outside element and its presence within or in contact with the relays that rendered them unfit for the use for which they were intended id ����������������������� the hig courts holding that contamination is not limited to food spoilage is consistent with rulings by other courts� in auten  swd at  the court held that fogging the plaintiffs home with an abovenormal level of an oilbased pesticide contaminated the home within the meaning of a contamination exclusion� in hartory  ned at  a contamination exclusion applied when methane gas seeped from a landfill into plaintiffs home and rendered it and a well unfit for use� and in js enterprises v continental cas co  pd   col ct app  asbestos fibers released during a store renovation were held to come within an unambiguous contamination exclusion� see also falcon products inc v ins co of pa  fsupp   dc mo  affd  fd  th cir  where plaintiff conceded that radioactive scrap metal plaintiff purchased and used in its products was contaminated� ����������������������� here the trial court also reasoned that contamination had not occurred because after the galvanizing broke loose in a very short process a few hours from possibly as much as a day or two the refrigeration system malfunctioned� the court looked to the conditions listed in the contamination exclusion clause mold wet or dry rot rust corrosion or contamination said that all are slow processes that occur over time and concluded that the exclusion did not apply to richlands loss ����������������������� we have located only one decision holding contamination must be a slow process� in largent v state farm fire  cas co  pd  or ct app  the plaintiffs tenants operated an illegal laboratory creating airborne vapor and particulates which permeated porous materials in the apartment such as drapes carpets and woodwork� plaintiff argued and the oregon court agreed that the contamination exclusion applies only when contamination happens over time� id at � we reject the largent courts reasoning� it is contrary to the several cases we have cited from other jurisdictions in which contamination occurred during a short period� moreover time lapse has specifically been held irrelevant to application of another condition corrosion listed in st pauls contamination exclusion clause� see arkwrightboston mfrs v wausau paper mills co  fd   th cir  concluding speed at which corrosion took place not relevant to whether it falls under the corrosion exclusion ����������������������� finally the trial court concluded from the wording contamination including fungal or bacterial contamination in st pauls policy that the exclusion is restricted to fungal or bacterial contamination� the court relied on the application of the doctrine of ejusdem generis in wisconsin builders inc v general insurance company  wisd   nwd  � we conclude that the doctrine does not apply to st pauls contamination exclusion ����������������������� the wisconsin builders court construed a builders risk policy which provided coverage for risks of direct physical loss to an apartment building while under construction� id at   nwd at � part of the building collapsed� the policy covered the collapse unless an earth movement exclusion applied� that exclusion described earth movement including but not limited to earthquake volcanic eruption landslide mud flow earth sinking earth rising or shifting� id at   nwd at � the wisconsin builders court said that most courts had found the exclusion ambiguous and had applied ejusdem generis to limit the definition of earth movement�  wisd at   nwd at � after noting that on other occasions it had recognized the applicability of the ejusdem generis rule in construing overly broad and ambiguous terms in insurance contracts the supreme court applied the ejusdem generis rule to limit the earth movement exclusion� id at   nwd at  ����������������������� wisconsin builders is not in point� the contamination exclusion in st pauls policy is neither overly broad nor ambiguous� for that reason the ejusdem generis rule is inapplicable ����������������������� the case law satisfies us that st pauls contamination clause is unambiguous and applies to the undisputed facts� the question is then whether coverage nevertheless exists by virtue of the ensuing loss clause following st pauls contamination clause and we turn to that issue �� ensuing loss ����������������������� st paul appears to take the position that because contamination occurred and loss or damage caused by contamination is excluded further analysis is unnecessary� st pauls reasoning is based on the ensuing loss clause immediately following the mechanical breakdown exclusion since loss resulting from contamination is a loss otherwise excluded� however the policy contains two ensuing loss clauses� the contamination exclusion has its own ensuing loss clause� the question is whether the loss resulting from contamination is covered by virtue of the latter ensuing loss clause the clause providing at the end of the contamination exclusion if a loss that would otherwise be covered results from one of these causes well pay for the direct loss that results ����������������������� we first pinpoint the nature of the contamination and the loss it caused in the case before us� contamination occurred when brine entered the coil and mixed with the ammonia in it� the two substances mixed and they were not supposed to� the brine was foreign to the ammonia and their mixing resulted in a loss of purity� that is contamination within the dictionary definitions and the case law from other jurisdictions construing and applying the term� the loss from the contamination is the impure ammonia ����������������������� st paul would extend the initial contamination beyond the mixing of ammonia and brine and the loss of pure ammonia to the crystallization and precipitation of salts that the mixing caused and then to the salts spreading to and clogging the other parts of the system� we disagree with that extension� when the brine mixed with the ammonia that was contamination� the crystallization and precipitation of salts out of the solution and circulation through the system resulted from the mixing� the question is whether the loss resulting from the crystallization and precipitation and the salts spreading throughout and clogging the system is covered by virtue of the ensuing loss clause that accompanies the contamination exclusion� we conclude the resulting loss is not covered ����������������������� the clogging was a direct physical loss but it was a loss which would not be otherwise covered because it was caused by the circulation of salt� the direct physical loss was caused by additional contamination and loss caused by contamination is an excluded loss� to demonstrate that contamination resulted we need only refer to the case law of other jurisdictions we have reviewed which held that particular losses described were excluded by virtue of a contamination clause� the contamination here is comparable to the contamination from the oil that covered relays in hig inc  fsupp at  to the pesticide that fogged a home in auten  swd at  to the methane gas which seeped into a home in hartory  ned at  and to the asbestos fibers released during a store renovation in js enterprises  pd at  ����������������������� the difference between those cases and the case before us is that the salt that circulated throughout and clogged richlands system resulted from the initial contamination itself the mixing of brine and ammonia but it is as much an additional contamination as if somebody had injected salt from an outside source into the piping which was used to circulate refrigerant� had the initial contamination resulted in fire for example that loss would have been covered under the ensuing loss clause� loss by fire is a loss not otherwise excluded� but here the result was loss resulting from contamination and loss caused by contamination is excluded from coverage ����������������������� from richlands point of view its loss is largely the lost earnings and other expenses it has had� however those losses are not due to a covered cause of loss under the blanket earnings and expense coverage endorsement to st pauls policy� that endorsement provides well pay your actual loss of earnings as well as extra expenses that result from the necessary suspension of your operations during the period of restoration caused by direct physical loss or damage to property at an insured location� the loss or damage must occur while this endorsement is in effect and must be due to a covered cause of loss� emphasis added while physical loss or damage occurred to richlands system it was not due to a covered cause of loss� it is an excluded loss � conclusion ����������������������� because the undisputed facts establish that richlands loss is not a covered loss the trial court should have dismissed richlands complaint� since coverage does not exist there is no basis for richlands claims for breach of contract and bad faith damages� our disposition moots the various other issues raised in richlands crossappeal all of which are predicated on the assumption that st pauls policy covers richlands losses ����������������������� by the court�judgments reversed and remanded with directions to dismiss the complaint ����   the same principle applies to statutory construction� ambiguity arises in a statute when its language may be reasonably construed in two different ways� kl v hinickle  wisd    nwd   � for that reason ambiguity does not arise just because persons unreasonably reach different conclusions� girouard v jackson cir ct  wisd    nwd   � as the girouard court said the litigants cannot by disagreeing limit the legal responsibility of the court to make that determination� id� see also harnischfeger corp v lirc  wisd    nwd    that two parties interpret statute differently does not in itself create an ambiguity   ������ were the principle otherwise in insurance law merely by asserting an alternative reading for otherwise plain words a party to an insurance contract could create an ambiguity where none exists� such a principle would invariably lead to policy disputes being resolved in favor of the insured� see wisconsin builders inc v general ins co  wisd    nwd    ambiguous term insurance policy is normally construed in favor of the insured and against the insurer ����   a contaminate need not effect an actual physical change in the form or substance of the product itself� hig inc  fsupp at � the first circuit agreed hig  fd at  ����   the parties use ensuing loss as a shorthand reference to the clause� the policy itself does not use the term ����   thus we do not use the analysis st paul proposes on the basis of acme galvanizing co v firemans life ins co  cal rptr  cal ct app  and chadwick v fire ins exchange  cal rptr d  cal ct app  but the result would be the same� the acme court held that the ensuing loss provision in that case applied when there is a peril ie a hazard or occurrence which causes a loss or injury separate and independent but resulting from the original excluded peril and this new peril is not an excluded one from which loss ensues� acme  cal rptr at � st pauls ensuing loss provision makes no reference to a peril it is unambiguous and does not require construction� the chadwick court imposed the additional peril requirement in a case which appears not to have involved ensuing loss clause
