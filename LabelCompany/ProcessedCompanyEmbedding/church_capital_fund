campaign will produce spiritual as well as financial fruit if you are looking to raise money for your church’s building fund or other capital expense you need to look beyond the bake sale and chicken

provide biblical teaching most churches found that their people were in need of practical and inspirational instruction and encouragement in the areas of christian generosity  churches found it helpful and very important that these areas be taught from the pulpit by the sr pastor andor an experienced financial speaker so that a proper spiritual tone and biblical basis was in place for the drive  many churches have found that using the  day spiritual journey to a more generous life bible devotional wwwgenerouslifeinfo has greatly inspired people spiritually to become more generous and to increase their giving commitments lesson   aim to make the fund drive a rich spiritual experience many churches indicated that their expansion drives helped deepen peoples faith and spiritual commitment ie  especially through the increased vision people received the interaction people had with others during the drive andor their increased or sacrificial giving to the lords work at the church  to add positive humor to your encouragement for people to be generous use financial funnies cartoons from wwwkluthorgcartoonshtm   lesson   include personal testimonies a number of churches actively included personal testimonies during worship times from people who have experienced the grace of giving in their lives andor who were specifically led by the lord to become supportive of the expansion project written testimonies handouts and articles were also used to help encourage people in the spiritual aspects of their giving decisions  weekly questions from the wwwgenerouslifeinfo devotional can help people determine how to share their generosity storytestimony in a positive way the importance of identifying  informing lesson   have a comprehensive plan every successful funding effort had a specific plan on how they were going to instruct inspire inform and appropriately involve people within the following groups leadership church leadership pastors staff heads and key leaders of church ministriescommittees active membership people regularly involved in serving and small group ministries potential major givers people who exhibited the gift of giving in the past or who may have the potential to be a major financial help in the drive regular attenders people who attend church at least twice a month fringe people occasional or sporadic attenders lesson   get experienced counsel andor help in addition to the active involvement of many lay leaders and present staff nearly all the churches that raised major dollars for expansion efforts used some level of experienced help and professional guidance usually from external sources to lead them through the funding process lesson   develop helpful collateral materials each church developed materials that effectively informed their congregation what the plans were and what level of help and support would be needed items often developed included multimedia presentations casestatement brochures question and answer flyers personal presentation packets commitment cards mailings and update sections in church publications the importance of inviting  involving lesson   have specific commitment times following a period of advance instruction inspiration and information churches would invite their people to carefully and prayerfully indicate how the lord has led them to be involved in the church expansion plans in a number of cases this was done in two stages the first stage would be receiving the commitments from the families that make up the churchs main leadership and lead givers and the second phase  weeks later would be receiving the commitments from the rest of the congregation on a specific target date or event      note this information was gathered through interviews brian kluth
