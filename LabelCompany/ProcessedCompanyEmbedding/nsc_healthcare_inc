immunological activity versus large particle andor aggregated clumped together glucan to boost the immune response  quotes with findings from the two reports follow “the macrophage phagocytosis is more enhanced by microparticulate bglucan than by its aggregated clumped large particle form biological activity of bglucan can be improved by reducing the size of its particles  the particles having  µm microns in diameter are optimally phagocytized by macrophages” internalized by the macrophage immune cells”  “it is known that immunological activity of bglucan depends on particle dimensions and can be improved by reducing the size of the particles” the enhanced immune benefits of microparticulate glucan were further stated in us patent  httpwwwnsccomdsmpatenthtm  which included the statement as the glucan reaggregates to a size of greater than one micron in diameter some of the beneficial effect of the glucan is not achieved because the macrophage receptors are not activated as readily by glucan greater than one micron in diameter because the receptor size on corresponding cells and molecules that accept the glucan is generally about one micron in size    a peerreviewed article from

viable up to  minutes  wwwcidrapumnedunewsperspectivecommentaryhealthworkersneedoptimalrespiratoryprotectionebola    the center for infectious disease research and policy cidrap since  has been a global leader in addressing public health preparedness regarding emerging infectious diseases and biosecurity responses  although the center for infectious disease research and policy acknowledges that they were first skeptical that ebola virus could be an aerosoltranmissible disease airborne they are now persuaded by a review of  experimental and epidemiologic data that this might be an important feature of disease transmission particularly in healthcare settings the president cdc and other government health agencies in addition to most physicians to date in public hearings protocols and announcements have acknowledged a transmission path of solely direct contact and denied the possibility of airborne or aerosol transmission to quote from the cidrap ebola commentary dated september   by lisa m brosseau scd and rachael jones phd medical and infection control professionals have relied for years on a paradigm for aerosol transmission of infectious diseases based on a very outmoded research and an overly simplistic interpretation of the data early aerobiologists were not able to measure small particles near an infectous person   in the s and s william f wells and other aerobiologists employed now significantly outofdate sampliing methods  they concluded that organisms capable of aerosol transmission termed airborne can only do so at around  feet from the source  because they thought that only large particles would be present near the source they believed people would be exposed only via large droplets on their face eyes or nose modern research using more sensitive instruments and analytic methods has shown that aerosols emitted from the respiratory tract contain a wide distribution of particle sizes  including many that are small enough to be inhaled  thus both small and large particles will be present near an infectious person  the important points are that virusladen bodily fluids may be aerosolized and inhaled while a person is in proximity to an infectious person and that a wide range of particle sizes can be inhaled and deposited thoughout the respiratory tract quoting further from the cidrap commentary some pathogens are limited in the cell type and location they infect influenza for example is generally restricted to respiratory epithelial cells which explains why flu is primarily a respiratory infection and is most likely aerosol transmissible  hiv infects thelper cells in the lymphoid tissues and is primarily a bloodborne pathogen with low probability for transmission via aerosols  ebola virus on the other hand is a broaderacting and more nonspecific pathogen that can impede the proper functioning of macrophages and dendritic cells  immune response cells located in the epithelium epithelial tissues are found throughout the body including in the respiratory tract  ebola prevents these cells macrophages and dendritic immune cells from carrying out their antiviral functions but does not interfere with the intitial inflammatory response which attracts additional cells to the infection site  the latter contribute to further dissemination of the virus and similar adverse consequences far beyond the initial infection site  the immune cells exposed to ebola hf virus are prevented from creating essential antibodies needed to kill the virus while the inflammation continues unabated throughout the body where the virus penetrates blood vessels and tissue creating internal and external bleeding and fever  by preventing blood clotting in the virus penetrated blood vessels and tissues the ebola hf virus can cause external hemorrhaging through blood droplets containing virus infected blood which then are potentially projected to animals and humans in the vicinity cidrap is warning surgical facemasks do not prevent transmission of ebola and healthcare professionals must immediately be outfitted with fullhooded protective gear and powered airpurifying respirators cidraps opinion on ebola virus is there are no proven pre or postexposure treatment modalities a high casefatality rate and unclear modes of transmission     am est texas nurse nina pham who cared for ebola patient thomas

standards that vary depending on funding and training time and facilities   abbigail tumpey cdc spokeswoman spearheading hospital education outreach stated there are   actual hospitals in the us and i would say probably the number of them that have actually done drills or put plans in place is small for many hospitals and health personnel guideline posters and pamphlets have been the form of guidelines although the cdc has announced several future training and guidelines symposiums for health professionals in the near future  the decisions of whether to move or the process of moving a confirmed ebola patient from one hospital to another are also under further review full protection against ebola is expensive involving special gowns gloves a mask and face shield the putting on and taking off of the protective gear safely is a multistep timeconsuming process with many steps needing training and drills  one potential point of exposure is during glove removal if the wearer then

characteristic of enterovirus d is the severity of respiratory issues  the d enterovirus form is particularly dangerous to immunocompromised children and seniors especially if a person is already susceptible to asthma or other respiratory health challenges symptoms can include coughing wheezing rapid or labored breathing especially if involving neck muscles not being able to catch ones breath blue lips and for some but not all a rash andor fever  wheezing is common in asthmatics acquiring d with a respirator required for many in these situations if a baby is unable to drink from a bottle

or  they only have mild illness like the common cold  but some people can have serious complications especially infants and people with weakened immune systems  there is no vaccine to protect you from nonpolio enterovirus infections since many infected people do not have symptoms it is difficult to prevent nonpolio enteroviruses from spreading enterovirus d can have serious complications as evidenced by more than  children being hospitalized recently in kansas city missouri with a reported  having been placed in intensive care  no fatalities have been reported due to enterovirus d to date recommended by the cdc is to wash hands with soap for at minimum  seconds  avoid touching and shaking hands especially in social settings such as schools and offices  clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces also suggested by many health professionals is the building up of the immune response while avoiding sugar and white refined products as foods that impair your immune response  get eight hours of sleep and moderate exercise  minimize stress both personal and universal as stress has a negative impact on your immune response  also suggested is nutritional

their further treatment in the us  both  have shown improvement after ongoing treatment with the experimental zmapp treatment   doctors at emory hospital in ga treating the ebola patients from africa have indicated their present treatment program is primarily keeping a patients body strong until body natural defenses can hopefully overcome the health challenge of the ebola virus while administering the experimental zmapp never tested for safety or effectiveness in humans the experimental treatment not a vaccine known as zmapp is made by mapp biopharmaceutical of san diego with funding from the us government only extremely limited amounts of the zmapp treatment exist to date according to the manufacturer according to the us center for disease control wwwcdcgov on  with the experimental zmapp treatment the monoclonal antibodies bind to the virus so that the human immune system can clear the virus  the wall street journal reported on  but good supportive care such as fluids to replace those lost in vomiting and diarrhea medication to bring down fevers and antibiotics for complications can improve a patients chances by keeping the immune system as strong as

abstract betaglucans are a heterogeneous group of natural polysaccharides mostly investigated for their immunological effects …the effects mainly depend on the source and structure of the betaglucans in the meantime several human clinical trials with dietary insoluble yeast betaglucans have been performed   the results confirm the previous findings of in vivo studies the results of all studies taken together clearly indicate that oral intake of insoluble yeast betaglucans is safe and has an immune strengthening effect   pmid  pubmed  in process pmcid pmc free pmc article link

centers for the study of nutrition and medicine and for nutritional research and clowes surgical metabolism laboratory beth israel deaconess medical center boston american journal of clinical nutrition vol  no   august    quotethe purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect on serum lipids of a yeastderived ßglucan fiber in  freeliving obese hypercholesterolemic men the yeastderived ßglucan fiber significantly lowered total cholesterol concentrations and was well tolerated…the link between elevated plasma ldlcholesterol concentrations and the risk of developing coronary artery disease has been clearly established…elevated plasma cholesterol and in particular ldlcholesterol concentrations are associated with increased risk of coronaryartery disease whereas an elevated of hdlcholesterol concentrationis inversely correlated with the incidence of cardiovascular…the yeastderived ßglucan fiber lowered total cholesterol and raised hdlcholesterol concentrations significantly … unlike the significant increases in hdlcholesterol concentrations observed  wk after the end of the study for subjects receiving the yeastderived ßglucan none of the  studies of oat products reported significant changes in hdl concentration …because higher hdlcholesterol concentrations are associated with a reduced risk of developing coronary artery disease there may be unique benefits of using the yeastderived ßglucan and perhaps psyllium rather than the oat products  notethe research utilized beta glucan from a source other than nsc   note the statements and news items in nsc
