organization that you favor or to think about your giving plan going forward depending on your individual situation there may be tax benefits to giving during the inheritance year especially if your tax bracket is higher due to income from the inheritancenbsp we recommend that you discuss these strategies with a qualified tax advisor before making any decisions p pwhen considering how when and where to give itrsquos important to think about which giving option fits best with your goals whether direct or indirect gifts while direct gifts of cash or stock are the most common type of

an alltime high as the economic expansion continueshspan stylecolor  outlook summer br  spanh heconomy h pconsistent with the trend of the last few years the economy was soft in the first quarter with growth of just  however we expect the rate of growth to increase as we progress through the remainder of the year just as it has in the recent past sustained gains in the labor market combined with low rates of inflation suggest that the expansion can continue with little risk of overheating given the sustained improvement in the labor market our central bank raised interest rates twice in the first half of  and has provided guidance that there will be another hike later this year p hinflation h pafter peaking in february of this year inflation rates have been slowly declining this phenomenon has spread beyond volatile commodities such as oil with prices falling in recent months for automobiles apparel and telephone calling plans looking forward we expect inflation to stabilize close to current levels given strength in the labor market rising capacity utilization and a continuation of the economic expansionnbspnbsp nbsp p hus dollar h pthe us dollar has declined steadily this year but remains at a historically high level improving fundamentals in foreign economies and slower than expected growth in the us has increased demand for foreign currencies in the coming months we expect the dollar to stabilize as foreign economies are improving but remain somewhat soft while the us expansion is firmly entrenchednbsp nbspnbspnbspnbsp p hspan stylecolor asset class spanh hcashmoney market instruments h pwith three federal reserve rate hikes in six months and us money market reforms almost nine months behind us the money markets are starting to approach normalcy yields on money market funds and shortterm bonds have appreciated along with the federal reserve policy moves this rise is likely to continue over the course of this year and next as policymakers are expected to continue with rate normalization p hintermediate governmentcredit bonds h pintermediateterm bond yields appear to have settled into a range with the fiveyear us treasury trading between  and  this year incremental moves within the range are likely to continue until there is a clear break in economic data a shift in monetary policy or implementation of fiscal policies that would change the outlook for inflation and growth the federal reserve is expected to continue reducing the level of stimulus as they have provided guidance that they expect to raise interest rates one more time this yearnbspthere are also indications that they will begin reducing the size of their  trillion balance sheet later this yearnbsphowever the course of their future policy remains fluid as it is data dependent p htaxexempt municipal bonds h pit has been an eventful first half of the year for municipal bonds despite challenges ranging from puerto ricorsquos troubles to tax reform and the perpetual concern of rising interest rates the municipal bond market has been strong the sector has been aided by a strong technical position supply from new issuance has been down about  compared to last year while maturities and calls have risen to elevated levels in the second half of  the market remains vulnerable to the repercussions of tax reform if and when the details of the legislation are announced and finalized from a credit perspective generally we continue to favor aa and aaa rated bonds at tighter spreads rather than reaching for yield in the a and bbb categories p hus equity h pthe stock market has generated strong gains in the first half of the year fueled by rising corporate earnings expectations for an eventual increase in economic growth and improving conditions in many foreign economies as we progress through the year we expect the market to trend higher driven by a continuation of these trends in fact earnings are expected to grow by about  this year without the help of a tax cut while stocks are expected to generate solid gains returns may be tempered by valuations that are above average and a steady withdrawal of stimulus from the federal reserve p hinternational equity h pinternational equities performed well in the first half of the year and for the first time since  are on track to outperform us stocks the gains are justified as economies in many foreign countries have improved and economic growth rates are accelerating in addition the improved outlook has resulted in a declining us dollar which has provided a nice tailwind to foreign stock returns despite the recent improvement in the outlook valuations remain attractive and aggressive monetary policies continue to be employed in europe and japan nbsp p hcommodity h pcommodity prices have been mixed this year within the commodity markets each segment has provided modest gains or losses except for energy advances in technology are allowing for a sustained increase in us production which has pushed the price of oil down approximately  this year looking forward we expect commodity prices to stabilize and eventually to trend upward as the global economic expansion continues p hspan stylecolor potential threats spanh prisks and notable items to watch p hrising protectionist sentiment h pglobally there is rising protectionist sentiment that is fueling a backlash against free trade while much of the rhetoric is likely a function of positioning for negotiating leverage there is a risk that supply chains will be negatively impacted and costs for some goods will increase p hgeopolitical risks h pconflicts in many parts of the world have escalated events in syria are critically important to monitor given russiarsquos support for the syrian government in north korea the government continues to develop and test ballistic missiles in defiance of united nations resolutions banning such tests just as important the heightened tensions in the south china sea also

the new administration is placing a stronger emphasis on trade and the loss of us jobs after their meetings earlier this year there has been a change in tone between the leaders which is encouraging as there appears to be an increased willingness to work together looking forward we will be watching for meaningful actions that demonstrate the leadersrsquo intentions to follow through on their discussions p hdebt related issues h psovereign debt levels continue to grow throughout much of the world generating conditions associated with low rates of economic growth in response to the low growth rates there has been a meaningful shift in the willingness to use fiscal policy to stimulate these economies however if the initiatives are debt financed they run the risk of exacerbating the

time to consider what will happen to your portfolio when they rise some industries benefit from rate hikes like banks and insurance so we believe it is good time to invest in those sectors in contrast incomeoriented investments generally fall in value as interest rates rise to bring their yields up to those offered by the rest of the marketnbsp p p it is also important to pay attention to the structure of investments and not just their inherent volatility for example individual bonds remain attractive in this environment in spite of the fact that there is potential for an increase in interest rates individual bonds have a set term to maturity as time passes the market value converges towards the stated maturity value regardless of the direction of interest rates in a rising rate environment an upward movement in rates will push the current market value of the bond down but that will be offset with the passage of time as the bond approaches maturity in contrast a bond fund never matures therefore as interest rates rise the value of the bond fund declines and there is no offsetting benefit from the underlying bonds moving closer to their maturity valuenbspnbspnbsp nbsp

expenses to establish and maintainmdashas well as require that a percentage of assets be granted each year yet while foundations must file tax returns donors receive income tax deductions for assets contributed to the foundation donating through a foundation makes sense when a family wants to personally deliver checks to the charities they support it wants to run the foundation and have full legal control and responsibility it wants to have family members receive compensation for services provided or it opts to have the foundation support scholarshipsmdashandor make loans to charities

whether it could be helpful to use a life alert device alternatively if you were to become disabled and could no longer live in your current home where would you live instead who would help you find a

economies rising government debt levels and a strong dollar are acting as headwinds looking forward we expect the expansion to continue but with a growth rate below the norm accordingly our central bank may be able to raise interest rates but we expect a gradual pace of rate normalizationnbsp p hinflationh pinflation remains quite low but it has been trending upwards in fact this year it has been hovering around  after spending much of  close to zero the increase is driven by the strength in prices for medical care services and housing looking forward we expect inflation to rise modestly given aggressive stimulus policies a strong employment market and the rebound in commodity pricesnbsp p hspan stylecolor us dollar spanh pthe us dollar has been strong due to the relative strength of our economy and expectations for an eventual rate hike by the federal reserve in the coming months we expect the dollar to remain elevated since the fed is seeking higher interest rates while most other central banks have an easing biasnbsp nbspnbsp p hspan stylecolor asset class spanh hcash and money market instruments h pnew sec rules governing money market mutual funds have resulted in higher interest rates for nongovernment securities that have shortterm maturities thenbspnew rules are intended to give investors more transparency on a daily basis and additional protection during rare periods of market stress as a result of the new regulatory environment money market funds have been net sellers of nongovernment bonds which has driven up interest rates on these securities while yields on treasury bills have remained relatively constant of course the ultimate impact on the supply and cost of shortterm loans will become clear after the markets have had time to adjust to the new rules in the interim expectations for an eventual rate hike by the federal reserve should result in an upward bias to interest ratesnbspnbspnbsp p hintermediate government and credit bonds h pin the face of relatively stable but subdued global growth central bank actions are the primary drivers of the fixed income markets in the us improving economic data and a calmer international backdrop have increased the probability of a rate hike later this year even with a hike bond yields will likely stay low and fluctuate within a narrow range given the strong influence of foreign inflows from countries whose governments are pursuing negative interest rates and quantitative easing policies investment grade corporate bonds remain our preference in taxable bonds as this sector benefits from modest economic growth and continued strong demand p htaxexempt municipal bonds h pthe fundamental backdrop for municipal bonds is generally sound but we are seeing some deterioration in a few pockets across the country as a result of slower tax revenues underfunded pension liabilities and the downturn in oil prices though new issuance of bonds is expected to be high strong investor demand should easily absorb the supplynbspour portfolio strategy currently emphasizes an enhanced laddered approach focused on intermediateterm bonds which provides flexibility in a variety of future interest rate environments p hus equity h pthe stock market has been volatile but has provided solid gains through the first nine months of the year stabilization in chinarsquos economy increased stimulus in europe and japan a rebound in oil prices and a modest decline in the us dollar helped to boost equities significantly from their february lows looking forward we expect the stock market to move higher driven by a continuation of the economic expansion and a rebound in corporate earnings growth however volatility is expected to remain elevated as the presidential election approaches european banks struggle with the need to boost capital and global growth remains modest nbspnbspnbspnbsp p hinternational equity h pin response to difficulties in their attempts to generate an enduring economic expansion foreign governments continue to utilize a myriad of strategies including aggressive monetary policies given the strong actions by these governments and attractive valuations international stocks are compelling from a longterm perspective however in the short term we expect these markets to remain volatile given the rising political discord in many countries a lack of consistent economic growth an undercapitalized banking system in europe and excessive debt levels p hcommodity h pafter declining dramatically in recent years commodity prices remain relatively subdued but they have rebounded from their lows oil and agricultural markets have been particularly volatile but reduced supply growth has led to a substantial rebound in oil prices in contrast abundant supplies led to a decline in agricultural commodities in the third quarter nbsplooking forward the trajectory of commodity prices will primarily be determined by the extent of production cuts in the coming months and the success of foreign governments in boosting their economic growth rates as the process develops we expect significant levels of volatility p hspan stylecolor potential threats spanh prisks and notable items to
