frequently trade at a market price that is below their net asset value important fund information the fund may invest up to  of its assets in foreign securities and invest in an array of security types and marketcap sizes each of which has a unique risk profile as a result of political or economic instability in foreign countries there can be special risks associated with investing in foreign securities these include fluctuations in currency exchange rates increased price volatility and difficulty obtaining information there are certain risks associated with an investment in a convertible bond such as default risk—that the company issuing a convertible security may be unable to repay principal and interest and interest rate risk—that the convertible may decrease in value if interest rates increase investments by the fund in lowerrated securities involve substantial risk of loss and present greater risks than investments in higherrated securities including less liquidity and increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk as interest rates go up the value of debt securities in the fund’s portfolio generally will decline the fund may invest in derivative securities including options the use of derivatives present risks different from and possibly greater than the risks associated with investing directly in traditional securities there is no assurance that any derivative strategy used by the fund will succeed one of the risks associated with purchasing an option is that the fund pays a premium whether or not the option is exercised the fund may seek to purchase index put options to help reduce downside exposure however the effectiveness of the fund’s index optionbased risk management strategy may be reduced if the fund’s equity portfolio does not correlate to the performance of the underlying option positions the fund also risks losing all or part of the cash paid for purchasing index options unusual market conditions or a lack of a ready market of any particular option at a specific time may reduce the effectiveness of the fund’s options strategies and for these and other reasons the fund’s options strategies may not reduce the fund’s volatility to the extent desired from time to time the fund may reduce its holdings of put options resulting in an increased exposure to a market decline the goal of the levelrate distribution policy is to provide investors a predictable though not assured level of cash flow monthly distributions paid may include net investment income net realized shortterm capital gains and if necessary return of capital maintenance of this policy may increase transaction and tax costs associated with the fund leverage creates risks which may adversely affect return including the likelihood of greater volatility of net asset value and market price of common shares and fluctuations in the variable rates
