a membrane glycoprotein present on the surface of all stages of b lymphocyte development and is also expressed on most bcell mature lymphoma cells and leukemia cells  cd is a glycoprotein expressed on blineage lymphoid precursors including precursor b acute lymphoblastic leukemia and often is coexpressed with cd on mature bcell malignancies such as lymphoma oxs targets cancer cells expressing the cd receptor or cd receptor or both receptors  when oxs binds to cancer cells the cancer cells internalize oxs and are killed due to the action of drugs cytotoxic payload  oxs has demonstrated success in early human clinical trials in patients with relapsedrefractory bcell lymphoma or leukemia twentyfive patients with advanced bcell lymphoid malignancies expressing cd andor cd were enrolled in a clinical study to evaluate oxs in a phase  fda study patients were enrolled that had previous failed chemotherapy immunotherapy andor hematopoietic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation patients received a single course of oxs according to study rules adverse events were successfully managed and included weight gain low albumin transaminitis and fever were transient grade – and occurred in patients at the higher doses tested µgkgday durable objective responses occurred in  patients at these higher doses a complete response occurred in the only patient given a second cycle of therapy that had a  cancer reduction after the first cycle of therapy the patient has been in remission for a year now correlative studies showed a surprisingly low incidence of neutralizing antibody  production that could be related to the drugs ability to suppress antibody responses  for further information about the clinical trial see bachanova v et al clin cancer res  march   about oxis biotech
