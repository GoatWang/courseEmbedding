now very pleased to turn the call over to our chief executive officer andreas rouve andreas rouve thanks dave and thank you all for joining us turning to slide  we delivered a very solid first quarter with improvement in all of our key financial targets adjusted ebitda free cash flow and adjusted earnings per share were up despite further currency headwinds and a strong focus of all major us retailers to reduce their inventory we grew adjusted ebitda as reported by  million or  if we exclude the negative currency impact of  million our organic adjusted ebitda increased by  over the very strong first quarter of fiscal  at the same time we improved our free cash flow in the quarter by  million compared to the first quarter of last year and our adjusted eps was up  the earnings growth was impacted by increased spending in several strategic initiatives despite those higher expenses we could increase our adjusted ebitda margin by  basis points to  due to our clear focus to grow our core profitable category with the launch of more innovative products as well as the expansion into more channels and more countries the growth in our core categories is partly offset by our strategic decision to exit unprofitable business and deemphasize low margin promotions on black friday and during the holidays as they only look great if you focus on market share but not if a company aims to grow ebitda and free cash flow as we do in total our net sales were down in the quarter as reported by  but if we consider the impact of currency the business exits and the two fewer days in the first quarter compared to last year we delivered on a comparable days basis organic growth in our core business of about  which was a key driver of our earnings improvement we are pleased with the performance of all divisions and regions even if we had to overcome one time headwinds in home and garden and global auto care which doug will explain in more detail hardware and home improvement delivered record quarter one results and also the performance of our global batteries and appliance division was excellent on a regional basis europe latin america canada and asia pacific reported solid adjusted ebitda growth despite the currency headwinds the reorganization of our asia pacific region last year with new leadership and clear strategic focus is starting to show operating performance improvement turning to slide  in line with our spectrum first strategic roadmap were focusing not only on becoming the preferred partner to our customers and employees but we are also working to continuously improve our processes to accelerate the sustainable growth of organic adjusted ebitda and free cash flow as such our global auto care team is making good progress to complete the major simplification of its us production distribution and rd footprint by consolidating in dayton ohio production has started already on the first line and we expect to complete this project within this fiscal year in addition we have announced a few days ago a new initiative which is the consolidation of hardware and home improvements two distribution centers in the us which are on each coast into one single centrally located facility by the end of calendar year  this will improve working capital and customer service by providing additional capacity for growth at the same time were stepping up rd and marketing investments and adding sales specialists to pursue white space opportunities in more categories channels and countries as part of our innovation process we are also enhancing packaging and product differentiation to allow us and our retail partners to cover multiple price points respond better to different consumer needs and avoid channel conflict in parallel were launching several brand refreshes and  degree marketing programs to raise the awareness and appreciation of our brand we expect accordingly for fiscal  above category organic top line increases and solid bottom line growth as well as free cash flow improvement the second half of our fiscal year will again be larger than the first half due to the seasonality of our home and garden and global auto care business we will be comping a strong second fiscal quarter as retailers had ordered last year exceptionally early related to fica ph concerns and a favorable early spring weather but were on good track and even if q is our smallest ebitda quarter of the year the solid resize provides an excellent start to achieving our eighth consecutive year of record financial performance in fiscal  let me turn it over now to doug for the financial review and details on our performance by product category doug martin thanks andreas and good morning everyone now turning to slide  lets review q results beginning with net sales firstquarter reported net sales of  billion decreased  versus last year excluding the negative impact of  million of foreign currency organic sales grew  against strong organic growth of  last year and while also including the negative impact of unprofitable business exits of approximately  million and two fewer shipping days of approximately  million to  million for clarity we will get one of these days back in q and the full year has one fewer day than fiscal  reported gross margin of  increased  basis points from  last year primarily due to strong productivity and improved mix partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange reported sga expense of  million or  of sales compared to  million last year or  reported operating margin of  increased  basis points compared to  last year largely driven by expanding gross margin and lower acquisition and integration spending on a reported basis q diluted earnings per share of  decreased compared to  last year primarily due to an increase in our reported effective tax rate adjusted eps of  increased  from  last year primarily as a result of volume favorable mix operating efficiencies and lower interest costs partially offset by the negative impact of foreign exchange the q reported tax rate of  increased from  last year primarily due to the absence of a valuation allowance benefit in the prior year turning to slide  as i have noted over the last several quarters and also mentioned by andreas the company continues to be focused on improving working capital not only absolute improvement year over year but also systemic improvement throughout the year to reduce some of our working capital seasonality and these initiatives are bearing fruit in the first quarter we delivered positive adjusted free cash flow of  million a  million improvement over a year ago mostly driven by working capital remember this is both better working capital management and efforts to reduce intrayear volatility so while you should expect full year improvement some of the gains in q would normally have occurred in q and q first quarter reported interest expense of  million decreased  million from  million last year driven by the benefit of our  euro denominated notes issued last september and repricing of our us term loans in october cash interest payments of  million were  million lower than last year largely related to major term debt reduction the note free financing and term loan repricing cash taxes of  million were unchanged from last year depreciation amortization and share based compensation were  million compared to  million last year and cash payments for acquisition and integration and restructuring and related charges were  million and  million respectively this year versus  million and  million last year now on to our operating unit results beginning on slide  with global auto care q reported net sales of  million decreased  solid us growth in refrigerants primarily ac pro was more than offset by lower appearance and performance chemicals revenues primarily due to the timing of shipments ahead of gacs north american sap go live last year and us retailer inventory adjustments we also saw lower european region distributor revenues due to order shipment timing versus last year reported adjusted ebitda of  million grew  with margin improving  basis points to  this year gac is supporting the core armor all stp and ac pro brands with new innovation educational initiatives and increased category awareness extending armor all and stp into adjacencies is a focus and one exciting example is the launch of our time saving armor all ultra shine wash and wax wipes which provide one step wash and waxing with no waiting or buffing and no need for a bucket or hose international growth most notably in europe is also a priority along with crossselling and white space wins turning to slide  hardware and home improvement is continuing its momentum from a record  with a record q results driven by growth in its core us residential security business q reported net sales of  million increased  including the impact of planned exits from unprofitable businesses in mexico of about  adjusted ebitda of  million improved  with reported margin of  up  basis points from last year organic adjusted ebitda of  million grew  excluding favorable fx of  million a key driver of hhi momentum in its core us categories is coming from a robust new product roadmap with strong innovation every quarter across all product categories at the consumer electronics show in early january hhi unveiled several new smart locks to strengthen its industry leadership in the fast growing residential electronic security category this included obsidian a key free smart lock with a lowprofile design targeted at homeowners seeking modern decor looks this latest smart lock from kwikset will be available as a standalone deadbolt or as a home automation connected device hhi seeks to sustain and further scale its strong do it yourself homebuilder channels distributors and showroom businesses pursue more growth in home automation and further establish its patented smart key technology as the industry standard in continuous improvement hhi has initiatives in progress to reduce costs simplify supply chain and reduce skus and inventory levels this global transformation program begun last year will also add capacity and insourcing harmonize lockset components and increase automation by the end of fiscal  to strengthen hhis position as the low cost industry producer now to global pet which is slide  q reported net sales of  million fell  while organic revenues decreased  excluding negative fx of  million consistent with comments on our yearend call in november pet expects to continue profit and margin expansion in fiscal  ahead of revenue growth which is expected to reoccur in the second half of the year to that end q reported adjusted ebitda of  million increased a strong  and  excluding negative fx of  million due to favorable product mix and favorable customer mix q reported adjusted ebitda margin grew  basis points to  higher aquatics revenues primarily from doubledigit growth in europe were more than offset by lower north american companion animal and european pet food revenues as expected north american companion animal sales were negatively impacted by the planned exits of lowmargin private label rawhide and chicken jerky business last year and lower european pet food sales in part from a planned exit of a customer tolling agreement together these exits adversely impacted pets top line by about  in q as evidenced by the q margin expansion the operational and process improvements made over the past  to  months are taking hold pet continues to transition to higher margin branded companion animal products with increased marketing support and stepped up efforts for geographic expansion in latin america canada and asia pacific in north america the expansion of natures miracle to broader distribution points is underway dingo has been relaunched and repositioned and innovative campaigns are also underway for furminator and prosense moving to slide  home and garden in its smallest quarter of the year home and garden reported record revenues providing an encouraging start to  reported net sales increased  to  million driven by double digit growth in the household controls category the  decline in adjusted ebitda to  million and  basis point decrease in reported margin to  was due to the absence of favorable manufacturing variances this year as a result of the improved manufacturing scheduling and the new aerosol line startup which will both benefit later quarters as well as investments in marketing expense to support innovation and new distribution to add a little clarity to the impact of manufacturing to this quarters results recall that in the last couple of years we began our seasonal prebuild for aerosols before the end of our fiscal year and into q this has generated favorable manufacturing variances in the last couple of years that did not repeat this year as the new aerosol line was installed and ramp up of production began this project nearly doubles filling capacity and will reduce inventory levels and production costs in  the st louis plant also completed its first production run of global auto care aerosol products specifically armor all tire foam in december and is increasing global auto care aerosol filling in this quarter resulting in additional cost savings versus prior year and the avoidance of using third party copackers to deliver continued strong results this year home and garden plans for increased distribution and market share gains more innovation and continued operational excellence for example the black flag brand is expanding beyond household controls into the outdoor control space with new insect products a comprehensive plan supporting black flag outdoors is generating retailer excitement and driving consumer engagement to support our hot shot bedbug pest management solutions home and garden is employing a first of its kind integrated multiproduct solution for consumers and cutters exclusive repellent sponsorship of us soccer is helping to drive important offshelf placement and improved brand awareness now to personal care which is slide  reported net sales of  million fell  while organic revenues decreased  excluding negative fx of  million despite the sales shortfall q reported adjusted ebitda was unchanged with margin improvement of  basis points organic adjusted ebitda increased  constant currency growth in europe and asia pacific was more than offset by lower north american revenues the north america decline was largely attributable to fewer promotions and distribution adjustments at key retailers remington innovation will remain strong this year to drive organic growth especially in shave and groom and in hair care supported by a blend of traditional print and online media in europe for example remington launched a new straight brush in unique proluxe range in womens hair care the focus is on expanding distribution in the new white space areas as well as continuing strong double digit ecommerce growth now lets turn to small appliances on slide  while reported net sales of  million decreased  organic revenues grew  after excluding negative fx of  million the improvement was attributable to strong growth in north america from distribution gains incremental listings effective promotions and strong ecommerce growth along with modest growth on a currency neutral basis in europe as an example our wifi enabled slow cooker was a very successful holiday product launch reported adjusted ebitda grew slightly with a margin improvement of  basis points organic adjusted ebitda grew more than  small appliances is working to further broaden its product portfolio and distribution points around the world armed with strong innovation in fiscal  especially in cooking and beverage we expect to drive top line growth through distribution wins white space opportunities and ecommerce which continues to see the most significant channel growth for small appliances in q george foreman grills are launching into continental europe following the success of the brand in the uk cookware and bakeware innovation is also being introduced into europe under the russell hobbs brand name finally to global batteries which is slide  global batteries delivered an excellent first quarter reported net sales of  million increased  and excluding  million of negative fx  organically reported adjusted ebitda grew  with margin expansion of  basis points while organic adjusted ebitda increased more than  solid growth on a currency neutral basis in europe from new customers organic increases and effective promotions as well as in latin america and asia pacific drove the improvement alkaline battery growth in north america was strong we expect a solid performance in north america with increased and targeted marketing initiatives and on a constant currency basis in international markets as we move through fiscal  primarily in the alkaline and hearing aid categories global batteries continues to pursue growth in underindexed channels and new geographies such as hearing aid batteries in china and through market share and distribution gains our expanded rayovac go to market strategy has been introduced broadly now in north america as we pursue key white space opportunities in the region moving to the balance sheet on slide  we ended q in a very strong liquidity position with more than  million available on our  million cash flow revolver a cash balance of about  million and debt outstanding of  billion we expect to continue to reduce leverage in fiscal  similar to last year we ended fiscal  with total leverage of about  times as mentioned earlier adjusted free cash flow for the quarter of  million compared to a use of  million in the prior year reflecting significant progress across inventory accounts receivable and accounts payable to sustainably improve working capital management and to begin to reduce some of the seasonal volatility in our working capital cycle capital expenditures were  million compared to  million in the prior year during the quarter we repurchased over  shares of common stock for  million or about  per share finally the board this week also approved a new three year  million share repurchase program turning to slide  and a review of our  guidance we expect reported net sales to grow above category rates partially offset by the anticipated negative fx impacts of approximately  to  basis points we expect to deliver free cash flow of between  million and  million we expect full year interest expense to be between  million and  million including approximately  million of noncash items cash interest payments are expected to be between  million and  million depreciation and amortization is expected to be between  million and  million for  including approximately  million for amortization of stock based compensation our  effective tax rate is expected to be between  to  and recall that for adjusted earnings we use a  tax rate cash taxes are expected to be approximately  million to  million and we do not anticipate being a regular us federal taxpayer for the next few years as we continue to use net operating loss carryovers cash payments for acquisition and integration and restructuring and related charges are expected to be between  million and  million and finally capital expenditures are expected to be between  million and  million including the rollover spending from  thank you and now back to dave for qa david prichard thanks very much andreas and doug with that operator you may now begin the qa session please questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from the line of bill schmitz with deutsche bank your line is now open bill schmitz a couple of things can you just talk about the trajectory in the us it looks like it was down a little bit this year and i know there was inventory destocking so from what you can tell is the bulk of the destocking done and could there even be maybe a snapback in some of that inventory level that at our retailers andreas rouve yes bill let me get that question i think doug mentioned we had in some divisions some one time effects likely for instance in global auto care where we had backlash ph for the sap golive on january  and as a consequence a couple of retailers had pulled orders forward into the december so those were the effects which were hitting the us in addition we have in the pet division walked away from unprofitable private label business and also this is in the us but in addition to that it is exactly what you mentioned at really all major retailers and it is the biggest retailer in the world the two biggest home improvement centers the auto channel all retailers are focusing on inventory reduction and they are heading towards their end of fiscal year and therefore they have accelerated their efforts now in the first quarter so that is basically the key driver for the pretty flattish sales in north america bill schmitz okay and do you think there is going to be a snapback are we going to get back to normal ordering patterns or could there even be a catch up i mean are out of stocks becoming a problem any of that stuff andreas rouve no actually not and also all of those retailers have implemented better forecasting systems better inventory management systems and we really see that service levels in stock at the retailers are at a very good level some of the inventory reduction in all fairness was a kind of correction of indiscernible inventory especially in global auto care and home and garden which are now in their low season so in those two categories we should see some snapback as we head into the next years peak season but in the other categories these appliances be it in pet or in home and garden that is truly going to be a kind of sustainable long term that simply retailers are more efficient bill schmitz okay great thats helpful and i have to ask the question because investors are asking about it but i know probably none of us really have a good answer yet but how adaptable is the supply chain as it relates to border taxes because i mean my view is that i dont think you could find somebody to make a toaster oven in the us unless i am wrong so how do you think the whole thing plays out if there is some variation of a border tax andreas rouve first of all i think it is a little bit premature to speculate about kind of possible changes because there are so many unknowns and so many variations which are possible so therefore i think it is really not extremely helpful to speculate right now the good news is and i would like to make that analogy to also currencies most of our competitors are pretty much in the same situation as we are so therefore should we see significant charges to import cost we believe its going to be pretty much consistent in the industry and therefore probably will lead to chain reactions that means higher prices in the market but then again lets wait and see what really is going to happen bill schmitz okay great and let me just sneak in one last quick one were you tempted at all to raise your free cash flow guidance because i dont know what your internal forecast was but we certainly werent modeling positive free cash flow this quarter so i guess the question is is it really just sort of just smoothing out cash flow more throughout the year because of some the initiatives you are doing on the working capital front or do you just want to sort of have a fairly conservative stance because its so early in the year doug martin yes bill this is doug i wasnt tempted to raise it at this point of the year and these initiatives we have had line of sight to these for a while now weve been working on them for the better part of a year and each one is being addressed differently so weve had really great improvement in inventory across the entire businesses and across the globe about  million yearoveryear weve implemented new and now are pretty much fully up and running on new terms with most of our supply chain and that was about  million yearoveryear but we have been getting some of those benefits as we have gone along and then on the ar side we have also made some improvements so these are improvements that are really great for the company because we are now getting this cash earlier in the year we can reduce debt earlier in the year but at the endpoint of our year the natural seasonality of our working capital cycle still falls out in the september timeframe so you should expect improvement from us and we have some in that cash flow guidance yearoveryear improvement but right now were pulling this benefit forward operator our next question comes from the line of joe altobello with raymond james your line is now open joe altobello just a couple questions i guess first on global batteries and small appliances global batteries up on a very tough compare small appliances up for the first time i guess in about a year now so it sounds like most of that was coming from distribution gains and things that you guys are doing internally but was curious if youre seeing any improvement in overall category trends in either of those two categories andreas rouve if we look at the two different categories i think in batteries it is really what you mentioned its more about focus we start seeing the benefits of our more more more strategy where we are going after more price points more channels more countries and that growth is really starting to pay off but even within batteries it is fair to look at different trends in the sub categories like for instance doug mentioned earlier we are growing very nicely in our two core categories which is alkaline and hearing aids whereas in the lower margin heavy duty batteries there we continue to see declines as consumers shift towards higher price point higher quality alkaline batteries so there are also certain shifts within the category which are supporting our growth strategy  now in small appliances we really had last year a tough year and the category in the quarter was overall flat however this year doug mentioned it also earlier we have launched some really innovative products like this wifi slow cooker which has been a very big success so therefore again our longterm strategy to focus on real innovative products which will help us gain a shelf space but also attract consumers and also partly justify higher price points is starting to pay off joe altobello okay thats helpful and just one question on global auto care i was wondering if you guys could quantify how much was pulled forward in the year ago first quarter im just trying to figure out how to think about that for the second quarter of this year doug martin sure joe it was about  million joe altobello about  million okay great thank you guys doug martin you bet andreas rouve i think the other  sorry let me just jump in i think the other point is also in europe we had a weak quarter in global auto care and doug mentioned it was linked to distributor sales and part of that was driven by our sales because we are getting tougher on credit management and therefore simply holding orders off distributors if they have over dues so part of that is also going to come back as those distributors get in line with our payment practice operator and the next question comes from the line of bob labick with cjs securities your line is open bob labick i was hoping you could discuss and elaborate on your ecommerce strategy specifically what brands and areas are a focus and can most benefit how big the opportunity is and how you can also help enhance your retail partners ecommerce sites as you focus on your strategy as well andreas rouve i think if we look at ecommerce we have to accept it is an integral distribution channel more or less for every retailer it is not only the amazons of the world all the big home improvement centers all the big retailers are equally focusing on that channel now the relevance of this channel is very different category by category and the highest e commerce penetration is in the higher priced appliance business that means in personal care with remington brand in small appliances with russell hobbs black  decker george foreman simply because the price point features are more important and that allows the consumer to better research so were fully going after this channel in all of our divisions because even in batteries even in home and garden with insect repellents and so on the channel is getting more important and we are growing very nicely we had a significant growth in the quarter in ecommerce now the point obviously is that ecommerce is kind of a challenging because you have to avoid channel conflict you have to avoid that you have a strong price competition between the different channels and this is why we are pushing forward very significant product and packaging differentiation to avoid that we are seeing a price erosion because those channels compete with each other bob labick okay terrific thank you for that and then just one other quick one and this may be difficult to answer directly but i know we are certainly getting tons of questions as well in terms of your majority shareholder hrg any thoughts on the potential timing of any outcomes and the best outcomes for the minority owners of spectrum brands andreas rouve this is really a tough question because again it is mainly driven by hrg so therefore that question really probably would be better suited for a call with the hrg management which i think is in a few days but again we believe there are plenty of opportunities and we again believe it is going to be long term favorable for spectrum brands operator and our next question comes from the line of steph wissink with piper jaffray your line is now open lauren wolff this is actually lauren wolff on for steph just looking at gross margin gross margin growth was pretty significant this quarter would you be able to discuss the drivers for expansion in a bit further detail and do you believe that this current pace is sustainable on a yearoveryear basis and then i guess secondarily to that has the pricing strategy shifted at all and my follow up question is just specific to the global auto care segment do you feel that that business in particular is maybe more seasonal than you had initially anticipated and does that impact your q results more than expected thanks doug martin sure lauren this is doug thank you on gross margin its really a pretty good story across the businesses and across the regions for us and part of it is productivity and as you know we have got a pretty healthy engrained culture of continuously driving improvement across not only cost of goods sold but really throughout the entire pl and that is showing up in our results and specifically in gross margin we also have taken some actions to exit low margin or negative margin categories and that benefit is flowing through and we have had good customer mix we dont have a lot of pricing we do get pricing in latin america weve had a little bit of pricing in europe but by and large these are mix and productivity gains across the businesses and a couple big ones weve mentioned as you know global auto care is benefiting from a lot of the consolidation work that we began over a year ago so overall i think you should expect continued gross margin expansion from us we have talked about a  to  basis point range over time and some of it will be choppy this is obviously a really nice quarter for us because some of those productivity initiatives are hitting in terms of the global auto care no were not surprised by the seasonality of the business this is consistent with the way we planned the businesses this year and the two things that we have already talked about one of them was putting global auto care on sap last year and asking retailers if they wanted to take some safety stock in ahead of time and many of our big ones did and fortunately that golive went without a hitch so we will expect that to normalize this year and then as andreas mentioned for some distributors in part of our european region we have tightened up on our credit policies a little bit and i expect those sales in fact most of those sales have already gone out in the month of january operator our next question comes from the line of jason gere with keybanc capital markets your line is now open jason gere i guess the first question is really thinking about category growth so youre talking about this year growing faster than category growth and obviously from november to now maybe there was a little bit of inventory destocking thats out there so i guess im just trying to get comfortable with your talk around the pace of innovation distribution gains but also growing faster than category the way that we are looking at organic sales this year  to  is that still the right way that we should be thinking about fiscal  andreas rouve yes we would be extremely disappointed if we would not hit those numbers and again i think were going to see some nice pick up doug mentioned it earlier for instance in pet we have been suffering in pet from our decisions now that we are exiting private label in some of the lower margin categories but thats going to anniversary now in the second quarter and we have already won a lot of new listings at major retailers where we are going to see those shipments going out in the year third quarter so we should see a nice continued trend in top line and we believe that we will be able to grow significantly faster than the category jason gere okay great and then the last question i guess is just on youre talking about some of the increased spending on initiatives can you talk about what you have seen so far in terms of the payback and then how thats effected your decision to maybe accelerate some of the additional projects that obviously dont make the first cut but have to get pushed off a little bit in terms of timing andreas rouve i think were seeing a very nice and if we talk about favorable mix it means that we are successful with launching innovations and that this is substituting exited or lower margin old business so were seeing the nice payback already from launching more innovation and we will actually step up the speed of bringing new products to the market now the second element where we are also stepping up our investment is into marketing like for instance we have spent the first time since quite a couple of years in the rayovac brand in the first quarter so we are stepping up our marketing spend to drive brand awareness and appreciation and i think that is going to pay back significantly because again retailers are interested to have strong brands which resonate with the consumers and that is going to pay back doug mentioned in his example we are doing for instance in pet quite significant relaunches where we are stepping up our activities be it in natures miracle be it in dingo in furminator and that really applies across the board in all different categories operator our next question comes from the line of olivia tong with bank of america merrill lynch your line is now open olivia tong on global auto care you have got obviously some pretty amazing margin progression there and youve talked about some of the incremental changes youre making so how high do you think that margins can go in that particular division doug martin hi olivia this is doug margins in that business are so good right now and attractive for us that we should not have a desire to take that much higher we would rather take that excess earnings and reinvest it in growth were investing in growth in europe in a meaningful way were exploring our opportunities in latin america in a meaningful way as well and we have a good solid business in the apac region so that low s overall ebitda margin that we have there we want to use that to accelerate growth across that business olivia tong got it and then just on margins overall obviously the gross margin expansion continues to be very strong but sga also continued to grow quite a bit on top of a big increase last year so can you parse out some of the bigger drivers of the increase in sga this quarter and what you think in terms of progression for the year andreas rouve if you look at sga i think overall we were actually reported flat however that is a separate trend while we are reducing our integration and restructuring expenses we are able to step up rd marketing and selling expenses and yes we believe we can or we should continue to step those up because we believe these are investments in gaining more market share by expanding into more channels more categories and more countries now we believe the expenses at margin of sales actually should continue to improve we were just impacted this quarter by the two fewer days also by those exits but that should again reverse going forward and therefore we see the expense ratio improving long term despite higher investment into those expenses olivia tong all right thanks and then its obviously still early in terms of legislation proposed by the new administration but how if at all does that affect your thinking on ma not necessarily more or less but categories that you might be interested mix of nondurables versus faster moving consumer goods and things like that doug martin olivia i think on the ma front its right now less about the legislative environment and more about the availability of assets at an affordable price that fit our portfolio and if the right assets come along at the right prices i think we would continue to be very interested because we are investors over a very long period of time so short term legislative impacts wont have a big influence on our decisions operator our next question comes from the line of joe lackey with wells fargo securities your line is now open joe lackey first in batteries can you kind of walk through some of the white space opportunities particularly in new channels grocery and drug and i guess we saw some good progress this quarter im just trying to gauge kind of what inning we are in as far as the progress you are making there thanks andreas rouve if we talk about white space we really have to look at it not only in the us by retail channel and it is one of our biggest opportunities and you actually mentioned the two biggest channels which are white space for rayovac already right now we serve only about  of the channels which are selling batteries in the us so therefore you see that its a major white space opportunity but in all fairness youre investing into the additional sales resources gaining the trust of the retailers gaining the tests gaining those listings will take time so this is not something which is going to happen overnight but we are making good progress and seeing really nice replies already in the us with alkaline and partly also with hearing aids now the second element which is equally important is that we have to look also globally that there is still a lot of white space doug mentioned with hearing aids where we are global market leader with hearing aid batteries but there are many regions in the world like for instance asia which we have simply neglected in the past and what we are doing right now is that we are adding also resources in those regions to go after those channels joe lackey thanks and then doug on free cash flow so i guess lots of good progress on your working capital efforts but just wanted to get some specifics on how you are specifically reducing seasonality is this just a factor of producing closer to when you ship to retailers kind of what is going into that smoothing of the seasonality and then also trying to gauge when the timing and the positive benefits from the aerosols line start up will begin to benefit margins and free cash flow thanks doug martin sure you bet on the first one its really a leveling of the peak so ordinarily this is our peak investment in working capital and we did we did invest in working capital in this quarter still close to a couple of hundred million dollars but the top of the hill in terms of where we invest in working capital is being lowered a little bit and part of it is our ability to produce closer to distribution as we invest as you know in this aerosol capacity it requires much less of a seasonal prebuild in that particular business consolidating our global auto care business into one location is going to continue to help us with better managing inventories going forward and weve already seen a nice impact in that business weve taken aggressive negotiating positions with our supply chain to get better terms and latertransfer of ownership of the goods to us by improvement on terms that way and then on the other side on our payment terms so it is really just trying to lower the peak of our working capital build during the year and im sorry i lost track of  the aerosol yes the aerosol benefits they will begin  they are fully in production now in january and our peak seasonal season as you know is late in q but really in q in that business and you will see that bleed through then operator our next question comes from the line of kevin grundy with jefferies your line is now open kevin grundy i wanted to come back to capital deployment and your decision to buy back stock in the quarter because its something you guys have not done a lot of historically and i guess couple that with the increase to the authorization which is now up to  million so maybe you could touch a little bit on that understanding that you said it seems like valuations may be a bit stretched so a couple of things talk about the decision to deploy cash to buy back stock in the quarter again which is a bit out of step with what you guys have generally done the expanded program of  million what is your appetite to go after that aggressively how quickly could you possibly work through that authorization and then maybe touch on a little bit with the pipeline and lastly just the dynamic with hrg and that came up earlier in the call as your largest shareholder does that encumber you at all in any way with respect to ma whether that is smaller or probably more appropriately larger ma doug martin okay kevin let me take those starting with the buyback we have been saying for the last several years that we intend to use the share repurchase program to offset equity compensation and we expect that to be about  million this year it was about the same last year and so we have done a little more than that in this first quarter so we have already offset our equity compensation dilution we also feel that the stock is very attractively priced where weve been buying back so we think its a very good capital allocation choice for us we did about the same thing last year we front loaded our share repurchase program to offset equity compensation dilution for  in the first quarter as well because we felt similarly that the share price was undervalued so i think this is fairly consistent we are about halfway through the original  million program so we just felt it was a prudent time to refresh that program and upsize it a little bit again if we think our stock is undervalued and it is a good capital allocation choice and were not going out and borrowing money to do it it is a good place to potentially put our money to work the ma pipeline we have a great funnel we know what we would like to buy over time we cant predict when assets will come to market the chairman of our board david maura is very involved in this and again if we find the right opportunities at the right price we will move forward and we dont believe that anything that is happening with hrg would impact our ability to continue to do ma kevin grundy okay all right that is helpful color and then i wanted to come back to some of the channel dynamics in the us it seems to be sort of a recurring issue specifically in home appliances and batteries where we will get the us nielsen data it doesnt look great specifically in batteries and home appliances and then you guys will generally report a number which is better even just for the us so can you talk a little bit about some of the dynamics that are going on in batteries and home appliances why your trends seemingly are quite a bit worse than walmart target to a lesser degree grocery channel than what you are seeing in nontracked and online andreas rouve yes kevin i mentioned earlier during my prepared remarks there are some companies which are focusing their management incentive on market share so there is a certain tendency of certain of our competitors to focus on those big retailers and in all fairness that is where typically the competition is toughest and the prices are lowest and where we partly decide to walk away from business if its too low margin and then on the opposite our more more more strategy is exactly aiming at gaining more footprint which is partly not covered by nielsen because it may not be the largest retailers and that strategy has worked very well in europe over the last eight years and its starting to pay off now also here in north america so we will continue to pursue that strategy kevin grundy and if i may follow up andreas on that just real quick just to make sure im clear some of the market share thats being picked up in those channels by some of your competitors is it your estimation that that is not profitable business or just lower margin business andreas rouve it is at very aggressive pricing lets put it that way operator and our next question comes from the line of ian zaffino with oppenheimer your line is now open ian zaffino following up on the buyback how quickly are we going to be looking at doing this i guess stock is off does that mean you are going to be doing it very quickly or should we expect it really to take three years doug martin i think you should look at it as first and foremost offsetting the equity compensation dilution so maybe half of it we will do that over the next three years and then we can predict if the stock we think is undervalued and we dont have other good capital allocation choices you could see us continue to do something like we did in the first quarter but at the moment we are pretty quiet ian zaffino okay and then as you look at kind of businesses that you have exited the unprofitable ones is there anything else that youre looking at maybe looking to exit or any other type of portfolio rejiggering that you would have on the horizon andreas rouve not really i would say the vast majority of the initiatives we have started i mentioned earlier for instance in pets the exiting of the private label that is going to anniversary pretty soon the exit of our hhi business the funnel ph business in mexico that was just started in the first quarter so that should continue until the fourth quarter but overall pretty much all initiatives have been started and we continue to measure our profitability by category by channel and also look at our long term competitive advantages and focus on that but right now we feel very confident that we have done our homework operator our next question comes from the line of karru martinson with jefferies your line is now open karru martinson you guys talked about light commercial expansion for hhi i was wondering how those initiatives were going whats been the sellin on that side of the equation andreas rouve actually it has been going very well after the acquisition of indiscernible we had a slight setback linked a little bit to the decline in oil prices and related things but now were seeing a very nice momentum because again our more more more strategy is starting to bade back where we are taking their product portfolio taking them into more countries like for instance into canada into latin america but also taking them into the channels where we are strong so this is paying off quite nicely and were seeing a very nice momentum in this category karru martinson okay and just lastly when you guys look at building brand awareness rayovac in particular had always been one kind of more instore advertising so when you put that emphasis on building the brand should we be expecting super bowl ads from you guys or is this more of your ncaps ph and so forth andreas rouve no it is really  and thats a strong belief that in batteries batteries are impulse purchases so therefore for certain categories to focus on pos on instore activities is  right and therefore is long term the right move but then we offer also in our portfolio a very different product like even our new electronic locks some of the latest pfister products which we are launching which have features which are much easier to call out if you put some advertising funds behind it so those marketing investments will really be very different category by category and then of course again it will be linked to where we can reach the consumer the most effectively and in all fairness i think the age of those big tv advertising is coming to an end as there is a strong shift of advertising dollars into more the digital channel where you can target much better like for instance we had a very nice success last year where in the internet you can really do a campaign depending on the weather forecast of the next couple of days where you can target the right region with the right product offering be it in home and garden be it in auto care with ac pro so therefore the internet really offers us plenty of opportunities to reach our target consumer better david prichard okay operator i think  kevin can you have one quick question weve really reached the top of the hour but i think kevin is still queued up right operator we have a question from the line of kevin ziets with citi your line is now open kevin ziets dave thanks for squeezing me in ill just ask on a follow up on the border tax issue im curious how you think your products and maybe your brands in particular respond in an inflationary environment and then as a follow up to that your outlook for commodities in general and how that figures into your margin expectations and your working capital expectations andreas rouve let me start with your second part on commodities we do see an uptick in our key commodities and that is going to affect  but then again it is going to affect the entire market that means all competitors sooner or later it probably will lead to certain inflationary pressures in the category we have similar to currencies we have a very systematic hedging program where we have rolling hedges which is going to soften the impact in the near term and again which allows us to respond appropriately in the markets now coming back to your point on border tax yes if there will be a cost increase again it is going to impact all competitors but also what we are seeing partly especially in some of the other markets are mainly these low margin opp where the players are really working on ultra thin margins in some of those cases the deals wont work any longer so as long as you have high featured products where you can explain to the consumer why they are paying a certain price for it we believe we will be able to price up in that environment so therefore we are not overly concerned in all fairness david prichard okay well thank you very much andreas and doug and with that we have gone past the top of the hour so we will conclude our conference call
