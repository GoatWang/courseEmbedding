founders of the new and exciting discipline of behavioural finance which has done so much in the last few years to explain why most human beings make poor investors in this autobiographical book he tells the story of how a selfconfessed lazy academic came to work in this increasingly influential field and what he and other researchers have learned along the way a brilliant and highly readable way into the subject for anyone who wants to learn more portfolio watch  strategy and tactics for my own money i run a core portfolio of around  long term favourite funds and investment trusts i then monitor a short list of other securities to use as tactical or occasionally speculative overlays adding or reducing exposure as circumstances require new additions don’t come round very often keeping portfolio turnover to a minimum – or “waiting for the fat pitch” as warren buffett puts it – is well documented to be one of the keys to superior investment returns you can monitor the results in the investment reader where i regularly review and update the core portfolio and relevant benchmarks  interviewstracking your peers as well as original research i have always found it pays to stay in
