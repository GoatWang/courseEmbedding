rating lowhigh most helpful most recent sadly no verified purchase style is excellent and trendy quality for price was fantastic dress fits very oddly on my size  body the top ends directly after the bust and the rest is form fitting it fit the same way on my friend so it wasnt just me i dont know maybe its the over  body type definately going back read more super cute verified purchase this dress was super cute i ordered it ina misses sz  and it fit perfectly except for two things the first night i wore i popped two buttons at the bottom and it wrinkles a lot like linen but i got lots of compliments read more liked the dress overall verified purchase this is a nice feminine dress the reason i did not give it  starts is because the last  buttons pop off very easily if youre not careful i drives a honda pilot suv which sits high off the ground and i have to be careful about how i get into the car or the buttons will pop off luckily this happened after i left church on sunday i liked this dress so much so i had a seamstress to sew down the front to the last button and i sewed the buttons back on since it adds to the style of the dress read more previous of next back to top
