hopes for independence by timothy l obriendec   continue reading the main story share this page continue reading the main story it wasnt supposed to end this waywhen frank n newman took over the bankers trust corporation three years ago he vowed to rein in the new york banks vaunted trading operation  widely viewed as populated by freewheeling hot shots more interested in making big bets on the direction of financial markets than with the wellbeing of their clients  and he regularly proclaimed his determination to maintain bankers trusts independencenow undone by huge trading losses and nasty internal strife at the eighthlargest bank in the country mr newman  has been forced into an act he firmly opposed as recently as five months ago the sale of bankers trust yesterday in a move that has been widely anticipated for more than a week deutsche bank the german banking giant formally announced plans for a  billion acquisition of bankers trustfrank will go down in history as the person who sold bankers trust said raphael soifer an analyst with brown brothers harriman frank is partially the victim of circumstance but as the bank evolved under him with an emphasis on emerging markets trading in eastern europe and asia junk bonds and initial public offerings he left bankers trust particularly vulnerable to the global financial turmoil of the last yearmr newman who declined repeated requests for an interview is certainly not the only victim of the upheaval that has ripped through international banks in an unusually tumultuous year some chief executives like mathis cabiallavetta of ubs in switzerland and martin taylor the chief executive of barclays britains biggest bank lost their jobs after huge trading losses materialized in other cases as in the ousters of james b dimon citigroups president and david coulter the president of bankamerica trading losses provided a convenient excuse for departures that were the result of more deepseated corporate frictions advertisement continue reading the main story as were many of his counterparts in the banking world mr newman was blindsided this summer by trading losses that snowballed after russia devalued its currency and declared a debt moratorium in midaugust unlike them he has not lost his job continue reading the main story advertisement continue reading the main story but while mr newman will join the board of deutsche bank and have a senior position in the investment banking unit created by deutsches purchase of bankers trust he is not expected to wield significant managerial control in the new entityif the third quarter hadnt happened i would have characterized newmans legacy as having led a significant turnaround in the companys fortunes said diane glossman an analyst with lehman brothers holdings he did a remarkable amount of work in a short period of time but then his time ran outthe clock started ticking for mr newman in julyat the time mr newmans position was relatively strong desiring to keep the bank intact he had recently spurned overtures from the bank of new york mellon bank and the state street corporation to sell bankers trusts valuable business as a securities custodianand in a june interview around the same time deutsche bank first privately floated the idea of a merger mr newman firmly asserted that bankers trust would remain independentwe are proponents of the idea that bigger is not necessarily better he said at the time were trying to find markets where we can add valuenonetheless mr newman accepted an invitation in july from a senior deutsche bank investment banker and board member ronaldo schmitz to dine at the st regis hotel in manhattan they revisted the possibility of a merger according to executives later involved in the transaction though people close to mr newman said he was noncomittal at that meetingmr newman had every reason to believe then that he did not have to rush into a marriage with deutsche bank a plodding financial behemoth that had been badly bruised by previous illconsidered forays into investment banking  an arena where bankers trust was making inroads mr newman still enjoyed strong support from his board and he had managed to steer bankers trust away from an overreliance on trading advertisement continue reading the main story big banks long ago branched away from the traditional business of making loans to corporations and began trading stocks bonds currencies and more exotic financial products known as derivatives bankers trust founded in  to handle the trust business of other large banks had transformed itself in the late s and s into one of the most aggressive and innovative trading shops on wall streetbut a series of derivatives scandals a few years ago wreaked financial havoc on the bank and led to the departure of charles sanford as its chairman and the ascent of mr newman to that positionmr newmans credentials  he had been the chief financial officer of wells fargo and bankamerica before serving as a top official in the treasury department from  to   were seen as the balm needed to restore credibility to bankers trusts damaged reputationyet mr newman who had no experience as a trader or an investment banker never entirely fit in at bankers trust he is respected for his analytical abilities and methodical planning but he was widely criticized within bankers trust for being aloof and awkward in social settings mr newman also relied on a small group of advisers from the west coast especially the chief financial officer richard h daniel a move that alienated some senior executives and as befalls any executive seeking to reshape a company mr newman also made enemies among traders who resented the cutbacks he made in their business newsletter sign

all new york times newsletters see sample manage email preferences not you privacy policy opt out or contact us anytime even with these tensions mr newman succeeded in making important changes at bankers trust despite the financial mess he inherited he came into a company that was very beaten down and so focused on derivatives products that it had lost its competitive edge observed judah kraushaar a merrill lynch analystin   percent of bankers trusts profits came from trading last year only  percent did and as he guided bankers trust more deeply into overseas markets and allowed the firms junk bond business to expand mr newman also bolstered the companys presence in investment banking last year by buying alex brown  sons a small but wellregarded regional brokerage firm with an important role in underwriting technology companiesdespite an uneven performance earlier this year mr newman was still well positioned to keep deutsche bank at a distance until the torrent of ill will unleashed by the alex brown acquisition and substantial trading losses in july and august combined to weaken his standing at that point insiders say he began to lose the ability to determine his own fatemany alex brown employees grumbled that the sale of their firm left them in a financial nether world they were no longer an independent regional brokerage firm yet they were trapped inside a bank that still lacked the heft to compete with the most powerful wall street investment firms several senior executives left alex brown and many of those who stayed were unhappy bankers said particularly mayo shattuck a longtime alex brown employee who became cohead of bankers trusts investment banking unitmr shattuck who is scheduled to play a senior role in deutsche banks new investment banking operation created by the bankers trust acquisition is said by colleagues to have been among the most vocal critics of mr newman mr shattuck did not return calls seeking comment advertisement continue reading the main story meanwhile in newspapers and magazines reports began to appear this summer of mr newmans fondness for glittering parties and expensive corporate perks mr newmans supporters attributed them to disgruntled employees trying to smear his reputation nonetheless it was clear that several members of the banks board were not pleased with the publicity surrounding mr newmans spending and fondness for a phalanx of private security guards one person close to the board and a supporter of mr newman said some board members were poisoned against mr newman by the turmoil at alex brown and by unwanted public interest in his spending habitsall this unrest might have been smoothed over had it not been for hundreds of millions of dollars in trading losses that beginning in july hit bankers trust including an embarrassing disclosure of a big hedge fund loss related to russia ultimately the bank posted a thirdquarter loss of  million and despite mr newmans reputation for risk aversion disclosed that its sophisticated models to manage risktaking had failed to perform effectivelyfrank made the promise to reduce the risk profile of bankers trust but look what happened in the third quarter said mr soifer the analyst at brown brothersas bankers trusts stock price fell the bank was roiled by internal accusations that mr newman had allowed its risky junk bond portfolio to balloon senior employees saiddeutsche bank which had dubbed its takeover campaign osprey after the blackandwhite bird of prey stopped considering a purchase of the san francisco brokerage firm hambrecht  quist and began circling bankers trust more closelywith bankers trusts financial position severely weakened mr newman was forced to take the takeover proposal much more seriously he held talks with deutsche banks chairman rolf breuer at an international monetary fund conference in washington in september and followed up with a meeting at mr breuers frankfurt home in octoberwhen bankers trust reported its big loss for the quarter on oct  deutsche bank made its move it quickly offered  a share for the beleaguered bank details of the transaction were worked out by investment bankers from goldman sachs which was advising deutsche bank and by jeffery a goldstein an investment banker with bankers trust morgan stanley dean witter was also hired as an outside adviser to bankers trustmr newmans future is hazy in a news conference yesterday mr breuer said that mr newmans duties would involve overseeing the integration of the two companies helping to negotiate regulatory hurdles in the united states and dealing with claims stemming from deutsche banks involvement with the nazis during the holocaustmy sense is that frank will just be a transitional figure mr soifer said and hell be there for only a few years continue reading the main story we’re interested in your feedback on this page tell us what you think whats next loading go to home page » site index
