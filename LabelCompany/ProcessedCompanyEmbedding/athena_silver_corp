press releases contact athena silver corporation symbol ahnr silver is one of the most valuable metals in the world today and is vital to many of the emerging technologies that will become more and more important as we move forward into tomorrow its unique properties include beauty strength sensitivity to light malleability and ductility electrical and thermal conductivity reflectivity and the ability to endure extreme temperature changes these properties allow groundbreaking research to be conducted by scientists and engineers that effect the way in which we live our lives in the ancient world silver was used primarily for jewelry and as monetary tokens today it’s primary use is in industry and the prospect is for that use to grow exponentially as new technologies take hold the vast majority of silver is mined outside of the united states as the united states develops new technologies in batteries bearings brazing and soldering catalysts electronics medical applications mirrors and coatings solar energy and water purification our industries will inevitably consume more silver having an increased supply at home reduces transportation costs removes currency fluxuation from the cost of a given project helps to guarantee adequate supply ensures environmentaly friendly production procedures keeps jobs at home and expands the business community in the immediate area of the production site new technology is vital to america’s future and silver is vital to that technology athena silver believes that increased industrial use of silver will stimulate demand athena silver intends to develop its silver deposit in the calico mining district of san bernadino california to help meet that demand and thus provide badly needed jobs in the industries that will help to maintain
