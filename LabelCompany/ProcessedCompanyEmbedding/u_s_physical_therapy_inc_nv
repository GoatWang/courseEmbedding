of us physical therapy inc and its subsidiaries the “company” all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated the company primarily operates through subsidiary clinic partnerships in which the company generally owns a  general partnership interest in all the clinic partnerships our limited partnership interests range from  to  in the clinic partnerships  the managing therapist of each clinic owns directly or indirectly the remaining limited partnership interest in the majority of the clinics hereinafter referred to as “clinic partnerships” to a lesser extent the company operates some clinics through whollyowned subsidiaries under profit sharing arrangements with therapists hereinafter referred to as “whollyowned facilities” the company continues to seek to attract for employment physical therapists who have established relationships with physicians and other referral sources by offering these therapists a competitive salary and incentives based on the profitability of the clinic that they manage the company also looks for therapists with whom to establish new de novo clinics to be owned jointly by the company and such therapists; in these situations the therapist is offered the opportunity to coinvest in the new clinic and also receives a competitive salary for managing the clinic for multisite clinic practices in which a controlling interest is acquired by the company the prior owners typically continue on as employees to manage the clinic operations retaining a noncontrolling ownership interest in the clinics and receiving a competitive salary for managing the clinic operations in addition we have developed satellite clinic facilities as part of existing clinic partnerships and whollyowned facilities with the result that a substantial number of clinic partnerships and whollyowned facilities operate more than one clinic location in  we intend to continue to acquire clinic practices and continue to focus on developing new clinics and on opening satellite clinics where appropriate along with increasing our patient volume through marketing and new programs during the first three months of  and the year ended  the

sheets restatement of prior financial statements as disclosed in our current report on form k filed march   and further described in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   filed on june   prior to issuing the  annual financial statements the company determined it had previously incorrectly accounted for the noncontrolling interests which were mandatorily redeemable management and the company’s board of directors concluded this error was material to previously issued annual and quarterly consolidated financial statements  additional information regarding the restatement is available in the company’s annual report on form k for the year ended december   financial information in this form q related to all periods prior to the quarter ended december   has been amended where necessary to reflect the restatement therefore this form q should be read in conjunction with the company’s annual report on form k for the year ended december   significant accounting policies cash equivalents the company maintains its cash and cash equivalents at financial institutions  the combined account balances at several institutions typically exceed federal deposit insurance corporation “fdic” insurance coverage and as a result there is a concentration of credit risk related on deposits in excess of fdic insurance coverage management believes that the risk is not significant longlived assets fixed assets are stated at cost depreciation is computed on the straightline method over the estimated useful lives of the assets estimated useful lives for furniture and equipment range from three to eight years and for software purchased from three to seven years leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or estimated useful lives of the assets which is generally three to five years    table of contents impairment of longlived assets and longlived assets to be disposed of the company reviews property and equipment and intangible assets with finite lives for impairment upon the occurrence of certain events or circumstances which indicate that the amounts may be impaired assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell goodwill goodwill represents the excess of the amount paid and fair value of the noncontrolling interests over the fair value of the acquired business assets which include certain identifiable intangible assets historically goodwill has been derived from acquisitions and prior to  from the purchase of some or all of a particular local management’s equity interest in an existing clinic effective january   if the purchase price of a noncontrolling interest by the company exceeds or is less than the book value at the time of purchase any excess or shortfall is recognized as an adjustment to additional paidin capital the fair value of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually and upon the occurrence of certain events and are written down to fair value if considered impaired the company evaluates goodwill for impairment on at least an annual basis in its third quarter by comparing the fair value of its reporting units to the carrying value of each reporting unit including related goodwill the company’s business is primarily made up of various clinics within partnerships the partnerships are components of regions and are aggregated to the operating segment level for the purpose of determining the company’s reporting units when performing its annual goodwill impairment test in the first quarter of  there were six regions an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the net assets of a reporting unit inclusive of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using two factors i earnings prior to taxes depreciation and amortization for the reporting unit multiplied by a priceearnings ratio used in the industry and ii a discounted cash flow analysis a weight is assigned to each factor and the sum of each weight times the factor is considered the estimated fair value for  the factors ie priceearnings ratio discount rate and residual capitalization rate were updated to reflect current market conditions the evaluation of goodwill in  did not result in any goodwill amounts that were deemed impaired the company has not identified any triggering events occurring after the testing date that would impact the impairment testing results obtained factors which could result in future impairment charges include but are not limited to · cost risks and uncertainties associated with the company’s recent restatement of its prior financial statements due to the correction of its accounting methodology for redeemable noncontrolling partnership interests and including any pending and future claims or proceedings relating to such matters; · changes as the result of government enacted national healthcare reform; · changes in medicare rules and guidelines and reimbursement or failure of our clinics to maintain their medicare certification or enrollment status; · revenue we receive from medicare and medicaid being subject to potential retroactive reduction; · business and regulatory conditions including federal and state regulation; · governmental and other third party payor inspections reviews investigations and audits; · compliance with federal and state laws and regulations relating to the privacy of individually identifiable patient information and associated fines and penalties for failure to comply; · legal actions which could subject us to increased operating costs and uninsured liabilities; · changes in reimbursement rates or payment methods from third party payors including government agencies and deductibles and copays owed by patients; · revenue and earnings expectations; · general economic conditions; · availability and cost of qualified physical and occupational therapists; · personnel productivity and retaining key personnel; · competitive economic or reimbursement conditions in our markets which may require us to reorganize or close certain operations and thereby incur losses andor closure costs including the possible writedown or writeoff of goodwill and other intangible assets;    table of contents · acquisitions purchases of noncontrolling interests minority interests and the successful integration of the operations of the acquired business; · maintaining necessary insurance coverage; · availability terms and use of capital; and · weather and other seasonal factors mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests the noncontrolling interests that are reflected as mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated financial statements consist of those owners who have certain redemption rights whether currently exercisable or not and which currently or in the future require that the company purchase the noncontrolling interest of those owners at a predetermined formula based on a multiple of trailing twelve months earnings performance as defined in the respective limited partnership agreements  the redemption rights are triggered at such time as both of the following events have occurred  termination of the owner’s employment regardless of the reason for such termination and  the passage of specified number of years after the closing of the transaction typically three to five years as defined in the limited partnership agreement on the date the company acquires a controlling interest in a partnership and the limited partnership agreement contains mandatory redemption rights the fair value of the noncontrolling interest is recorded in the longterm liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheet under the caption – mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests   then in each reporting period thereafter until it is purchased by the company the redeemable noncontrolling interest is adjusted to its then current redemption value based on the predetermined formula defined in the respective limited partnership agreement  the company reflects any adjustment in the redemption value and any earnings attributable to the mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interest in its consolidated statements of net income by recording the adjustments and earnings to other income and expense in the captions  interest expense – mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests – change in redemption value and interest expense – mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests – earnings allocable  noncontrolling interests the company recognizes noncontrolling interests as equity in the consolidated financial statements separate from the parent entity’s equity the amount of net income attributable to noncontrolling interests is included in consolidated net income on the face of the income statement changes in a parent entity’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in deconsolidation are treated as equity transactions if the parent entity retains its controlling financial interest the company recognizes a gain or loss in net income when a subsidiary is deconsolidated such gain or loss is measured using the fair value of the noncontrolling interest on the deconsolidation date when the purchase price of a noncontrolling interest by the company exceeds or is less than the book value at the time of purchase any excess or shortfall as applicable is recognized as an adjustment to additional paidin capital additionally operating losses are allocated to noncontrolling interests even when such allocation creates a deficit balance for the noncontrolling interest partner revenue recognition revenues are recognized in the period in which services are rendered net patient revenues patient revenues less estimated contractual adjustments are reported at the estimated net realizable amounts from thirdparty payors patients and others for services rendered the company has agreements with thirdparty payors that provide for payments to the company at amounts different from its established rates the allowance for estimated contractual adjustments is based on terms of payor contracts and historical collection and writeoff experience the company determines allowances for doubtful accounts based on the specific agings and payor classifications at each clinic the provision for doubtful accounts is included in clinic operating costs in the statement of net income net accounts receivable which are stated at the historical carrying amount net of contractual allowances writeoffs and allowance for doubtful accounts includes only those amounts the company estimates to be collectible    table of contents medicare reimbursement the medicare program reimburses outpatient rehabilitation providers based on the medicare physician fee schedule ‘‘mpfs’’ the mpfs rates have historically been subject to an automatic annual update based on a formula called the sustainable growth rate ‘‘sgr’’ formula the use of the sgr formula would have resulted in calculated automatic reductions in rates in every year since ; however for each year through september   centers for medicare  medicaid services ‘‘cms’’ or congress has taken action to prevent the implementation of sgr formula reductions on april   the medicare access and chip reauthorization act of  ‘‘macra’’ was signed into law eliminating the sgr formula and the associated annual automatic rate reductions  as a result of macra and cms’ adjustment to the applicable conversion factor the net fee schedule payment rates were increased for  by   for  and  a  increase will be applied each year to the fee schedule payment rates unless further adjusted by cms in addition the macra promotes the development of new payment models that focus on quality and outcomes the budget control act of  increased the federal debt ceiling in connection with deficit reductions over the next ten years and requires automatic reductions in federal spending by approximately  trillion payments to medicare providers are subject to these automatic spending reductions subject to a  cap on april   a  reduction to medicare payments was implemented the bipartisan budget act of  enacted on november   extends the  reductions to medicare payments through fiscal year  as a result of the balanced budget act of  the formula for determining the total amount paid by medicare in any one year for outpatient physical therapy occupational therapy andor speechlanguage pathology services provided to any medicare beneficiary ie the ‘‘therapy cap’’ or ‘‘limit’’ was established based on the statutory definitions which constrained how the therapy cap would be applied there is one limit for physical therapy and speech language pathology services combined and one limit for occupational therapy for  the annual limit on outpatient therapy services is  for physical and speech language pathology services combined and  for occupational therapy services historically these therapy caps applied to outpatient therapy services provided in all settings except for services provided in departments of hospitals however the protecting access to medicare act of  and prior legislation extended the therapy caps to services furnished in hospital outpatient department settings the application of these annual limits to hospital outpatient department settings will sunset on december   unless congress extends it in the deficit reduction act of  congress implemented an exceptions process to the annual limit for therapy expenses for therapy services above the annual limit therapy services above the annual limit that are medically necessary satisfy an exception to the annual limit and such claims are payable by the medicare program the macra extended the exceptions process for outpatient therapy caps through december   unless congress extends the exceptions process further the therapy caps will apply to all outpatient therapy services beginning january   except those services furnished and billed by outpatient hospital departments for any claim above the annual limit the claim must contain a modifier indicating that the services are medically necessary and justified by appropriate documentation in the medical record furthermore under the middle class tax relief and job creation act of  ‘‘mctra’’ since october   patients who met or exceeded  in therapy expenditures during a calendar year have been subject to a manual medical review to determine whether applicable payment criteria are satisfied the  threshold is applied to physical therapy and speech language pathology services; a separate  threshold is applied to the occupational therapy the macra directed cms to modify the manual medical review process such that those reviews will no longer apply to all claims exceeding the  threshold and instead will be determined on a targeted basis based on a variety of factors that cms considers appropriate the new factors apply to exception requests for which cms did not conduct a medical review by july   cms adopted a multiple procedure payment reduction ‘‘mppr’’ for therapy services in the final update to the mpfs for calendar year  the mppr applied to all outpatient therapy services paid under medicare part b — occupational therapy physical therapy and speechlanguage pathology under the policy the medicare program pays  of the practice expense component of the relative value unit ‘‘rvu’’ for the therapy procedure with the highest practice expense rvu then reduces the payment for the practice expense component for the second and subsequent therapy procedures or units of service furnished during the same day for the same patient regardless of whether those therapy services are furnished in separate sessions since  the practice expense component for the second and subsequent therapy service furnished during the same day for the same patient was reduced by  in addition the mctra directed cms to implement a claimsbased data collection program to gather additional data on patient function during the course of therapy in order to better understand patient conditions and outcomes all practice settings that provide outpatient therapy services are required to include this data on the claim form since  therapists have been required to report new codes and modifiers on the claim form that reflect a patient’s functional limitations and goals at initial evaluation periodically throughout care and at discharge cms has rejected claims if the required data is not included in the claim    table of contents the physician quality reporting system or ‘‘pqrs’’ is a cms reporting program that uses a combination of incentive payments and payment reductions to promote reporting of quality information by ‘‘eligible professionals’’ although physical therapists occupational therapists and qualified speechlanguage therapists were generally able to participate in the pqrs program therapy professionals for whose services we bill through our certified rehabilitation agencies cannot participate because the medicare claims processing systems currently cannot accommodate institutional providers such as certified rehabilitation agencies eligible professionals such as those of our therapy professionals for whose services we bill using their individual medicare provider numbers who do not satisfactorily report data on quality measures will be subject to a  reduction in their medicare payment in  and  as required under the macra the pqrs program has been replaced with the meritbased incentive payment system mips on january   physical therapists and occupational therapists are not required to participate in the mips program until january   or later as determined by cms statutes regulations and payment rules governing the delivery of therapy services to medicare beneficiaries are complex and subject to interpretation the company believes that it is in compliance in all material respects with all applicable laws and regulations and is not aware of any pending or threatened investigations involving allegations of potential wrongdoing that would have a material effect on the company’s financial statements as of march   compliance with such laws and regulations can be subject to future government review and interpretation as well as significant regulatory action including fines penalties and exclusion from the medicare program for the three months ended march   net revenue from medicare accounts for approximately  million management contract revenues management contract revenues are derived from contractual arrangements whereby the company manages a clinic for third party owners the company does not have any ownership interest in these clinics typically revenues are determined based on the number of visits conducted at the clinic and recognized when services are performed costs typically salaries for the company’s employees are recorded when incurred management contract revenues are included in “other revenues” in the accompanying consolidated statements of net income contractual allowances contractual allowances result from the differences between the rates charged for services performed and expected reimbursements by both insurance companies and government sponsored healthcare programs for such services medicare regulations and the various third party payors and managed care contracts are often complex and may include multiple reimbursement mechanisms payable for the services provided in company clinics the company estimates contractual allowances based on its interpretation of the applicable regulations payor contracts and historical calculations each month the company estimates its contractual allowance for each clinic based on payor contracts and the historical collection experience of the clinic and applies an appropriate contractual allowance reserve percentage to the gross accounts receivable balances for each payor of the clinic based on the company’s historical experience calculating the contractual allowance reserve percentage at the payor level is sufficient to allow the company to provide the necessary detail and accuracy with its collectability estimates however the services authorized and provided and related reimbursement are subject to interpretation that could result in payments that differ from the company’s estimates payor terms are periodically revised necessitating continual review and assessment of the estimates made by management the company’s billing system does not capture the exact change in its contractual allowance reserve estimate from period to period in order to assess the accuracy of its revenues and hence its contractual allowance reserves management regularly compares its cash collections to corresponding net revenues measured both in the aggregate and on a clinicbyclinic basis in the aggregate the historical difference between net revenues and corresponding cash collections has generally reflected a difference within approximately  of net revenues additionally analysis of subsequent period’s contractual writeoffs on a payor basis reflects a difference within approximately  between the actual aggregate contractual reserve percentage as compared to the estimated contractual allowance reserve percentage associated with the same period end balance as a result the company believes that a change in the contractual allowance reserve estimate would not likely be more than  at march   income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basis and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date    table of contents the company recognizes the financial statement benefit of a tax position only after determining that the relevant tax authority would more likely than not sustain the position following an audit for tax positions meeting the morelikelythannot threshold the amount to be recognized in the financial statements is the largest benefit that has a greater than  percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement with the relevant tax authority the company did not have any accrued interest or penalties associated with any unrecognized tax benefits nor was any interest expense recognized during the three months ended march   the company will book any interest or penalties if required in interest andor other incomeexpense as appropriate fair value of financial instruments the carrying amounts reported in the balance sheets for cash and cash equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and notes payable approximate their fair values due to the shortterm maturity of these financial instruments the carrying amount under the amended credit agreement

some provisions in stock compensation accounting  the guidance amends how excess tax benefits and a company’s payments to cover tax bills for the recipients’ shares should be classified  prior to this guidance excess tax benefits were recorded in additional paidin capital but will now become a component of the income tax provisionbenefit in the period in which they occur  this guidance allows companies to estimate the number of stock awards expected to vest and revises the withholding requirements for classifying stock awards as equity  for public business entities this guidance is effective for fiscal years starting after december   including interim periods within those fiscal years but early adoption is allowed  the company adopted this accounting treatment in the fourth quarter of  and retrospectively adjusted each quarter period in   the adoption increased earnings by decreasing the tax provision by  million for the three months ended march     the election to record forfeitures in the period they occur is consistent with the company’s past approach due to the immateriality of past forfeitures and the company believes the effect to be immaterial on the consolidated financial statements recently issued accounting guidance in january  the fasb issued asu  simplifying the test for goodwill impairment topic  which eliminates the requirement to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill to measure a goodwill impairment change asu  is effective prospectively for fiscal years and the interim periods within those years beginning after december   the company is currently evaluating the impact of adopting this asu on our consolidated financial statements and do not expect adoption to have a material impact in february  the fasb issued amended accounting guidance which replaced most existing lease accounting guidance under u s generally accepted accounting principles among other changes the amended guidance requires that a righttouse asset which is an asset that represents the lessee’s right to use and a lease liability which is a lessee’s obligation to make lease payments arising for a lease measured on a discounted basis be recognized on the balance sheet by lessees for those leases with a term of greater than  months the amended guidance is effective for reporting periods beginning after december  ; however early adoption is permitted entities are required to use a modified retrospective approach for leases that exist or are entered into after the beginning of the earliest comparative period in the financial statements since the company leases all but one of its clinic facilities it has been evaluating various lease management systems to capture the necessary information and the impact that this amended accounting guidance will have on its consolidated financial statements   in may  march  april  and december  the fasb issued asu  revenue from contracts with customers asu  revenue from contracts with customers principal versus agent considerations asu  revenue from contracts with customers identifying performance obligations and licensing asu  revenue from contracts with customers narrow scope improvements and practical expedients and asu  technical corrections and improvements to topic  revenue from contracts with customer collectively “the standards” respectively which supersede most of the current revenue recognition requirements the core principle of the new guidance is that an entity should recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services new disclosures about the nature amount timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers are also required the original standards were effective for fiscal years beginning after december   however in july  the fasb approved a oneyear deferral of these standards with a new effective date for fiscal years beginning after december   the standards require the selection of a retrospective or cumulative effect transition method the company does not anticipate a material adjustment upon adoption of these standards subsequent event the company has evaluated events occurring after the balance sheet date for possible disclosure as a subsequent event

in a physical therapy clinic business referred to as “therapy practice” these acquisitions occur in a series of steps which are described below  prior to the acquisition the therapy practice exists as a separate legal entity the “seller entity” the seller entity is owned by one or more individuals the “selling shareholders” most of whom are physical therapists that work in the therapy practice and provide physical therapy services to patients  in conjunction with the acquisition the seller entity contributes the therapy practice into a newlyformed limited partnership “newco” in exchange for one hundred percent  of the limited and general partnership interests in newco therefore in this step newco becomes a whollyowned subsidiary of the seller entity  the company enters into an agreement the “purchase agreement” to acquire from the seller entity a majority ranges from  to  of the limited partnership interest and in all cases  of the general partnership interest in newco the company does not purchase  of the limited partnership interest because the selling shareholders through the seller entity want to maintain an ownership percentage the consideration for the acquisition is primarily payable in the form of cash at closing and a small twoyear note in lieu of an escrow the “purchase price” the purchase agreement does not contain any future earnout or other contingent consideration that is payable to the seller entity or the selling shareholders  the company and the seller entity also execute a partnership agreement the “partnership agreement” for newco that sets forth the rights and obligations of the limited and general partners of newco after the acquisition the company is the general partner of newco  as noted above the company does not purchase  of the limited partnership interests in newco and the seller entity retains a portion of the limited partnership interest in newco “seller entity interest”  in most cases some or all of the selling shareholders enter into an employment agreement the  “employment agreement” with newco with an initial term that ranges from three to five years the “employment term” with automatic oneyear renewals unless employment is terminated prior to the end of the employment term as a result a selling shareholder becomes an employee “employed selling shareholder” of newco the employment of an employed selling shareholder can be terminated by the employed selling shareholder or newco with or without cause at any time in a few situations a selling shareholder does not become employed by newco and is not involved with newco following the closing; in those situations such selling shareholders sell their entire ownership interest in the seller entity as of the closing of the acquisition  the compensation of each employed selling shareholder is specified in the employment agreement and is customary and commensurate with his or her responsibilities based on other employees in similar capacities within newco the company and the industry  the company and the selling shareholder including both employed selling shareholders and selling shareholders not employed by newco execute a noncompete agreement the “non compete agreement” which restricts the selling shareholder from engaging in competing business activities for a specified period of time the “noncompete term” a noncompete agreement is executed with the selling shareholders in all cases that is even if the selling shareholder does not become an employed selling shareholder the selling shareholder is restricted from engaging in a competing business during the noncompete term    table of contents  the noncompete term commences as of the date of the acquisition and expires on the later of a two years after the date an employed selling shareholders’ employment is terminated if the selling shareholder becomes an employed selling shareholder or b five to six years from the date of the acquisition as defined in the noncompete agreement regardless of whether the selling shareholder is employed by newco  the noncompete agreement applies to a restricted region which is defined as a mile radius from the therapy practice that is an employed selling shareholder is permitted to engage in competing businesses or activities outside the mile radius after such employed selling shareholder no longer is employed by newco and a selling shareholder who is not employed by newco immediately is permitted to engage in the competing business or activities outside the mile radius  the partnership agreement contains provisions for the redemption of the seller entity interest either at the option of the company the “call option” or on a required basis the “required redemption” a required redemption i once the required redemption is triggered the company is obligated to purchase from the seller entity and the seller entity is obligated to sell to the company the allocable portion of the seller entity interest based on the terminated selling shareholder’s pro rata ownership interest in the seller entity the “allocable portion” required redemption is triggered when both of the following events have occurred  termination of an employed selling shareholder’s employment with newco regardless of the reason for such termination and  the expiration of an agreed upon period of time typically three to five years as set forth in the relevant partnership agreement the “holding period” ii in the event an employed selling shareholder’s employment terminates prior to the expiration of the holding period the required redemption would occur only upon expiration of the holding period b call option i in the event that an employed selling shareholder’s employment terminates prior to expiration of the holding period the company has the contractual right but not the obligation to acquire the employed selling shareholder’s allocable portion of the seller entity interest from the seller entity through exercise of the call option c for the required redemption and the call option the purchase price is derived from a formula based on a specified multiple of newco’s trailing twelve months of earnings before interest taxes depreciation amortization and the company’s internal management fee plus an allocable portion of any undistributed earnings of newco the “redemption amount” newco’s earnings are distributed monthly based on available cash within newco; therefore the undistributed earnings amount is small if any d the purchase price for the initial equity interest purchased by the company is also based on the same specified multiple of the trailing twelvemonth earnings that is used in the required redemption noted above e although the required redemption and the call option do not have an expiration date the seller entity interest eventually will be purchased by the company f the required redemption and the call option never apply to selling shareholders who do not become employed by newco since the company requires that such selling shareholders sell their entire ownership interest in the seller entity at the closing of the acquisition  an employed selling shareholder’s ownership of his or her equity interest in the seller entity predates the acquisition and the company’s purchase of its partnership interest in newco the employment agreement and the noncompete agreement do not contain any provision to escrow or “claw back” the equity interest in the seller entity held by such employed selling shareholder nor the seller entity interest in newco in the event of a breach of the employment or noncompete terms more specifically even if the employed selling shareholder is terminated for “cause” by newco such employed selling shareholder does not forfeit his or her right to his or her full equity interest in the seller entity and the seller entity does not forfeit its right to any portion of the seller entity interest the company’s only recourse against the employed selling shareholder for breach of either the employment agreement or the noncompete agreement is to seek damages and other legal remedies under such agreements there are no conditions in any of the arrangements with an employed selling shareholder that would result in a forfeiture of the equity interest held in the seller entity or of the seller entity interest    table of contents for the three months ended march   the following table details the changes in the carrying amount of mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling

interest expense increased to  in the  first quarter compared to  in the  first quarter due to a higher average balance outstanding under our amended credit agreement  at march    million was outstanding under our amended credit agreement see “—liquidity and capital resources” below for a discussion of the terms of our amended credit agreement provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes for the  first quarter was  million and for the  first quarter was  million the provision for income taxes as a percentage of income before taxes less net income attributable to noncontrolling interest was  in the  first quarter and  in the  first quarter  included in the  first quarter was an excess tax benefit which had the effect of reducing the effective tax rate of  million related to the adoption of revised guidance on accounting for stock compensation as compared to  million in the  first quarter   noncontrolling interests net income attributable to noncontrolling interests was  million for the  first quarter and  million for the  first quarter    table of contents liquidity and capital resources we believe that our business is generating sufficient cash flow from operations to allow us to meet our shortterm and longterm cash requirements other than those with respect to future acquisitions at march   and december   we had  million and  million respectively in cash although the startup costs associated with opening new clinics and our planned capital expenditures are significant we believe that our cash and unused availability under our revolving credit agreement are sufficient to fund the working capital needs of our operating subsidiaries future clinic development and acquisitions and investments through at least march  significant acquisitions would likely require additional financing   effective december   we entered into an amended and restated credit agreement with a commitment for a  million revolving credit facility with a maturity date of november   this agreement was amended in august  january  and march  hereafter referred to as “amended credit agreement” the amended credit agreement is unsecured and has loan covenants including requirements that the company comply with a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio and consolidated leverage ratio proceeds from the amended credit agreement may be used for working capital acquisitions purchases of the company’s common stock dividend payments to the company’s common stockholders capital expenditures and other corporate purposes the pricing grid which is based on the company’s consolidated leverage ratio with the applicable spread over libor ranging from  to  or the applicable spread over the base rate ranging from  to  fees under the amended credit agreement include an unused commitment fee ranging from  to  depending on the company’s consolidated leverage ratio and the amount of funds outstanding under the amended credit agreement on march    million was outstanding under our amended credit agreement resulting in  million of availability  as of the date of this quarterly report we were in compliance with all of the covenants thereunder   cash and cash equivalents increased by  million from december   to march     million was provided by operations and  million from net proceeds drawn on the line of credit provided in our amended credit agreement the major uses of cash for investing and financing activities included purchase of businesses  million distributions to noncontrolling interests  million payments to settle mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests  million purchases of fixed assets  million and payments on notes payable  million on january   we acquired a  interest in a seventeenclinic physical therapy practice  the purchase price for the  interest was  million in cash and  million in a seller note that is payable in two principal installments totaling  each plus accrued interest in january  and  in march  we acquired a  interest in a company which is a leading provider of workforce performance solutions services provided include onsite injury prevention and rehabilitation performance optimization and ergonomic assessments the majority of these services are contracted with and paid for directly by employers including a number of fortune  companies other clients include large insurers and their contractors the purchase price for the  interest was  million in cash and  million in a seller note that is payable principal plus accrued interest in september  on november   we acquired a  interest in a  clinic physical therapy practice the purchase price for the  interest was  million in cash and  million in a seller note that is payable in two principal installments of  each plus accrued interest in november  and  on february   we acquired a  interest in an eightclinic physical therapy practice  the purchase price for the  interest was  million in cash and  million in a seller note that is payable in two principal installments totaling  each plus accrued interest one of which was paid in february  and one of which is payable in february   in addition we acquired a single clinic practice in june  for  historically we have generated sufficient cash from operations to fund our development activities and to cover operational needs we plan to continue developing new clinics and making additional acquisitions we also from time to time purchase the noncontrolling interests in our clinic partnerships generally any acquisition or purchase of noncontrolling interests is expected to be accomplished using a combination of cash and financing any large acquisition would likely require financing we make reasonable and appropriate efforts to collect accounts receivable including applicable deductible and copayment amounts in a consistent manner for all payor types claims are submitted to payors daily weekly or monthly in accordance with our policy or payor’s requirements when possible we submit our claims electronically    table of contents the collection process is time consuming and typically involves the submission of claims to multiple payors whose payment of claims may be dependent upon the payment of another payor claims under litigation and vehicular incidents can take a year or longer to collect medicare and other payor claims relating to new clinics awaiting medicare rehab agency status approval initially may not be submitted for six months or more when all reasonable internal collection efforts have been exhausted accounts are written off prior to sending them to outside collection firms with managed care commercial health plans and selfpay payor type receivables the writeoff generally occurs after the account receivable has been outstanding for at least  days we generally enter into various notes payable as a means of financing our acquisitions our outstanding notes payable as of march   relate to certain of the acquisitions of businesses purchases of noncontrolling interests and settlements of mandatorily redeemable noncontrolling interests that occurred in  through march  typically the notes are payable in equal annual installments of principal over two years plus any accrued and unpaid interest interest accrues at various interest rates ranging from  to  per annum subject to adjustment at march   the balance on these notes payable was  million  in addition we assumed leases with remaining terms of  month to  years for the operating facilities in conjunction with the above mentioned acquisitions in the event that a limited minority partner’s employment ceases at any time after a specified date that is between three and five years from the acquisition date we have agreed to repurchase that individual’s noncontrolling interest at a predetermined multiple of earnings before interest and taxes as of march   we have accrued  million related to credit balances due to patients and payors  this amount is expected to be paid in the next twelve months from september  through december   our board of directors “board” authorized us to purchase in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions up to  shares of our common stock in march  the board authorized the repurchase of up to  or approximately  shares of our common stock “march  authorization” our amended credit agreement permits share repurchases of up to  subject to compliance with covenants we are required to retire shares purchased under the march  authorization there is no expiration date for the share repurchase program as of march   there are currently an additional estimated  shares based on the closing price of  on march    that may be purchased from time to time in the open market or private transactions depending on price availability and our cash position we did not purchase any shares of our common stock during the three months ended march      table of contents factors affecting future results the

and procedures our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer has conducted an evaluation of the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rule ae promulgated under the exchange act as of the end of the period covered by this report based upon that evaluation our chief executive officer and chief financial officer have concluded that as a result of the material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting discussed in the company’s annual report on form k for the year ended december    our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective in ensuring that the information required to be disclosed in the reports we file or submit under the exchange act is recorded processed summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the rules and forms of the sec and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer as appropriate to allow timely decisions regarding disclosure b previously reported material weaknesses in internal control over financial reporting as discussed in the company’s annual report on form k for the year ended december   management conducted an assessment of the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december    based on this assessment management concluded that our internal control over financial reporting was not effective as of december   as a result of the material weakness discussed below redeemable noncontrolling interests – we did not properly account for redeemable noncontrolling interests the company’s business combination  purchase accounting controls relating to our accounting for redeemable noncontrolling interests were not designed effectively to ensure that we correctly interpreted and applied technical accounting requirements concerning the classification of such interests on our consolidated financial statements changes in internal control over financial reporting other than the material weakness described above there have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the period covered by this report that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting subsequent to the period covered by this report we implemented the following changes to our internal control over financial reporting process as it relates to redeemable noncontrolling interests to begin to remediate the material weakness · the assistant controller reviews the language and terms of any new standard limited partnership agreement created by the company’s legal department  the sections which contain language having a potential accounting impact are identified and listed on the “accounting considerations for limited partnership agreements” checklist · for each new limited partnership agreement executed by the company’s legal department the assistant controller obtains a completed and signed “accounting considerations for limited partnership agreements” checklist from the company’s general counsel indicating if the language having a potential accounting impact denoted on the checklist referenced above has changed · if a change is denoted on the “accounting considerations for limited partnership agreements” checklist the corporate or assistant controller will review the agreement and research the changed language for accounting and disclosure implications  if the nature of the language is such that interpretation is subjective and management does not believe they have the technical experience in that transaction type research will include seeking outside counsel from a third party accounting expert such as a consulting or accounting firm  a memo is drafted with the appropriate facts and resolution and approved by the corporate controller and chief financial officer management believes the new process and controls stated above are precise enough to identify and prevent the type of accounting error which occurred related to limited partnership agreements    table of contents part ii—other information   item
