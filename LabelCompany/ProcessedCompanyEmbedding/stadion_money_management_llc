the money that absolutely must be there for important life goals like retirement at stadion we have several deeply held views that govern our products and services investing should feel as easy as sitting on a porch swing on a warm summer day  for more than two decades stadion has served thousands of investors as they prepare for their financial futures—in ways that we hope are easy to understand and follow our downtoearth approach comes from our southern roots and a company culture based on doing the right thing it’s a style that resonates with investors who like us think investing should be less stressful and less confusing the less money lost during downturns means less money that must be made up before gains become actual gains that’s why all of our strategies are defensively biased that is they aim to protect from large losses during down markets investment decisions should be governed by a disciplined process the investments that stadion money managers make are informed by our own datadriven processes we never invest based on hunches intuition or emotion investment results are best measured in full market cycles some investors may be quick to jump to where they think returns are highest which could mean shortterm gains but a less satisfying experience when markets turn instead we believe investors should look at how an investment performs over a longer period of time—evaluating how it does in up markets down markets and everything in between over the long term we think our approach provides a smoother path to satisfying returns find out more about our

exchangetraded products in  by andrew barber at over  billion in assets under management in mutual funds and separate accounts stadion money management is one of the largest managers of exchangetraded funds and related products stadion has quietly grown its business from a headquarters in watkinsville georgia since launching in  in june of  private equity firm ta associates acquired a controlling stake in the firm institutional investor contributor andrew barber recently sat down with will mcgough a portfolio manager at stadion to pick his brain about what  holds for the etf industry and how asset management firms like his will adapt to the changing landscape  what are some of the big stories that you see developing for the etf market in  one of the most interesting developments is the fidelity news that they have recently filed for a series of actively managed bond and equity etfs the proliferation of actively managed etfs had been primarily focused among smaller managers at first if the fidelitys of the world are willing to let everyone see their daily holdings though it may be a gamechanger signaling more entries by big fund families to come the success of the pimco total return etf may be causing a broad reassessing of business plans we very much look forward to new ways to access different strategies for our portfolios through these new offerings  what do you think about the prospects for the fixed income etf market in  everyone has been waiting for the bond bubble to pop animal spirits on the hunt for yield have been crowding certain sectors like high yield via the etf market for a while now qe was announced the other day and in that announcement the fed further defined limitations on how long they are willing to keep the foot on the pedal people looking for yield need to understand the risks that come with it because eventually the bond markets will turn and when they do that riskier paper will be hit first and hardest  another popular space in etfs has been emerging markets both fixed income and equity what are your firms thoughts on allocating there in the coming year weve seen a lot of what the emerging markets have to offer in terms of growth prospects and in some cases positive demographic inflections the developed world is largely following japans lead with rapidly aging populations and economies that are groaning under debt levels of historic proportions with these severe economic drags the investment opportunities in emerging markets could become increasingly attractive for tactical shifts away from domestic allocations during cyclical bull moves  what about the etp industry itself do you see any changes coming for the makeup of the competitive landscape i dont really see much change in the issuers at the higher level youll always have the ishares spdrs and vanguards and such things are getting tougher for midtier players like first trust however and they will have to be really focused on developing products that have significant demand but are still niche enough to justify higherthanindex fee structures the really small guys will definitely have a huge battle ahead trying to capture investor attention in such a saturated market  speaking of fees do you anticipate further fee contraction in the coming year yes absolutely just look at what ishares is doing with fees on their core lineup in the institutional world where fee disclosure is critical its imperative that commoditized beta offerings have lower costs to compete basically the fee is the tracking error at that stage given equal fund structure and portfolio manager expertise this trend of fee compression for commoditized products can only continue as more institutional interest develops for these products if you think about it that is really the root cause of vanguards move away from msci for their index products sure there have been some outflows as investors that need to track specific indices go away but for the most part the expense ratio is of paramount importance to the institutions that are becoming an increasing part of this market audience sponsored video get started subscribe show me all of my options   research  rankings
