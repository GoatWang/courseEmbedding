frederick rentschler an ohio native and former executive at wright aeronautical was determined to start an aviationrelated business of his own his social network included edward deeds another prominent ohioan of the early aviation industry and fredericks brother gordon rentschler both of whom were on the board of niles bement pond then one of the largest machine tool corporations in the world frederick rentschler approached these men as he sought capital and assets for his new venture deeds and g rentschler persuaded the board of niles bement pond that their pratt  whitney machine tool pwmt subsidiary of hartford connecticut should provide the funding and location to build a new aircraft engine being developed by rentschler george j mead and colleagues all formerly of wright aeronautical conceived and designed by mead the new engine would be a large aircooled radial design pratt  whitney machine tool was going through a period of selfrevision at the time to prepare itself for the post–great war era discontinuing old product lines and incubating new ones the great war had been profitable to pwmt but the peace brought a predictable glut to the machine tool market as contracts with governments were canceled and the market in used recently built tools competed against new ones pwmts future growth would depend on innovation having idle factory space and capital available at this historical moment to be invested wherever good return seemed available pwmt saw the postwar aviation industry both military and civil commercial private as one with some of the greatest growth and development prospects available anywhere for the next few decades it lent rentschler  the use of the pratt  whitney name and space in their building this was the beginning of the pratt  whitney aircraft company pratt  whitney aircrafts first engine the  horsepower  kw r wasp was completed on christmas eve  on its third test run it easily passed the navy qualification test in march  by october the navy had ordered  the wasp exhibited performance and reliability that revolutionized american aviation the r powered the aircraft of wiley post amelia earhart and many other record flights the r was followed by another very successful engine the r wasp junior eventually a whole wasp series was developed both engines are still in use in agricultural aircraft around the world and produce more power than their original design criteria replacement parts for both engines are still in production and it is theoretically possible to assemble a new engine from the parts george mead soon led the next step in the field of large stateoftheart aircooled radial aircraft engines which the wasp dominated when pratt  whitney released its r hornet it was basically a bigger wasp in  rentschler ended his association with pratt  whitney machine tool and merged pratt  whitney aircraft with boeing and other companies to form the united aircraft and transport corporation his
