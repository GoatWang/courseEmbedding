of the fastestgrowing areas of new drug development  there are two main categories – active immunotherapy and passive immunotherapy  active immunotherapies aka therapeutic vaccines involve internally stimulating the body’s own immune system to generate a targeted durable treatment against a specific disease or condition  passive immunotherapies also employ the immune system but rely on antigenspecific antibodies engineered outside of the body which are repeatedly administered for treatment effect klh in active immunotherapy klh can be used as a carrier molecule or immune stimulant in certain active immunotherapies being developed for a wide range of conditions including cancers inflammatory disease immune disorders and alzheimer’s klh in tdar immunotoxicology klh is well known

klh keyhole limpet hemocyanin is used extensively as a carrier protein in research and therapeutic vaccine applications peptides small proteins and drug molecules of low molecular weight are not usually immunogenic they require the aid of a carrier protein to stimulate antibody production klh is a very effective and popular carrier protein due to its large size numerous epitopes plentiful sites for antigen conjugation and strong safety history klh is also well known as a safe potent stimulator of humoral and cellular immune responses it plays a vital role in research and clinical studies as an antigen for assessing immune function and in immunotoxicology studies such as monitoring the immunosuppressive effects of drug candidates different forms and supply sources of klh have
