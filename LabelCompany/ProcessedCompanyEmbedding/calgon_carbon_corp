activated carbons that means whatever your activated carbon need calgon carbon has a product engineered specifically to provide a better solution what is activated carbon activated carbon is a porous material that removes organic compounds from liquids and gases by a process known as “adsorption” in adsorption organic molecules contained in a liquid or gas are attracted and bound to the surface of the pores of the activated carbon as the liquid or gas is passed through adsorption occurs on the internal surface of activated carbon termed the adsorbent during adsorption liquids or gases pass through the highly porous structure of the activated carbon the compounds to be removed termed the adsorbates diffuses to the surface of the adsorbent and is retained because of attractive forces the primary raw material used in the production of our activated carbons is bituminous coal that is crushed sized and processed in low temperature bakers followed by hightemperature activation furnaces activation develops the pore structure of the carbon through adjustments in the activation process differentiated pores for a particular purification application are developed what is carbon reactivation calgon carbon reactivation services include the reactivation of spent carbon on a custom basis or a pool basis customers in the municipal drinking water food application or industrial sectors can have their spent carbon reactivated with the resultant product being returned to them custom reactivation alternatively customers may put their spent carbon into a generic pool for reactivation making this a costeffective product alternative when getting your own material returned is not required or a costeffective recycling option as opposed to disposal when virgin material is required calgon carbon’s custom municipal reactivation cmr products custom food grade reactivation cfr products and custom industrial reactivation cir products are put through the same quality testing

reactivation followed by offgas treatment the adsorbed organic compounds are destroyed and reactivated carbon can be safely and costeffectively recycled back to facilities for continued use a number of important steps are involved in the reactivation process spent activated carbon is heated in furnaces devoid of oxygen using steam as a selective oxidant adsorbed organics are either volatilized from the activated carbon or pyrolysed to a carbon char volatilized organics are destroyed in the furnace’s afterburner acid gases are removed by means of a chemical scrubber the hightemperature reaction with steam serves to restore the adsorptive capacity of the activated carbon through reactivation the spent granular activated carbon can be recycled for reuse virtually eliminating the costs

removes organic compounds from liquids and gases by a process known as adsorption the raw material used in the production of the companys activated carbons is bituminous coal which is crushed sized and then processed in rotary kilns followed by high temperature furnaces this heating process is known as activation and develops the pore structure of the carbon through adjustments in the activation process pores of the required size and number are developed for a particular purification application the company also markets activated carbons from other raw materials including coconut shell and wood it produces and sells a range of activated impregnated or acid washed carbons in granular powdered or pellet form granular activated carbon gac particles are irregular in shape and generally used in fixed filter beds for continuous flow purification processes powdered activated carbon pac is carbon that has been pulverized into powder and is often used in batch purification processes in municipal water treatment applications and for flue gas emissions control pelletized activated carbons are extruded particles cylindrical in shape and are typically used for gas phase applications due to the low pressure drop high mechanical strength and low dust content of the product another important component of the activated carbon and service business segment is the optional services that the company makes available to purchasers of its products and systemsthe company offers a range of treatment services for customers including carbon supply equipment leasing installation and

challenges to the operations tasked with eliminating it calgon carbon responds to recently approved amendment to the  international ballast water management convention implementation schedule calgon carbon corporation nyse ccc calgon carbon or the company today announced its disappointment with an amendment made to the implementation schedule for ships to comply with the international maritime organization imo  international convention for the control and management of ships’ ballast water and sediments the convention that was agreed to at the imo marine environment protection committee mepc meetings held last week in london england in summary the amendment to the convention treatment alternatives for pfcs over the past two years no groundwater issue has perhaps received as much community focus and attention as polyfluoroalkyl and perfluoroalkyl substances like pfoa and pfos often referred to as perflourinated compounds pfcs the us epa issued a health advisory limiting the amount of these compounds to  partstrillion which kicked off a nationwide evaluation of local water sources how to select the right activated carbon for pfas removal no water contamination issue is grabbing more headlines these days than that of perfluorinated chemicals commonly referred to as pfcs or pfas concerns over the chemicals have sprung up all over the country prompted by contamination from industrial wastewater and military firefighting foam regardless of where the issue has come up or what caused it everyone who has been affected wants the same thing an effective treatment

specialty resins for tannins arsenic nitrates dealkalization and deionization subcategories carbon  taste odor color and chlorine reduction water softener resin water softener resin can be regenerated with either potassium chloride or sodium chloride salt there is a misconception in the marketplace that certain water softeners are specifically designed for use with potassium salt to be more environmentally correct this is a fallacy all water softeners using a cation exchange resin can use either salt typically it requires about  more salt to regenerate with potassium chloride salt when compared to sodium chloride salt the advantage of potassium salt is that it does not contribute to a high sodium diet and the backwash can be discharges onto a lawn or garden sodium chloride salt will kill plants so it must be discharged into a sewer system usa made resins are made with sulfuric acid to sulfonate the resin versus imported resins that use a solvent based process both produce a good resin but the usa made resin wont have the solvent residue on startup that will be experienced with the imported resins newer  crosslink resins claim to have more resistance to breakdown from chlorine

layer of media including filterag sand garnet and gravel ph correction media the two most popular ph correction medias for home water treatment are calcite and corosex calcite is limestone and offers one primary advantage you cannot overtreat your water with calcite calcite will correct ph to a  range without overcorrecting and causing high ph spikes calcite is ideal for ph levels as low as  when ph levels are below  calcite generally will not provide enough ph correction and that is where corosex comes into use corosex causes aggressive ph correction in these low ph conditions corosex can overcorrect ph so it must be used with caution generally we start with a media tank with  lbs of calcite then add corosex in small amounts of  lbs at a time until the ideal ph level is reached when the water sits with little or no flow for extended period corosex even in small quantites can overcorrect which is why we use so little media specialty medias specialty medias are used for a variety
