politico media politico media facebook twitter google  email print some digital first media titles  digitalfirstmediacom what are they thinking apollos acquisition of digital first media share on facebook share on twitter apollo global management has almost won its twohorse race with cerberus capital management to acquire digital first media’s  daily newspapers and more than  nondailies or as dfm likes to put it “ multiplatform products reach  million americans each month across  states” the two private equity companies emerged in january as the only two likely bidders for the whole company as i reported then in capital “cerberus apollo bidding for digital first media” and reaffirmed in february as apollo moved ahead by at least a nose “ken doctor’s media notebook digital first media sale nears end”story continued below apollo by far the bigger of two firms with  billion assets under management compared to cerberus’  billion is now finalizing its acquisition and its financing or as reuters put it monday “in advanced talks” i’ve confirmed through confidential sources that apollo is indeed closer to getting the deal done and that the purchase price would come around  million an announcement may still come before the end of the quarter or if not soon thereafter the sale will set a larger stage as newspapers as diverse as the new york daily news and ut san diego test their value in the beleaguered newspaper property marketplace the long sales process decided upon by dfm’s owners more than a year ago and finally made public last fall fulfills dfm ceo john paton’s goal of finding a single buyer for the company that goal met with much skepticism including mine means that dfm will move from control of one private equity owner alden global capital to another yet  offers quite differing digital transformation challenges than those faced by alden and paton as they consolidated ownership control and management over the last five years consequently apollo’s answer to the question of what’s next for the muchcut and consolidated properties is the key one and one at this point on which we know only bare outlines apollo believes it can bring new strategic thinking – straddling the worlds of print and digital better than most current newspaper owners  to this deal those newspapers’ communities readers staffs and merchants await signals on the impact of that thinking they’ll have to wait well into  to hear the first clues expect a closing of the sale to take three to six months if the purchase price finalizes at  million that will work out to a multiple in the neighborhood of  as complicating pools of assets are sorted out both gannett and stephens media have been partners of dfm and its predecessor companies especially medianews group those pooled assets arising from partnerships in california pennsylvania and texas mean divided ownership stakes essentially those two companies will cash out one way or another on the approximate  million of dfm’s annual ebitda to which they can stake claims that leaves approximately  million in ebitda which alden a  owner and its other partners will be paid at an approximate  multiple is it a good deal that’s a question for this transitioning digital age as a multiple it’s at the lower end of what alden and paton hoped to get print advertising declines in the high single digits – ones experienced by all papers of significant size  made relentless mush of the argument that the dfm papers were turning a corner in their bids to become more profitably “digitalfirst” “digitalfirst” of course was paton’s battle cry early on as he first took over management of smaller postbankrupt journal register company and then larger postbankrupt media news and then after still another bankruptcy merged the two into the official digital first media company in december  those inside the company over the years both give the ceo credit for real change and for a talent for selfpromotion that exceeded his real lasting accomplishments in the end as paton moves of out the ceo role allowing him to enjoy his board seats at the guardian prisa and el pais he takes pride in assembling a singular company that could be sold to a singular buyer at a price acceptable to his employers largely alden consider dfm at least a feat of financial engineering the dfm that apollo would inherit though is not a stellar business model for the us or western newspapercentric industry while in some digitalforward areas it may have done better than its peers in others it has fared worse now apollo  and the execs it chooses to take over the management reins – must sort through the diverse parts of this odd assemblage of farflung metro paper and community paper company a company i’ve likened more to an odd dr seuss assemblage that a logical enterprise a smart capitalist would put together apollo executed deep due diligence but will still face early decisions on where the bright management lights are to be found within the company and which of dfm’s centralizing technologies should be kept and which replaced most importantly apollo faces translating its theory of acquisition into a turnaround strategy the hallmark of the company apollo takes on a set of assets that has maintained profit margin by years of cutting slicing of costs staffing and of course product for all of its digitalfirst positioning the company’s mobile products stand out as laggards for instance don’t expect apollo to continue the process of just taking out costs to maintain nearterm profit throughout due diligence confidential sources confirm the company along with competitor cerberus has shown an increasingly keen understanding of the company’s – and larger industry’s – woes consequently look for apollo to take a longerterm view of investment expense and expected revenue return its time horizon likely runs five to seven years within that time frame the world including its readers and advertisers migrates increasingly digital over time that will mean less reliance on print but it’s the pathway that will count apollo as a private owner could add to its own wellturned turnaround playbook it could borrow as much from the strategies of jeff bezos john henry and glen taylor as those deeppocketed private owners have opted to reinvest in their print and digital products at the washington post boston globe and minneapolis startribune respectively it would be overly optimistic for dfm’s communities readers and journalists from san jose to denver to el paso to saint paul to pontiac to new haven to expect a revival of community journalism in their hometowns at best they may see targeted investments to shore up wobbly products and bring the inaptly named dfm more fully into the digital age they could see days of printing cut as advance publications has done all options will be on the table as the overriding goal of financial buyers is gamed how to increase value toward an exit post

stage company   notes to condensed financial statements september     on september   apollo acquisition corporation the company was formed in the cayman islands with the objective to acquire or merge with an operating business the companys formation and administrative costs of  were financed through the issuance of  shares of ordinary shares at par value of  per share for consideration of  together with a payable to the founders of    at september   the company had not yet commenced operations all activity from september   date of inception through september   relates to the companys formation the company selected june  as its fiscal yearend   the company based on its proposed business activities is a blank check company the securities and exchange commission defines such a company as a development stage company as it either has no specific business plan or purpose or has indicated that its business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies or other entity or person and has issued penny stock as defined in rule a under the securities exchange act of  many states have enacted statutes rules and regulations limiting the sale of securities of blank check companies in their respective jurisdictions management does not intend to undertake any efforts to cause a market to develop in its securities either debt or equity until the company concludes a business combination with an operating entity   the company was organized to acquire a target company or business seeking the perceived advantages of being a publiclyheld company and to a lesser extent that desires to employ the companys funds in its business the companys principal business objective for the next  months and beyond will be to achieve longterm growth potential through a business combination rather than shortterm earnings the company will not restrict its potential candidate target companies to any specific business industry or geographical location the analysis of new business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of the officers and directors of the company   note   summary of significant accounting policies   interim financial information   the financial statements included herein which have not been audited pursuant to the rules and regulations of the securities and exchange commission reflect all adjustments which in the opinion of management are necessary for a fair presentation of financial position results of operations and cash flows for the interim periods on a basis consistent with the annual audited statements all such adjustments are of a normal recurring nature the results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results that may be expected for any other interim period or for a full year certain information accounting policies and footnote disclosures normally included in consolidated financial statements prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america have been omitted pursuant to such rules and regulations although we believe that the disclosures are adequate to make the information presented not misleading these financial statements should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements included in our form  for the year ended june   filed with the securities and exchange commission on november     basis of presentation   these financial statements are presented on the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united state of america whereby revenues are recognized in the period earned and expenses when incurred the company also follows the accounting guidelines for accounting for and reporting in development stage enterprise in preparing its financial statements              note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   statement of cash flows   for purposes of the statement of cash flows we consider all highly liquid investments ie investments which when purchased have original maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   loss per ordinary share   basic loss per ordinary share is based on the weighted effect of ordinary shares issued and outstanding and is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average shares outstanding during the period  diluted loss per ordinary share is calculated by dividing net loss by the weighted average number of ordinary shares used in the basic loss per share calculation plus the number of ordinary shares that would be issued assuming exercise or conversion of all potentially dilutive ordinary shares outstanding  the company does not present diluted earnings per share for years in which it incurred net losses as the effect is antidilutive     at september   and june   there were no potentially dilutive ordinary shares outstanding   on march   the company consolidated the authorized ordinary share capital of the company from  ordinary shares of  par value each to  ordinary shares of  par value each this resulted in every shareholder as of march   receiving  ordinary shares for every ordinary share previously held  this was treated as a stock split for us gaap purposes and all share and per share data is presented as if the consolidation took place as of the date of inception september    on march   the company also consolidated the authorized preference share capital of the company from  preference shares of  par value each to  preference shares of    par value   income taxes   apollo acquisition corporation was registered as an exempted company in the cayman islands and therefore is not subject to cayman island income taxes for  years from the date of inception  while the company has no intention of conducting any business activities in the united states the company would be subject to united states income taxes based on such activities that would occur in the united states   the company accounts for income taxes using the liability method whereby deferred tax asset and liability account balances are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse  in assessing the realization of deferred tax assets management considers whether it is likely that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will be realized  the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company attaining future taxable income during periods in which those temporary differences become deductible                note   summary of significant accounting policies continued   fair value of financial instruments   our financial instruments consist of accounts payable and payables to an affiliate we believe the fair value of our payables reflects their carrying amounts   in  the fasb issued new guidance relating to the measurement and disclosure of financial assets and liabilities  this guidance established a framework for measuring fair value in gaap and clarified the definition of fair value within that framework this guidance does not require assets and liabilities that were previously recorded at cost to be recorded at fair value or for assets and liabilities that are already required to be disclosed at fair value this guidance introduced or reiterated a number of key concepts which form the foundation of the fair value measurement appro apollo acquisition corp company profile  bloomberg feedback apollo acquisition corp private company

generally use the words “believes” “expects” “intends” “plans” “anticipates” “likely” “will” and similar expressions to identify forwardlooking statements such forwardlooking statements including those concerning our expectations involve risks uncertainties and other factors some of which are beyond our control which may cause our actual results performance or achievements or industry results to be materially different from any future results performance or achievements expressed or implied by such forwardlooking statements the risks uncertainties and factors that could cause our results to differ materially from our expectations and beliefs include but are not limited to those factors set forth in this annual report on form k under “item a  risk factors” below as well as the following   · changes in laws or regulations affecting our operations   · changes in our business tactics or strategies   · acquisitions of new operations   · changing market forces or contingencies that necessitate in our judgment changes in our plans strategy or tactics and   · fluctuations in the investment markets or interest rates which might materially affect our operations or financial condition   we cannot assure you that the expectations or beliefs reflected in these forwardlooking statements will prove correct we undertake no obligation to publicly update or revise any forwardlooking statements whether as a result of new information future events or otherwise you are cautioned not to unduly rely on such forwardlooking statements when evaluating the information presented in this annual report on form k   all references in this annual report to the “company” “apollo” “we” “us” or “our” are to apollo acquisition corporation              item  business   general   we are a development stage company formed under the laws of the cayman islands on september   solely for the purpose of identifying and entering into a business combination with a privately held business or company domiciled and operating in an emerging market that is seeking the advantages of being a publicly held corporation whose stock is eventually traded on a major united states stock exchange we intend to focus on targets located primarily in asia south america and eastern europe as we believe that businesses with operating history and growth potential in these locations would benefit significantly from access to the united states capital markets and may offer the potential of capital appreciation stemming from the economic growth in such emerging markets   plan of operation   we have not engaged in any business activities that generate revenue our activities to date have been primarily focused upon raising capital we have conducted private offerings of our ordinary shares the proceeds of which we use for payment of costs associated with accounting and auditing fees legal fees identifying acquisition targets and completing necessary due diligence in addition we incur costs related to filing periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission    we believe we will be able to meet these costs for at least the next  months by obtaining loans from our shareholders management or other investors   we may consider a business which has recently commenced operations is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets is seeking to develop a new product or service or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering   narrative description of business   although we have not identified or entered into any agreements with a potential target business to date we intend to focus on targets located primarily in asia south america and eastern europe as we believe that businesses with operating history and growth potential in these locations could benefit significantly from access to the united states capital markets and may offer the potential of capital appreciation stemming from economic growth in such emerging markets   the analysis of business opportunities will be undertaken by or under the supervision of our officer and directors who will have a large amount of flexibility in seeking analyzing and participating in potential business opportunities in our efforts to analyze potential acquisition targets we will consider the following kinds of factors   · potential for growth indicated by new technology anticipated market expansion or new products   · competitive position as compared to other firms of similar size and experience within the industry segment as well as within the industry as a whole   · strength and diversity of management either in place or scheduled for recruitment     · capital requirements and anticipated availability of required funds   · the extent to which the business opportunity can be advanced   · the accessibility of required management expertise personnel raw materials services professional assistance and other required items and   · other relevant factors            in applying the foregoing criteria no one of which will be controlling management will attempt to analyze all factors and circumstances and make a determination based upon reasonable investigative measures and available data potentially available business opportunities may occur in many different industries and at various stages of development all of which will make the task of comparative investigation and analysis of such business opportunities extremely difficult and complex if necessary we will retain third party consultants to aid us in our evaluation of potential targets provided that we have the necessary capital available   we anticipate that the selection of a business combination will be complex and extremely risky in addition we believe that as a result of general economic conditions shortages of available capital the attractiveness of obtaining access to united states capital markets and the perceived benefits of becoming a publicly traded company that there may be numerous firms seeking business combination partners such as ourselves thus adding to the complexity     competition   in identifying evaluating and selecting a target business we may encounter intense competition from other entities having a business objective similar to ours there are numerous blank check companies that have gone public in the united states that have significant financial resources that are seeking to carry out a business plan similar to our business plan furthermore there are a number of additional blank check companies that are still in the registration process or are about to file registration statements both under the securities and exchange act and under the securities act additionally we may be subject to competition from other companies looking to expand their operations through the acquisition of a target business many of these entities are well established and have extensive experience identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates many of these competitors possess greater technical human and other resources than us and our financial resources will be relatively limited when contrasted with those of many of these competitors   while we believe there may be numerous potential target businesses that we could acquire with our currently available funds our ability to compete in acquiring certain sizable target businesses will be limited by our available financial resources this inherent competitive limitation gives others an advantage in pursuing the acquisition of a target business   our management believes however that our status as a reporting entity and potential access to the united states public equity markets may give us a competitive advantage over privatelyheld entities having a similar business objective as ours in acquiring a target business with significant growth potential on favorable terms we also believe that because we are incorporated in the cayman islands we may be attractive from a tax perspective to potential targets operating outside of the united states as the majority of nonoperating companies that are seeking reverse merger candidates are incorporated in the united states which potentially adds an additional layer of taxation   further if we succeed in effecting a business combination there will be in all likelihood intense competition from competitors of the target business we cannot assure you that subsequent to a business combination we will have the resources or ability to compete effectively   forms of acquisition   the structure of a potential business combination either through an acquisition or a merger will depend upon a number of factors including the nature of the target entity’s ownership structure its business structure and the relative negotiating strengths of the parties to the transaction it is our intention to structure a business combination so that the consideration we offer the owners of the target company consists primarily of ordinary shares such a structure provides the benefit of conserving our capital but has the potential drawback of resulting in our current shareholders no longer having control of a majority of our voting ordinary shares following such a transaction   if a business combination is structured as an acquisition we may be able to structure the transaction so that the vote or approval by our shareholders is not required if a business combination is structured as merger then we may be required to call a shareholders meeting and obtain the approval of the holders of a majority of the outstanding ordinary shares the necessity to obtain such shareholder approval may result in delay and additional expense in the consummation of any proposed transaction and may also give rise to certain appraisal rights to dissenting shareholders accordingly we will seek to structure any such transaction so as not to require shareholder approval            we currently anticipate that we will be able to effect only one business combination due primarily to our limited financing and the dilution of interest for present and prospective shareholders which is likely to occur if we offer our ordinary shares to obtain a target business this lack of diversification should be considered a substantial risk in investing in us because it will not permit us to offset potential losses from one venture against gains from another   employees   we presently have no employees apart from our officers our officers are engaged in outside business activities and anticipate that they will devote to our business very limited time until the acquisition of a successful business opportunity has been identified we expect no significant changes in the number of our employees other than such changes if any incident to a business combination   we intend to hire additional management and other support personnel when we have reached a point in our proposed growth that would allow for such employment in the interim we will rely upon consultants to assist us in identifying and investigating acquisition opportunities   enforceability of civil liabilities     we are incorporated in the cayman islands because our management believes that incorporation in the cayman islands offer a number of benefits including but not limited to the following   · political and economic stability   · an effective judicial system   · a favorable tax system   · the absence of exchange control or currency restrictions and   · the availability of professional and support services   however certain disadvantages accompany incorporation in the cayman islands these disadvantages include   · a less developed body of securities laws as compared to the united states and significantly less protection to investors and   · cayman islands companies may not have standing to sue before the federal courts of the united states   we have been advised that there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the cayman islands would   · recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state in the united states or   · entertain original actions brought in the cayman islands or china against us or our directors or officers predicated upon the securities laws of the united states or any state in the united states   we have been advised that a final and conclusive judgment in the federal or state courts of the united states under which a sum of money is payable other than a sum payable in respect of taxes fines penalties or similar charges may be subject to enforcement proceedings as a debt in the courts of the cayman islands under the common law doctrine of obligation   reports to security holders   we are required to file annual quarterly and current reports and other information with the sec you may read and copy any reports statement or other information that we file with the sec at the secs public reference room at  f street ne washington dc  please call the sec at   for further information on the public reference room these sec filings are also available to the public from commercial document retrieval services and at the internet site maintained by the sec at httpwwwsecgov             item a risk factors   an investment in our ordinary shares involves a high degree of risk you should carefully consider the following risk factors before deciding to invest in our company if any of the following risks actually occur our business financial condition results of operations and prospects for growth would likely suffer as a result you may lose all or part of your investment in our company   we are a development stage company with no operating history and accordingly you will not have any basis on which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective   because we are a recently formed development stage company with no operations andor functions to date you will have no basis upon which to evaluate our ability to achieve our business objective which is to acquire an operating business we have not conducted any negotiations regarding acquisitions and we have no current plans arrangements or understandings with any prospective acquisition candidates   we are dependent on the ability of management to locate attract and effectuate a suitable acquisition candidate management intends to devote only a limited amount of time to seeking a target company   the nature of our operations is highly speculative and there is a consequent risk of loss of your investment the success of our plan of operation will depend to a great extent on the operations financial condition and management of an identified business opportunity we cannot assure you that we will be successful in locating candidates with established operating histories in the event we complete a business combination with a privately held company the success of our operations may be dependent upon management of the successor firm and numerous other factors beyond our control while seeking a business combination management anticipates devoting no more than a few hours per week to the company’s affairs our officers have not entered into written employment agreements with us and are not expected to do so in the foreseeable future this limited commitment may adversely impact our ability to identify and consummate a successful business combination   there is no public market for our ordinary shares   there is no public trading market for our ordinary shares and none is expected to develop unless and until among other things we complete an acquisition file a selling shareholder registration statement under the securities act and such ordinary shares are accepted for trading on a trading medium in the united states the occurrence of any of which no assurances can be given when if or ever   because of our limited resources and intense competition for private companies suitable for an acquisition of the type contemplated by management we may not be able to consummate an acquisition on suitable terms if at all   we expect to encounter intense competition from other entities having business objectives similar to ours the highly competitive market for the small number of business opportunities could reduce the likelihood of consummating a successful business combination many of the entities that we will be in competition with are well established and have extensive experience in identifying and effecting business combinations directly or through affiliates a large number of established and wellfinanced entities including small public companies and venture capital firms are active in mergers and acquisitions of companies that may be desirable target candidates for us nearly all these entities have significantly greater financial resources technical expertise and managerial capabilities than we do consequently we will be at a competitive disadvantage in identifying possible business opportunities and successfully completing a business combination these competitive factors may reduce the likelihood of our identifying and consummating a successful business combination   we have no agreements for a business combination or other transaction   we have no arrangement agreement or understanding with respect to engaging in a merger with joint venture with or acquisition of a private or public entity no assurances can be given that we will successfully identify and evaluate suitable business opportunities or that we will conclude a business combination management has not identified any particular industry or specific business within an industry for evaluation we cannot guarantee that we will be able to negotiate a business combination on favorable terms and there is consequently a risk that funds allocated to the purchase of our shares will not be invested in a company with active business operations            management intends to devote only a limited amount of time to seeking a target company which may adversely impact our ability to identify a suitable acquisition candidate   while seeking a business combination management anticipates devoting no more than a few hours per week to the companys affairs in total our officer has not entered into a written employment agreement with us and is not expected to do so in the foreseeable future this limited commitment may adversely impact our ability to identify and consummate a successful business combination   the time and cost of preparing a private company to become a public reporting company may preclude us from entering into a merger or acquisition with the most attractive private companies   target companies that fail to comply with sec reporting requirements may delay or preclude acquisition sections  and d of the exchange act require reporting companies to provide certain information about significant acquisitions including certified financial statements for the company acquired covering one two or three years depending on the relative size of the acquisition the time and additional costs that may be incurred by some target entities to prepare these statements may significantly delay or essentially preclude consummation of an acquisition otherwise suitable acquisition prospects that do not have or are unable to obtain the required audited statements may be inappropriate for acquisition so long as the reporting requirements of the exchange act are applicable   our business will have no revenues unless and until we merge with or acquire an operating business   we are a development stage company and have had no revenues from operations we may not realize any revenues unless and until we successfully merge with or acquire an operating business further we anticipate that the investigation of specific business opportunities and the negotiation drafting and execution of relevant agreements disclosure documents and other instruments will require substantial management time and attention require the expenditure of significant financial resources if we decide not to participate in a specific business opportunity or if we fail to consummate a business combination the costs incurred by us related to a transaction may result in the loss of the related costs incurred   we may require additional funds in order to operate a business that we acquire   any target business that is selected may be a financially unstable company or an entity in its early stages of development or growth including entities without established records of sales or earnings in that event we will be subject to numerous risks inherent in the business and operations of financially unstable and early stage or potential emerging growth companies in addition we may effect a business combination with an entity in an industry characterized by a high level of risk and although our management will endeavor to evaluate the risks inherent in a particular target business there can be no assurance that we will properly ascertain or assess all significant risks if we obtain a business that requires additional capital that we cannot provide it could have a material adverse effect on our business and could result in the loss of your entire investment   we expect to issue additional ordinary shares in a merger or acquisition which will result in substantial dilution   our memorandum of association authorizes the issuance of a maximum of  ordinary shares any merger or acquisition effected by us may result in the issuance of additional securities without shareholder approval and may result in substantial dilution in the percentage of our ordinary shares held by our then existing shareholders   we have not conducted any market research or identified business opportunities which may affect our ability to identify a business to merge with or acquire   we have neither conducted nor have others made available to us results of market research concerning prospective business opportunities therefore we have no assurances that market demand exists for a merger or acquisition as contemplated by us our management has not identified any specific business combination or other transactions for formal evaluation by us such that it may be expected that any such target business or transaction will present such a level of risk that conventional private or public offerings of securities or conventional bank financing will not be available there is no assurance that we will be able to acquire a business opportunity on terms favorable to us decisions as to which business opportunity to participate in will be unilaterally made by our management which may act without the consent vote or approval of our shareholders            we cannot assure you that following a business combination with an operating business our ordinary shares will be listed on nasdaq or any other securities exchange   following a business combination we may seek the listing of our ordinary shares on nasdaq or another stock exchange however we cannot assure you that following such a transaction we will be able to meet the initial listing standards of either of those or any other stock exchange or that we will be able to maintain a listing of our ordinary shares on either of those or any other stock exchange after completing a business combination until our ordinary shares are listed on the nasdaq or another stock exchange we expect that our ordinary shares would be eligible to trade on the otc bulletin board another overthecounter quotation system or on the “pink sheets” where our shareholders may find it more difficult to dispose of shares or obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of our ordinary shares in addition we would be subject to an sec rule that if it failed to meet the criteria set forth in such rule imposes various practice requirements on brokerdealers who sell securities governed by the rule to persons other than established customers and accredited investors consequently such rule may deter brokerdealers from recommending or selling our ordinary shares which may further affect its liquidity this would also make it more difficult for us to raise additional capital following a business combination   our shareholders may face different considerations in protecting their interests because we are incorporated under cayman islands law   our corporate affairs are governed by our memorandum and articles of association by the companies law as revised of the cayman islands and the common law of the cayman islands the rights of shareholders to take action against our directors actions by minority shareholders and the fiduciary responsibilities of our directors to us under cayman islands law are to a large extent governed by the common law of cayman islands the common law in the cayman islands is derived in part from comparatively limited judicial precedent in the cayman islands and from english common law the decisions of whose courts are of persuasive authority but are not binding on a court in the cayman islands cayman islands law relating to the right of shareholders and the fiduciary duties of our directors may not be as established and may differ from provision under statutes or judicial precedent in existence in jurisdictions in the united states as a result our public shareholders may have more difficulty in protecting their interests in actions against the management directors or our controlling shareholders than would shareholders of a corporation incorporated in a jurisdiction in the united states   judgments against us may be difficult or impossible to enforce in foreign jurisdictions   we are a cayman islands company and a substantial majority of our assets are located outside the us in addition a majority of our directors and officers reside outside the us as a result it may not be possible to effect service of process within the us upon such persons including with respect to matters arising under us or foreign securities or other applicable laws there is uncertainty as to whether the courts of the cayman islands hong kong or china would recognize or enforce judgments of united states courts obtained against us or such persons based upon the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or be competent to hear original actions based upon these laws in addition any judgments obtained in the us against us including judgments predicated on the civil liability provisions of the securities laws of the united states or any state thereof may be not collectible within the us moreover china does not have treaties providing for the reciprocal recognition and enforcement of judgments of courts within the us japan or most western countries hong kong has no arrangement for the reciprocal enforcement of judgments within the us as a result if you intend to enforce a judgment obtained in the us against our assets located outside the us such judgment may be subject to reexamination of the merits of the action by a foreign court and face additional procedures and other difficulties which would not be required for enforcement of such judgment in the us enforcing such judgments may be difficult or impossible   if we effect a business combination with a company located outside of the united states we would be subject to a variety of additional risks that may negatively impact our operations   we intend to effect a business combination with a company located outside of the united states if we do so we could be subject to special considerations andor risks associated with companies operating in the target business’ home jurisdiction including any of the following   · rules and regulations or currency conversion or corporate withholding taxes on individuals   · tariffs and trade barriers   · regulations related to customs and importexport matters   · longer payment cycles            · tax issues such as tax law changes and variations in tax laws as compared to the united states   · currency fluctuations   · challenges in collecting accounts receivable   · cultural and language differences and   · employment regulations   we cannot assure you that we would be able to adequately address these additional risks if we were unable to do so our operations and those of the business that we acquired could be materially adversely affected   if we effect a business combination with a company located outside of the united states the laws applicable to such company will likely govern all of our material agreements and we may not be able to enforce our legal rights   if we effect a business combination with a company located outside of the united states the laws of the country in which such company operates will govern almost all of the material agreements relating to its operations we cannot assure you that the target business will be able to enforce any of its material agreements or that remedies will be available in this new jurisdiction the system of laws and the enforcement of existing laws in such jurisdiction may not be as certain in implementation and interpretation as in the united states the inability to enforce or obtain a remedy under any of our future agreements could result in a significant loss of business business opportunities or capital additionally if we acquire a company located outside of the united states it is likely that substantially all of our assets would be located outside of the united states and some of our officers and directors might reside outside of the united states as a result it may not be possible for investors in the united states to enforce their legal rights to effect service of process upon our directors or officers or to enforce judgments of united states courts predicated upon civil liabilities and criminal penalties of our directors and officers under federal securities laws   authorization of preference shares   our memorandum of association authorizes the issuance of up to  preference shares with designations rights and preferences determined from time to time by our board of directors accordingly our board of directors is empowered without shareholder approval to issue preference shares with dividend liquidation conversion voting or other rights which could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of our ordinary shares in the event of issuance the preference shares could be utilized under certain circumstances as a method of discouraging delaying or preventing a change in control of our company although we have no present intention to issue any preference shares we cannot assure you that we will not do so in the future   we may become a passive foreign investment company which could result in adverse us federal income tax consequences to us investors   based on the nature of our business we do not expect to be a passive foreign investment company or pfic for us federal income tax purposes for our current taxable year however whether or not we are a pfic for any taxable year will be based in part on the character of our income and assets and the value of our assets from time to time which will be based in part on the trading price of our ordinary shares once they commence trading which may be volatile accordingly it is possible that we may be a pfic for any taxable year if we were treated as a pfic for any taxable year during which a us investor held an ordinary share certain adverse us federal income tax consequences could apply to the us investor   if we effect a business combination with a united states corporation we could face adverse tax effects under the united states tax laws   although we currently intend to focus on asia south america and eastern europe for potential business combination targets if we were to effect a business combination with a us corporation such a combination could subject us to potentially adverse tax effects as a result of changes made to the us internal revenue code of  as amended by the american jobs creation act of  relating to the treatment of domestic business entities which expatriate from the united states to a foreign jurisdiction these new provisions generally apply to the direct or indirect acquisition of substantially all of the properties of a domestic enterprise by a foreign corporation if there is at least  or  of continuing share ownership in the successor foreign entity by the former stockholders of the us corporation and substantial business activities are not conducted in the jurisdiction in which such successor is created or organized in the event we effected a business combination with a us corporation and were subsequently subject to these new rules it could cause us to lose certain tax benefits which could make the transaction more expensive to us which could have an adverse effect on our operations            if we are deemed to be a controlled foreign corporation or cfc we may be subject to certain us income tax risks associated with the cfc rules under the us internal revenue code of  as amended   we will be considered a cfc for any year in which our united states shareholders that each own directly indirectly or by attribution at least  of our voting shares each a “ us holder” together own more than  of the total combined voting power of all classes of our voting shares or more than  of the total value of our shares if we were classified as a cfc such classification would have many complex results one of which is that if you are a  us holder on the last day of our taxable year you will be required to recognize as ordinary income your pro rata share of certain of our income including both ordinary earnings and capital gains for the taxable year whether or not you receive any distributions on your ordinary shares during that taxable year   if we are deemed to be a cfc in the future these rules would then apply to holders of our ordinary shares accordingly us persons should consider the possible application of the cfc rules before making an investment in our ordinary shares   item b unresolved staff comments   none   item  properties   we do not own or rent any property we utilize the office space and equipment of our officers and directors at no cost   item  legal proceedings   we know of no material active or pending legal proceedings against us nor are we involved as a plaintiff in any material proceedings or pending litigation there are no proceedings in which any of our directors officers or affiliates or any beneficial shareholder are an adverse party or has a material interest adverse to us   item  mine safety disclosures   not applicable   part ii     item  market for registrant’s common equity related stockholder matters  and issuer purchases of equity securities   market information   our ordinary shares have not been listed for trading on the otc bulletin board or on any stock exchange and we do not anticipate applying for listing on any exchange until after such time that we have completed a business acquisition   holders   as of september   there were approximately  record holders of  ordinary shares   dividends   we have not paid any cash dividends to date and we do not anticipate or contemplate paying dividends in the foreseeable future it is the present intention of management to utilize available funds for development of our business   recent sales of unregistered securities   we did not sell any unregistered securities during the fiscal year ended june     securities authorized for issuance under equity compensation plans   as of june   we had no securities authorized under equity compensation plans and we do not intend to have an equity compensation plan prior to the completion of a business combination            purchases of equity securities by the issuer and affiliated purchasers   none   item  selected financial data   we are a smaller reporting company as defined by rule b of the securities exchange act of  and are not required to provide the information under this item   item  management’s discussion and analysis  of financial condition and results of operations   disclosure regarding forward looking statements   statements other than historical facts contained in this annual report on form k including statements of potential acquisitions and our strategies plans and objectives are forwardlooking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act and section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act although we believe that our forward looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions we caution that such statements are subject to a wide range of risks trends and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected among those risks trends and uncertainties are important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements including but not limited to the effect of existing and future laws governmental regulations and the political and economic climate of the united states the effect of derivative activities and conditions in the capital markets we undertake no duty to update or revise these forwardlooking statements   when used in this form k the words expect anticipate intend plan believe seek estimate and similar expressions are intended to identify forwardlooking statements although not all forwardlooking statements contain these identifying words because these forwardlooking statements involve risks and uncertainties actual results could differ materially from those expressed or implied by these forwardlooking statements for a number of important reasons   general   we are a development stage company formed solely for the purpose of identifying and entering into a business combination with a privately held business or company domiciled and operating in an emerging market that is seeking the advantages of being a publicly held corporation whose stock is eventually traded on a major united states stock exchange we intend to focus on targets located primarily in asia south america and eastern europe as we believe that businesses with operating history and growth potential in these locations would benefit significantly from access to the united states capital markets and may offer the potential of capital appreciation stemming from the economic growth in such emerging markets   plan of operation   we have not engaged in any business activities that generate revenue our activities to date have been primarily focused upon raising capital we have conducted private offerings of our ordinary shares the proceeds of which we intend to use for payment of costs associated with accounting and auditing fees legal fees identifying acquisition targets and completing necessary due diligence in addition we incur costs related to filing periodic reports with the securities and exchange commission we believe we will be able to meet these costs for at least the next  months by obtaining loans from our shareholders management or other investors   we may consider a business which has recently commenced operations is a developing company in need of additional funds for expansion into new products or markets is seeking to develop a new product or service or is an established business which may be experiencing financial or operating difficulties and is in need of additional capital in the alternative a business combination may involve the acquisition of or merger with a company which does not need substantial additional capital but which desires to establish a public trading market for its shares while avoiding among other things the time delays significant expense and loss of voting control which may occur in a public offering            results of operations   year ended june   compared to year ended june     operating expenses   because we currently do not have any business operations we have not had any revenues during the period of inception through june   total expenses for the year ended june   decreased from  for the year ended june   to  for the year ended june   the primary reason for this decrease was a decrease in professional fees related to legal and auditing service   liquidity and capital resources   as of june   we have a cash balance of  the company is actively pursuing merger opportunities as described in the “general” section of management’s discussion and analysis   assuming we do not complete a business combination we anticipate needing approximately  in order to effectively execute our business plan over the next  months if we are unable to raise the funds we will seek alternative financing through means such as borrowings from institutions or private individuals there can be no assurance that we will be able to keep costs from being more than these estimated amounts or that we will be able to raise such funds we expect that we will seek additional financing in the future however we may not be able to obtain additional capital or generate sufficient revenues to fund our operations if we are unsuccessful at raising sufficient funds for whatever reason to fund our operations we may be forced to seek a buyer for our business or another entity with which we could create a joint venture if all of these alternatives fail we expect that we will be required to seek protection from creditors under applicable bankruptcy laws   our independent auditor has expressed doubt about our ability to continue as a going
