golden eagle ranch the property we acquired separate parcels of golden eagle ranch a mature permanent crop farm in stanislaus county california in march  and august  for a combined purchase price of approximately  million on august   we acquired a second farm of  gross acres and  tillable acres of almonds which has been aggregated with golden eagle as of the date of this prospectus golden eagle ranch consists of  gross acres with  tillable acres planted with young and mature almonds we hold golden eagle ranch in fee simple through our wholly owned subsidiary arnold ca llc on june   edwards lien  toso inc an accredited rural appraiser concluded that the market value of the property was  million prior to the recent acquisition relying most heavily on the income capitalization approach to valuation golden eagle ranch was planted over a period of time to create a sustainable almond orchard with replanting originally scheduled to begin after the  harvest however due to a nutrient program utilized by the current tenant and high almond prices we have delayed replanting until after the  harvest demand generators and competition while the mature permanent crop farmland tenant base for nut crops in the region is still developing we expect a competitive tenant environment to develop for this property type and believe there is a strong market already in place for direct operations as well as associated services including harvesting processing hulling shelling and packaging warehousing marketing and shipping and there are numerous vertically integrated corporations that currently farm almonds and are highly qualified to farm the property as tenants additionally since june  more than  million almond trees were sold by california nurseries a  increase on amount of trees sold from the prior year of the sold trees roughly  were used to replant an orchard  were used to replace trees in existing orchards and the remaining  were sold for new plantings the increased trees and acreage demonstrates grower confidence in the longterm growth of the almond industry especially as growers shift more acreage into almond production which we believe will generate increased leasing demand for this farm currently california produces  of the worlds almond supply additionally almond prices have been steadily increasing over the past few years both overseas and domestically as almonds are being incorporated into more products ie nutrition bars and almond milk operating and occupancy information six months ended year ended december  june       occupancy         na rental revenue         na total leased acreage     na rent per leased acre         na  farm was acquired in two tranches during   based on percentage of tillable acres currently leased  property has been subject to a crop share lease based on gross revenues and starting with the  crop season is now subject to a flexible lease with base and participating components there was no base rent in the leases from  to  crop share lease amounts are largely delayed in revenue recognition as almonds sold from the farm are largely sold in the year following harvest for this reason there is a large increase from  to  year ended december   is more representative of our future expectations kingfisher ranch the property we acquired a contiguous tract of land kingfisher ranch which is a mature permanent crop farm in fresno county california on august   for a purchase price of approximately  million kingfisher ranch consists of  gross acres with  tillable acres planted with young and mature pistachios we hold kingfisher ranch in fee simple through our wholly owned subsidiary warren ca llc demand generators and competition the united states is the largest supplier of pistachios and more than  of us pistachios are produced in california according to usda data demand stems from international markets who have an increasing appetite for nuts including pistachios as well as domestically as major pistachio producers and the american pistachio growers association have been proactively marketing pistachios to increase awarenesss and appeal while the mature permanent crop farmland tenant base for nut crops in the region is still developing we expect a competitive tenant environment to develop for this property type and believe there is a strong market already in place for direct operations as well as associated services including harvesting processing hulling shelling and packaging warehousing marketing and shipping and there are numerous vertically integrated corporations that are currently farm almonds and are highly qualified to farm the property as tenants operating and occupancy information kingfisher ranch was acquired on august   and was not leased prior to acquisition therefore there is no rental revenue occupancy or leased acreage information available or applicable for the period presented subsequent to the acquisition a five year flexible lease including a base rent component and a flexible rent component was put in place on the  of the  tillable acres that are currently planted with mature pistachio trees the remaining  acres are planted with young trees and will be

leland ca llc demand generators and competition while the mature permanent crop farmland tenant base for nut crops in the region is still developing we expect a competitive tenant environment to develop for this property type and believe there is a strong market already in place for direct operations as well as associated services including harvesting processing hulling shelling and packaging warehousing marketing and shipping additionally current usda estimates for  california walnut production represent a record level of growth as mild weather during the growing season benefitted production and allowed for an early harvest and a higher quality crop walnut shipments for the new  crop season are weaker than the prior season due to a decrease in exports to asia slightly offset by an increase in exports to europe however domestic shipments have increased we believe that increased production of walnuts and the quality of the crops will generate increased leasing demand for this

generators and competition kane county farms is a commodity row crop farm located in a premier cornproducing area of illinois for which there is an established and highly competitive tenant market continued global growth in population and consumer income and the demand for biofuels eg ethanol from corn and the increasing need for feed for livestock as well as the location and highquality soils

rental revenue           total leased acreage      rent per leased acre            farm was acquired during  and we assumed existing leases  based on percentage of tillable acres currently leased  subject to a fixed lease  appraisal net acreage totals may differ slightly from tillable acreage totals stated in leases and are rounded  the activity of identifying completing and realizing attractive acquisitions of farmland is highly competitive and we are competing for investment opportunities with many other real estate and farmland investors including real estate and farmland funds individual and institutional investors public and private real estate companies and reits developers municipalities and financial institutions however identifying and acquiring high quality farms of the size we acquire in prime growing regions is more difficult and we feel our and our agricultural subadvisers deep and local relationships provide unique access to offmarket opportunities giving us a strong competitive advantage other investment firms that we might compete directly against could include agricultural investment firms such as hancock agricultural investment group ubs agrivest llc westchester agricultural asset management a tiaa—cref company these firms engage in the acquisition asset management valuation and disposition of farms in our local markets we believe that the locations of our farms as well as the overall quality and attractiveness of our individual farms including their access to adequate water supplies and superior soil quality and suitability for crop type enable us to compete effectively for tenants because our revenue potential may be linked to the success of our tenants depending on the particular lease structure in place we may indirectly share exposure to the same competitive factors that our tenants experience in their respective markets when trying to sell their harvest while our tenants do not typically compete with particular farms or farmers oversupply of a particular crop or a decrease in exports for such crop resulting from increased yields from other farmers both domestically and internationally may affect the prices of our tenants crops company description we are an internally managed real estate company that owns a diversified portfolio of highquality farmland consisting of mature permanent specialtyvegetable row and
