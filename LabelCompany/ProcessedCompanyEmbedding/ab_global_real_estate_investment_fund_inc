day to day so investments may lose value interest rate risk as interest rates rise bond prices fall and vice versa―longterm securities tend to rise and fall more than shortterm securities the values of mortgagerelated and assetbacked securities are particularly sensitive to changes in interest rates due to prepayment risk credit risk a bond’s credit rating reflects the issuer’s ability to make timely payments of interest or principal―the lower the rating the higher the risk of default if the issuer’s financial strength deteriorates the issuer’s rating may be lowered and the bond’s value may decline foreign nonus risk nonus securities may be more volatile because of political regulatory market and economic uncertainties associated with such securities fluctuations in currency exchange rates may negatively affect the value of the investment or reduce returns these risks are magnified in emerging or developing markets leverage risk trying to enhance investment returns by borrowing money or using other leverage tools―magnify both gains and losses resulting in greater volatility reit risk investments in real estate can decline due to a variety of factors affecting the real estate market such as economic conditions mortgage rates and availability reits may have additional risks due to limited diversification and the impact of tax law changes derivatives risk investing in
