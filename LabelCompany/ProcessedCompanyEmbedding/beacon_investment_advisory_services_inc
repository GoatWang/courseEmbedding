hampered in some families manage your wealth find a financial advisor branch and private wealth advisor near you enter zipcode go invalid zipcode some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education  at the same time children are entering their ’s with student loan debt which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home even grandparents have modified life goals choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now rather than leaving a larger legacy later in short paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern but with a little advance planning families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college  the growing cost of education according to the college boards latest “trends in higher education report the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes financial aid and many

director morgan stanley wealth management investment solutions it takes a village to raise a child but in  it may take an extended family to educate one tweet this share this on linkedin share this on facebook email this one option says dextraze is for parents to start saving early with a  college savings plan  “having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans he says for the child “having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals as opposed to the college that offers the most aid and graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom named after section  of the internal revenue code a  plan is a taxadvantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save or even pay in advance for college expenses earnings in a  plan can be tax deferred and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition fees room and board and supplies many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that making education a family affair motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education grandparents relatives and even family friends have also begun creating  accounts in a child’s name not only do  plans offer potential tax advantages they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt “today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college says jennifer tierney vice president morgan stanley wealth management investment solutions and  plans product manager “its so important to plan ahead for grandparents aunts and uncles family friends it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that  plans provide to a child and from a taxperspective to themselves” related reading wealth management the real costs of not saving for college wealth management when little geniuses have big dreams wealth management how to break the ice around family finances a flexible way to save and invest for college the appeal of  plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility there are no income restrictions no required minimum distributions no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account and high contribution limits virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child grandchild niece nephew spouse even a friend according to chris stack a managing consultant at savingforcollegecom one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the  account as opposed to a utma uniform transfers to minors act or ugma uniform gifts to minors act account or other strategy “with s grandparents or extended family give themselves an option but not an obligation to apply their funds to help pay college costs he says  another significant benefit of  plans is taxfree compounding “earning on an account’s growth rather than paying taxes on the earnings provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality stack says “having the ability to withdraw the principal and taxdeferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible while as soon as the child is born is ideal he said some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future says dextraze “at the end of the day the idea is to harmonize all of your goals taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there including ks s and others it’s using all of the available tools that’s how you reach your goals” morgan stanley offers many s from some of the nation’s leading mutual fund companies

verbatim transcript parts have been slightly modified to improve readability berkeley capital partners is a registered investment advisor in atlanta georgia chris eddy cfp® partner investment officer berkeley capital partners tony palazzo cfa berkeley capital partners dan newberg cfp® partner chief compliance officer berkeley capital partners video transcript we manage all of the assets of our firm in house we have grown our business through family friends and their referrals and we treat everyone as such choosing to go independent was a conscious decision to get away from having mangers manage us the day we actually all agreed that this is the path we wanted to pursue the major pro was the client and you’re able to do what’s in the best interest of the client and there’s nothing that prevents you from doing your job schwab is agnostic as to how you manage assets they really leave it up to you to do what you think is best for your clients schwab provided a significant amount of resources and had an integral part of our successful transition transitioning a business is never easy it’s never without stress one of our own fears was us being responsible for our own compliance when we moved to schwab they had a team that came in they helped us identify those issues and it turned out to be very helpful communication with the clients relative to the move ended up being significantly easier than any of us expected they said “well do you really think it’s the right thing for me” and we could say unequivocally yes i have the ability to manage money any way that i see fit clients can sense our passion and our excitement about being able to do things we couldn’t do before the clients that were our clients that were entrepreneurs really started referring us more business than they normally had business owners respond to other business owners our firm’s experienced the best growth rate in our history i consider this more than just a business you know we consider it like a large extended family it’s more of a team feel and less of a competitive feel the ultimate goal is just serving the client and everybody will do fine you know if we do that there’s tons of freedom being independent um with the technology you have access to you can work from anywhere and still get great results so the fact that i can do my job wherever i need to be has allowed us to travel more spend more time i try to work from home  to  days maybe  days a month because i now run my own business i have that freedom now to do what i think is best for me and my family don’t focus so much on the fear of the move and the fear of the front end but focus on what you can do on the back end and longterm you know the trajectory will put you on for your customers and for yourself personally we don’t know how it’s gonna all shake out but we do think we’re in a better position to be agile being independent isn’t for everybody you have to have the right business mix but

college has become a toptier life expense alongside other bigticket goals like buying a home and planning for retirement however education costs have now skyrocketed to the extent that saving for both of those life goals—retirement and homebuying—has become hampered in some families manage your wealth find a financial advisor branch and private wealth advisor near you enter zipcode go invalid zipcode some parents are cutting back on retirement savings contributions to help fund their children’s education  at the same time children are entering their ’s with student loan debt which in some cases is delaying the purchase of their first home even grandparents have modified life goals choosing to help grandchildren with education expenses now rather than leaving a larger legacy later in short paying for education has officially become a multigenerational concern but with a little advance planning families can make some savvy moves to help prepare for the costs of college  the growing cost of education according to the college boards latest “trends in higher education report the continued increase in average published tuition and fees at colleges and universities is now outpacing the growth in family incomes financial aid and many consumer goods and services it now costs on average  per year for tuition fees room and board for a fouryear private college assuming a collegecost inflation rate of  today’s yearold child may need  come college time in  “for parents the numberone goal from a financial planning perspective is still retirement but close behind is paying for a child’s education” says marc dextraze executive director morgan stanley wealth management investment solutions it takes a village to raise a child but in  it may take an extended family to educate one tweet this share this on linkedin share this on facebook email this one option says dextraze is for parents to start saving early with a  college savings plan  “having a head start on the costs means less sacrifice later on avoiding the heavy burden of parental loans he says for the child “having all or most of their college funding in place means they have more options like being able to select the college that best fits their interests and goals as opposed to the college that offers the most aid and graduating with less student debt means having the ability to pursue the next chapter of their lives with more financial freedom named after section  of the internal revenue code a  plan is a taxadvantaged savings vehicle which allows you to save or even pay in advance for college expenses earnings in a  plan can be tax deferred and the withdrawals are exempt from federal and state income taxes if you use the funds for qualified expenses such as tuition fees room and board and supplies many states also offer state tax deductions or tax credits on top of that making education a family affair motivated by persistent news headlines about the growing costs of education grandparents relatives and even family friends have also begun creating  accounts in a child’s name not only do  plans offer potential tax advantages they allow the family member or friend to give the gift of education and a young adulthood free from student debt “today it definitely takes a village to send a child to college says jennifer tierney vice president morgan stanley wealth management investment solutions and  plans product manager “its so important to plan ahead for grandparents aunts and uncles family friends it just makes sense to leverage the benefits that  plans provide to a child and from a taxperspective to themselves” related reading wealth management the real costs of not saving for college wealth management when little geniuses have big dreams wealth management how to break the ice around family finances a flexible way to save and invest for college the appeal of  plans may derive from their benefits and flexibility there are no income restrictions no required minimum distributions no limits on the number of accounts the same person or entity can own generally no maximum age limits for establishing an account and high contribution limits virtually anyone can be named a beneficiary—a child grandchild niece nephew spouse even a friend according to chris stack a managing consultant at savingforcollegecom one of the most overlooked benefits is the daily access and liquidity of the  account as opposed to a utma uniform transfers to minors act or ugma uniform gifts to minors act account or other strategy “with s grandparents or extended family give themselves an option but not an obligation to apply their funds to help pay college costs he says  another significant benefit of  plans is taxfree compounding “earning on an account’s growth rather than paying taxes on the earnings provides more funding available in future years when the college costs become a family reality stack says “having the ability to withdraw the principal and taxdeferred earnings without any federal or state income tax liability is a very significant benefit especially when compared to alternative strategies such as using a life insurance policy or a taxable account stack recommends that families start preparing for college costs as early as possible while as soon as the child is born is ideal he said some even “begin with an account in their own name years before their first child is born knowing the designated beneficiary can be changed in the future says dextraze “at the end of the day the idea is to harmonize all of your goals taking whatever tax advantages you can through the various kinds of plans out there including ks s and others it’s using all of the available tools that’s how you reach your goals” morgan stanley offers many

georgia chris eddy cfp® partner investment officer berkeley capital partners tony palazzo cfa berkeley capital partners dan newberg cfp® partner chief compliance officer berkeley capital partners video transcript we manage all of the assets of our firm in house we have grown our business through family friends and their referrals and we treat everyone as such choosing to go independent was a conscious decision to get away from having mangers manage us the day we actually all agreed that this is the path we wanted to pursue the major pro was the client and you’re able to do what’s in the best interest of the client and there’s nothing that prevents you from doing your job schwab is agnostic as to how you manage assets they really leave it up to you to do what you think is best for your clients schwab provided a significant amount of resources and had an integral part of our successful transition transitioning a business is never easy it’s never without stress one of our own fears was us being responsible for our own compliance when we moved to schwab they had a team that came in they helped us identify those issues and it turned out to be very helpful communication with the clients relative to the move ended up being significantly easier than any of us expected they said “well do you really think it’s the right thing for me” and we could say unequivocally yes i have the ability to manage money any way that i see fit clients can sense our passion and our excitement about being able to do things we couldn’t do before the clients that were our clients that were entrepreneurs really started referring us more business than they normally had business owners respond to other business owners our firm’s experienced the best growth rate in our history i consider this more than just a business you know we consider it like a large extended family it’s more of a team feel and less of a competitive feel the ultimate goal is just serving the client and everybody will do fine you know if we do that there’s tons of freedom being independent um with the technology you have access to you can work from anywhere and still get great results so the fact that i can do my job wherever i need to be has allowed us to travel more spend more time i try to work from home  to  days maybe  days a month because i now run my own business i have that freedom now to do what i think is best for me and my family don’t focus so much on the fear of the move and the fear of the front end but focus on what you can do on the back end and longterm you know the trajectory will put you on for your customers and for yourself personally we don’t know how it’s gonna all shake out but we do think we’re in a better position to be agile being independent isn’t for everybody you have to have the right business mix but if you do i think with the way the industry’s changing you should look into it and you should probably look into it as soon as possible important disclosures
