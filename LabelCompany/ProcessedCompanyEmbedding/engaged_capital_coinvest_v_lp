for election to the board of rentacenter engaged capital has lost confidence in rcii board’s willingness to fulfill its fiduciary duty and independently identify the optimal riskadjusted strategy to restore value to rcii shareholders reiterates call for rcii board to hire a financial advisor and immediately initiate a strategic alternatives process to evaluate a sale of the entire company engaged capital is concerned that the current board and management may take actions that would materially harm shareholders formally nominates mitchell e fadel former president and coo of rcii william k ken butler former coo of aan jeffrey j brown carol a mcfate and christopher b hetrick at the upcoming  annual meeting february    am eastern standard time newport beach califbusiness wireengaged capital llc an investment firm specializing in enhancing the value of small and midcap north american equities today sent a letter to the board of directors the “board” of rentacenter inc “rcii” nasdaqrcii formally nominating five highly qualified candidates for election to the board at the company’s upcoming  annual meeting of stockholders glenn w welling managing member of engaged capital llc commented “it is time for change at rcii the current board has presided over years of declining operating performance deteriorating financial results and a decimation of shareholder value despite years of underperformance these same directors refuse to act with a sense of urgency to explore all alternatives to create value for the owners of the company as one of the company’s largest shareholders we felt we had no choice but to present shareholders with an alternative slate of directors – directors who can help stabilize the business while also evaluating all strategic options available to the company we are pleased that we were able to attract two of the most experienced operators in the industry to our slate mitch fadel the former president and coo of rcii and ken butler the former coo of aan both of whom are highly qualified to replace mark speese rcii’s chairman interim ceo and cofounder who is up for election at this years meeting both have the capabilities and handson experience that is sorely missing in rcii’s boardroom today in addition carol mcfate jeff brown and chris hetrick bring decades of financial and transaction experience to the board that is paramount to assessing and taking action on the highest value option for the company’s future we believe it is time shareholders have directors who exhibit an understanding that their job is to act as the fiduciaries of all the company’s shareholders and not just those shares represented in the boardroom” the full text of the letter follows february   board of directorsrentacenter inc headquarters driveplano texas  members of the board engaged capital llc together with its affiliates “engaged capital” has a  economic interest in rentacenter inc “rcii” or the “company” making us one of the company’s largest shareholders as we have expressed numerous times we believe the rcii board of directors the “board” should immediately hire a financial advisor and initiate a strategic alternatives process to evaluate a sale of the entire company before attempting to pursue a risky public turnaround strategy the company’s over  decline in share price from its value above  a little over two years ago is a stark reminder of the need to benchmark the riskadjusted alternatives available to the company as we highlighted in our december   letter we believe the company could command a significant equity premium given the capital structure of the business for example based on yesterday’s closing price of  an acquisition price of  per share would represent a  premium for shareholders yet only a  premium to the company’s enterprise value based on our industry research we are confident there are numerous parties both strategic and financial that would have serious interest in acquiring the company given the history of shareholder value destruction poor operational execution weak corporate governance and reactive management change stubbornly committing to a standalone strategy when other options remain unexplored is simply unacceptable while we appreciate the open dialogue we have had to date with the board we are extremely disappointed by the company’s apparent refusal to address our concerns we believe the recent  share open market purchase by mark speese rcii’s chairman interim ceo and cofounder signals that the board is unlikely to proactively commence a strategic alternatives process in the near future as a consequence of this inaction we have lost confidence in the willingness of the board to fulfill its fiduciary duty and independently identify the optimal riskadjusted strategy to restore value to rcii shareholders our interactions with the board thus far suggest its behavior as a whole may reflect a personal loyalty to mr speese who owns only  of the company at the expense of rcii shareholders this is particularly concerning because we believe mr speese has a significant conflict of interest that could prevent rcii from maximizing value for its shareholders by pursuing a risky turnaround strategy that allows him to retain control of the company he cofounded and to maintain his leadership position mr speese clearly benefits in ways that shareholders whose primary interest is the company’s value do not benefit thus it is imperative for the board to not let the personal interests of one director stand in the way of value creation as we see no evidence that the incumbent board is willing to prioritize the interest of shareholders we believe the board must be reconstituted with new directors who will maintain an unquestionable allegiance to the true owners of the company – the shareholders furthermore we are extremely concerned that mr speese under the cover provided by a group of longtenured and apparently conflicted incumbent directors may materially harm shareholders if he acts to ensure his continued control of the company at any cost these actions include but are not limited to  failing to respond to incoming communications from parties expressing an interest in acquiring the company it is our understanding that mr speese may be employing this strategy so that he can either legitimately tell the board he has not received meaningful approaches from interested parties or to limit his interactions to parties that are in his personal best interest  failing to inform all members of the board of such inbound communications  restructuring the company’s debt in a way that transfers value from equity holders to debt holders effectively acting as an implicit poison pill eg onerous prepayment penalties for wouldbe acquirers mr speese is having discussions with lenders on refinancing alternatives which we are concerned could make rcii less valuable to an acquirer or make an acquisition of the company more difficult  selling a piece of the company while refusing to evaluate a sale of the entire company ultimately damaging the value of the remaining business  diluting current shareholders by placing equity or convertible debt with a “friendly” party to protect the status quo  negotiating a sale of the entire company to a “friendly” party as opposed to running a full and fair process  delaying a formal consideration of strategic alternatives to provide interim management more time to operate the business which despite their best efforts and based upon recent performance could result in a continued worsening of operational performance and a further decline in equity value we are hereby putting each and every director on notice we will use any and all resources at our disposal to ensure that the approximately  of shares outstanding not owned by mr speese are protected from further value destruction more specifically we call on rcii’s six independent directors michael j gade rishi garg jeffrey jackson jv lentell leonard h roberts and stephen l pepper to act objectively in these deliberations and to hold mr speese accountable you are being closely watched by us and the rest of rcii’s shareholder base to be clear we intend to hold each of you personally liable to the fullest extent permitted by law should you continue down a value destructive path and fail to act in the best interests of the company’s shareholders we believe that if you choose to do what is right for the company’s shareholders as is your duty the potential exists to create a significant amount of shareholder value by capturing a large percentage of the “fixed” value of rcii in a sale of the company given our interactions with the company thus far and the concerns highlighted above in this letter we feel we have been left with no choice but to seek significant board change given that five of seven incumbent directors have served on the board for over ten years and two of such directors including mr speese have served on the board for over twenty years we believe this board is stale and needs to be refreshed with new directors we are formally providing the board notice of our nomination of five highly qualified candidates for election to the board at the company’s upcoming  annual meeting of stockholders provided however that we intend to withdraw two of our nominees to the extent that only three seats remain up for election at the meeting we believe these individuals possess the financial operational and strategic acumen the board urgently needs our nominees are

item purpose of transaction item  is hereby amended to add the following on june   engaged capital delivered a letter to the remaining incumbent directors michael j gade rishi garg j v lentell and steven l pepper on the issuer’s board of directors the “board” in the letter engaged capital chronicled how immediately following the conclusion of the june th annual meeting mr pepper who was named as chairman of the board following the ouster of mark e speese informed mr welling that he would be leaving on a twomonth vacation and would be unavailable until august and that there was no need for the new board to convene at any time prior to his return engaged capital expressed great concern that despite the decisive and unequivocal mandate for change that stockholders delivered to the board at the annual meeting the remaining incumbents appear committed to maintaining the status quo and ignoring the will of the issuer’s stockholders engaged capital also expressed its disapproval of the issuer’s continued delay in onboarding the recently elected directors jeffrey j brown mitchell e fadel and christopher b hetrick and reminded the incumbents that they have an obligation to act in stockholders’ best interests – not those of mr speese engaged capital also cautioned the incumbents against establishing an executive committee of the board to conduct business without messrs brown fadel and hetrick or taking any other action to ostracize them engaged capital concluded by making clear that it hopes the incumbents heed the wishes of stockholders and immediately begin working with the newly elected directors however if the incumbents fail to do so engaged capital is fully prepared to utilize all tools at its disposal to protect stockholder value the full text of the letter is attached hereto as exhibit  and is incorporated herein by reference item material to be filed as exhibits item  is hereby amended to add the following exhibit letter to incumbent directors dated june

christopher b hetrick      ex  extodahtm letter to incumbent directors dated june   exhibit        june     by email fax and overnight mail   rentacenter inc  headquarters drive plano texas  attn   steven l pepper chairman of the board   michael j gade director   rishi garg director   j v lentell director   gentlemen   engaged capital llc together with its affiliates “engaged capital” or “we” is the largest stockholder of rentacenter inc “rcii” or the “company” with a  economic exposure to the company we pursued the election contest at the recently completed  annual meeting of stockholders the “annual meeting” to ensure that the best interests of stockholders – the true owners of the company – are appropriately represented in the boardroom   despite the decisive and unequivocal mandate for change that stockholders delivered to the board of directors the “board” at the annual meeting via the resounding election of engaged capital nominees jeffrey j brown mitchell e fadel and christopher b hetrick you the remaining incumbent directors appear committed to maintaining the status quo and ignoring the will of rcii’s stockholders   immediately following the conclusion of the annual meeting steven l pepper who was named as chairman of the board following the ouster of mark e speese informed me that he would be leaving on a twomonth vacation and would be unavailable until august he further informed me that there was no need for the new board to convene at any time prior to his return it is simply unacceptable for the board to shut down for at least a twomonth period in blatant disregard for the outcome of the annual meeting i find it hard to believe that the three other incumbent directors who are not as fortunate as mr pepper to take a vacation for  of the calendar year are also unable to perform their fiduciary duties during this time period i would expect that messrs gade garg and lentell are still working in june july and early august and can together with the newly elected directors begin the process of executing on the mandate that stockholders voted for at the annual meeting   engaged capital campaigned for stockholder friendly corporate governance and a commitment to openly and fairly evaluate all opportunities to enhance stockholder value to find the best path forward for all stockholders the incumbent directors appear to be dragging their feet to frustrate what stockholders overwhelmingly voted for at the annual meeting since the announcement of the preliminary election results we have received numerous inbound inquiries from interested parties and their advisors wondering when the company will finally entertain their calls and hoping that the presence of new directors will expedite the culmination of the strategic review process that stockholders clearly and overwhelmingly voted for at the annual meeting       moreover engaged capital has learned that there has been a delay in the onboarding of the recently elected directors engaged capital recently voluntarily dismissed its claim in delaware against the company without prejudice regarding the manipulation of the record date and certain other matters in connection with the annual meeting despite the dismissal engaged capital has been informed by mr hetrick that rcii has demanded as a condition to his onboarding that he deliver a written acknowledgement from engaged capital stating that neither engaged capital nor any of its affiliates will refile the lawsuit or assert any claims that were the subject of the lawsuit in light of the incumbent board’s actions to date engaged capital must retain maximum flexibility and reserve all of its rights in no way do we expect the onboarding of mr hetrick and the other directors to be held hostage stockholders emphatically elected messrs brown fadel and hetrick at the annual meeting to serve as their fiduciaries – as the stockholders’ chosen representatives they must be seated without delay and treated equally to the other members of the board   further the board must reconstitute the audit  risk compensation nominating  corporate governance and finance committees of the board with the newly elected directors the failure to do so promptly is the height of irresponsibility and leaves the company exposed to serious liability we demand that the reconstituted committees be established by june     further engaged capital is confident that the company’s stockholders will not tolerate any attempts by you the remaining incumbent directors to establish an executive committee of the board to conduct business without messrs brown fadel and hetrick or take any other action to ostracize them given your actions better yet inactions to date we feel compelled to remind you that you owe a fiduciary duty to stockholders…it is your obligation to act in stockholders’ best interests not those of mr speese   it is our sincere hope that you face the reality of the results from the annual meeting and immediately begin working with the newly elected directors to the extent you fail to do so we are fully prepared to utilize all tools available at our disposal to protect stockholder value including initiating legal action against the incumbent directors personally and individually   sincerely     glenn w welling engaged capital llc       elevate your investments try
