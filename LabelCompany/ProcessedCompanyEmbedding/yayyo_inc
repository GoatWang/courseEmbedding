lines  of page  and lines  on page  of the ii complaint herein defendant affirms in part that hurst capital lllp is aprivateequity firm investing predominately in the technology and consumer goods sectors but denies the majority of the facts plaintiff yayyo inc a delaware corporation with its principal place of business in  case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              los angeles california alleges in its complaint that it hired hurst capital lllp a florida limited liability limited partnership in the summer of  to develop create launch and run its mobile applications and website for consumer use business development and marketing in contrary hurst capital lllp was never hired contracted or signed any agreements be that contractor agreements work for hire agreements or any form of employment agreement with yayyo inc or any of its affiliates additionally hurst capital lllp an entity two of the defendants austin hurst and zach hurst jointmanage never signed allondisclosure agreement with yayyo inc or any of its affiliates the only written agreement between defendants austin hurst and zach hurst is a mutual nondisclosure agreement dated june   and signed personally by the defendants austin hurst and zach hurst that agreement included a walkaway clause stating  the plaintiff also alleges that it paid hurst capital lllp approximately  for services to aid yayyo inc in delivering a usable work product yayyo inc founder ramy elbatrawi verbally agreed to provide the defendants austin hurst and zach hurst management level equity in the company in trade for writing the technology plan recruiting contractors with very unique skillsets assisting with the business and financial plans managing the technical teams  that were contracted and providing access to their vast rolodex of relationships all in an effort to help yayyo become profitable there were approximately  individuals contracted by yayyo inc while the defendants austin hurst and zach hurst were actively involved with the company the defendants austin hurst and zach hurst allowed yayyo inc to independently contract the majority of their engineering relationships directly however the defendants austin  hurst and zach hurst paid a few of these individuals invoices directly from hurst capital  case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              lllp for which yayyo inc reimbursed hurst capital lllp dollar for dollar totaling appromately  this reimbursement is in no way considered remuneration for austin hurst or zach hursts material contribution developing yayyo inc including but not limited to hundreds of combined hours of sweat equity and the creation of a proprietary technical plan that yayyo inc used in order to overcome specific market obstacles providing yayyo inc the secret sauce necessary in order to accomplish multioperator rideshare booking through a single app without direct operator api access the defendants austin hurst and zach hurst provided the core material for the business plan that yayyo inc used when securing its upstart capital and also provided yayyo inc with numerous opinions disclosing the execution risk that  would be involved such as yayyos unstable reliance on unofficial rd party application programming interface access merchant liabilities and legal threats from rideshare operators among other concerns the plaintiff alleges that the defendants austin hurst and zach hurst are  at all times relevant to the complaint the plaintiff alleges austin hurst and zach hurst made fraudulent representations to yayyo in order to persuade yayyo to pay hundreds of thousands dollars for work that was either never completed or incapable of being performed as they represented it also alleges austin hurst and zach hurst conspired with their codefendants in this action to defraud yayyo and to steal andor convert approximately  for their collective personal gain and benefit this allegation is beyond frivolous and is presented with  zero merit the plaintiff yayyo inc set forth in its business plan to build the first meta search engine to compare the cost of ride share operators such as uber and lyft as well as manage bookings and rewards through a single app it was made clear by austin hurst to ramy el batrawi yayyo incs founder in their very first meeting that what he was proposing to do was strictly against the terms and conditions of uber and the other ride shaxe operators yayyo inc e case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              would need to function with in order to attract users both austin hurst and zach hurst concluded that in order to successfully deploy the meta type search engine mr elbatrawi was requesting yayyo inc would have to build proprietary software that automatically booked rides on behalf of yayyo users by managing virtual accounts with each operator in those users names similar processes have been successfully executed before by companies such as travelocity hotwire and orbitz prior to having permission from airlines and allowed them to quote and compare the airline service offerings these companies used a process in technology called screenscraping where the computer would download a copy of the travel websites data and publish relevant pieces of it to the aggregator or meta search page the user was viewing in two previous ventures the defendants austin hurst and zach hurst worked with ryan oconnor as well as the other defendants listed in this suit on virtualizationbased software  projects and described to mr elbatrawi that the unique demands of his project would require the very specific virtualization skillset and domain expertise that ryan oconnor and his team possessed inanemail titled additional info for yayyo plan sent to mr elbatrawi on fri jun   at  pm zach hurst submitted additional material for mr elbatrawi to add to the yayyo business plan for mr elbatrawis express purpose of raising capital included was more than a page describing the defendants austin hurst and zach hursts applicable work  history with mr oconnor and a detailed description describing the teams previous failures with virtualization ventures however it also included the line the foundational knowhow necessary to execute on the proposed virtualization goals was acquired by the yayyo engineering team over the course of several years through previous virtualization ventures mr  elbatrawi responded to that email on sat jun   at  am stating i would really shorten the virtualization experience section and remove the negative out of it the  case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                             austin hurst and zach hurst made overwhelming efforts to disclose all of the risks associated with the yayyo business model and expected that mr elbatrawi would be similarly forthcoming with his shareholders since other meta search websites in the airline and hotel industries had not been shut down mr elbatrawi was confident that a metasearch engine in ridesharing would not be shut down either mr elbatrawi believed that uber and other large operators would negotiate official deals with yayyo inc as soon as yayyo inc proved traction in a copy of the business plan sent to austin hurst on june   at  am pdt by mr elbatrawi it was published under risks that we may be unable to maintain or establish relationships with providers which could limit the information we are able to provide to users and that ridesharing providers choose to reduce or even eliminate the fees they pay our financial performance could be materially adversely affected in a copy of the business plan  sent to austin hurst and zach hurst on sat jul   at  am mr elbatrawi published under revenue model that with critical mass yayyo intends to gain the necessary negotiating leverage to demand referral fees in the beginning each trip will be processed at a loss accounting for merchant fees and general operating considerations such as compute and bandwidth costs these expenses will initially be slated as marketing with forecasted roi resulting from rebates and future localized offer arbitrage initiatives mr elbatrawi was so confident in the strategy that he asked the defendants austin hurst and zach hurst to create a preregistration website offering two free ride credits to every new yayyo user and granularly  track referral codes for the marketing initiatives yayyo inc was running including cable television advertisements while the defendants austin and zach hurst were actively involved with yayyo inc mr elbatrawis marketing campaigns resulted in over  preregistered users all of which were promised two free ride credits with uber and lyft mr elbatrawi  case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              was extremely confident that upon launch a significant number of the preregistered yayyo users would redeem theix free ride credits enmass and create volumes of immediate transaction activity with both uber and lyft that could not be ignored by either operator hence creating the perfect case for an official uber and lyft partnership with yayyo inc mr elbatrawi also believed that because uber and lyft were reportedly spending upwards of  per user on  customer acquisition at that time the capital markets would also support yayyos freeride credit strategy and aggressive marketing expense forecast for that reason mr elbatrawi was convinced that yayyos reliance on unofficial connections into uber and other operators services would merely be a temporary dependency and that he could raise s of million of dollars once the app was live in the app store and negotiate direct deals what the defendants austin and zach hurst proposed to mr elbatrawi was not only possible but was successfully accomplished by their teams per the requirements set forth in fact mr oconnor successfully deployed a prototype version of the app that booked a ride with a third party rideshare operator as proposed meeting the rigorous launch deadline for yayyos beta required that uber did not change their systems or infrastructure as a means of disrupting the connection between the yayyo technology and the uber technology several times during the development process uber in fact did change their systems disrupting the connection beriveen the uber app and the yayyo technology this in addition to various other unforeseen development hurdles such as numerous changeovers with merchant providers naturally created development delays for yayyo the entire project scope drastically expanded several times throughout the user experience design userinterface prototyping and user story development phases as well as upon i new updates to uber or lyfts respective apps the defendants austin hurst and zach hurst vehemently deny any allegations that they or their teams were incapable of completing the  case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              project in fact mr elbatrawi had several third party technology consultants interview ryan oconnor before ever contracting him communicated directly with ryan regarding change order requests and fully understood the risks involved every step of the way on numerous occasions mr elbatrawi broke the chain of command and communicated directly with contractors that were under the direction of the defendants austin hurst and zach hurst which eventually caused internal confusion developmental delays and three weeks of unnecessarily expensed hours across the design and frontend programming deparhnents if anyone is to blame or development delays at yayyo inc it is mr elbatrawi for gross mismanagement and general incompetency the complaint of fraudulent representation is baseless and therefore unwarranted answering the allegations of page  paragraph  lines  of the complaint herein  defendant affirms in part that mr oconnor was hired by yayyo but denies that he conspired with his codefendants to defraud yayyo or steal andor convert approximately  for defendants collective personal gain and benefit answering the allegations of pages  paragraph

answering the allegations of page  paragraph  lines  of the complaint herein  defendant denies that fictitiously named defendants caused damages to yayyo answering the allegations of pages  and  paragraphs  lines  on page  and lines  on page  of the complaint herein defendant denies all claims the plaintiff alleges  the defendants austin hurst and zach hurst were hurst capitals alter egos the plaintiff is  informed and believes and on that basis alleges that there was a commingling of funds or other  assets identical equitable ownership inadequate capitalization disregard of corporate formalities and a lack of segregation of corporate records as among austin zach and hurst capital hurst capital lllp is a florida based limited liability limited partnership established and incorporated on apri  following a company operating agreement prepared and executed on april   hurst capital lllp has  managing partners and  limited partners s case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              hurst capital lllp is based out of its florida office located at  gulf dr suite  holmes beach fl  per the terms of the hurst capital lllp operating agreement the defendants austin  zach hurst jointly hold all equitable interests in hurst capital lllp and from time to time the lllp makes investments in companies in a verbal contract the defendants austin hurst  zach hurst asked plaintiff to assign the yayyo partnership equity to hurst capital lllp to follow the strict guidelines set forth in their own partnership agreement hurst capital lllp maintains its corporate records and justly operates as a limited liability limited partnership in the state of florida the plaintiffs effort to pierce the corporate veil of hurst capital by making allegations of every legal possibility is completely frivolous unwarranted and without merit i answering the allegations of pages  paragraphs  of the complaint herein defendant denies all claims the primary allegation states mr elbatrawi during mid june  acting on yayyos behalf met with austin hurst who was representing hurst capital lllp at the w hotel in hollywood through way of a mutual acquaintance he met with austin in an effort to fmd a company to hire to build his mobile and web applications mr elbatrawi alleges that after sharing his idea austin jumped at the chance also continuing that austin claimed through hurst capital he and his brother had successfully built and launched numerous mobile applications such as celebvidy austin spoke highly of his team in miami insisted that he along with zach and hurst capital were experts in the field and promised that they could build an application and website that performed exactly how mr elbatrawi envisioned the meeting took place on june   at the w hollywood contrary to these allegations austin did not jump at the chance in fact austin was very vocal about the risks involved in violating ubers terms of service and confidently presented to mr elbatrawi in front of the mutual  case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              acquaintance his concern mr elbatrawi was very bullish in not worrying about a lawsuit saying if i generate them millions in revenue day one they will not shut me down only embraa me not once in the initial meeting did austin speak about his team in florida he merely indicated one possible way of accomplishing it would be to use android powered virtual machines running the uber app and build software that mimicked finger taps when someone pressed the same commands on the yayyo app he was very clear that he needed to consult some advisors and experts before coming back to mr elbatrawi austin never promoted any experience launching numerous mobile applications mr elbatrawi actually didnt ask austin about his background in the meeting if that information was presented then it was by way of their mutual acquaintance who mr elbatrawi spent a considerable amount of time with prior to the start of the meeting the app mr elbatrawi mentions in this complaint is celebvidy while working on yayyo austin and zach were very vocal with mr ebatrawi regarding the state of celebvidys platform development and the fact that it was not complete yet in fact any delay to yayyos development timeline could threatened austin and zachs attention to celebvidy as well as their vested interest in yayyo as well as other ventures mr elbatrawi indicated austin and zach would make so much money from yayyo they need not to worry about celebvidy and showed absolutely zero interest in hearing the celebvidy business plan or acknowledging austin  zachs fiduciary duty to complete the project as such while working in partnership with mr elbatrawi to design and build yayyo austin  zach contributed what little hours they had remaining to their other holdings celebvidy included in the june nd meeting austin made no indication to mr elbatrawi he could or had the teams in place to do what mr elbatrawi was requesting and needed to consult some advisors and experts before coming back to him in an email sent by mr elbatrawi to austin hurst zach hurst mr  case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              oconnor and two other technical team members on sun sep   at  pm mr el batrawi stated i looked and our teams and i find that everyone on them is amazing the talent is undeniably there austin and zack put together something special when they pull all of you together every team lead by ryan shadi cris desire even the small teams that austin put together for the website are great austin and zach are more like me big thinkers and dealmakers and can see the big picture and this is not the only thing they are working on as they pointed out a few times when i approached them they were not sitting on their hands they were working on  other projects so the technical side of project management is not what they able to do at this time the complaint continues austin stated that hurst capital could complete the project by september is and that it wotilc cost yayyo  s  for both the website and the mobile application that worked on both the apple and andyoid platforms the september st delivery date was nothing more than an optimistic dream stated numerous times over by mr elbatrawi mr elbatrawi actually reference several times a book called think and grow rich where a select passage taught him to give himself and others unrealistic timelines therefore hethey were motivated to work hard every day knowing that they most likely wouldnt achieve the goal but would be much further along than if his deadline was later this is a philosophy mr elbatrawi preached to not only the defendants but anyone who came into his office he kept copies of the books to hand out to individuals he chose to gift them to austin never saw eyetoeye with mr elbatrawi on this delivery date saying numerous time over a  day track that to develop a full working app was beyond crazy it would take a perfect world scenario where there were zero setbacks the entire way mr elbatrawi continued to say september  to everyone even when it was clear to him that was never going to happen in the  case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              initial meeting austin threw out a ballpark figure of  to develop a website mobile app iosandroid and tech plan based on a full stack single engineer working on the whole project before making a final assessment austin made it clear to mr elbatrawi he needed to do some technical discovery and due diligence to make sure what they were proposing was even possible it wasnt until this discovery was complete that austin could make an accurate assessment the project would move forward the complaint continues within a couple of weeks of the fast meeting mr elbatrawi had a second meeting with hurst capital this time both austin and zach attended they met at cafe in beverly hills california and further discussed a potential deal between yayyo and  hurst capital in which hurst capital would create develop and finalize yayyos website and mobile applications june   mr elbatrawi did not have a meeting with hurst capital he had a meeting with austin and zach hurst the purpose of the meeting was to come to terms on their  partnership in this meeting mr elbatrawi asked austin directly what he would like in terms of equity austin suggested the following terms  founders equity in the company mr el  batrawi also indicated that his partner henrich bari would be receiving °a it was clear to  austin and zach at this time mr elbatrawi was willing to dilute up to  of the company and keep for himself austin asked mr elbatrawi how the company was structured and mr el  batrawi indicated he had a special llc structure where  of the company belonged to the  founders and  belonged to the investors investors would receive all their principle back first from net profit and then all proceeds following would be split paripassu among the founders investors the way the llc was structured the founders could never be diluted from their  this sounded like an appealing structure at the worst outcome austin  zach would own   case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              of the company which at the diluted value would be  of the entire llc this verbal agreement was in place and austin requested paperwork documenting it never did austin  zach agree they would or hurst capital would create develop and finalize yayyos website and mobile applications in fact austin only indicated he would introduce mr elbatrawi to developers that could handle the task the complaint continues again austin represented that they meaning he zach hurst capital and them team  could unequivocally create a website and mobile application that could accomplish exactly that my ezbatrawi envisioned zach also spoke throughout the meeting confirming too that hurst capital and their teams were experts in coding developing software and programming both austin and zach represented that they were capable of developing code and programming that could access realtime pricing offered by all nide sltaying and private ride services such as uber and lyft austin and zach speccally guaranteed theyhad the knowhow and technology experience to accomplish the speck prod mr elbatrawi explained never did austin or zach indicated hurst capital was a software development company or was to be hired by yayyo nor did austin and zach refer to the engineersprogrammersdevelopers as their team these were all independent contractors with real world jobs that did not actively work with or directly for austin and zach austin and zach agreed to becoming founding equity partners in yayyo llc in trade for the sweat equity of planning recruiting and leading teams down a critical path of development in trade for a verbal contract and a extremely aggressive artificial deadline austin and zach went immediately to work identifying highly qualified individuals axound the country all with specific skillsets deemed necessary by not only austin and zach but also mr elbatrawi in accomplishing the  case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              job mr elbatrawi had austins first hire do numerous phone and slcype driven interviews with people mr elbatrawi trusted to be experts in technology to further validate his resume and wherewithal mr elbatrawi did not hire hurst capital austin or zach hurst at any point it was a partnership from the start in this meeting austin made it very clear a technical discovery would have to be completed to validate the theories being tossed around in respect of how to accomplish the tasks he was also very clear no one he put mr elbatrawi on the phone with would consult for that many hours for free mr elbatrawi said money was not a problem he also indicated in that meeting he was raising  for the company austin made it clear to mr elbatrawi he did not believe mr elbatrawi could raise money from any sophisticated investors without the technical discovery complete a business plan and a financial plan in place he suggested to mr elbatrawi everything needed to get to that next stage the complaint continues when discussing the cost austin and zach represented that the price would be somewhere between  s  to   they were clear that the cost would never exceed   this statement was made without any technical discovery or research to reveal the complexity of the task moving forward and cannot be taken as fact additionally when mr el batrawi met the potential engineering hires the remaining defendants on this complaint it was made clear their hourly rates number of hours needed per work week and provided a detailed breakdown of costs well exceeding the  figure mr elbatrawi chose to move forward with them as independent contractors pay them directly communicate with them directly and receive all invoices and related statements regarding hours worked and when payments were duf austin and zach were never cced on these communications this was a direct relationship between the other defendants and mr elbatrawi austin merely facilitated an introduction  case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              the complaint continues soon thereafter austin and zach insastec that mr elbatrawi meet them team of developers and technology staff in flonida they claimed mr elbatrawi would be impressed with their team and that this meeting would solidify huyst capital as the right company for yayyo s job austin shared with mr elbatrawi a research report completed by  group out of san francisco validating ryan oconnors competency in virtual machines austin also shared with mr elbatrawi that he met mr oconnor after mr oconnor was executively recruited to become the head of engineering at a tampa based tech company austin  zach were customers of austin indicated to mr elbatrawi not only has someone else already burdened the expense of an executive recruiter but this assembled team was the best in their field that field being software virtualization and what mr elbatrawi was trying to do required experts in said field never did austin or zach represent mr oconnor was an employee part of an active team or that hurst capital was a software development company looking for work austin  zach hurst are  equity parhiers with mr elbatrawi who owns the majority of the company and henric bari who owns  in the startup company yayyo llc the complaint continues mr elbatrawi obliged their request and traveled to florida to meet hurst capitals team mr elbatrawi met with austin and oconna at a yestaurant around orland florida he spent time once again discussing the intricacies of the pyoduct yayyo envisioned mr elbatrawi specifically discussed the fact that yayyo needed to be able to access realtime accurate pyicing options available to the public via all ridesharing and pyivate ride applications so that they could offer these prices to the consumer mr elbatrawi emphasized that the pricing needed to be correct and updated to reflect exactly what the pyices and options were available to a customer at any given time foy any yide sought my elbatawi  case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id   also discussed that yayyos product needed to interface with these rideshaping and pyivate ride  applications such as uber and lyft so that its cicstomeys could book rides with these caryiers  through yayyos application austin emphatically confirmed that hurst capitals team  absolutely could accomplish these objectives oconnoy also specifically represented that he   along with hurst capitals team could accomplish these objectives austin and oconnor  discussed various technology avenues available to achieve these product features they touted g their experience in this industry and insisted these were completely accomplishable objections  never once did austin zach or oconnoy ever state verbally or in writing that it wozrld be impossible for them to build the product yayyo wanted to bring to market to the contrary they   assuyed mr elbatrawi that they could make yayyos vision areality and that they could do sc  by september isfor no more than    mr elbatrawi demanded an in person meeting with mr oconnor and requested austin  book a flight with his identical itinerary mr elbatrawi never referred to mr oconnor as austins team neither mr oconnor or austin referred to hurst capital as a software   g company specifically responsible for the delivery of the product mr elbatrawi was very aware  mr oconnor had a full time job and was a potential recruit for a position as engineer mr el  batrawi and austin hurst flew to miami international airport where mr elbatrawi rented a car  and the two of them drove to west palm beach where oconnor would meet them at a restaurant halfway inbetween his house and the hotel mr elbatrawi was staying at in the  meeting mr oconnor made it clear to mr elbatrawi that as an engineer he and his colleagues   like to break things down and figure out how they work therefore this job would be a fun one to  do mr oconnors response when mr elbatrawi would ask him if he was capable of making i  work was always ill figure it out mr elbatrawi complimented him numerous times on the   case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              response saying he liked that attitude never did oconnor agree to a deliverable date and laughed every time mr elbatrawi said so you can get it done by september  he simply said i can try my best mr elbatrawi worked hard to convince mr oconnor to quit his job and come work full time for yayyo in california he even went as far as showing mr oconnor a real estate listing on zillow of amultimillion dollar home he said he would purchase for oconnor if he moved austin always disclosed the risks associated with reliance on third party vendors the company had no contracts with furthermore emphasizing the fact it could bring forth legal action as well as legislative troubles mr elbatrawi removed all disclosures of risk from the business plan drafts before forwarding it on to potential investors against austin  zachs insistence on keeping them in there mr elbatrawi called austins attitude negative and would not let him come to meetings with potential investors austin was afraid there would  be disclosure violations in the fundraising effort but mr elbatrawi assured him it was all above board and he knew what he was doing hurst capital wasnever mentioned in any conversations related to being contracted hired assigned etc nor are there any contracts of such a relationship contrary to the allegations in the complaint a total price for the development of the project was never discussed during the initial dinner in west palm beach with mr oconnor this discussion would take place the following morning in mr elbatrawis hotel room in mr elbatrawis hotel room mr oconnor discussed his rates with mr elbatrawi it was mr oconnors personal hourly rate as well as the rates of the individuals mr oconnor suggested were necessary in order to accomplish different tasks associated with the backend development and engineering of the platform mr elbatrawi asked him if he could get the project finished by september  in which mr oconnor laughed again and said thats really aggressive and probably wont happen mr elbatrawi offered mr oconnor and his team  case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              bonuses for finishing on time in the meeting he told mr oconnor was told that if he finished by september st he would receive a bonus check for both him and every member of his team but that amount would reduce incrementally if he delivered the product in october november or december if the product took longer to produce there would be no bonus oconnor verbally agreed and said they would do their best to get the job completed oconnor also asked austin during the meeting who was in charge of the frontend development of the application to which austin indicated he had a team in mind but were not ready for them yet later austin would hire shadi fares to handle frontend development and work with oconnor to connect it via api endpoints to the backend the complaint continues following these meetings in reliance on austins zachs and oconnors express yepresentations yayyo entered into an agreement with hurst capital to build yayyos website and mobile applications and to have both fully complete and operational by septemberl  in exchange foy compensation not to exceed   mr elbatrawis claims are patently false and no such agreement exists either verbally written with hurst capital the verbal agreement on june   with henrich bari as witness was that austin  zach hurst would receive founders equity in the company henrich bari would receive  austin and zach hurst are partners in yayyo llc now yayyo inc not employees not contractors the complaint continues yayyo relied on austins zachs and oconnors representations to its detriment among other things yayyo solicited funding from vanious investors spent   on marketing materials and profnotional spots openations and made deals with various investoys and third parties to yaise further capital and generate market interest in yayyos pyoduct unfortunately for yayyo it tuyned out that austins zachs and s case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                             oconnors representations were false that it was impossible fon hurst capital to provide the deliverables as promised and that the defendants were conspiring all along to defraud yayyo to the tune of   all for their personal gain and benefit mr elbatrawi asked austin and zach hurst to lead the development teams and deploy a ipreregistration website where users could fill out basic information in anticipation of an app launch not only was apreregistration website launched the database collected in excess of  customer records mr elbatrawi never consulted his business partners austin or zach hurst on spending the company money freely and if he spent in excess of  on marketing he did so without their consent austin and zach hurst never had access to the company financial accounts never saw a copy of the operating agreement nor can confirm how much money the company raised and for what percentages any investors in the company subscribed under mr elbatrawis own disclosures mr elbatrawi showed austin an email from a banker in new york city requested information about how yayyo has obtained api access from uber mr elbatrawi showed austin how he avoided the topic in his replies but insisted yayyo needed to get a deal in place so he could respond without omission its austins opinion mr elbatrawi did not disclose risks properly when promoting the investment these allegations are frivolous baseless unwarranted and without merit the complaint continues aftey yayyo hiyed hurst capital and huyst capital s team   which was compnised of defendants  yayyo learned that they had been the victim of a bait and switch it turned out that defendants were utterly incapable of providing the deliverables they promised despite defendants repyesentations and proclamations to the contrary it was actually impossible for them to access realtime continuously updated pricing from available  case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              ridesharing and privateride seyvices in the area this was the key component of yayyos product without it the product was useless defendants were also far fyom the experts they claimed to be in the technology and soflwaye industries they created a website that was fraught with eryors and bugs so much that yayo had to hire a new company to completely retool the website so that it functioned properly defendants work product on the mobile applications was even more useless yayyo did not hire hurst capital yayyos backend engineering team which comprised of all defendants with the exception of hurst capital austin hurst and zach hurst was yayyos team they were all independent contractors who signed agreements individually with mr elbatrawi to work directly for yayyo llc they were paid directly by yayyo llc they reported to mr elbatrawi directly through mr oconnor mr elbatrawi chose to carry communications with mr oconnor directly about the product the features the road map and the progress these conversations took place several hours per day without austin or zach mr elbatrawi never summarized or updated austin or zach in respect to these conversations mr elbatrawi had numerous technology consultants at the highestlevel interview mr oconnor about his experience as well as his objectives on how to accomplish the job mr elbatrawi had a copy of mr oconnors resume as well as the resumes of every team member which he published in the business plans shown to his investors mr elbatrawi was extremely controlling of the process and demanded direct relationships with every member of thf team the plaintiffs claim is impossible foy them to access realtime continuously updated przcing from available ridesharilg and privateride services in the area  this claim has zero merit accessing real time pricing is a feature of both uber and lyfts public apis it requires no hacking of uber and lyft the data the plaintiff is claiming oconnor was unable to access is  case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              publically available to anyone in the world there are several dozen websites on the internet that tap this data to create search tools the key component of yayyos technology was not accessing the pricing of the rides it was being able to book one without leaving the yayyo app and entering the ride share providers app it is clear from the complaint mr elbatrawi does not understand his own product austin and zach hurst contributed the core of the business plan which clearly defines the purpose of the company and what the investors bet on the buggy website mr elbatrawi is referring to is the preregistration page that was developed in offshore india to save mr eibatrawi money it was not recommended by his partners austin  zach hurst to task mr oconnor at his high hourly rate to build a website and austin told mr el batrawi on several occasions the speed and efficiency in which the website was being developed was dependent on the talent level expectancy of offshore resources it was against the better judgment of austin and zach hurst to burn excess company dollars on code that would be scrapped when the product launched clearly mr elbatrawis philosophy of how to spend his investors money differed at the time nir elbatrawi asked austin and zach hurst to allow a product manager with  years of experience in silicon valley take over there was no mobile app mr elbatrawi had worked behind the backs of austin and zach hurst to redesign the entire product from the ground up wasting  days of development time and forcing the front end developer to throw out all of his code whatever code was delivered tuider the leadership of the new product manager and under the obsessive control of mr elbatrawi is in no way a reflection of austin and zach hursts departure on october   these allegations are frivolous baseless unwarranted and without merit the complaint continues over the course of july to octobey  defendants continued to insist that yayyo pay more and mope money in oydey to cover the cost of hiring additional  case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              engineers defendants claimed they needed to hire more andor different people to pnovide the prodicct they initially promised to delivey on september   and for no more than   defendants missed their deliverable deadline and forced yayyo to pay it an additional   throcgh nonstop invoices fog additional engineers and services it insisted were necessary to complete the application the aggressive and artificial deadline of september   forced the defendants to recommend the hires of multiple resourceful teams in parallel against all best practices of technology development the defendants made it clear to mr elbatrawi how traditional technology tracks work and he was told this not only by austin and zach hurst but also by the resources they recommended he hire mr elbatrawi refused to listen to reality and operated from a delusional state of mind mr shadi fares the frontend developer had an extensive background in enterprise app development working for pitney bowes and told mr elbatrawi his deadline was absolutely crazy for the best of the best he created what we referred to as a waterfall effect where all hands were on deck to handle tasks as they presented themselves instead of planning out features and teams waiting for their predecessors to complete jobs the feature list set forth in the initial florida meeting was reduced to  of the total features presented after a month of planning mr elbatrawi saw  of the features and said he wanted them all for launch mr elbatrawi said money wasnt an issue and if we needed more people to get the job done he would pay for them mr elbatrawi had control of the company accounts mr elbatrawi had complete control over how much money was being spent if the  exceeding a budget he concocted was spent his signature will be found on every check no one forced mr ebatrawi to do anything if what mr elbatrawi is saying was accurate it would also be accurate to suggest gross mismanagement of investor funds by mr el z case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              batrawi however not a word of this complaint is accurate these allegations are frivolous baseless unwarranted and without merit the complaint continues some five months and   later yayyo realized it had been duped defendants still did not have a functioning product the work they had claimed to complete was entirely useless and in the end yayyo had absolutely nothing to show for the time and money it spent relying on defendants representations yayyo ultimately had to hire a new team of expeyts to build its pyoduct from scratch on october d  under the threat of legal action for interfering with the new manager austin and zach hurst decided to sit on their equity and focus their time on other business ventures plaintiff instructed all contractors of yayyo that if they communicated or attempted to communicate with austin and zach hurst that they would be sued and that he was preparing a lawsuit against austin and zach hurst following being served papers alongside the other defendants austin was able to speak for the first time to mr oconnor it turns out the product was in fact completed the only portion of the product that was not working had to do with the phone numbers yayyo would need to assign to its users when signing them up on the uber and lyft apps the team contracted by austin and zach hurst to handle the phone numbers were never paid and fired on october rd when mr elbatrawi asked austin and zach to cease their involvement with yayyo it turns out this decision by mr elbatrawi single handedly cost hirn a working product a decision which happened after austin and zach departed their operational roles in the business a decision mr elbatrawi made in haste because he was misinformed about his own company and why each team was hired removing key people without a proper transition plan is a recipe for disaster in any business and mr elbatrawi made this decision under his own authority the plantiff alleges that they had to build the product from  case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              scratch however they are still using the code the repository of source code shows its been forked and is still being accessed and used by yayyo inc yayyo published an app to the itunes app store on december  several days after filing the lawsuits using the code the pre registration website is still active on the yayyocom homepage where they are still using the code it is without a doubt yayyo is not rebuilding a product from scratch just continuing to work with what was already contributed by its contractors these allegations are frivolous baseless unwarranted and without merit the complaint continues to date yayyo is still recovering from the damages defendants causecl its product launch has been delayed it has lost out on millions of dollars in funding and capital investments due to defendants shontcotnings it has lost out on other viable income generating opportunities because it did not have a working product by september  sr as defendants guaranteed yayyo suffered additional out ofpocket losses in increased costs wastec opportunities and money spent on mayketing and zaunch tasks on wednesday september th  at pm the plaintiffs contractor desiree sisneros accidentally attached new design files to an email titled video for site and emailed it to austin hurst at which point austin and zach hurst uncovered a compartmentalized agenda to undermine their work and set the tech development off its planned trajectory austin questioned desirees objectives but she had no valid defense for why austin and zach were out of the loop at pm austin conducted a  hour and  minute conversation with shadi fares trying to understand why all these changes were happening it was pretty obvious he also on several occasions made it clear to the plantiff and desiree that the changes were so drastic he would have to start over in the coming days we spoke to all team members to verify the directives came from the plaintiff mr elbatrawi was paying all contractors directly therefore  case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                               he was their boss they did what he said and did not feel the need to run it by austin and zach for approval on the morning of monday october   mr elbatrawi spoke for  long minutes admitting to a month long internal compartmentalized effort to direct the teams himself as he believed jobs were not being done properly he shortly thereafter asked for austin and zach hurst to stop anything related to yayyo by removing the two key individuals capable of leading yayyos development teams to the finish line the plaintiff is solely responsible for the companys failure due to protecting his own ego pride and enacting a hastily rush to judgment therefore his allegations are frivolous baseless unwarranted and without merit in summary mr elbatrawi the plaintiff admittedly in his claims had no prior substantive experience in the technology or software industries mr elbatrawi needed defendants austin and zach hurst to oversee the technology side of the business this is why he partnered with them mr elbatrawi is trying to erroniously persuade the court defendants hursi capital austin hurst and zach hurst were employees andor contractors hired by his company to provide services when in fact that is far from the truth hurst capital lllp is a equity holder of yayyo llc or the equivalent conversion when the company was changed to yayyo inc with software ventures it is not unusual to acquire what is commonly referred to as technical debt inside of a startup business oftentimes startups hire on marketing and sales teams before the software is fully complete because it is important to develop the brand and prepare the sales materials for the inevitable product launch in these cases the software development teams are further pressured to meet their proposed deadline because if they miss it it could lead to layoffs in other departments across the organization when technical debt presented itself at yayyo marketing efforts were not impacted whatsoever because the strategy was solely focused on preregistering as many users as possible by launch be that in september s case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                               or later sy running several cable television advertisements among other sizable marketing campaigns which drove traffic to the yayyocom landing page asking the defendents to develop an automated referral system which not only credited bonus miles upon new user referrals in a rewards program but also made it incredibly easy fox these incentivized users to share their unique affiliate links by offering two free ride credits for uber and lyft to empower every new user exposing the company to in excess of  in redemption liability that austin and zach hurst are aware of through these programs disregarding opinions regarding legal legislative andor regulatory risks in addition to putting zero restrictions on his pre enrollment signup forms or caps on how many reward miles a new affiliate user could earn mr elbatrawi illustrated without a shadow of a doubt that his companys operational style was consistent with that of a very well capitalized silicon valley startup company and likely was not forthcoming with his shareholders regarding the true reason for the development delays leading to suspicion of misappropriation by falsely placing the blame on the defendants austin hurst and zach hurst with this claim and promoting an absolutely absurd potential for damages to his shareholders mr elbatrawi was able to conceal his own judgements as a ceo namely his inability to properly manage his own companys runway or burndown expectations the wishful thinking and decudions made in a vaccuum left yayyo is an illiquid state presented issues making payroll and eventually resulted in the unjust removal of the defendants austin hurst and zach hurst from their management roles defendants austin hurst and zach hurst are both managing partners of hurst capital lllp where they see aprorata distribution of hurst capitals equitable interest in yayyo inc  case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              the plaintiffs misremembering of key facts should discredit the plaintiff in this case fc example mr elbatrawi could not remember that he requested his only inperson meeting with mr oconnor or where mr elbatrawi travelled to meet mr oconnor mr elbatrawi falsely contends that he hired hurst capital a private equity firm as a software development company and believes his  contractors all locked in legally binding independent contractor agreements paid by yayyo at the sole direction of mr ebatrawi were somehow employees or contractors of hurst capital not some but all claims in general these allegations are fictional at best patently false at worst it should be clear to the court that the plaintiff brought this frivolous baseless unwarranted and without merit claim against the defendants in an effort to more easily promote yayyo to current and new potential shareholders following his previous missteps answering the allegations of pages  paragraphs  of the complaint herein defendant denies all facts the plaintiff alleges hurst capital lllp austin hurst and zach hurst were employees contractors work for hire and contractually obligated to provide services not exceeding  for yayyo inc in the deployment and development of their website is application and android application the plaintiff alleges the defendants misrepresented their capabilities in an effort to bill more hours hire more workers and steal  from the company the plaintiff alleges the defendants delivered no working product or code and the plaintiff is rebuilding their product from scratch the plaintiff alleges the defendants conspired with the other defendants to carry out this plan and keep the company from launching interfering with the plaintiffs economic business interests hurst capital lllp austin hurst and zach hurst axe in fact not employed or contracted by the plaintiff there is no agreement or written representation of such agreement in existence in the company business plan that has  case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                              been shared with investors defendants austin hurst and zach hurst are titled as advisors and consultants and in a verbal agreement with witness on june   the defendants austin  hurst and zach hurst agreed to accept  equitable interest in the company in trade for sweat equity and managing the tech side of the company all of the other contractors signed individual independent contractor agreements several of which were countersigned by austin hurst as an acting officer of yayyo all of the other employees including the other defendants listed were paid by the company directly and not through austin or zach hurst the defendants austin hurst and zach hurst have thousands of combined hours of material contribution to the business including writing the technology plan recruiting contractors with very unique skillsets assisting with the business and financial plans managing the technical teams contracted and providing access to their vast rolodex of relationships only in an effort to help yayyo become profitable on october d  the plaintiff hired a product manager with  years experience to replace the duties fulfilled by austin and zach hurst as business partners austin and zach hurst removed themselves quietly and respectfully from the roles and have made a continued effort not to harm yayyos reputation austin and zach hurst wish only for yayyos to be successful which would inevitably increase the vested value of their sweat equity the claims brought forth in this lawsuit are not only misrepresentative of who the defendants were to yayyo inc they are frivolous baseless unwarranted and without merit s case cvtjhe document  filed  page  of  page id                               dated
