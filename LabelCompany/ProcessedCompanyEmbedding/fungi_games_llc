garnered over  million installs much of my time is now spent acquiring companies  which means that i look at a lot of them while i turn down most investment opportunities i invested in fungi because i was impressed by how they created a novel game with branded content something other companies spend millions of dollars to accomplish alfred has done at high quality with a lean budget dave yonamine founder  chairman of the board at mobilityware fungi advisor  investor the buzz about fungi when alfred first started fungi i immediately recognized in him the same grit and determination i possessed

fung founder of fungi did not take a traditional route into app developmentif app development is even old enough to have a traditional route that is after finishing his undergraduate degree at the

weve even already breached the rankings for top grossing game at  help us create the games you want to play were a tightknit team and we want you to be a part of it building a thriving business is about building great teams i witnessed this when alfred grew his ad agency at mc saatchi and im seeing it firsthand at fungi weve both been in the games industry long enough to know the opportunity hes capturing can only be done with a crew that creates with purpose knows the flow of fun and is passionate about design these are the ideals he holds to himself and those around him and its resulting in truly innovative game content stephen saiz investor  advisor the genesis of fungi and house flip is a story of risk and reward when i first flew to waco texas to pitch chip  joanna gaines i had nothing but my will and a clunky demo funded from my dwindling life savings finding the tables turned with chip pitching me instead i knew our game was something special but it wasn’t enough to create innovative content alone after all there are plenty of great games that land in the app stores unnoticed at fungi we captivate customers in the app stores by partnering with brands which have exceptional alignment with our novel gameplay where chip  jo lift our game and open the doors to their zealous fans fungi grows their brands and unlocks a new audience together our audience heart share amplifies further bonding the love that fans have for chip  joanna as well as for house flip few others create content this way and we aim to become the leader in publishing fun games for growing brands and the irony hasn’t escaped me that we’ve designed a game around the ageold business of real estate speculation the simple concept of buying low and selling high is the very thing that drives who we are as a country to take risks and reap their rewards joining us as an investor isn’t just about game creation it’s a vote to keep the american dream alive much love alfred fung founder

investors more investors details expand all what is fungi fungi designs and publishes games for growing brands we start by creating innovative game designs with a focus on fun and marketability we then publish our games by working with brands and different media outlets to maximize exposure from launch to live operations can you tell us about the game youre working on now we are working on house flip a firstofitskind house flipping game on both mobile and vr platforms in partnering with chip  joanna gaines the stars of hgtvs popular show fixer upper we’re able to leverage their audience which brought in  million viewers last season add to that chip  joanna’s own social media footprint exceeds  million followers and continues to grow everyday we created house flip as a close collaboration with chip  joanna which has allowed us to imbue the game with their industry and design experience with the successes of their show their  best selling book their magazine and all of their home renovation ventures we’ve created a new media channel in a game where players learn about flipping houses the very thing that kickstarted chip  joanna’s first businesses authenticity to their identity is of utmost importance and we’ve worked incredibly hard to become an extension of their brand in fixer upper chip  joanna turn dilapidated but potentialrich houses into showplaces the game that we designed is similar in the sense that you buy a dilapidated house you renovate it and then you flip it at a margin everything is in d so you can evaluate your renovations from every angle as you renovate more houses in the game you unlock new technologies new colors and new materials in the process of learning about the world of renovation our players also unlock new cities with bigger houses and unique architecture part of chip  joanna’s character is a sense of american culture that we wanted to capture in each city by including landmark partners including baylor university in waco texas the nelsonatkins museum in kansas city missouri and the uss midway museum in san diego california instilling americana into our game was essential as it’s one of the things people love about chip  joanna whats the goal of the game what will keep people playing the key is the sense of progression and accomplishment it is doing more and more renovations to see the fruits of your labor choosing which materials and colors with which to renovate allows players to exercise their own sense of design in the process of exercising that aesthetic muscle you unlock more and more choices we make it very accessible because it is in the context of something that a lot of people are already familiar with home renovation and decoration on the business side the element that drives progression is unlocking new cities and architecture plus bigger and more unique homes not only are you unlocking new choices but youre able to touch different types of architecture and see whether or not the technologies you have unlocked look good in those homes collaboration also adds to that progression where players can help their friends’ renovations by visiting their house flips and getting bonuses for being helpful whether you play the game alone or with your friends there’s always more to discover in the everexpansive world of renovation can you describe some of the milestones youve reached weve been in production for about a year now in march we signed contracts with chip  joanna gaines to build the game around their brand our relationship with them has been instrumental not just from an audience perspective but it has opened so many doors in terms of other brands that were integrating into their game like kilz paint and york wallcoverings chip and joanna had such a great experience working with us that they became investors in our seed round were also in talks with habitat for humanity as our impact partner a portion of our profits will go towards building houses not just in america but in developing countries as well another big milestone for us is our great relationship with the application platforms apple and google theyve seen our game and theyre both really excited not just because of the brand but because this is a firstofitskind game we are defining a new genre of game that’s not only beautiful but fun to play as well the most recent development has been creating a media relationship with scripps networks which owns fixer upper and the hgtv network they also own the food network diy and travel channel they have also seen the game and have been highly supportive wed love to promote the game on television so even though were a fledgling publisher well be doing things that only some of the biggest game developers are able to do how much runway do you have as of november  the company had cash in bank of approximately k it is operating with an approximate burn rate of k per month the company has financing in place to fund expenses if needed why will fungi win when you think about where the games industry is right now it continues to see massive amounts of growth and were still in the elbow of its growth curve especially in mobile applications in terms of branded content innovation has always been late as common practice has been to skin a brand on an old game for rerelease essentially replicating the same tired game we’ll win because our focus is on innovative designs that are highly engaging we’ve created a game which will define and own its genre where you not only exercise the business skill of flipping houses but you also exercise the design skill of home renovation we’ll also win because we’re doing something no one else has done packaging a game in a beautiful casual wrapper while introducing what the industry calls ‘midcore game mechanics’ to an audience that is usually accustomed to playing games like candy crush or words with friends delivering a midcore game experience to a casual audience in house flip creates a fun and highlyengaging experience perhaps most importantly fungi also wins because our focus on audience alignment allows us ways to scale our games like few other game developers can chip  joanna’s show fixer upper is the  program on tv for upscale women ages  to  our game from the ground up was built for that very same audience while alignment is key we’re also able to leverage their massive audience which we anticipate will result in millions of downloads why is fungi unique we want to continue making innovative content and we want to create games that allow brands to thrive and continue to grow the ea’s and the kabam’s of the world do it with some of the biggest ip from star wars to marvel likewise we’re creating games as a platform for growing brands to be able to engage with a player base the key word here is “growing” since our games are intended to grow the originating brand and by aligning the game with their audience while basking in that halo effect we end up bringing in other brands further growing the audiences of everyone participating ultimately it is that merging of the game world with the brand world and helping them grow through really fun and innovative game content is what set us apart have you launched what are your measures for success right now we are in private beta that means that we have a build that we are continuously updating for internal testers were right around the corner for soft launch so were on track to submit our build to a couple of small countries in december during that time well basically be looking at  key metrics retention engagement and monetization how often players come back how long players play and if players open their wallets to pay respectively those are the really key pieces when it comes to retention downloads are always a big sign well be looking at our daily active users well be looking at how often they come back whats our day  day  day  day  retention rate how did they compare up against other games in the casual to midcore space well have a good sense by then of how well players are monetizing and we will be able to determine if we are hitting the metrics that we forecasted we forecasted a conservative figure to achieve  million downloads in the first  months that would be in most of the major countries that fixer upper has a presence in what that translates into daily active users in our estimates based on a compounded retention curve pans out to about  daily active users we took a look at what the industry standard is on average revenue per daily active user for a lot of casual titles theyre under  cents then you have the games that are doing really well like the pokemons or the clash royales clash of the clans the candy crushes of the world theyre all over  cents average revenue per daily active user arpdau what we forecast is just a  cent arpdau carrying conservative forecasts skews us more towards the casual space but it also ensures we hit our revenue targets tell us about your strategies for growth it is a combination of things we have the ability to leverage chip  joanna gaines social media footprint over  million followers chip and joanna are also followed by some incredible people but getting exposure to chip  joanna doesn’t stop at owned or earned influencer marketing publishing house flip will carry a truly integrated marketing approach where paid social search and video advertising will amplify any influencer campaign our relationship with scripps networks will also allow us to advertise at scale on hgtv effectively capturing the attention of the very audience we’ve built our game for how do you make money we make money in three ways inapp purchases ingame sponsorships and ingame video advertising our strategy for these three channels is intentional since we know we will attract a variety of different players folks who wish to be more productive or accelerate their renovations will be more inclined to make an inapp purchase whereas folks who wish to grind and play for free will consume more ingame video advertising our focus on a great branded experience also gives players the chance to interact with some of the home renovation industry’s biggest brands such as kilz paint or york wallpaper with house flip being free to download we wanted to make sure that there was a lot of value to play for free while at the same time creating worthwhile moments for our players to make purchases in a game they’ve come to love is the first of many games to come why are you raising now house flip is just our first title we will use the same discipline of creating a truly innovative and marketable game to approach and win other brands though we have already designed two other games we’ll go through the same rigor we did with chip  joanna in our discovery process to ensure we identify and can help grow a growing brand the momentum of getting chip  joanna on board really dictated our focus on leading with our house flipping game as our sole project the nature of the game being in d and highly assetintensive has also turned the game into a high budget title that said the capital we’re raising right now is intended to go entirely towards the production and marketing of house flip even more than just raising money we’re excited to bring on fans of games real estate and chip  joanna as champions for our company and our games what keeps you up at night about the business building the right team having the capital so that we can hire outstanding talent and to continue to make great content so that the copycats cant get at us why are you the ones to make this happen i have been in games since  when i oversaw monetization and user acquisition at a casual game company called mobile deluxe we made solitaire deluxe as well as some of the highest rated slots and hidden object games i then joined mc saatchi where i worked with some of the biggest apps as part of our client base including amazon where i marketed
