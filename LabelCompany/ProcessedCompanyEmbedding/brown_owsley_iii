almost  local employees still makes whiskey in jefferson county and has resisted the impulse to move its headquarters despite what it feels is a tax climate that singles out its industry unfairly mr

dropping out in  when stanley was  he enlisted in the us air force and served for  months before being discharged in  later inspired by a  performance of the bolshoi ballet he studied ballet in los angeles supporting himself for a time as a professional dancer in  he enrolled at the university of california berkeley where he became involved in the psychoactive drug scene he dropped out after a semester took a technical job at kgotv and began producing lsd in a small lab located in the bathroom of a house near campus his makeshift laboratory was raided by police on february   he beat the charges and successfully sued for the return of his equipment the police were looking for methamphetamine but found only lsdcitation needed which was not illegal at the time stanley moved to los angeles to pursue the production of lsd he used his berkeley lab to buy  grams of lysergic acid monohydrate the basis for lsd his first shipment arrived on march   and he produced  hits  micrograms each of lsd by may  then he returned to the bay area in september  stanley became the primary lsd supplier to ken kesey and the merry pranksters by this time sandoz lsd was hard to come by and owsley

members of the grateful dead during  he both financed them and worked with them as their first soundman along with his close friend bob thomas stanley designed the lightning bolt skull logo the lightning bolt design came to him after seeing a similar design on a roadside advertisement one day in the rain i looked out the side and saw a sign along the freeway which was a circle with a white bar across it the top of the circle was orange and the bottom blue i couldnt read the name of the firm and so was just looking at the shape a thought occurred to me if the orange were red and the bar across were a lightning bolt cutting across at an angle then we would have a very nice unique and highly identifiable mark to put on the equipment during his time as the sound engineer for the grateful dead stanley started what became the longterm practice of recording the dead while they rehearsed and performed his initial motivation for creating what he dubbed his sonic journal was to improve his ability to mix the soundcitation needed but the fortuitous result was an extensive trove of recordings from the heyday of the san francisco concertdance scene in the mids in addition to his large archive of dead performances stanley made numerous live recordings of other leading s and s artists appearing in san francisco including quicksilver messenger service jefferson airplane early jefferson starship old and in the way janis joplin big brother and the holding company taj mahal santana miles davis the flying burrito brothers jimi hendrix johnny cash and blue cheer richmond

cargill stanleys girlfriend and a skilled chemist introduced to stanley by susan cowper a former girlfriend set up a lab in the basement the point richmond lab turned out more than  tablets  micrograms each of lsd dubbed white lightning when lsd became illegal in california on october   scully decided to set up a new lab in denver colorado the new lab was set up in the basement of a house across the street from the denver zoo in early citation needed legal trouble and continued involvement with the grateful deadedit stp was distributed in the summer of  in  mg tablets and quickly acquired a bad reputation later research in normal volunteers showed that  mg was over six times the dose required to produce hallucinogenic effects and its slow onset of action may have caused street users to take even more than a single tablet stanley and scully made trial batches of stp in  mg tablets and then of stp mixed with lsd in a few hundred yellow tablets but soon ceased production of stp stanley and scully produced about  grams of lsd in  but  grams of this was confiscated by the police in late  stanleys la espiral orinda lab was raided by police he was found in possession of  doses of lsd and  doses of stp his defense was that the illegal substances were for personal use but he was found guilty and sentenced to three years in prison the same year stanley officially shortened his name to owsley stanley after he was released from prison stanley resumed working for the grateful dead as their live sound engineer on january   at  am  members of the grateful dead and crew were arrested for possession of a variety of drugs at a french quarter hotel after returning from a concert at the warehouse in new orleans according to rolling stone everyone in the band except ron pigpen mckernan and tom constanten  neither of whom used psychedelic drugs  was included in the arrest along with several members of their retinue including stanley and some locals stanley was charged with illegal possession of narcotics dangerous nonnarcotics lsd and barbiturates another west coast–based rock band jefferson airplane had been arrested two weeks earlier in the same situation according to an article in the baton rouge state times stanley identified himself to the police as the king of acid and technician of the band the  grateful dead song truckin is based on the incident busted down on bourbon street  set up like a bowling pin  knocked down it gets to wearing thin  they just wont let you be stanley was confined to federal prison from  to  after a federal judge intervened and revoked his release from the  case stanley took advantage of the opportunity there to learn the trade of metalwork and jewelrymaking immediately following his release stanley resumed working for the grateful dead as a roadie and sound engineer in the summer of  as much of his portfolio had been delegated to as many as four sound engineers during his prison sentence he struggled to regain his past influence among the band and support staff in a later interview with dennis mcnally he opined that he received just a taste of his previous position according to stanley i found on my release from jail that the crew most of whom had been hired in my absence did not want anything changed no improvements for the sound no new gear nothing different on stage they wanted to maintain the same old same old which under their limited abilities they had memorized to the point where they could sleepwalk through shows bob matthews who had been mixing since my departure did not want to completely relinquish the mixing desk which was a total pain in the ass for me since he was basically a studio engineer and no match for my live mixing ability the situation was exacerbated by his disdain for the coarse language and deleterious drugs most notably alcohol and cocaine favored by the bands physically imposing roadies many of whom perceived themselves as macho cowboys in contrast to stanleys diminutive stature and erudite mien the tensions culminated in a logistical mishap at a october  concert at vanderbilt university when students recruited by stanley to deputize for an

release from jail that the crew most of whom had been hired in my absence did not want anything changed no improvements for the sound no new gear nothing different on stage they wanted to maintain the same old same old which under their limited abilities they had memorized to the point where they could sleepwalk through shows bob matthews who had been mixing since my departure did not want to completely relinquish the mixing desk which was a total pain in the ass for me since he was basically a studio engineer and no match for my live mixing ability the situation was exacerbated by his disdain for the coarse language and deleterious drugs most notably alcohol and cocaine favored by the bands physically imposing roadies many of whom perceived themselves as macho cowboys in contrast to stanleys diminutive stature and erudite mien the tensions culminated in a logistical mishap at a october  concert at vanderbilt university when students recruited by stanley to deputize for an

a white bar across it the top of the circle was orange and the bottom blue i couldnt read the name of the firm and so was just looking at the shape a thought occurred to me if the orange were red and the bar across were a lightning bolt cutting across at an angle then we would have a very nice unique and highly identifiable mark to put on the equipment during his time as the sound engineer for the
