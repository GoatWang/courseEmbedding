business magazine leave a comment attorney  shareholder las vegas number of employees  years in nevada  years with company  what inspired you to get into your industry i come from a family of business owners and executives  i enjoy working with business professionals to help them achieve their goals grow their businesses and when necessary handle their litigation needs how do you encourage growth and development within your company as attorneys we must never forget that customer service is a critical component of our profession  we must be incredibly responsive provide the highest quality product and do so in a costeffective manner  when we do this effectively we grow through positive referrals and repeat business what is the biggest challenge your industry is facing in litigation incivility is becoming more of a problem  even when you disagree with an opponent there is no reason to be disagreeable  acting civilly makes our lives more enjoyable and ultimately saves our clients time and money if you could have had another career what would it have been i would have enjoyed playing professional soccer  unfortunately i was not blessed with speed  however i still enjoy my favorite sport by serving as a soccer referee for high school and competitive youth games what is the best advice you’ve ever received my father once told me not to make important decisions when angry  i often provide this same advice to clients and colleagues  draft a letter or email let it sit overnight and revise it the next morning before sending it what do you anticipate for the future of business in nevada nevada still epitomizes the pioneer spirit  our economy in general and the gaming and tourism industries will rebound but i expect nevada to become a more important commercial transportation distribution and customer service hub for the southwest what values do you hope to pass on to your employees our partners have built a law firm where people respect and appreciate one another  we have an open door policy which fosters mentoring and collaboration  working together and sharing ideas and solutions is not only enjoyable but effective business connection login sign up
