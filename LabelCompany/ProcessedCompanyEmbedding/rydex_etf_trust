such as leverage derivatives and short selling click a fund name above or see a prospectus for additional details on these and other risks inverse and leveraged funds are not suitable for all investors •these funds should be utilized only by investors who a understand the risks associated with the use of leverage b understand the consequences of seeking daily leveraged investment results c understand the risk of shorting and d intend to actively monitor and manage their investments •the more a fund invests in leveraged instruments the more the leverage will magnify any gains or losses on those investments •inverse funds involve certain risks which include increased volatility due to the funds possible use of short sales of securities and derivatives such as options and futures •the funds use of derivatives such as futures options and swap agreements may expose the funds shareholders to additional risks that they would not be subject to if they invested directly in the securities underlying those derivatives •shortselling involves increased risks and costs you risk paying more for a security than you received from its sale •leveraged and inverse funds seek to provide investment results that match the performance of a specific benchmark before fees and expenses on a daily basis because the funds seek to track the performance of their benchmark on a daily basis mathematical compounding especially with respect to those funds that use leverage as part of their investment strategy may prevent a fund from correlating with the monthly quarterly annual or other period performance of its benchmarkdue to the compounding of daily returns leveraged and inverse funds returns over periods other than one day will likely differ in amount and possibly direction from the benchmark return for the same period for those funds that consistently apply leverage the value of the funds shares will tend to increase or decrease more than the value of any increase or decrease in its benchmark index the funds rebalance their portfolios on a daily basis increasing exposure in response to that days gains or reducing exposure in response to that days losses daily rebalancing will impair a funds performance if the benchmark experiences volatility investors should monitor their leveraged and inverse funds holdings consistent with their strategies as frequently as daily •for more on these and other risks please read the prospectus an investment in the us government money market fund is not insured or guaranteed by the federal deposit insurance corporation or

funds within its morningstar category how is it determined the overall morningstar ratingtm for a fund is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its   and year if applicable morningstar rating metrics which are based on riskadjusted returns as of the date stated  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds  yrs out of  funds what does it mean a funds morningstar rating is a quantitative assessment of a funds past performance that accounts for both risk and return with funds earning between  and  stars as always this rating system is designed to be used as a first step in the fund evaluation process a high rating alone is not sufficient basis upon which to make an investment decision returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk expenses low avg high average this funds expenses are rated as average because they fall between the th and th percentiles when compared with other funds in the category how is it calculated this morningstar data point compares the funds net expense ratio to the net expense ratio of all the other funds within its morningstar category grouping what does it mean excessive expenses can detract from overall returns and can be a drain on performance while you should not base any investment decision entirely on expenses or expense ratios a funds expense structure may be one factor to consider risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other characteristics before making your investment decisionlearn more morningstar® snapshot as

average this fund scores below average because morningstar has rated its risk between the th and th percentiles when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated risk is calculated using the sharpe ratio which compares portfolio returns to a rate comparable to us treasury bonds relative to the funds overall volatility for this measure morningstar has compared the sharpe ratio of this fund against all other funds that invest in its morningstar category what does it mean a higher sharpe implies better riskadjusted returns therefore if a fund has a sharpe ratio higher than its category average its returns relative to its risk were better than other similar funds if its sharpe ratio is lower thats usually a sign that the riskadjusted returns were lower than other similar funds returns low avg high average this fund scores average because it delivered returns that were in the middle  when compared to other funds within its morningstar category how is it calculated this rating is based on a funds morningstar return its annualized return in excess to the return of the day us treasury bill over a three five or tenyear period the morningstar returns in each category are then scored against each other on a bell curve in each morningstar category� top   high� next   above average� middle   average� next   below average� bottom   low what does it mean while past performance is no guarantee of future results the morningstar return shows how the fund has done in the past in comparison to similar funds in its peer group it does not however show the effects of risktherefore the morningstar return is most helpful when used in conjunction with the morningstar risk score for example an investor could use these two scores when comparing between funds that have the same morningstar star rating and similar morningstar risk adjusted returns but different levels of risk risk of this type of fund lower higher morningstar assigns a risk level to each of its mutual fund categories these risk levels range from  for those funds with least amount of risk to  for those with the greatest amount of risk how is it calculated morningstar calculates these risk levels by looking at the morningstar risk of the funds in the category over the previous year period morningstar risk is the difference between the morningstar return based on fund total returns and the morningstar risk adjusted return based on fund total returns adjusted for performance volatility the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average morningstar risk of the funds in the category morningstars research committee evaluates the category morningstar risk and assigns the category risk level after further qualitative judgment what does it mean this score can help you understand the risk involved with a particular morningstar category of funds which may be helpful in evaluating the risk associated with a specific investment the category risk level is based on the equal weighted average performance of the funds in the category it does not reflect the risk associated with any individual fund or the relative risk of a fund within a particular morningstar category because the score is based on past performance it may not reflect the future risk of the category in addition to risk you should evaluate a funds investment objective strategy fees and other

act the distributor is registered as a brokerdealer under the securities exchange act of  “exchange act” and will act as the distributor and principal underwriter for each funds shares “shares”  the trust currently offers eight series that seek to match the performance of equity securities indices pursuant to the prior order applicants seek relief to offer additional series with different types of investment objectives each such series a “new fund” the new funds will seek daily investment results that correspond before fees and expenses to a   or  of the return of equity securities indices “leveraged funds” or b move in the opposite direction of the performance of equity securities indices in multiples of    or  “inverse funds” applicants propose to initially offer ninetysix new funds  in addition to equity securities the new funds may invest in shortterm debt instruments that meet the definition of “eligible security” in rule a under the act “money market instruments” and in futures contracts options equity caps collars and floors swap agreements forward contracts and reverse repurchase agreements collectively “financial instruments” in order to meet their investment objectives leveraged funds will invest  or more of their total assets in equity securities contained in the relevant underlying index and up to  of their total assets in financial instruments and money market instruments the inverse funds will only invest in financial instruments and money market instruments they will not invest in equity securities  the advisor will seek to achieve the investment objectives of the new funds by using a mathematical model that takes into account a variety of specified criteria the most important of which are a the net assets in each new funds portfolio at the end of each trading day b the amount of required exposure to the underlying index and c the positions in equity securities financial instruments and money market instruments at the beginning of each trading day on each day that a new fund is open for business “business day” including as required by section e of the act the full portfolio holdings of each new fund will be disclosed on the web site of the trust andor the exchange where the shares are primarily listed “primary listing exchange” the portfolio holdings information disclosed each business day will form the basis for that new funds net asset value “nav” calculation as of  pm that day and will reflect portfolio trades made on the immediately preceding business day intraday values of each underlying index will be disseminated every  seconds throughout the trading day  for the new funds applicants expect a daily tracking error of less than  excluding the impact of expenses and interest if any to the specified multiple inverse or inverse multiple respectively of the performance of the relevant underlying index  each new fund will issue shares in aggregations of  to  shares each a “creation unit” applicants expect the price of a creation unit to be a minimum of  million creation units may be purchased only by or through the distributor or a party that has entered into a participant agreement with the distributor an “authorized participant” an authorized participant must be either a a brokerdealer or other participant in the continuous net settlement system of the national securities clearing corporation a clearing agency that is registered with the commission or b a participant in the depository trust company “dtc” system  creation units of leveraged funds generally will be purchased and redeemed in exchange for an “inkind” transfer of securities and cash “inkind payment” inverse funds will generally be purchased and redeemed entirely for cash because of the limited transferability of financial instruments an investor making an inkind payment will be required to transfer to the trust a “deposit basket” consisting of a a basket of equity securities consisting of some or all of the securities in the relevant underlying index or equivalent equity securities selected by the advisor to correspond to the performance of the underlying index the “deposit list”  and b a cash amount equal to the differential if any between the market value of the equity securities in the deposit basket and the nav per creation unit “balancing amount” an investor purchasing a creation unit from a new fund will be charged a fee “transaction fee” to prevent the dilution of the interests of the remaining shareholders resulting from the new fund incurring costs in connection with the purchase of the creation units the start printed page maximum transaction fee and any variations or waivers of the transaction fee will be disclosed in the current prospectus “prospectus” and the method of determining the transaction fees will be disclosed in the prospectus andor statement of additional information “sai”  all orders to purchase creation units must be placed on a business day with the distributor the distributor also will be responsible for delivering the prospectus to those persons purchasing creation units and for maintaining records of the orders and acknowledgements of acceptance for orders  persons purchasing creation units from a new fund may hold the shares or sell some or all of them in the secondary market shares of the new funds will be listed on an exchange and trade in the secondary market in the same manner as other exchangetraded funds it is expected that one or more exchange members will act as a specialist or market maker and maintain a market on the listing exchange for shares the price of shares traded on an exchange will be based on a current bidoffer market the initial trading price for each share of each new fund will fall in the range of  to  transactions involving the sale of shares in the secondary market will be subject to customary brokerage commissions and charges  applicants expect that purchasers of creation units will include institutional and retail investors arbitrageurs traders financial advisors portfolio managers and other market participants an exchange specialist or market maker in providing for a fair and orderly secondary market for shares also may purchase or redeem creation units for use in its marketmaking activities applicants expect that the market price of shares will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities created by the ability to purchase or redeem creation units at their nav which should ensure that the market price of shares at or close to  pm stays close to the nav on that business day  shares will not be individually redeemable shares will only be redeemable in creation units through the distributor which will act as the trusts agent for redemption to redeem an investor must accumulate enough shares to constitute a creation unit an investor redeeming a creation unit of a leveraged fund generally will receive an “inkind” payment comprised of equity securities published by the trusts index receipt agent the “redemption list” plus a balancing amount equal to the difference between the market value of the equity securities on the redemption list and the nav of the shares being redeemed redemptions of creation units for inverse funds will occur entirely in cash a redeeming investor will pay a transaction fee to offset the transactional expenses associated with redeeming creation units  applicants state that neither the trust nor any new fund will be advertised marketed or otherwise held out as a “mutual fund” the term “mutual fund” will not be used in the prospectus except to compare and contrast the trust or a new fund with conventional mutual funds in all marketing materials where the features or methods of obtaining buying or selling creation units are described or where there is reference to redeemability applicants will include a prominent statement to the effect that individual shares are not redeemable except in creation units the same approach will be followed in connection with reports and other communications to shareholders as well as any other investor education materials issued or circulated in connection with shares the trust will provide copies of its annual and semiannual shareholder reports to dtc participants for distribution to beneficial holders of shares applicants legal analysis  applicants request an order under section c of the act granting an exemption from sections a a d and d of the act and rule c under the act and under sections c and b of the act granting an exemption from sections a and a of the act  section c of the act provides that the commission may exempt any person security or transaction or any class of persons securities or transactions from any provision of the act if and to the extent that such exemption is necessary or appropriate in the public interest and consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policy and provisions of the act sections a and a of the act  section a of the act defines an “openend company” as a management investment company that is offering for sale or has outstanding any redeemable security of which it is the issuer section a of the act defines a redeemable security as any security other than shortterm paper under the terms of which the holder upon its presentation to the issuer is entitled to receive approximately his proportionate share of the issuers current net assets or the cash equivalent because shares will not be individually redeemable applicants request an order that would permit the trust which is registered as an openend management investment company to issue shares of new funds that are redeemable in creation units only applicants state that investors may always redeem shares in creation units from the trust applicants further state that because the market price of shares will be disciplined by arbitrage opportunities investors should be able to sell shares in the secondary market at or close to  pm on a business day at prices that do not vary substantially from the nav on that business day section d of the act and rule c under the act  section d of the act among other things prohibits a dealer from selling a redeemable security which is currently being offered to the public by or through a principal underwriter except at a current public offering price described in the prospectus rule c under the act generally requires that a dealer selling redeeming or repurchasing a redeemable security do so only at a price based on its nav applicants state that secondary market trading in shares will take place at negotiated prices not at a current offering price described in the prospectus as required by section d of the act and not at a price based on nav as required by rule c under the act applicants request an exemption under section c from these provisions  applicants assert that the concerns sought to be addressed by section d of the act and rule c under the act with respect to pricing are equally satisfied by the proposed method of pricing shares applicants maintain that while there is little legislative history regarding section d its provisions as well as those of rule c appear to have been intended to a prevent dilution caused by certain risklessstart printed page trading schemes by principal underwriters and contract dealers b prevent unjust discrimination or preferential treatment among buyers and c ensure an orderly distribution of shares by eliminating price competition from dealers offering shares at less than the published sales price and repurchasing shares at more than the published redemption price  applicants believe that none of these purposes will be thwarted by permitting shares to trade in the secondary market at negotiated prices applicants state that a secondary market trading in shares does not involve the trusts assets and cannot result in dilution of an investment in shares and b to the extent different prices exist during a given trading day or from day to day such variances occur as a result of thirdparty market forces such as supply and demand not as a result of unjust or discriminatory manipulation therefore applicants assert that secondary market transactions in shares will not lead to discrimination or preferential treatment among purchasers finally applicants contend that the proposed distribution system will be orderly because competitive forces in the marketplace will ensure that the difference between the market price of shares and their nav remains narrow section d of the act  section d of the act provides in relevant part that the prospectus delivery exemption provided to dealer transactions by section  of the securities act does not apply to any transaction in a redeemable security issued by an openend investment company applicants request an exemption from section d to permit dealers selling shares to rely on the prospectus delivery exemption provided by section  of the securities act  applicants state that secondary market investors will regard shares in a manner similar to other securities including closedend fund shares that are listed bought and sold on an exchange applicants note that shares of closedend fund investment companies are sold in the secondary market unaccompanied by a prospectus  applicants contend that shares as a listed security merit a reduction in the compliance costs and regulatory burdens resulting from the imposition of prospectus delivery obligations in the secondary market because shares will be exchangelisted prospective investors will have access to several types of market information about shares applicants state that information regarding market price and volume will be continually available on a realtime basis throughout the day from the relevant exchange automated quotation systems published or other public sources or online information services applicants expect that the previous days closing price and volume information for shares also will be published daily in the financial section of newspapers in addition the trust expects to maintain a website that includes quantitative information updated on a daily basis including for each new fund daily trading volume the nav and the reported closing price or in the alternative the midpoint of the bidask spread at the time of calculation of such nav the “bidask price” the web site will also include for each new fund closing price or bidask price and data in chart format displaying the frequency distribution of discounts and premiums of the closing price or bidask price against the nav within appropriate ranges for each of the four previous calendar quarters  investors also will receive a product description “product description” describing the trust the new funds and the shares applicants state that while not intended as a substitute for a prospectus the product description will contain information about shares that is tailored to meet the needs of investors purchasing shares in the secondary market sections a and  of the act  section a of the act generally prohibits an affiliated person of a registered investment company or an affiliated person of such a person from selling any security to or purchasing any security from the company section a of the act defines “affiliated person” to include any person directly or indirectly owning controlling or holding with power to vote  or more of the outstanding voting securities of the other person and any person directly or indirectly controlling controlled by or under common control with the other person section a of the act provides that a control relationship will be presumed where one person owns  or more of another persons voting securities applicants state that one or more holders of creation units could own more than  of a new fund or in excess of  of that new fund and could be deemed affiliated with the trust or such new fund under section aa or ac of the act also an exchange specialist or market maker for shares of any new fund might accumulate from time to time more than  or in excess of  of that new funds shares applicants request an exemption from section a of the act under sections c and b of the act to permit persons that are affiliated persons of the new funds solely by virtue of a  or  ownership interest or affiliated persons of such affiliated persons that are not otherwise affiliated with the new fund to purchase and redeem creation units through “inkind” transactions  section b of the act authorizes the commission to exempt a proposed transaction from section a of the act if evidence establishes that the terms of the transaction including the consideration to be paid or received are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned and the proposed transaction is consistent with the policies of the registered investment company and the general provisions of the act applicants contend that no useful purpose would be served by prohibiting the affiliated persons of a new fund described above from purchasing or redeeming creation units through “inkind” transactions the deposit and redemption procedures for “inkind” purchases and redemptions of creations units will be effected in exactly the same manner for all purchases and redemptions the securities contained in the “inkind” transactions will be valued in the same manner and according to the same standards as the securities held by the start printed page relevant new fund therefore applicants state that “inkind” purchases and redemptions will afford no opportunity for the affiliated persons described above to effect a transaction detrimental to the other holders of its shares applicants also believe that “inkind” purchases and redemptions will not result in abusive selfdealing or overreaching by affiliated persons of the new funds applicants conditions applicants agree that any order granting the requested relief will be subject to the following conditions  applicants will not register a series of the trust not identified in the application by means of filing a posteffective amendment to the trusts registration statement or by any other means unless applicants have requested and received with respect to such series either a

exemptive order that permits registered investment companies to invest in a new fund beyond the limits in section d subject to certain terms and conditions including that the registered investment

 applicants do not seek relief from the prospectus delivery requirement for nonsecondary market transactions such as transactions in which an investor purchases shares in creation units from the issuer or an underwriter applicants state that persons purchasing creation units will be cautioned in the prospectus that some activities on their part may depending on the circumstances result in their being deemed statutory underwriters and subject them to the prospectus delivery and liability provisions of the securities act the prospectus will state that whether a person is an underwriter depends upon all the facts and circumstances pertaining to that persons activities for example a brokerdealer firm andor its client may be deemed a statutory underwriter if it takes creation units after placing an order with the distributor breaks them down into the constituent shares and sells shares directly to its customers or if it chooses to couple the purchase of a supply of new shares with an active selling effort involving solicitation of secondary market demand for shares the prospectus also will state that dealers who are not “underwriters” but are participating in a

suite of exchangetraded products made a splash with the latest addition to its product lineup on tuesday the recentlylaunched currencyshares chinese renminbi trust fxch will offer exposure to the official currency of the people’s republic of china bringing the total number of currency products offered by the company up to ten “the renminbi has become an important currency in the world and the china growth story is expected to continue longterm” said jim king an etf portfolio manager at rydexsgi “the chinese renminbi trust offers investors a way to participate in china’s burgeoning economy as well as diversify their portfolio with currency exposure” he saidthe value of the chinese currency often known as the yuan has been a hot topic for the last several years the international community including treasury secretary geithner has regularly implied that china has kept the official value of its currency depressed in order to boost exports beijing has gradually moved to allow the currency to appreciate though perhaps at a much slower pace than many would suggest as optimalthe us senate recently passed a bill that would impose tariffs on exports from countries with undervalued currencies a list that would presumably be headlined by china though the outcome of that legislation in the house is uncertain the move appeared to frustrate china the people’s bank of china issued a statement saying that the bill could “seriously affect” exchange rate reform or potentially lead to a trade warthe general expectation is that the chinese currency will gradually appreciate against the dollar and other currencies in coming years fxch allows investors to participate in that price appreciation few expect a rapid acceleration of the renminbi’s valuation as such fxch can be seen as an opportunity for slow steady growth as opposed to quick appreciationunder the hoodlike all currencyshares products fxch is not a “true”  act exchangetraded fund rather it is structured as a grantor trust  the underlying assets of the fund will consist of chinese renminbidenominated deposits which allows fxch to respond to changes in the us dollar price of the chinese currency if the renminbi appreciates relative to the greenback fxch can be expected to appreciate as wellas part of china’s movement towards a more flexible currency the government has introduced two versions of the renminbi an onshore version cny and an offshore version cnh that arrangement was set up in order to allow an orderly introduction of the chinese currency to international trade while still protecting chinese banks from external shocksgenerally the offshore version trades at a premium to the onshore renminbi because it is freely convertible in hong kong recently however that relationship flipped as the value of the offshore currency sank on concerns about the global economythe currency held by the new trust is the cnh versionchina yuan etfs comparedfxch becomes the third exchangetraded product to offer pure play exposure to the chinese currency the two existing products have aggregate assets of close to  million those include wisdomtree dreyfus chinese yuan fund cyb
