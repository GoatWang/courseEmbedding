christian chabot tableau cofounder and chairman with new tableau ceo adam selipsky photo via michael clinardtableau for the first time since it launched nearly  years ago tableau software has a new leader the seattlebased data analytics and visualization company just announced that amazon web services veteran adam selipsky will become tableau’s new ceo effective sept  christian chabot who cofounded tableau in  and ran the company as ceo since then will remain as chairman in an interview on monday with geekwire chabot called selipsky a “sensational new leader” pointing to his experience at amazon where he helped grow the company’s cloud computing arm from the ground floor into a business that is now on track to generate  billion per year in sales geekwire previously reported last week that selipsky had left amazon — now we know where the longtime amazon executive and former realnetworks vice president is headed “clearly that has been a sensational success” chabot said of aws calling it one of the ‘most successful tech platforms’ in the world “adam will be helping lead tableau through a similar journey hopefully” follow up why tableau just hired amazon web services guru adam selipsky to be its new ceo in a statement selipsky said that he is “incredibly excited” to join tableau an sec filing shows that he will earn an annual base salary of  and will be eligible for an annual incentive bonus of up to  percent of that base salary he will also receive a cash signing bonus of  million “tableau has that rare combination of a passionate customer base leading products amazingly talented people dedication to technology innovation and momentum in the market” said the yearold “the company is positioned to become the new world standard in analytics i’m honored to join the leadership team and all the great people that have fueled tableau’s disruption of business analytics as we add capabilities for our customers deepen our enterprise presence and expand into the cloud our mission remains unchanged — to help people see and understand their data” tableau software ceo christian chabot at the tableau conference courtesy tableau software the executive shuffle comes during a rocky year for tableau on wall street during the fourth quarter of  the company posted a record  million in revenue but took a  million loss as a result its stock lost about half its value and has yet to fully recover the company’s stock fell again the following quarter and has dropped nearly  percent in the past year now trading at  tableau which is facing increased competition in the data analytics industry also scaled back hiring plans by  percent earlier this year asked about the timing of the leadership changes chabot said the person company  percent of employees are based in the seattle area is “well positioned for its next stage — becoming one of the most important technology companies on the planet” “we have not expanded our leadership team since before our ipo in  and since then the company and opportunity have grown tremendously” he said “these moves expand our executive ranks and positions us well for our next stage of growth” shares of tableau are up more than  percent in afterhours trading the hiring of selipsky also points to tableau’s new focus on its cloud product tableau online chris stolte “our expansion in cloud is particularly germane to the next five years — it’s more important to the next five years than the last five years” chabot said “in fact one of the reasons we recruited adam is his exceptional expertise in the cloud i wouldn’t be surprised if he decides to really supersize that part of the strategy” tableau cofounder and chief development officer chris stolte will also step down from his leadership position and transition to “technical advisor” andrew beers tableau’s seventh employee who was most recently vice president of product development will replace stolte as the company’s new chief development officer chabot said that he and stolte who started tableau in silicon valley in  before moving the company to seattle a few years later will spend more time focused on longterm strategy and customer evangelism — “areas where we can have the biggest impact” he noted “chris and i will be assisting adam and the executive team in the areas where we are best at” chabot added tableau went public in  despite the decreasing stock price chabot said that tableau is “one of the fastestgrowing technology companies out there” noting that it closed more new accounts during q than any quarter in its history he added that tableau which has more than  customer accounts “has a very small share” of the visual data and analytics market pinning it at about  percent “tableau’s size and scale continues to increase” chabot said “as we look forward into next year and the year plan it seems like an opportune time to have the best of both worlds bring in additional executive leadership for a much bigger company while also focusing me and chris on the things we most enjoy and do best” this past may chabot hinted that he wanted to bring on a president or coo but it wasn’t clear then that he would ultimately step down as ceo tableau sales chief kelly wright who helped build the company into a data visualization powerhouse will retire at the end of this year there is no longer a search for a president but the company is still searching for a new sales chief chabot said today chabot on monday also explained how successful software companies come in three acts going from  to  million in annual revenue going from  million to  billion and then beyond he said tableau which just launched tableau  and has  offices worldwide is nearing the end of act  closing in on  billion in annual sales — its guidance for  revenue is more than  million “the question for our board which has been thinking about this for some time was what our ‘act ’ plan was and if we were going for it or not” chabot explained “we are going for it” tableau’s stock over the past year geekwire newsletters subscribe to geekwires free newsletters to catch every headline email address subscribe geekwire daily  top

loss of  per share the seattlebased company reported a record  million in revenue which narrowly beat expectations of  million and was up  percent from last year “in q a record  new customer accounts chose tableau bringing our total to more than  worldwide” tableau ceo christian chabot said in a statement “this speaks to the immense popularity of tableau’s products and continued strong demand from customers around the world i remain optimistic that tableau is best positioned to address the large and growing market opportunity for selfservice visual analytics” in the yearago quarter tableau posted net income of  million on earnings of  per share during q  the company reported  million in revenue beating analyst expectations but missed on earnings expectations with a net loss of  per share in an earnings call with financial analysts tableau cfo tom walker said that customer acquisition is “quite strong” with  customer accounts but he said they saw some “softness in spend” with larger customers in the fourth quarter  “it was not at the same clip that we saw historically” said walker especially as it related to the strong fourth quarter in  chabot added that tableau is well positioned with its data visualization tools since it operates a “hybrid model” where customers can choose to purchase products onsite for their own data centers or purchase cloudbased offerings while he’s bullish on the prospects going forward chabot added that it is “too early to say that there is some pause” that has impacted tableau over the years chabot said that the competitive landscape has gotten “more crowded and more difficult” “it has gotten thicker and thicker over the years” said chabot adding that the company’s “win rates” remain stable against rivals microsoft launched its powerbi data analytics tool last summer creating a new competitive threat for tableau chabot said that tableau has the most robust data visualization product on the market and it is competitively priced versus the competition but he admitted that the lowerpriced alternatives may have had a minor role in the softness that tableau experienced “the large number of competitive alternatives that are available for customers to check out versus a few years ago probably had some role in expansion ratios” said chabot “it is very hard to measure that from our perch… i will leave you with the hypothesis that the number of things that customers are checking out has increased probably played some role but it doesn’t feel to us that is an overwhelming factor” even so tableau plans to continue investing heavily in building out its marketing sales and engineering force taking advantage of what the company believes is an enormous opportunity “we have seen a lot of competitors get attracted to the overall market space and so it is very very important for us to recognize … what a rich opportunity it is and how much beyond business intelligence it is and so we want to continue to go and be the leader there and we think the best way to do that is through investing” said walker “there will be a time when we don’t think the opportunity is as rich and i believe that is when we would turn towards more operating leverage in the model but right now we are actually bullish on the overall opportunity and the longterm opportunity” he said they are focused on growing to more than  billion in
