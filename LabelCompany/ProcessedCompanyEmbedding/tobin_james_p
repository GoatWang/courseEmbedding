cellars click here for the full pdf name  tobin james cellars location paso robles san luis obispo county owners  tobin james lance and claire silver winemaker  tobin james lance silver established   opened tasting room   annual case production   website  wwwtobinjamescom cwc selections  titan hills vineyards “fiasco”  “radiance” chardonnay “it worked out for everybody” tobin james cellars off hwy  just east of paso robles midway up the golden state has earned a reputation as one of the region’s most popular fun wine destinations  when tobin opened his tasting room in  bruce and pam boring had also just recently started the california wine club  “back then nobody knew who tobin james was or paso robles and bruce took a chance by featuring my wines” says tobin “it worked out for everybody” it’s about to work out again with two fantastic tobin james cwc selections … there’s a party in there located at the site of an historic stagecoach stop tobin james cellars offers down home ambiance loud music and louder crowds bellying up to the old s mahogany bar delivered all the way from blue eye missouri  before you swing open the door you can hear a party going on why is wine so fun at tobin james cellars look no further than the founder himself “our winery is all about people enjoying every day and a glass of wine makes the day better” says tobin james “if you come home and don’t have a glass of wine that is a boring day  i love that we make a product that people open with family and enjoy it with food and friends that is an honor for us and we never forget that” “when i play we sell wine” tobin’s first vintage was in  and for several years he made his wines in other winery facilities  when he opened his own winery and tasting room in  things took off  “i just wanted to wear rubber boots and get my hands red making wine  but it suddenly turned into a business” tobin smiles  “i couldn’t do it without my partners lance and claire silver  i would be nowhere without those guys they are the best   lance makes everything run  it leaves me to do what i do best and that is play  and when i play we sell wine” the very friendly winery staff does its part too  “it doesn’t cost anything to be friendly” tobin says early start in wine tobin may have learned that kind of neighborliness growing up in indiana he was born in california by the age of eight he was working for his brothers in their vineyard and wine shop  when he was  inspired by a visit from paso robles winemaker gary eberle tobin headed out to the region to work for him for nothing ultimately joining gary’s winery as assistant winemaker eberle got more than he bargained for  the young man ended up making a zinfandel from surplus grapes that earned double gold medals and launched tobin on his winemaking career meteor sighting tobin james’ reputation rocketed skyward like a meteor  he became founding winemaker for peachy canyon in paso robles in  and his first wine a zinfandel earned th place in wine spectator’s  “top  wines of the world” tobin left peachy canyon to begin his own winery purchasing  acres and an old stagecoach stop on hwy  east  he renovated the old house for guests then built his rustic out west style winery  the party began “people might think this western stuff is gimmicky but it’s not this is the way our bars were in paso — they were saloons i tell people we wanted to make a snobby winery but we didn’t know how to do it  we don’t have a violinist in the corner we’ve got merle haggard on that is the way it is i’m just a country boy that makes pretty good wine” hello paso when this country boy started selling wine elsewhere he ran into a little problem  “when i said i had a winery in paso robles people in los angeles would say ‘oh in texas’  now everybody knows where paso robles is and i love that  i saw the whole transformation here going from seven wineries to ” tobin’s tireless promotion of the region earned him “wine person of the year ” from the paso robles wine alliance and other awards  it has also made his winery a paso robles hot spot where wine lovers from all over come to put their feet up on the bar’s brass rail and enjoy  or so different tobin james wines  “we have a problem at our winery” tobin confesses  “if somebody comes up with a new grape we want it and then we go oh my gosh we made it now we have to sell it  that’s where our wine club comes in”  twentyfour thousand “james gang” club members enjoy wines like tempranillo and refosco because this country boy just can’t stop having fun his son is right behind him studying winemaking at fresno state university while his and his wife ermie’s children man the pizza oven and serve the finger foods at the winery’s annual parties uncork your bottles of tobin james
