everyone and thanks for participating in our call my plan for today is to review our  results speak a little bit about the first few weeks of  talk about a handful of companies that we own in the fund and then open it up to your questions well we’re always pleased to generate a positive return for our shareholders which we did in  performance relative to the sp  was actually disappointing the fund’s performance was a tale of two halves the vast majority of the amount we trailed the sp occurred in the first half of the year which began with a significant amount of volatility as i reviewed in our july call chinese stocks plunged in the beginning of the year setting up a significant riskoff trade in us stocks the weakness continued into february where actually the intraday low for the sp  was down  to give you an idea of how volatile the year was the market advanced about  from that point to the end of the year quite a heady move indeed our difficulties were in few areas the first was very high correlation of stocks to macro events for many of our companies for most of the year it actually seemed like where the dollar was mattered more than company fundamentals and as you recall we are a bottom up fundamental stock guys second many of the stocks that performed well in  actually performed quite badly in  in fact the  best sp  performers for the first six months were up between  and  of those top  companies only four were in the top  last year many of these were lower quality out of favor companies that really were rewarded based on their prospects that the fact that their prospects would improve and here is a very important point we will likely always have difficulty in this type of an environment our emphasis is on high quality companies doing good things at good prices with patience we believe that philosophy will be rewarded in the later half of the year there was more balanced perspective in the market and we actually preformed – performance improved for the year the underperformance against the sp was concentrated in three areas for us technology consumer staples and healthcare in the tech sector the semiconductor industry group was a large contributor to our underperformance although there were a handful of stocks that we owned land research at semicap equipment company and nxp a chip company they performed quite well our difficulty in semi is actually revolved around a company called nvidia which we did not on nvidia makes chips for playstations and games as well as for commercial uses and that stock was up  for the year very very difficult we did not see that one very difficult to try to outperform with a company that big that did that well and a handful of other semi stocks also had outsized performance which added to our difficulty in additions to the pain from semis broadly investors sold longterm winners in order to fund more cyclical and interest rate sensitive names our position in apple also contributed to our underperformance although they had a bit of a tailwind because of the product recall from samsung the disappointing or lukewarm reception i guess and disappointing reception of the iphone  weighed on the stock lastly as it relates to technology our exposure to visa which we still think is a very very good stock i heard as debit card market concerns pressure the stock we believe in the shortterm also detracting from performance relative to the sp  was the consumer staples sector for us two stocks in particular weighed significantly on our performance the first is kroger kroger is considered a very good high quality food retailer what we really didn’t appreciate it is how long and persistent food deflation would hurt the stock in a similar way cbs was a detractor again we under appreciated deflation coupled with the markets uneasiness with their pharmacy benefit management business found us behind the eight ball with that stock as well lastly healthcare presented a headwind as well for us the weakest performer for us in healthcare was a company called allergan a diversified pharmaceutical company as some of you might recall at the beginning of the year allergan was approached by pfizer for a take over in april pfizer called off its acquisition of allergan after significant difficulty with the government trying to crack down on tax inversion deals and allergan was significantly hurt by that news however despite concerns about drug pricing we believe that allergan’s inexpensive valuation and strong growth profile make it among the both – the most attractive large cap drug companies now turning to where the fund did well energy was a bright spot for us as many of you know adx owns a position in our sister fund adams natural resources fund ticker symbol peo and like adx peo has been around since  this is an energy and materials fund that is run by the same team which includes dedicated fundamental energy and materials analysts who report to me peo as a matter of fact was the best performing energy stock in the fund in  as well energy was the strongest performer performing sector in the sp in  as supply and demand fundamentals for both oil and gas improved during the year oil prices rose  and gas prices rose  optimism was further bolstered by president trump’s promise to reduce regulation as well as the opec agreement to limit production in addition to trump reforming adams natural resources fund our position in halliburton was particularly helpful as a provider of products and services halliburton would have delivered outsized returns for the fund looking out over that horizon we also expect as more – as there’s more activity in the emp sector that halliburton will continue to benefit from that let me take a couple of minutes and look ahead a bit to  my first comment on  is i think the year will be volatile there are many things to like about what president trump has outlined the effects of less regulation lower corporate tax rates policy that is less monetary and more fiscally simulative and an approach that is more probusiness and less progovernment sets up very well for companies but let’s be clear the market has already begun to discount some of this in the price of stocks the volatility will likely come as president trump’s good intentions are either watered down or they are slowed down both are certainly possible but even with that as a backdrop i am optimistic looking out over that horizon in addition to the many good things i’ve mentioned we still have a likely tailwind of an enormous amount of money that has fled the equity markets over the last ten years and sits in fixed income investments as we begin to see corporate profits continue to improve and benefit from more accommodative washington i believe we will see a steady stream of investors rebalancing toward equities let’s move on next to discuss a few names in the – in the portfolio it is actually probably the most fun part of it of the chat i’m going to talk about five names that we have in the portfolio i wanted to start with a company called comcast comcast is one of our largest overweight in the fund as many of you know it’s a diversified media company it has broadcast cable content studio’s broadband and really is a big beneficiary of vertical integration possibilities on the cable side continued demand for broadband bandwidth high bandwidth and broadband services it plays well to their strengths and universal pictures has great content and has been incredibly successful with their movies over the last several years it is around all of those attractive traits is a very very strong balance sheet they just reported a quarter today beating on revenue eps increasing their dividend and increasing stock buybacks so it continues to be one of our favorite stocks in the fund and cotton swindell our analysts and pm and adx continues to like that a lot the next stock is a company called priceline priceline is a global online travel company many of the things that we like about this business is number one that it is a fragmented business not withstanding the fact that priceline has grown significantly we still see a significant runway for growth given the fragmented nature of the travel business they are very efficient marketers they have the best global scale of any of the competitors that they go against we are being beginning to see some good asia and china growth ahead of them and they have a great track record of execution and eps providing eps upside so again another company doing good things at a good price the next one is actually the next two are financials a lot of a lot of good things that’s happened for financials over the last couple of months the first is with president trump’s election certainly reduce regulation as everybody knows banks are among and financial institutions in general are among the most regulated businesses and so some relief there is certainly welcome bank of america is the largest bank that we have an active weight in the fund they have leading franchises across many in the financial services industry very attractive deposit franchise bank of america benefits disproportionately to high rates given their set up they’re very domestically focused and we see significant upside to higher rates to bank of america and lastly they have a very good management team that has continued quarterafterquarter to work down expenses providing good margin upside the second financial is american express american express has been pretty controversial it really has underperformed pretty badly over the last three or four years notwithstanding the fact that we believe it really does have a good franchise a little over a year ago they lost the cosco business which was a big jolt to them and to their earnings we have – they have anniversaried that so the headwinds are beginning to abate from that american express tends to be leveraged to nominal gdp growth which we think that looks good and pretends good things for american express as i said it’s been a significant underperformer for the last several years and we believe that eps that the eps estimates have bottomed and we’re getting it – we’ve gotten it at a very attractive valuation our analyst there jeffrey schollaert has done a significant amount of work on this and we believe that it’s a valueoriented stock that we believe we can hold for quite some time as they as they work out of the difficulty that they’ve had and lastly i’ll talk a little bit about a company in the tech sector called adobe most everybody would know adobe from adobe acrobat it is a dominant player in digital marketing and media solutions one of the things that got us really interested in adobe initially was the fact that they went from a purchase model to a subscription model so a purchase model meaning they relied on people every year making a conscious decision to buy it as opposed to a subscription model where they download everything from the cloud and in it’s built automatically that’s an incredibly attractive model the sustainable recurring revenue from that as i said is one of the things that really attracted us to it they have few real competitors in the creative professional market and we expect revenues to grow north of  while managing expenses to allow for a very good margin expansion going forward and so let me wrap up with my comments here on companies these are all examples of highquality companies that we have been attracted to that are doing good things at good prices before i open it up to questions there are a few things that i want to remind our shareholders the first is that we remain committed to the minimum yearly distribution of at least  each year since we made that commitment we have exceeded that minimum for  we distributed  we understand the importance that many of our shareholders place on this distribution and will continue to honor this commitment as it relates to the distribution we feel it’s important that our shareholders remember that your fund should be viewed as a total return vehicle meaning you can’t just look at the return of the stock you must factor in the distributions in order to get a proper understanding of your total return lastly it’s important to me that you know we have a very good team here at adams funds in addition to having strong infrastructure and accounting and compliance we have a very good investment team and although our  performance relative to the sp  was not what we had hoped it would be our three in fiveyear returns continue to be very compelling which is a good segway to our philosophy we are a team that takes a longterm view looking for high quality companies doing good things at good prices not every year will be brilliant but over time we feel confident about our ability to deliver good investment results for our shareholders and with that i’d be happy to open it up to questions questionandanswer session q  nancy prue operator instructions and we’ll begin with – the first question is coming in is adams diversified equity actively buying back shares if so how many shares were bought back in  mark stoeckle the short answer is yes we are actively buying back shares i don’t have the exact number but we bought back about  of the total outstanding shares in  so about  – yes just short of one million shares we bought in fact in  but it is something that the board did approve again for this year and something that we’ve been doing now for i think it’s three years three or four years nancy prue okay another question coming in a question we frequently get it’s talking about the discount this question is specifically asking indiscernible rising the distribution this just relates to managed distribution and the committed distribution not a managed distribution but the question centers on would you consider raising the distribution in order to possibly narrow the discount and if not what other things are you doing to address the discount so we generally take that with the other questions i get and mark you can talk just a little bit about the discount and educate everybody on what it is where it’s been and sort of things please mark stoeckle sure the discount is something that – the first thing that’s important is to know that the management and the board discussed the discount a lot it’s something that is not unusual for closedend funds our discount currently is about  i think it’s important to try to keep that in perspective in the last  years the discount has been about  so certainly it’s a little bit more than but it’s not like it went from zero to  recently and we have looked at a lot of different things i can tell you i can tell everybody on the call that if i haven’t read everything that has been written academically about the reason for discounts i would certainly come close it’s a conundrum that being said the board is committed to several things the first is that we are buying back shares the second thing is we do have what we believe is that it’s an attractive payout one of the questions is why would you consider a higher payout and i think that one of the things that is important and we’ve looked at this is if the payout is going to make a big difference in the discount it’s going to have to be a lot higher than  or  or  or  it’s going to have to be significantly higher than that so to us we established at  because we felt given the way we manage money that we could – that we would not have any trouble meeting that and so to me it’s i think that where we are and  is a good place to be we do – we have talked to a number of our shareholders about the discount we have been asked to do several things i’ve – the answer that i usually give is or always give is frankly i’m interested in doing things that are going to help all shareholders and one of the other things that we’ve done in the board has been fully supportive of is that we’ve been trying to increase our visibility as many of you have seen we have a website that is uptodate and we continue to put things on that trying to add some value to our shareholders and that’s something that we’re going to continue to do in addition to that we are looking for ways that we can get the adams’ funds word out we think that that should also help with identifying people who don’t know us yet but we would find what we do very attractive and hopefully help with a discount as i said it’s a conundrum it’s something that we think about we worry about but we think that we have embarked on the right things for our shareholders so far nancy prue and we did pay at  in the last year as well mark stoeckle yes we did yes nancy prue the next question and brian you may want to contribute on this as well brian our cfo is in the room does that take distribution from cash and do you issuing your share if you’re issuing your share how does its impact dilution brian hook as most of you may know every year our fourth quarter distribution we provide shareholders the option and to make the election to take that fourth quarter distribution in cash or stock this year we have seen the results of that election we have seen that a very significant portion of our shareholder base does elect to take the amount in stock as a result of that we do issue new shares for that stock that is elected this year we issued about  million shares a part of that is offset by the buybacks that we do that we mentioned earlier and the impact that dilution it does dilute the net asset value it had approximately  to  impact on nav per share which on a percentage basis is less than half of  so not a significant impact on the net asset value meanwhile just as a reminder that for those that do take stock it does provide them the opportunity because we are trading at a discount to buy new shares at a discounted price nancy prue we have one more question i’m asking you could just provide a little bit more detail about the type of investments in the energy fund is it a diversify fund is it a small cap fund what are the type of investments brian hook the interesting part about the energy sector within adx is that as i said earlier the largest position is in peo and it’s a wonderful position to be in as i mentioned the same management team is responsible for the decisions in peo as in adx we do have a dedicated fundamental analysts that are working on that fund in the energy sector and so we are responsible for the decisions that are made there which is really really nice one of the things that is very attractive about peo right now we really feel comfortable with our positioning in the permian basin greg buckley and mike kijesky have done a really good job of positioning the fund so that we are taking advantage of a number of stocks some of them midcap some of them smaller cap but companies that are specifically dedicated to the delaware and midland pieces of the permian and so we feel very good about that as i mentioned earlier halliburton was one of our real big outperformance for the year mike has done a really good job of navigating through what has been a difficult time for large cap service companies and we’ve benefited there and greg has done a wonderful job in our ep lineup we have a large percentage of peo that is dedicated to ep and as i mentioned a lot of that specifically targeted to the best basin in the world which is the permian so we feel really comfortable with the position we have in peo and what the underlying stocks within peo give to the adx shareholders nancy prue along with that mark the question is coming in its looks like we are paying two management fees because of the ownership in peo i’m asking is that advantageous kind of brian or larry you may – larry our general counsel is in as well we don’t really have our management fee which you’ve – i will throw that up which of you three you would like to tackle that in terms of paying the management fee by having peo in the fund as well brian hook well we – i think it’s fair to say that we are paying something for that i think that one of the real attractive parts is that what we have in the management fee is pretty low for an actively managed fund but there’s no question that there is a little drag as it relates to happen the expenses of that funds for what we own in adx i will also tell you that i’m very comfortable with the ownership piece with that as a backdrop or as a drag nancy prue we have a question coming in asking about our use of etf could you explain how you use etf mark stoeckle that’s a really good question i probably should have addressed that earlier our use of the etf is quite simple if we own a stock today in any sector and we believe today is the right day to sell it and we don’t have a high conviction name that we would like to put it in we will temporarily park that money in an etf so as an example if we have a industrial’s company that we want to sell but we don’t have a name for it we will park the money shortterm in the xli which is the industrial’s etf and it’s really just trying to monetize the position within industrials as many of our shareholders probably have observed as we try to run with as little cash as possible and so we want to be fully invested our commitment towards shareholders is we will be fully invested and in order to do that – if there is a stock that we don’t want to own today – in order to do that effectively monetize the cash we do that by the sector etfs so it’s a shortterm place to park money until we find a good idea to roll that money into nancy prue i have another question up here and i’m going to probably turn this one over to brian they’re asking about our expense ratio which was in last year’s expense ratio of  could you educate us on that please brian hook sure so last year in  our expense ratio in peo was  that included a nonrecurring charge related to the termination of our defined benefit plan without that charge that ratio was  for this year for  it is a more normalized expense ratio and the peo ratio is at  that’s  nancy prue okay the next question they’re asking us that if we have considered issuing our preferred stock or preferred equity brian hook the real reason behind – from an investment standpoint from – for issuing a preferred would be effectively to get some leverage to be able to have additional capital to invest i will tell you that’s not my strong suit i’ve never really used leverage in that way the cost to preferred we did look at it we looked at a number of different ways to incorporate leverage in the fund and there were two things to that one is even the preferred is really pretty expensive relative to what we think you get number two we would like only use that kind of leverage at market extremes extremely oversold and those don’t happen that often so the cost of a preferred given how we would use it really the risk reward isn’t good enough so that’s why we have decided to pass on using a preferred nancy prue okay we have one more question in the queue operator instructions and this question is just asking why our distributions are – for the first three quarters are small and then we pay the largest distribution at the end of the year why we do it that way is it going to stay that way and you want to take one more mark stoeckle i will start and if brian wants to chime in if i forget something yes please do but we’ve talked about this with the board i will tell you that we’ve been doing that for a very long time and it’s something that we are comfortable with from an operational standpoint and i think it continues to be a good way to provide distributions so i don’t see any – i personally don’t see anything on the horizon that would make me feel like that was something that we needed to change in the finals is there anything else that you would add to that brian hook just that the fourth quarter distribution really is our capital gain it comprises mostly our capital gain distributions so of course everyone knows the market can be very volatile throughout the year so without knowing for sure as we get – until we get closer to the year end what that capital gain distribution will be it is more advantageous to wait till later in the year to pay that out and as we all know too we’re required to pay out all of our distributions in order to be very tax efficient as we are nancy prue great and we do have another question coming in and he’s asking mark what is kind of our sales that anymore value or more growth in the fund and then the second piece of that is to talk about active share in the portfolio mark stoeckle sure the easiest way to describe that is we are the quintessential core portfolio i would say that the best way that i’ve been able to describe what we do to our shareholders is i believe we are growing at a reasonable price but if you were to put our adx into a style analyzer you’d find us smack dab in the middle but i do think that in general if you look at the statistics of the funds statistics on any given year you will find that we get a little bit more growth in the fund and pay a little bit less for little more growth in the sp pay a little bit less for it than the sp so a little bit of a valueish but i would say rather than say it’s a value i think it’s more growth at reasonable price although you could say that that’s splitting hairs and the active share is just under  nancy prue okay not seeing any more questions come in i’d like to thank all of you for your interest in adams fund we will be holding our next call in july but in the interim please feel free to contact me or

interview with mark e stoeckle ceo of adams express co and petroleum  resources corp  tribunedigitalbaltimoresun home→collections→baltimore sunfive questions for  mark stoecklefor mark stoeckle new ceo of baltimore fund companiesbaltimore mdmay  this is mark e stoeckle chief… barbara haddock taylor…june  by eileen ambrose the baltimore sunfor more than two decades baltimore fund companies adams express co and petroleum  resources corp had been under the direction of a single ceo and chairmanbut with the retirement of doug ober this year the two have seen a shakeup at the toplongtime director kathleen mcgahran who is based in florida was named chair and to find a ceo the companies went to massachusettsmark e stoeckle had been the chief investment officer of the us equities and global sector funds for bnp paribas investment partners in boston before he was tapped to take over as ceo in february ober who aided in the search of his successor said the companies wanted a ceo with a strong investment background who could improve funds performanceadams express and petroleum  resources have been operating as closedend funds since  they have a fixed number of shares that are bought and sold on exchanges like a stock the shares can be sold at a premium or a discount depending on market demandthe baltimore sun recently checked in with stoeckle who has been on the job for nearly four monthswhat are the challenges of filling the shoes of a longtime ceo at fund companies with lengthy historiesthe first challenge is to establish rapport and respect with a group that has been led by the same ceo for over  years doug was well liked and respected and not having him there takes time for people to process i think the best approach and the one im taking is to be myself and listen a lot the second challenge is to make sure whatever changes i make are done carefully and thoughtfully the companies have a very rich history and have been doing good things for a long time my objective is to take all the good things that are being done and add some of the things that ive had success with in my careerhow did an english major get into high finance something lots of new college grads probably want to knowfirst of all i am very proud to have been an english major my senior adviser told me that english majors can do anything i took her at her word there are very few english majors in finance and i think thats a shame my guess is some people shy away from the quantitative or statistical part of finance the dirty little secret is most of the math we do is not much more difficult than addition subtraction multiplication and division i went for an mba because in the early s it was difficult to get into finance without one these days its different the ability to think critically question exhaustively and know excel will equip you to do well i am always encouraging liberal arts majors to look at a career in financeyouve held a wide variety of jobs selling baby products just out of college for johnson  johnson working as an investment banker for bear stearns — long before its collapse — as well as launching a hedge fund and managing portfolios for investment firms how will these experiences shape how you run the baltimore fund companiesi feel incredibly blessed to have had such a broad range of experiences i think thats what i bring to adams and petroleum — a diverse background of experiences rooted in a strong investment philosophy and process i have had the opportunity to work with some very talented mentors over the years ive tried to take the best of each of them and develop my own style developing a core set of values treating people fairly and getting the most out of them is much of what ive learned and i believe will serve us well at both companiesyour predecessor doug ober participated in the search for his replacement saying the companies were looking for someone who could work on improving the performance of the funds how do you plan to do thatour work early on will be focused on portfolio structure and risk we have good fundamental analysis capability at both companies but need to work on how to put it all in a portfolio that achieves our investment objectives within a certain risk budget said differently finding stocks that will go up is different than assembling a group of stocks in a sector that work together from both a risk and return perspective to achieve our goals its certainly a different approach than has been taken historically but one that is imminently doable and should serve to enhance performance and consistencyas a pittsburgh native youre a steelers fan and your many years in boston have made you a red sox supporter what would it take to get you to switch allegiances to the ravens and oriolesok this is by far the hardest of the five questions steeler black and gold is in my veins and over  years in boston has made me a total boston sports fan except when the patriots play the steelers the best i can do is tell you i respect both teams and will do my best to start liking purple and orange although i cant make any promisesmark e stoeckle    next morethe misunderstood rule of
