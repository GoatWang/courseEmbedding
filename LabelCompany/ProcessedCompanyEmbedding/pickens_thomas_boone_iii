pickens attended texas am university for one year then transferred to oklahoma am at stillwater majoring in geology in  he married lynn obrien whom he had dated on and off since high school within a year their first child deborah was born the couple had three more children pam mike and thomas boone iii pickens graduated in  and took a job as an onsite geologist with phillips petroleum in bartlesville oklahoma by  pickens was frustrated with work in the fields he quit his job and worked for a while as an independent oilman in  he invested  and with two partners formed petroleum exploration inc pei shrewd financier financial world described peis early years as a series of successful ventures in which pickens demonstrated shrewd financial instincts and a creative approach to raising capital the company went public in  and was renamed mesa petroleum during its first year mesa had revenues of  million and a net income of  in  mesa merged with hugoton production company giving mesa the leverage it needed to expand exploration and production operations pickens considered the acquisition the most important deal mesa ever made the next year mesa failed to take over southland royalty three years later mesa bought pubco petroleum in  he was outbid by southland in his attempt to purchase aztec a gas company pickens divorced in  and a year later he married beatrice carr stuart a divorcee with four daughters whom he had first met in  bea was by pickens side throughout his subsequent career serving as a confidante adviser and sounding board according to his autobiography spotted trends pickens ability to spot trends helped mesa grow pei began oil exploration in canada in  twenty years later according to financial world mesa got out of canada … at a time when the country looked like fertile ground for american oil concerns but it wasnt long before canada took everyone else by surprise by implementing a new energy policy greatly favoring canadian enterprises pickens left the country with more than  million also in  pickens withdrew from the north sea netting  million when he left he avoided a new british tax on north sea oil production pickens formed the first large publicly traded oil royalty trust using mesa properties in  stockholders were issued one trust unit per mesa share under this arrangement the cash flow of properties held in trust are distributed to stockholders management cannot spend the cash flow from those properties by  mesa was a major independent oil company with assets of more than  billion oversupplies of oil at this time caused prices to drop and pickens looked for new ways to make money according to william c wertz of financial world he pickens became a financier instead of an oilman and turned dealmaking on wall street into a highly lucrative enterprise that inspired many imitators pickens launched a series of attempts to take over other often larger oil companies among his targets were cities service superior oil general american oil of texas and kn energy none of the acquisitions succeeded but pickens overtures drove up the prices of his targets stocks netting him and other investors millions of dollars pickens became known as a greedy corporate raider and greenmailer an investor who threatens to take over a company by buying large blocks of stock then selling the stock back for huge profits pickens preferred to describe himself as an advocate for stockholders he targeted companies that he believed were mismanaged by executives who held little stock in their own companies his first large takeover attempt was cities service a company  times as large as mesa in early  pickens owned four million shares of cities service stock representing about five percent of the total when cities services management rebuffed his attempt at a merger he sought partners for a hostile takeover what followed was an month struggle between the two oil companies mesa prepared a tender offer for  percent of cities stock a tender offer was one of the takeover strategies of the s in which a company offered stockholders of a target company a premium price for their stock before mesa could make its offer cities service made an offer for mesa putting pickens in danger of losing his company pickens who was a master at public relations was now viewed in the media as an underdog eventually both companies offers fell through and cities service was acquired by occidental petroleum pickens made  million on his four million shares of cities service stock battled gulf oil in  pickens embarked on the most highly publicized deal of his career when he began acquiring stock in gulf oil gulf was the sixth largest oil company in america with annual revenues of  billion but the companys oil reserves were low and its stock was undervalued like many other oil companies gulf was investing a lot of money in exploration with little results high organization of petroleum exporting countries opec prices had maintained oil companies cash flows in previous years but by  prices were down leaving the oil companies in trouble peter nulty reported in the december   issue of fortune that pickens described oil companies as being in a state of liquidation and suggested that they liquidate efficiently by pipelining more cash flow to shareholders as a return of capital and less to exploration and diversification this pickens said would force the companies undervalued stocks to go up the large oil companies disagreed with pickens arguing that oil prices would eventually go back up and that there would be more large oil finds and alternative energy sources to develop pickens believed the oil industry needed to restructure and he set about being a catalyst for change in the biggest fight of his career he targeted gulf oil for restructuring he formed the gulf investment group gig which acquired  percent of gulf stock as gulfs largest stockholder gig asked management to place part of its domestic oil and gasproducing properties in a royalty trust since mesa created the first royalty trust other oil companies had done the same stock prices for oil companies whose properties were put in trusts were generally higher than those without pickens stood to gain  million in profit on the plan management refused gigs request and initiated a proxy fight in which stockholders were asked to vote for or against managements decision the battle between pickens and gulf oil was one of the most publicized business stories of the year and made pickens name synonymous with corporate takeover gulf management told stockholders that pickens had a history of hitandrun tactics and that a royalty trust was a get rich quick scheme that would cripple the company and severely penalize the majority of the stockholders pickens had positioned himself as a champion of oil company shareholders many of whom were retirees and pension holders texas monthlys gregory curtis said that pickens claimed to be warring on the lazy or ineffective corporate managers who seemed to think they owned the company themselves rather than the stockholders managers who cared more about their own salary and perquisites than they did about the best interests of the stockholders… itwasa message the country was ready to hear when the proxy votes were counted in december  gulf oil management won by a narrow margin within six months gulf was bought by standard oil of california gulfs  shareholders reaped profits of  billion including gigs  million profit the federal government reacted to the mergermania when congress attempted to pass a bill that would curb oil company mergers pickens lobbied against the bill saying it was not the governments responsibility to protect companies with weak management he also believed that the oil industry should be allowed to restructure itself the bill was defeated pickens subsequently battled other oil companies including phillips and unocal reaping millions for mesa petroleum he later failed in an attempt to gain a seat on the board of a japanese auto parts manufacturer in august  pickens launched the united stockholders association usa a nonprofit group dedicated to defending shareholders rights within three months usa had  members declining popularity pickens demonstrated his competitive spirit away from wall street as well he has enjoyed tennis and racquetball throughout his life he also plays golf and poker and hunts quail he and his wife bea were active in amarillo bea worked on a project to build an ambulatory cancer center in the city pickens a republican campaigned for texas politicians and considered running for governor in  pickens popularity declined in the late s he became embroiled in political disputes and led a boycott of the amarillo newspaper he angered many people when he backed an unpopular president of west texas state university where he was chairman of the board of regents pickens moved mesa from amarillo to dallas in  disparaging the town he had lived in since he was a boy in  after several years of debt pickens was forced to resign as mesas chairman he and bea divorced around the same time pickens retained two businesses a natural gas trading company and a southern california fueling firm which he continues to operate when pickens left mesa after  years joseph nocera of fortune noted that the oncecontroversial chairman who dominated the front pages of newspapers ten years previously had faded into obscurity nocera wrote more than any other raider … boone changed the world while corporate

promotes a radical reduction in the united states dependency upon foreign energy particularly oil provided by nations in the opec cartel although the plan calls for introduction of various

united states to utilize its wind corridor in the middle of the country stretching from texas northerly through the great plains to the canada–us border he noted in congressional testimony in july  that his plan would generate new jobs and provide economic stimulus to this area while noting that it would also require new transmission lines which traditionally antagonize some environmentalists andor nearby populations the announcement of the plan also coincides with pickens need for federal subsidies for wind to be renewed as he has already begun placing orders for his planned wind farm in
