agrawal july    views how as an emerging saas company do you nail your business model get your engineers to truly understand customer needs and finally go toetotoe with legacy competitors appdynamics former ceo jyoti bansal continues his discussion on these topics and others in his “saas adventure” video interview with battery’s neeraj agrawal you can view the first three segments of the discussion here in segment  above bansal discusses how appdynamics approaches the classic software “freemium” model—offering a version of a product for free then charging for premium services originally bansal says the company offered appdynamics light a limitedfunctionality version of its product free on an unlimited basis but the company learned that customers appreciated the product more if they used the full product first so now appdynamics provides the full version free for  days after that freemium users are converted to limitedfunctionality version by experiencing the full functionality and value of the product up front bansal describes how the company has already “done much of the selling without anyone even talking to us” segment  customercentric engineering and breaking down barriers are engineers and enterprisesoftware customers from two different planets they are at many tech companies but don’t have to be bansal says in the next segment here bansal discusses the importance of engineers being familiar with actual customer problems so they can build better products to help solve them at appdynamics this is called “customercentric engineering” engineers are encouraged to sit in on phone or video sales presentations so they can get a feel for customer needs and preferences and learn what aspects of the appdynamics product seem to resonate with customers the most during demos “engineers are smart people” bansal says “if you make it easy for them to understand the problem they will come up with solutions breaking the barriers between engineers and customers is the fastest way to innovate” on the sales side bansal counsels other founders to change the type of sales leadership they encourage through various phases of their companies’ growth leading sales at a company with under  million in revenue involves different processes than running the sales department at a company with  million to  million in revenue and certainly more than  billion segment  competitive advantages here bansal discusses his perspective on the secret to appdynamics competitive success—fostering startups within a startup bansal’s philosophy he notes is that small teams innovate the best “they are more customer aligned more innovation aligned and you don’t need to build process around them” he shares the story about how as appdynamics began to scale and put more processes in place he found that the company began to slow down this he states was concerning “the reason we are out innovating the legacy companies who have no shortage of money is because we are small nimble and fast moving if we don’t remain that our main competitive advantage goes away” so appdynamics split the company into small organizations of no more than  people to function as ‘startups within a startup’ in this segment bansal also discusses his approach to customer success an emerging business function designed to ensure customers gain full value from a company’s products and continue to purchase from the company year after year “everything you do” bansal advises to fellow entrepreneurs “you should do to make your customers successful at appdyanmics customer success is everyone’s job within the company” this approach has gained appdynamics a net promoter score of  this measure of how likely customers are to recommend the brand is higher than scores gained by muchloved consumer brands like apple and amazon jyoti bansal was the second guest in agrawal’s saas adventure videointerview series in the series agrawal analyzes the
