forthcoming does social interaction improve service quality field evidence in massive open online education manufacturing  service operations management msom van mieghem jan a and itai gurvich forthcoming collaboration and multitasking in networks prioritization and achievable capacity management sciencemotivated by the trend towards more collaboration in team work we study networks where some tasks require the simultaneous processing by multiple types of multitasking human or indivisible resources the capacity of such networks is generally smaller than the bottleneck capacity in gurvich and van mieghem  we proved that both capacities are equal in networks with a hierarchical collaboration architecture which define a collaboration level for each task depending on how many types of resources it requires relative to other network tasks this paper studies how task prioritization impacts the capacity of such hierarchical networks using a conceptual queuing framework that formalizes coordination and switching idleness to maximize the capacity of a team highest priority should be given to the tasks that require the most collaboration otherwise a mismatch between priority levels and collaboration levels inevitably inflicts a capacity loss we demonstrate this essential tradeoff between task prioritization quality of service and capacity productivity in a basic collaborative network and in parallel networks to manage this tradeoff we present a hierarchical threshold priority policy that balances switching and coordination idleness zhang j eric park itai gurvich jan a van mieghem robert s young and mark v williams  hospital readmissions reduction program a financial and operational analysis management science  the hospital readmission reduction program hrrp a part of the us patient protection and affordable care act requires the centers for medicare and medicaid services to penalize payments to hospitals with excess readmissions we take an economic and operational patient flow perspective to ask a simple question assuming that hospitals are selfinterested operatingmargin maximizers and are strategically forwardlooking does the structure of the hrrp policy provide economic incentives to all hospitals to reduce readmissions if not which hospitals are left behind and what are the challenges since hospitals are benchmarked against their peers under the policy we use a gametheoretical model to describe hospitals behavior while the game is complex we develop bounds on equilibria that provide insights into the effectiveness of the hrrp policy we calibrate our model with a dataset of hospitals in california our model suggests that in the long term a significant proportion of hospitals will prefer to pay penalties rather than reduce readmissions for a broad range of parameters we find that the policy may be ineffective in inducing some hospitals to reduce readmissions these are hospitals that either i are located in sparsely served areas ii have a low fraction of revenue coming from medicare iii have currently high readmission rates or iv have a high contribution margin per patient we also examine the effect of certain changes to the hrrp policy gurvich itai and jan a van mieghem  collaboration and multitasking in networks architectures bottlenecks and throughput manufacturing  service operations management msom  motivated by the trend towards more collaboration in work flows we study stochastic processing networks where some activities require the simultaneous collaboration of multiple human resources collaboration introduces resource synchronization requirements that are not captured in the standard procedure formalized through a static planning problem to identify bottlenecks and theoretical capacity we introduce the notions of collaboration architecture and unavoidable idleness in general collaboration architectures may feature unavoidable idleness so that the theoretical capacity exceeds the maximal achievable throughput or actual capacity this fundamental tradeoff between collaboration and throughput does not disappear in multiserver networks and has important ramifications to servicesystem staffing we identify a special class of collaboration architectures that have no unavoidable idleness and present a condition on this architecture that guarantees regardless of the processing times of the various activities that the standard bottleneck procedure in fact identifies the actual capacity of the network in multiserver cases this class of networks guarantees that the theoretical capacity is achievable provided one has the right number of floaters finally we study the subtleties that collaboration introduces to questions of flexibility investment unavoidable idleness may limit the ability to materialize the benefits of flexibility we study the interplay of flexibility and unavoidable idleness and offer remedies derived from collaboration architecture allon gad achal bassamboo jan a van mieghem and r cui  information sharing in supply chains an empirical and theoretical valuation management science  we provide an empirical and theoretical assessment of the value of information sharing in a twostage supply chain the value of downstream sales information to the upstream firm stems from improving upstream order fulfillment forecast accuracy such an improvement can lead to lower safety stock and better service based on the data collected from a cpg company we empirically show that if the company includes the downstream sales data to forecast orders the improvement in the mean squared forecast error ranges from  to  across all studied products theoretical models in the literature however suggest that the value of information sharing should be zero for over half of our studied products to reconcile the gap between the literature and the empirical observations we develop a new theoretical model while the literature assumes that the decision maker strictly adheres to a given inventory policy our model allows him to deviate accounting for private information held by the decision maker yet unobservable to the econometrician this turns out to reconcile our empirical findings with the literature these decision deviations lead to information losses in the order process resulting in a strictly positive value of downstream information sharing furthermore we empirically quantify and show the significance of the value of operations knowledge  the value of knowing the downstream replenishment policy van mieghem jan a and robert boute  global dual sourcing and order smoothing the impact of capacity and leadtimes management science  after decades of offshoring production across the world companies are rethinking their global networks local sourcing is receiving more attention but it remains challenging to balance the offshore sourcing cost advantage against the increased inventories because of its longer lead time and against the cost and volume flexibility of each source’s capacity to guide strategic allocation in this global network decision this paper establishes reasonably simple prescriptions that capture the key drivers we adopt a conventional discretetime inventory model with a linear control rule that smoothes orders and allows an exact and analytically tractable analysis of single and dualsourcing policies under normal demand distinguishing features of our model are that it captures each source’s lead time capacity cost and flexibility to work overtime we use lagrange’s inversion theorem to provide exact and simple squareroot bound formulae for the strategic sourcing allocations and the value of dual sourcing the formulae provide structural insight on the impact of financial operational and demand parameters and a starting point for quantitative decision making we investigate the robustness of our results by comparing the smoothing policy with existing single and dualsourcing models in a simulation study that relaxes model assumptions huang tingliang and jan a van mieghem  clickstream data and inventory management model and empirical analysis production and operations management  we consider firms that feature their products on the internet but take orders offline click and order data are disjoint on such nontransactional websites and their matching is errorprone yet their time separation may allow the firm to react and improve its tactical planning we introduce a dynamic decision support model that augments the classic inventory planning model with additional clickstream state variables using a novel data set of matched online clickstream and offline purchasing data we identify statistically significant clickstream variables and empirically investigate the value of clickstream tracking on nontransactional websites to improve inventory management we show that the noisy clickstream data is statistically significant to predict the propensity amount and timing of offline orders a counterfactual analysis shows that using the demand information extracted from the clickstream data can reduce the inventory holding and backordering cost by  to  in our data set van mieghem jan a  rs of om research relevance and rewards manufacturing  service operations management msom   this article presents three personal

distinguished fellow inaugural lecture given at columbia university on june   huang tingliang and jan a van mieghem  the promise of strategic customer behavior on the value of click tracking production and operations management  recent internet clickstracking technology has generated the fast growing practice of web analytics and extensive ongoing research in academia motivated by empirical evidence we study whether strategic consumers are willing to click to reveal their advance demand information adi and preferences we show that by embracing clicks tracking technology operations management can bring significant improvements in firm profit we compare the new technology to traditional practices such as quantity commitment availability guarantees and quick response and distinguish three different effectswe show that the efficiency effect from better matching uncertain demand and the learning effect from contingent pricing are much more significant than the

operations research   chod jiri nils rudi and jan a van mieghem  mix time and volume flexibility valuation and corporate diversification review of business and economics  flexibility measures the ability to adapt to change and often has multiple dimensions that impact value jointly yet differently we assess this joint impact in a theoretical model of a twoproduct firm that makes capacity output and pricing decisions at three points in time with an underlying continuoustime information evolution the firms ability to adapt is characterized by three types of flexibility the cost of switching capacity between the two products measures the firms mix flexibility the fraction of product costs that are postponed until demand information is updated measures the firms volume flexibility finally the relative timing of the output decision measures the firms time flexibility we show that mix and volume flexibilities are substitutes in creating firm value but both are complementary to time flexibility furthermore the marginal values of mix and time flexibility are decreasing in demand correlation whereas the marginal value of volume flexibility increases in demand correlation we discuss the implications of these results to the tradeoffs faced by managers when deciding how much to invest in different aspects of flexibility we also relate these results to corporate strategy and show when different types of flexibility can justify a company to pursue market diversification bassamboo achal ramandeep s randhawa and jan a van mieghem  optimal flexibility configurations in newsvendor networks going beyond chaining and pairing management science  we study the classical problem of capacity and flexible technology selection with a newsvendor network model of resource portfolio investment the resources differ by their level of flexibility where level  k flexibility refers to the ability to process k different product types we present an exact settheoretic methodology to analyze newsvendor networks with multiple products and parallel resources this simple approach is sufficiently powerful to prove that i flexibility exhibits decreasing returns and ii the optimal portfolio will invest in at most two adjacent levels of flexibility in symmetric systems and to characterize iii the optimal flexibility configuration for asymmetric systems as well the optimal flexibility configuration can serve as a theoretical performance benchmark for other configurations suggested in the literature for example although chaining is not optimal in our setting the gap is small and the inclusion of scale economies quickly favors chaining over pairing we also demonstrate how this methodology can be applied to other settings such as product substitution and queuing systems with parameter uncertainty allon gad and jan a van mieghem  the mexicochina sourcing game teaching global dual sourcing informs transactions on education  we describe a threehour class on global dual sourcing built around a game that demonstrates the challenges in making operational decisions and transfers recent academic insights to the classroom student teams manage a firm with access to a responsive but expensive supply source mexico and a cheap but remote source china each team must determine a sourcing strategy to satisfy random demand that is revealed throughout the game in each period teams place orders to both sources and manage two assets inventory and their bank account the goal is to maximize each teams value final bank balance during the debriefings we analyze the policies use by different teams along both financial and operational metrics present the optimal strategy and summarize the experimental learning points chod jiri nils rudi and jan a van mieghem  operational flexibility and financial hedging complements or substitutes management science  we consider a risksensitive firm that invests in capacity under demand uncertainty and thus faces two related but distinct types of risk mismatch between capacity and demand and profit variability while mismatch risk can be mitigated with greater operational flexibility profit variability can be reduced through financial hedging we show that the relationship between these two risk mitigating strategies depends on the type of flexibility product flexibility and financial hedging tend to be complements substitutes ie product flexibility tends to increase decrease the value of financial hedging and vice versa financial hedging tends to increase decrease the value of product flexibility when product demands are positively negatively correlated in contrast to product flexibility postponement flexibility is a substitute to financial hedging as intuitively expected our results rely in part on analytical proofs and in part on numerical analysis allon gad and jan a van mieghem  global dual sourcing tailored base surge allocation to near and offshore production management science  when designing a sourcing strategy in practice a key task is to determine the average order rates placed to each source because that affects costs and supplier management we consider a firm that has access to a responsive nearshore source eg mexico and a lowcost offshore source eg china the firm must determine an inventory sourcing policy to satisfy random demand over time unfortunately the optimal policy is too complex to allow a direct answer to our key question therefore we analyze a tailored basesurge tbs sourcing policy that is simple used in practice and captures the classic tradeoff between cost and responsiveness the tbs policy replenishes at a constant rate from the offshore source and produces at the near shore plant only when inventory is below a target the constant base allocation allows the offshore facility to focus on cost efficiency while the nearshores quick response capability is utilized only dynamically to guarantee high service the research goals are to i determine the allocation of random demand into base and surge capacity ii estimate corresponding working capital requirements and iii identify and value the key drivers of dual sourcing given that even this simple tbs policy is not amenable to exact analysis we investigate a brownian approximation that yields a simple square root formula that is insightful to answer our questions and sufficiently accurate for practice as is demonstrated with a validation study lu lauren xiaoyuan jan a van mieghem and rcanan savaskanebert  incentives for quality through endogenous

investigate how network design impacts capacity requirements and responsiveness which is a natural performance indicator of quality of service inspired by the contrasting network design approaches of fedex and ups we study when two service classes eg express or regular should be served by dedicated resources eg air or ground or by an integrated network we present analytic expressions for the delay distributions and the network integration value which show how the value of network integration depends on the quality of service guarantees speed and reliability of service and the demand characteristics averages volume and variance of each service class and their correlation our results suggests that operating dedicated networks is a fine strategy meaning that network integration is of little value if the firm primarily serves express requests with high reliability and if the correlation with regular requests is not strongly negative lu lauren xiaoyuan and jan a van mieghem  multimarket facility network design with offshoring applications manufacturing  service operations management msom  moving production to lowwage countries may reduce manufacturing costs but increases logistics costs and introduces foreign trade barriers among others this paper studies a manufacturers multimarket facility network design problem and investigates the offshoring decision from a network capacity investment perspective we analyze a firm that manufactures two products to serve two geographically separated markets using a common component and two localized final assembly the common part can be transported between the two markets that have different demand and economic characteristics two strategic network design questions arise naturally in this context  should the common part be produced centrally or in two local facilities  if a centralization strategy is adopted for the common component which market should the facility be located in we present a transportation cost threshold that captures costs revenues and demand risks and below which centralization is optimal the optimal location of commonality crucially depends on the relative magnitude of price and manufacturing cost differentials but also on demand size and uncertainty incorporating scale economies further enlarges the centralizations optimality region finally we translate our results into

in newsvendor networks resource diversification flexibility sharing and hedging management science  this paper studies how judicious resource allocation in networks mitigates risk theory is presented for general utility functions and meanvariance formulations and is illustrated with networks featuring resource diversification flexibility eg inventory substitution and sharing commonality in contrast to singleresource settings riskaverse newsvendors may invest more in networks than riskneutral newsvendors some resources and even total spending may exceed riskneutral levels with normally distributed demand riskaverse newsvendors change resource levels roughly proportionally to demand variance while riskneutral agents adjust only proportionally to standard deviation two effects explain this operational hedge and suggest rules of thumb for strategic placement of safety capacity and inventory in networks  risk pooling suggests rebalancing capacity toward inexpensive resources that serve lower profit variance markets this highlights the role of profit variance instead of demand variance in riskaverse network investment  expost revenue maximization suggests rebalancing capacity toward flexible but away from shared capacity when markets differ in profitability capacity imbalance and allocation flexibility thus mitigate profit risk and truly are operational hedges schmidt

fluidmodel approach for admission and sequencing control european journal of operational research  we study how multiproduct queueing systems should be controlled so that sojourn times or endtoend delays do not exceed specified leadtimes the network dynamically decides when to admit new arrivals and how to sequence the jobs in the system to analyze this difficult problem we propose an approach based on fluid model analysis that translates the leadtime specifications into deterministic constraints on the queue length vector the main benefit of this approach is that it is possible and relatively easy to construct scheduling and multiproduct admission policies for leadtime control additional results are a while this approach is simpler than a heavytraffic approach the admission policies that emerge from it are also more specific than but consistent with those from heavytraffic analysis b a simulation study gives a first indication that the policies also perform well in stochastic systems c our approach specifies a tailored admission region for any given sequencing policy such joint admission and sequencing control is robust in the following sense system performance is relatively insensitive to the particular choice of sequencing rule when used in conjunction with tailored admission control as an example we discuss the tailored admission regions for two wellknown sequencing policies generalized processor sharing and generalized longest queue d while we first focus on the multiproduct single server system we do extend to networks and identify some subtleties

management science  commonality strategies assemble different products from at least one common component and one other productspecific component the distinguishing feature of commonality ie the presence of dedicated components to be assembled with a common component is shown to be mathematically inconsequential in the sense that the unified commonality problem for two products can be reduced to an equivalent substitution flexibility problem without those dedicated components this significant simplification provides the first general closedform condition for commonality adoption and identifies its value drivers commonality is optimal even for perfectly correlated demands if products have sufficiently different margins this introduces the revenue maximization option of commonality as a second benefit that is independent of the traditional risk pooling benefit pure commonality strategies are never optimal unless complexity costs are introduced dual sourcing externalities and operational hedging features of commonality are discussed van mieghem jan a  capacity management investment and hedging review and recent developments manufacturing  service operations management msom   this article reviews the literature on strategic capacity management concerned with determining the sizes types and timing of capacity investments and adjustments under uncertainty specific attention is given to recent developments to incorporate multiple decision makers multiple capacity types hedging and risk aversion capacity is a measure of processing abilities and limitations and is represented as a vector of stocks of various processing resources while investment is the change of capacity and includes expansion and contraction after discussing general issues in capacity investment problems the article reviews models of capacity investment under uncertainty in three settings the first reviews optimal capacity investment by single and multiple riskneutral decision makers in a stationary environment where capacity remains constant allowing for multiple capacity types the associated optimal capacity portfolio specifies the amounts and locations of safety capacity in a processing network its key feature is that it is unbalanced ie regardless of how uncertainties are realized one typically will never fully utilize all capacities the second setting reviews the adjustment of capacity over time and the structure of optimal investment dynamics the article ends by reviewing how to incorporate riskaversion in capacity investment and contrasts hedging strategies involving financial versus operational means van mieghem jan a  due date scheduling asymptotic optimality of generalized longestqueue and generalized largest delay rules operations research  consider the following duedate scheduling problem in a multiclass acyclic singlestation service system any class k job arriving at time t must be served by its due date equivalently its delay must not exceed a given delay or leadtime d in a stochastic system the constraint must be interpreted in a probabilistic sense regardless of the precise probabilistic formulation however the associated optimal control problem is intractable with exact analysis this article proposes a new formulation that incorporates the constraint through a sequence of convexincreasing delay cost functions this formulation reduces the intractable optimal scheduling problem into one for which the generalized gc rule scheduling rule is known to be asymptotically optimal the gc rule simplifies here to a generalized longest queue

manufacturing  service operations management msom   we introduce a class of models called newsvendor networks that generalizes the wellknown newsven dor model along three dimensions newsvendor networks model the flow of multiple products through multiple processing and storage points over multiple time periods such models provide a parsimonious framework to study various problems of stochastic capacity investment and inventory procurement newsvendor networks can feature commonality flexibility substitution or transshipment in addition to assembly and distribution newsvendor networks are stochastic models with recourse that are characterized by linear revenue and cost structures and a linear inputoutput transformation while capacity and inventory decisions are locked in before demand uncertainty is resolved as usual some managerial discretion can remain via expost inputoutput activity decisions this discretion is captured through nonbasic activities that model input or resourcesubstitution and that result in subtle pooling effects nonbasic activities are never used in a deterministic environment their value stems from the discre tionary flexibility to meet stochastic demand deviations from the operating point the optimal capacity and inventory decisions balance overages with underages continuing the classic newsvendor analogy the optimal balancing conditions can be interpreted as specifying multiple critical fractiles of the multivariate demand distribution this paper shows that the properties of optimal singleperiod newsvendor network solutions extend to a dynamic setting under plausible conditions indeed we establishes dynamic optimality of inventory and capacity policies for the lost sales case depending on the nonbasic activities this also extends to the backordering case analytic and simulationbased solution techniques and graphical interpretations are presented and illustrated by a comprehensive example that features input substitution and a flexible processing resource van mieghem jan a and piet van mieghem  pricecoupled scheduling for differentiated services gcmu vs gps international journal of communication systems  we present an integrated approach to pricing and scheduling for services that are differentiated in terms of throughput delay and loss specifications the key building block to the model are quality value curves that specify a users value of higher quality levels from the analysis emerges a pricing rule that charges based on rate and quality grade and a dynamic scheduling rule called the gcmu rule the analysis also derives the economically optimal probabilistic qos guarantee parameters we compare our model to the deterministic approach of qos guarantees using burstiness constraints and fair scheduling rules the scheduling that arises from such deterministic approach is the wellknown generalized processor sharing gps a comparative analysis inspires the fair gcmups rule as the scheduling rule that combines the unique strengths of gps and gcmu this gcmups rule is proposed as a tailored scheduling solution for both the expedited forwarding class and the four assured forwarding classes in the ietfs differentiated services van mieghem jan a  price and service discrimination in queuing systems incentive compatibility of gcmu scheduling management science  this article studies the optimal prices and service quality grades that a queuing system the firm provides to heterogeneous utilitymaximizing customers who measure quality by their experienced delay distributions results are threefold first delay cost curves are introduced that allow for a flexible description of a customers quality sensitivity second a comprehensive executable approach is proposed that analytically specifies scheduling delay distributions and prices for arbitrary delay sensitivity curves the tractability of this approach derives from porting heavytraffic brownian results into the economic analysis the generalized ct gct scheduling rule that emerges is dynamic so that in general service grades need not correspond to a static priority ranking a benchmarking example investigates the value of differentiated service third the notions of grade and rate incentive compatibility c are introduced to study this system under asymmetric information and are established for gc scheduling when service times are homogeneous and customers atomistic grade c induces correct grade choice resulting in perfect service discrimination rate c additionally induces centralizedoptimal rates dynamic gc scheduling exhibits negative feedback that together with timedependent pricing can also yield rate incentive compatibility with heterogeneous service times

comparative analysis of possible postponement strategies in a twostage decision model where firms make three decisions capacity investment production inventory quantity and price typically investments are made while the demand curve is uncertain the strategies differ in the timing of the operational decisions relative to the realization of uncertainty we show how competition uncertainty and the timing of operational decisions influence the strategic investment decision of the firm and its value in contrast to production postponement price postponement makes the investment and production inventory decisions relatively insensitive to uncertainty this suggests that managers can make optimal capacity decisions by deterministic reasoning if they have some price flexibility under price postponement additional postponement of production has relatively small incremental value therefore it may be worthwhile to consider flexible expost pricing before production postponement reengineering while more postponement increases firm value it is counterintuitive that this also makes the optimal capacity decision more sensitive to uncertainty we highlight the different impact of more timely information which leads to higher investment and inventories and of reduced demand uncertainty which decreases investment and inventories our analysis suggests appropriateness conditions for simple maketostock and maketoorder strategies we also present technical sufficiency and uniqueness conditions under price postponement these results extend to oligopolistic and perfect competition for which pure equilibria are derived interestingly the relative value of operational postponement techniques seems to increase as the industry becomes more competitive van mieghem jan a  coordinating investment production and subcontracting management science  we value the option of subcontracting to improve financial performance and system coordination by analyzing a competitive stochastic investment game with recourse the manufacturer and subcontractor decide separately on their capacity investment levels then demand uncertainty is resolved and both parties have the option to subcontract when deciding on their production and sales we analyze and present outsourcing conditions for three contract types  priceonly contracts where an exante transfer price is set for each unit supplied by the subcontractor  incomplete contracts where both parties negotiate over the subcontracting transfer and  statedependent priceonly and incomplete contracts for which we show an equivalence result while subcontracting with these three contract types can coordinate production decisions in the supply system only statedependent contracts can eliminate all decentralization costs and coordinate capacity investment decisions the minimally sufficient priceonly contract that coordinates our supply chain specifies transfer prices for a small number  in our model of contingent scenarios our gametheoretic model allows the analysis of the role of transfer prices and of the bargaining power of buyer and supplier we find that sometimes firms may be better off leaving some contract parameters unspecified exante and agreeing to negotiate expost also a pricefocused strategy for managing subcontractors can backfire because a lower transfer price may decrease the manufacturers profit finally as with financial options the option value of subcontracting increases as markets are more volatile or more negatively correlated harrison jmichael and jan a van mieghem  multiresource investment strategies operational hedging under demand uncertainty european journal of operational research  consider a firm that markets multiple products each manufactured using several resources representing various types of capital and labor and a linear production technology the firm faces uncertain product demand and has the option to dynamically readjust its resource investment levels thereby changing the capacities of its linear manufacturing process the cost to adjust a resource level either up or down is assumed to be linear the model developed here explicitly incorporates both capacity investment decisions and production decisions and is general enough to include reversible and irreversible investment the product demand vectors for successive periods are assumed to be independent and identically distributed the optimal investment strategy is determined with a multidimensional newsvendor model using demand distributions a technology matrix prices product contribution margins and marginal investment costs our analysis highlights an important conceptual distinction between determin istic and stochastic environments the optimal investment strategy in our stochastic model typically involves some degree of capacity imbalance which can never be optimal when demand is known van mieghem jan a  investment strategies for flexible resources management science  this article studies optimal investment in flexible manufacturing capacity as a function of product prices margins investment costs and multivariate demand uncertainty we consider a twoproduct firm that has the option to invest in productdedicated resources andor in a flexible resource that can produce either product but has to make its investment decision before demands are observed the flexible resource provides the firm with a hedge against demand uncertainty but at a higher investment cost than the dedicated resources our analysis highlights the important role of price margin and cost mix differentials which in addition to the correlation between product demands significantly affect the investment decision and the value of flexibility contrary to the intuition also prevalent in the academic literature we show that it can be advantageous to invest in flexible resources even with erfectly positively correlated product demands harrison jmichael and jan a van

costs so that all factor accumulation is costly to reverse we first consider a general nonstationary case with a concave operating profit function unrestricted form of uncertainty and a horizon of arbitrary length we show that the optimal investment strategy follows a control limit policy at each point in time the state space of the firms problem is partitioned into various domains including a

that incurs a delay cost csubksubtsubksub for each class k job that resides tsubksub units of time in the system this paper derives a scheduling policy that minimizes the total cumulative delay cost when the system operates during a finite time horizon denote the marginal delay cost function and the possibly nonstationary average processing time of class k we call the scheduling policy that at time t serves the oldest waiting job of that class k with the highest index the generalized c rule as a dynamic priority rule that depends on very little data the generalized c rule is attractive to implement we show that with nondecreasing convex delay costs the generalized c rule is asymptotically optimal if the system operates in heavy traffic and give explicit expressions for the associated performance characteristics the delay throughput time process and the minimum cumulative delay cost the optimality result is robust in that it holds for a countable number of classes and several

multiple subclass pattern recognition a maximin correlation approach ieee transactions on pattern analysis and machine intelligence  this paper addresses a correlation based nearest neighbor pattern recognition problem where each class is given as a collection of subclass templates the recognition is performed in two stages in the first stage the class is determined templates for this stage are created using the subclass templates assignment into subclasses occurs in the second stage this two stage approach may be used to accelerate template matching in particular the second stage may be omitted when only the class needs to be determined the authors present a method for optimal aggregation of subclass templates into class templates for each class the new template is optimal in that it maximizes the worst case ie minimum correlation with its subclass templates an algorithm which solves this maximin optimization problem is presented and its correctness is proved in addition test results are provided indicating that the algorithms execution time is polynomial in the number of subclass templates the authors show tight bounds on the maximin correlation the bounds are functions only of the number of original subclass templates and the minimum element in their correlation matrix the algorithm is demonstrated on a multifont optical character recognition problem aviitzhak

algorithm for enhancing the accuracy of the parameter extraction of straight lines in a twodimensional image the algorithm achieves high accuracy in comparatively less computational time than most traditional methods and is invariant under rotation and translation the iterative total least squares itls method starts from an initial estimate of the line parameters when no a priori information about the image is available this estimate can be assigned randomly alternately a lower accuracy method can be used to generate an initial estimate which will result in faster convergence then a rectangular window is centered using the current line approximation and a new line estimate is generated by making a total least squares fit through the pixels contained within the window this is repeated until convergence is reached adaptively adjusting the window size yields the d itls process in addition a pairwise accelerated itls method has been developed which substantially increases the convergence rate we conclude with some examples where the itls method has been used successfully schwerer elizabeth and jan a van mieghem  brownian models of closed queueing networks explicit

simplex building on earlier work by harrison landau ands shepp we develop explicit formulas for various quantities associated with the stationary distribution of rbm in a general triangle and use them to derive approximate performance measures for the closed queueing network in particular we develop approximations for the throughput rate and for moments and tail fractiles of the throughput time distribution also crude bounds on the throughput rate and mean throughput time are proposed finally we present three examples that test the accuracy of both the brownian approximation and our

optimization model for inventory management with two supply sources or modes with general lead times the fast source is more expensive than the slow source while the optimal stochastic policy for nonconsecutive lead times has been unknown for over  years we prove that the optimal robust policy is a dual index dual basestock policy that constrains or caps the slow order optimality is established in a rolling horizon model that can accommodate nonstationary demand as the lead time difference grows the capped dual index policy increasingly smoothes slow orders and for stationary demand converges to the tailored base surge policy which places a constant slow order and has been shown to be asymptotically optimal in an extensive simulation study the capped dual index policy

 have no maturity stage and are best fit by a triangle the fitted plc curves of similar products are clustered either by known product characteristics or by datadriven clustering our key empirical finding is that datadriven clustering of simple triangles and trapezoids which are simpletoestimate and explain performs best for forecasting our conservative outofsample forecast evaluation using
