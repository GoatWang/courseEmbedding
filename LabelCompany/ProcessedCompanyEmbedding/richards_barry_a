philadelphia in  but as his family moved to brooklyn soon after his birth he attended schools there later enrolling at the brooklyn polytechnic institute while richard was growing up his father alexander hudnut c operated a series of drug stores first in court street brooklyn then on the junction of fulton and washington streets the court street drug store opened in  the year before richard’s birth so it is possible that alexander’s wife margaret parker remained in philadelphia until richard the first of six children was born or until alexander had established the business in brooklyn and secured suitable accommodation the family lived in brooklyn while richard was growing up but later built a new home in llewellyn park west orange new jersey where they remained until  in  alexander hudnut opened a pharmacy in the new herald building on the corner of ann street and broadway erected in  on the site of the barnum’s museum which had burnt to the ground in  alexander inaugurated the idea of the allnight drug store and hudnut’s pharmacy soon became the meeting place for nightowls including newspaper reporters actors and drama critics who selected drinks from one of the largest soda fountains installed in new york the fame of the pharmacy was further enhanced when alexander hung a boxedin thermometer at the front of the pharmacy this was used for ‘official unofficial’ temperature readings for new york by various newspapers and made hudnut’s pharmacy a household name above  the herald building on the corner of ann street and broadway sometimes called the bennett building after the herald’s famous editor james gordon bennett it was completed in  the hudnut pharmacy awning can be seen just to the right of the building’s portico entrance in  aged  richard hudnut joined his father’s business some have suggested he had been to princeton but this seems incorrect possibly stemming from confusion with his younger brother william who graduated from princeton college in  wessell  p  exactly how or why he began to make scents for his father’s pharmacy is unclear his brother william notes that alexander hudnut played no part in their development and richard’s first fragrances released in  were formulated before he had visited france to see firsthand how things were done in grasse in  alexander hudnut’s health began to fail and by the end of the year he had sold his pharmacy business to the hudnut  hegeman consolidated drug and chemical company however by this time richard was independent having established his own pharmacy uptown at  broadway new york in  although the original hudnut’s pharmacy was demolished when the herald building was pulled down in  to make way for a storey skyscraper the new owners reopened it in another alternative location this meant there were two hudnut businesses in new york for many years one operated by richard hudnut uptown at  broadway the other downtown at  broadway owned by frederick f anness and george h bancroft the two firms seemed to coexist quite amicably a situation made easier by the fact that richard did not advertise widely apart from some trade promotions and the occasional placement by agents or stores who carried his products in other american cities there is little mention of his wares in the press until  one reason why richard hudnut desisted from advertising broadly was to give his perfumes and cosmetics an air of exclusivity rather than use newspaper or magazine advertisements he distributed booklets to prospective customers that contained details of his various preparations in addition to stop the line being ‘cheapened’ by discounting he employed a strict price maintenance policy and all retailers that carried his products had to sign an agreement to that effect above  a copy of the agreement used by richard hudnut to stop price cutting retailers who broke it were likely to find all their stock bought up and further supplies cut off galloway  harmon  p  this pricecontrol policy would lead to charges being brought against the company by the american federal government in  by  richard hudnut had built up a sizeable range and his products were being sold across the united states as well as perfumes toilet waters cologne waters sachets and scented tablets hair preparations tooth powders tooth washes soaps and a pasta mack there were also toilet and face powders white flesh and brunette shades skin creams and other assorted cosmetics toilet and face powders violet superba peau d’espagne wood violet extreme violet hudnutine rice orchid beauty powder hudnutine face powder extreme violet talcum and orchid beauty skin preparations violet toilet cerate hudnutine toilet cerate violet almond meal crystal camphor ice prepared cocoa butter milk of cucumber and orris cucumber cold cream concrete tincture benzoin toilet cerate gloves other cosmetics eyebrow pencil floro vegetal extract nail powder hudnut made some attempt to develop the brand name ‘hudnutine’ as in hudnutine face powder hudnutine rice powder hudnutine toilet cerate royal hudnutine toilet water hudnutine tooth paste and hudnutine tooth wash but in general he followed the perfume tradition which based names on a key ingredient or extract in the cosmetic by  it was evident that the company needed to expand its operations land was acquired at  east th street the two old twostory dwellings on it was demolished and by  a new sixstory building containing manufacturing space offices shipping areas and a pharmacyshowroom had been built on the site then in  the company incorporated above  interior of the richard hudnut drug store designed by edmund ellis at  east th street new york early cosmetics richard hudnut’s primary interest was in making perfumes equal to those produced in france however knowing that price was also important he helped – through his chairmanship of the committee of importations and undervaluations for the manufacturing perfumer’s association – reduce competition from foreign perfumes by securing legislation that allowed raw materials for perfumes into the united states to be free from tariff but increased the duty on overseas manufactured perfumes skin creams early richard hudnut skin creams included cerates glycerine creams cucumber creams by  richard hudnut many of these were replaced with cold and vanishing creams bringing his products more into line with other companies like pond’s marvelous cold cream “marvelous cold cream has all the qualities most sought by fastidious women as an innocent unguent of rare effectiveness in soothing healing and beautifying the skin it will keep indefinitely without change and entirely free from glycerine is guaranteed not to promote the growth of down” cucumber cold cream “this preparation has a base of the finest sweet almond oil rarely employed by manufacturers on account of its high cost it may be described as purely vegetal in character entirely free from the mineral oils so generally used today in cold creams” milk of cucumbers and orris “milk of cucumbers and orris contains a minute percentage of fatty matter and even this is neutralized to such an extent as to make it par excellance the best of all liquid skin improvers not only for oily skins but for general day time use to soften and soothe the skin before applying powder etc” crême violet sec “it contains no oily matter whatever consequently it is most cleanly in use and being instantly absorbed by the skin leaves no apparent trace” toilet cerate “this most useful preparation is readily absorbed by the skin and owing to this and certain other characteristics it is particularly adapted to use as a massage cream while as a general healing application to the skin when burned irritated chapped inflamed etc it has no superior” marvelous cold cream was a mineralbased cold cream which could be used as a cleanser skin protectant or powder base cucumber cold cream was an almond oilbased cold cream with a shorter shelf life for use on injured or more delicate skins milk of cucumbers and orris was a skin protectant and powder base for oily skins violet sec crême was glycerinebased and suggested for oily skins or skins that were inclined to be dry while toilet cerate was marketed as a skin protectant see also cerates glycerine creams and jellies cold creams and vanishing creams makeup by  richard hudnut’s range of face powders included du barry sweet orchid gardenia violet superba royal hudnutine and violet sec they all came in the same shades – white natural rose and brunette – and i expect that there was little or no difference in their formulation apart from the fragrance used to scent them he also made blanc mondain a compact powder in white natural rachel rose and electrique violettinted for use by blondes at night shades and orchid beauty white a cream liquid white in white flesh and brunette shades orchid beauty white “a harmless instantaneous beautifier for the face neck and arms suited to the requirements of society women who do not want exaggerated effects it suffices to apply the cream with a small sponge and when dry to rub the skin gently with a soft cloth or piece of chamois leather” shades white flesh brunette see also liquid face powders the hudnut range of rouges included liquid rouges – permanent rose tint rose and liquid face rouge carmine dry rouges – rouge mondain brunette rouge mandarine orange vanity rouge theatre rouge and modern rouge brunette and rouge leaves hudnut also sold stick rouges for the lips – violet sec lip rouge and permanent lip rouge – which suggests that he was one of the first american cosmetic manufacturers to make what we would now call a lipstick he may also have been one of the first american cosmetic manufacturers to packaged his lipstick in a metal pushup case see also rouge and lipsticks eye makeup was largely absent from richard hudnut’s product range as far as i can tell he did not make a mascarawater cosmetique at this time and only sold eyebrow crayons in shades of black brown and chestnut this is understandable given that eyebrows were then considered a more important facial feature than eyelashes see also water cosmetique mascaro manicure preparations these included nailustre nailstic marvelous nail polish and hudnut’s  nail gloss which if i was to guess would indicate that he made powder stick and liquid powder polish and possibly a nail lacquer as well he also made a rouge pomade to colour in the nail plate pink and cuticle acid an acidbased cuticle remover using oxalic acid common at the time but later superseded by alkaline forms made from sodium andor potassium hydroxide see also nail powder polishes and liquid nail polishes pharmacy closes in  in response to demand manufacturing space at  east th street was more than doubled and two floors of the bush terminal building on east th street – with its fully equipped motortruck delivery service – were rented for stock storage and shipping the following year a branch office was opened at  rue augustine paris the richard hudnut pharmacy at  broadway was shut down in  and the furniture fittings and stock were sold at auction to the c  c pharmacy of williamsburg this enabled the firm to concentrate on manufacturing and ended richard hudnut’s direct interests in pharmacy then in  most of the stock in the company was sold to h pfeiffer g a pfeiffer and g d merner of william r warner  co although initially reaffirmed as president richard hudnut soon retired and the presidency then passed to g a pfeiffer william r warner william r warner was headquartered in philadelphia but after buying richard hudnut the company abandoned a new building under construction there and purchased the former altman building at  west th street new york along with some adjacent property and then moved to new york city in  the building at  east th street was leased from richard hudnut but it eventually became surplus to requirements and richard sold it in  through the hudnut realty co established by him some years previously a new richard hudnut perfume shop was opened in december  at  fifth avenue but as this occurred only a few months after the sale of the company negotiations for its development may have been in the pipeline before the sale of the business took place the store was subsequently moved to  fifth avenue in  the hiatus brought on by the first world war and the postwar slump of the early s was followed by a period of growth a more secure european presence was established with the construction of a laboratoryfactory at surenes paris in  – which produced products that were cheaper to make in france – and by the opening of a retail outlet at  rue de la paix paris in  a new eightstorey factory and loft building was developed at  west th street new york and by  the company had factories branch offices or agencies throughout canada and europe as well as in mexico south america cuba and the far east apeor march  product lines richard hudnut regarded himself as a highclass perfumer rather than a pharmacist or cosmetic chemist and looked to france for inspiration this helped determine the way he did business – the lack of advertising the use of price maintenance and the move to uptown new york – and the products he produced it was common practice for perfumers to create a range of scented toiletries and cosmetics such as a toilet waters sachets talcums face powders soaps or bath salts all based on a common fragrance richard hudnut followed this tradition and used a number of his perfumes to produced small lines some french perfumers like guerlain and bourjois also made and sold cosmetics particularly makeup and richard hudnut did this as well for example his violet sec perfume released in  was by  incorporated into a sachet toilet water soap bath salts talcum powder face powder toilet rice powder leaves almond meal lip rouge and face cream again following the lead of french perfumers like dorin richard hudnut also produced compacts and other accessories designed for discerning clients the new owners of the company continued this tradition through much of the s displaying ‘richard hudnut perfumer’ or ‘richard hudnut parfumeur’ at the bottom of much of their advertising additional perfumes were created – presumably by hudnut’s resident perfumer henry g dusenbury – and a number of limited lines containing items such as perfume toilet water bath salts face powder talcum and rouge with accompanying compacts and chatelaines were created from some of them the deauville line begun in  and the le début line started in  being cases in point however as the beauty industry boomed in the united states during the s it must have become increasingly clear that a wider range of cosmetics was needed some progress was made in this regard with extensions to the three flowers and du barry lines but when you look at a richard hudnut brochure from  it seems clear that the company’s cosmetic items were still limited and those that it sold were a bit of a mishmash  three little jars for exquisite care of the skin three flowers cleansing cream — every night and after any dusty fatiguing experience three flowers skin and tissue cream — every night to nourish the skin three flowers vanishing cream — every morning and always before venturing out—to protect the skin and hold the powder smoothly  for special cases richard hudnut’s almond meal — to remove blackheads and use on sensitive skin in place of soap concrete tincture of benzoin — a tonic astringent to close enlarged pores  for beautiful arms soft elbows and smooth white hands three flowers lotion — every time you wash your hands—to protect their softness and delicacy milk of cucumbers and orris — a creamy lotion to whiten and soften arms and hands orchid beauty cream — a clinging liquid powder and a velvety powder base for evening in white flesh brunette  to brighten madame’s beauty face powders — in white naturelle rose brunette and parisian dark brunette scented with plaza deauville du barry sweet orchid or gardenia three flowers compact rouge in dark medium light orange nasturtium carmeen crimson geranium stage and natural three flowers compact powder in white naturelle and brunette lipstick three flowers lip stick in shade no  cherry red carmeen crimson and orange three flowers twin lip stick and eyebrow pencil in the desired shades dubarry tandem lip stick and eyebrow pencil in the desired shades eyebrow crayons black brown and chestnut eyebrow pencils black brown and chestnut modified from the way to lovely skin  by the early s this situation had changed somewhat a salon had been opened at  fifth avenue new york in  and four reasonably sized cosmetic lines were in production – three flowers gemey du barry and marvelous each was based on a perfume three of which were developed prior to  reading through the development of each of these lines one should perhaps take note of the words of elmer holmes bobst  who became president of william r warner  company in  “the business was dominated by cosmetic cooks they built their products on the basis of sight smell and feel they had no regard for the needs of the skin and hair” “corporations life begins at ”  although he is probably overstating the case i think it partially explains many of the deficiencies in the skincare products of the company the comparative strength of the makeup lines and the willingness to allow considerable duplication between a number of lines differentiated largely by scent if the company had produce a single comprehensive skincare and makeup range – as was largely the practice at the salonbased cosmetic companies like elizabeth arden helena rubinstein or dorothy gray – things would have been a lot simpler and more tightly focussed three flowers the three flowers perfume  was one of the cheaper perfumes in the richard hudnut range and after going out of production it reappeared in  when many of the products that made up this line were probably introduced as well as the usual perfume toilet water and sachets the range included skincare cosmetics and makeup products available around  included three flowers cleansing cream “penetrates the pores entirely clears them of the day’s dust and grime and leaves the skin soft smooth and fresh” three flowers skin freshener “to remove excess cream and close the pores” three flowers skin and tissue cream “nightly use of this tissue cream after skin has been thoroughly cleansed with three flowers cleansing cream will keep the tissues and pores of the skin in a vigorous condition and ensure firm youthful contours” three flowers vanishing cream “the mission of the cream is to protect and finish apply lightly to the face and all the shine is gone all the little roughnesses have vanished now the powder will cling evenly softly for hours to the velvetsmooth surface of your skin” three flowers face powder “one may obtain in three flowers face powder a tint for every complexion it is caressing to the skin and in so fortunately blended that it combines lightness for the preservation of the skin and body to ensure a lasting effect” shades white natural rose brunette and parisian dark brunette three flowers compact powder shades white natural and brunette a silver finish became available in the s three flowers cream rouge shades carmeen crimson and cherry three flowers compact rouge shades dark medium light orange nasturtium carmeen crimson geranium stage and natural three flowers lip stick shades cherry red carmine crimson and orange three flowers eyebrow pencil shades black brown and chestnut the line was priced more cheaply than either the gemey or du barry ranges and although it was well promoted in places like australia it received less attention in the united states gemey based on the gemey perfume  this line originated in france and was reputedly available there from around  before being released into the united states in  above  richard hudnut gemey the tan and brown mottled effect of the packaging was produced by printing fine brown lines on a rose tan background that was only broken by a vertical silver band displaying the product name gemey and richard hudnut promoted as a prestige parisian line the range started out with a perfume and toilet water along with a face powder lipstick and rouge with the only skincare cosmetic offered being cucumber cleansing lotion face powder shades white naturelle brunette rachel no  and dark brunette rachel no  compact rouge shades carmeen orange geranium nasturtium medium radiant red petal pink and stage lipstick pushup type shades carmeen orange crimson cherry and rose cucumber cleansing lotion dusting powder talcum powder brilliantine perfume and toilet water gemey makeup came in a greater range of shades than was available in the du barry line at the time the meagre skincare line would be later extended and gemey would go on to develop a good following in france and elsewhere in places like australia it was generally sold as a more expensive range alongside the cheaper three flowers line above  richard hudnut in an australian department store with the gemey line sold alongside the three flowers range marvelous marvelous perfume  was not as far as i can tell used to scent a powder in richard hudnut’s time and the marvelous name back then was more closely associated with hudnut’s marvelous cold cream when it debuted in  the creams in the range were packaged in white glass jars with a silver finish metal top with silver labels marked with black lettering and a narrow scarlet border at the bottom displaying the word marvelous other art deco inspired features included a stylised kneeling woman used as an emblem these elements were repeated on other packaging giving the whole line a very modern feel the early marvelous product list included cold cream “it’s a cleansing cream a soothing cream an all round satisfying cream for general everyday use” liquefying cream “light in texture silky to your touch soothing and kind to your skin” skin freshener “that pleasant paradox a soothing astringent stimulating and refreshing soothing to the most delicate skin” tissue cream “rich and luscious—a cream that does wonders for heatfried and wind chapped faces that relaxes taut tissues improves necks” foundation cream “soft fragrant smooth—protects your skin holds powder tenaciously ends nose an cheekbone shine” hand cream “to smooth soften whiten your hands to ward off cracks control cuticle keep your fingertips free from grime” face powder shades white naturelle brunette rachel no  and dark brunette rachel no  compact

radiant red petal pink and stage lip stick pushup type shades carmeen orange crimson cherry and rose lash cosmetic shades black blue and brown eye shadow shades blue brown gray green and violet mascara shades black blue brown nail enamel and remover in combination dusting powder cold cream soap there were similarities between the marvelous and the gemey lines most clearly evident in the shade ranges which were identical and in the compact and lipstick cases which seem to use the same moulds like the gemey line the emphasis was on makeup but the marvelous range had more skincare cosmetics namely liquefying cream skin freshener tissue cream and foundation cream as it was priced below du barry and gemey the line may have been developed in response to the deteriorating economic circumstances of the s to appeal to customers with a limited budget significantly there was no attempt to include a perfume or toilet water with this cheaper line and the metal lipstick and compact cases were made in a silver finish rather than the gold used with gemey the marvelous line seems to have been limited to the united states although a range simply called richard hudnut introduced into britain in the s was a near clone the british version of marvelous was sold in black containers with a prominent red stripe with compacts and lipsticks in a silver finish the same as with the american marvelous line although the shades in the makeup range were initially geared to skin types from around  the british richard hudnut line and the american marvelous line were promoted as eyematched makeup with eye colour advertised as being the key to a person’s ‘personality colour’ your personality colour this key to your type shows why in dress you have always instinctively chosen colours becoming to your eyes as with dressing—so with makeup here is the sure guide now richard hudnut have created eyematched makeup    face powder—rouge—lipstick—eye shadow and mascara in shades that blend    keyed in turn to brown blue hazel and grey eyes — shades correct together for you richard hudnut advertisement  above marvelous eyematched makeup for blue brown hazel and gray eyes also see the company booklet new loveliness for you there are some similarities between this approach and the ‘find yourself’ promotion used by the armand company back in  that also linked colouring with personality see also armand company du barry du barry  was a premium perfume created by richard hudnut that he used to scent one of his more expensive face powders along with a few other items some skin creams such as contour cream and foundation cream were added to the range in the early s but it was not until  that the line was developed as richard hudnut’s premier cosmetic range in the united states above  richard hudnut du barry beauty preparations products available in the early s included special cleansing cream “frees skin of dust an imperfections” skin tonic and freshener “a mild astringent which dissolves all traces of cleansing cream” tissue cream “for normal or oily skins has special softening qualities” special skin food “lubricates dry skin” special astringent “subdues oiliness of the skin” muscle oil “slightly astringent stimulates the tissues” eye lotion “refreshes and soothes the eyes” pore cream “refines enlarged pores” special preparation for blackheads “makes a paste mixed with a little water” beauty lotion “an effective astringent lotion also an excellent powder base” hand beauty cream “a softening whitening cream” foundation cream “a finishing protective powder base” shades white and flesh face powder “a fine texture powder in skin tones” cream rouge shades carmeen crimson cherry and perpétuel indelible liquid rouge shades light and dark like the marvelous line the du barry line was largely restricted to the united states the reason for this may have been due to a trademark conflict with the dubarry perfume company an english firm established in  that william warner  co ltd of england eventually acquired in  there may have been plans to extend the hudnut du barry line into the united kingdom after that but as far as i know this did not take place above  richard hudnut du barry line after it was repackaged in  although not sold in the united kingdom or the british commonwealth here is some evidence that hudnut’s du barry cosmetics were on sale in france before the second world war it does not appear to have been as successful there as the gemey line and after the war when operations were started up again in paris the company seems to have concentrated its efforts on gemey and the chen yu brand it had acquired in  skincare the initial range of skincare cosmetics in the du barry line was rather limited consisting of a single cleanser two skin foods two skin tonicsastringents and a muscle oil there was a limited recognition of skin types – oily and dry – which showed few differences in their treatment plans and special treatment preparations seem to have been limited to a pore cream an eye lotion and a special preparation for blackheads smoothing out facial lines dry type of skin  basic cleansing  special skin food apply to areas of the face showing lines  muscle oil dip cushion fingertips in oil and follow directions for smoothing out lines oily type of skin  basic cleansing  tissue cream apply to

throat oily type of skin  basic cleansing  tissue cream apply to chin and neck  special astringent to be applied when the cream is absorbed  muscle oil to be used smoothing lines from neck and throat richard hudnut  p  see also skin tonics astringents and toners skin foods and muscle oils du barry hand principle as with other beauty treatments of the time physical manipulation in the form of massage and strapping formed an important part of a du barry facial treatment rather than using a mechanical aid like a vibratory massager or patter the du barry line pinned its hopes on a massage routine it advertised as the du barry hand principle supposedly developed by doris hale the routines – which were nothing out of the ordinary – were combined with du barry cosmetics to cleanse and tone the skin treat enlarged pores and blackheads reduce lines and wrinkles and lift sagging contours as yet i have not found any evidence that doris hale actually existed like madame jeanette of pompeian or jeanne armand of armand she may have been a creation of the marketing department if you follow the simple rules of the hand principle your skin will not grow old before its time pore enlargement lines dropping contours rough texture and loss of color can be corrected by this natural skin beautifying method richard hudnut  p  above  the du barry hand principal chart additional products were added to the line during the s including du barry stimulating cream  du barry dermasec formula  for dry skin du barry eye cream  du barry rose cream mask  and du barry special cleansing cream for dry skin  these helped flesh out the line but total sales remained disappointingly low until the du barry success course was introduced in  this led to a fourfold increase in sales of du barry cosmetics and became an important focus for the company during the war and immediate postwar period see also du barry success course makeup du barry makeup in  included both a liquid and cream foundation face powders rouge cream liquid and compact lipstick eyeshadow eyebrow pencil and mascara although the shade range of each was limited the company did provide suggestions for shade selection based on skin and hair colouring for powder rouge and lipstick or on eye colouring for eyeshadow and mascara lash beauty using a more complicated colour matching system than that provided for the marvelous range above  du barry makeup chart some allowance was also made for the suntanned skins that became fashionable in the s with light tan and dark tan shades of du barry powder lotion and du barry face powder included in the range although the makeup range did not alter very much during the s the du barry colour range did show a marginal improvement with the introduction of new shades salon although the shop at  rue de la paix paris was described as a salon i have no evidence that it was ever anything more than a showroom during the s it was managed by charles adrian pennock  who later became the president of hudnut sales co above photographs of the richard hudnut showroom at  rue de la paix paris the exterior of the building was covered in green marble inside the ceiling was pink with a flight of silver birds flying across it the marble floor was covered by a carpet that was the same colour as the ceiling the walls were covered with engraved glass reflecting the couch and chairs that were upholstered in pink with rims of silver at the back of the showroom was a fountain lit by concealed lighting the building at  fifth avenue new york which opened in  did have a beauty salon it appears to be the only one owned and operated by the company at the time although there were other beauty salons scattered throughout the united states that used du barry products i have the impression that these were not very numerous originally known as the richard hudnut salon the fifth avenue salon was often referred to as the richard hudnut du barry salon after  as described in  the salon and shop extended over three floors the st floor was made up of a showroom where richard hudnut perfumes and du barry beauty preparations were available for sale above  the showroom at  fifth avenue new york decorated with zebra and primavera wood casework with a terrazzo floor covered by a yellow and grey rug woven by loja saarinen at the back in the primavera ceiling there is a recessed gold dome trimmed in nickel silver the nd floor contained a reception area leading into treatment rooms for facials manicures and pedicures but also contained a salon de coiffure in the charge of ferdinand who specialised in partial permanent waves above  the reception area at  fifth avenue new york accessed by a private elevator this mirror lined reception led into individual treatment rooms the rd floor held a slenderizing department where excess pounds were exercised away on a beauty board washed away in du barry beauty baths andor massaged away by a masseuse in addition a sports roof was set up on the top of the building so women could take part in badminton checker tennis rope skipping handball punching bags and medicine ball throwing or practice their golf strokes by  the salon was under the directorship of ann delafield who had come over to richard hudnut from elizabeth arden it was ann delafield who probably introduced the beauty boards used in the slenderizing department and the right angle or beauty angle face treatments that reclined the client at a slight angle so that blood flowed to the face the idea behind tilting the client in this way was that it would increase blood flow to the face and neck without the need for slapping or patting thereby improving sagging contours the appearance of lines and sallowness the right angle face treatment alone should be enough to make any woman an habituée of the richard hudnut salon to say that it is different is to put it mildly for this face treatment is absolutely revolutionary from the minute you relax in the special scientific chair to the time you are pronounced “finished” it is different in that your spine and nerve centers are massaged until every vertebra is relaxed and all tension is relieved it is different in that you are inclined in this astounding chair so that your feet are slightly higher than your head and the blood can flow naturally to your face when your face is thus in repose in its youngest most linefree state you’re given a mirror to prove this the “tieup” best suited to your skin is applied it is that angle of incline that is the secret of the effectiveness of this treatment hence its name richard hudnut advertisement  above  ann delafield demonstrating a rocking device in the gymnasium the ‘scientific chairs’ installed in the salon used a similar principle in  the emphasis on improving circulation was increased with the addition of du barry stimulating cream which “activated the circulation so that the skin can more easily throw off impurities” see also circulation creams apart from the right angle face treatment there seems little else offered by the richard hudnut salon in the way of beauty treatments that would distinguish it from other salons of its time the salon operated until  when the company replaced it with a new showroom on the corner of fifth avenue and th street new york that opened in  above  view of the du barry showroom on the corner of fifth avenue and th street above  another view of the du barry showroom warnerhudnut in  elmer bobst combined william r warner  company and richard hudnut into a new corporation warnerhudnut inc and realigned its component parts into four separate divisions william r warner pharmaceuticals richard hudnut cosmetics standard laboratories proprietary medicines and toiletries and the foreign division which handled the products of the other divisions in  foreign countries stock in the company was then offered for sale the  prospectus released before the sale of the stock indicated that although cosmetics accounted for most of the company’s sales they were barely turning a profit and of those lines it was haircare not skincare or makeup that was generating the most volumes drug  cosmetic industry  additives when the success course closed in  – after running for over a decade – warnerhudnut looked for other ways to promote the du barry line improve sales volumes and increase margins the ‘miracle drug’ craze of the s was the perfect setting for richard hudnut to introduce a number of skincare lines containing quasiscientific additives two additives added to many cosmetics in the s were hormones and vitamins however richard hudnut did not included them in its skincare lines until after the second world war du barry liquid treasure was introduced in  and crème superb in  both contained vitamins a d  e the company also engaged in a limited experiment with hormones when it released du barry penetrating balm containing hormones vitamins and lanolin in  elmer bobst had put a top chemist in charge of warner’s cosmetics research in  to take charge of the ‘cosmetic cooks’ as he put it so these products were the presumably a direct result of this placement du barry liquid treasure “nongreasy blend of light emollients plus vitamins a d and e a moisture balm it supplied and retails essential moisture in the skin” du barry crème superb “contains vitamins a d and e plus smoothing emollients and tocopherol a special ingredient that tones and revives the skin’s dewy radiance du barry penetrating balm “this fabulous beauty treatment is a magical blend and balance of vitamins hormones and lanolin that works wonders under through and on the skin to give it the moist full look of youth” see also hormone creams oils and serums and vitamin creams then in  starting with du barry royal treatment cream a royal treatment line was developed made up of a liquid face lotion royal nectar a hand and body lotion royal balm makeup royal velvet liquid makeup and royal lipstick and hair preparations royal shampoo royal creme rinse and royal hair conditioner all of which contained the additive royal jelly du barry royal treatment cream “now her precious beauty secret is yours in this luxurious queen of creams…to soften and make supple dry or mature skin…to prevent and smooth away fine surface lines” this was followed by a range containing placental extract beginning with du barry elixir natale and du barry creme natale in  and with products containing enzymes such as du barry penetrating cleanser also released in  a fourth group of biological compounds alginates made from seaweed also found their way into du barry cosmetics beginning with a hand cream released in  george j abrams who left revlon to join warnerhudnut in  spoke enthusiastically about these quasiscientific cosmetics branding them as ‘charmaceuticals’s in  woodhead  p  he continued to promotion them through the establishment of the paradox line starting in  with du barry crème paradox a beautysleep cream with nor natural oil replacement containing polyunsaturated oils placentine a placental extract and panthenol but not lanolin or hormones it was marketed as being a close match to the natural oils of the skin by  paradox creme cleanser and paradox moisturising lotion had been added to this luxury line and later this was followed by paradox milk bath paradox body crème and paradox after bath dusting powder see also royal jelly and placental creams and serums another ‘scientific’ ingredient that found its way into du barry skincare products around this time was ‘vibranol’ the identity of this tradenamed ingredient is not known but considering the fact that it was used in flatterglo liquid makeup to “hold beautifying moisture on the skin and retain precious moisture underneath” and also in the du barry penetrating cleanser to “dissolve and float away dirt and stale makeup in seconds” it is possible that it was an acetylated lanolin alcohol skincare many of the limitations of the prewar du barry skincare treatments were rectified by  the range now included programs for normal oily and dry skins – each of which included a morning and evening treatment regime – and there were also suggestions for dealing with a combination skin a plan for teenage skin was outline however as it did not contain any medicated products it used a routine that was similar to that described for oily skin although a fourstep process of cleansing freshening lubricating and toning was recommended as the basis for good skincare most of the proscribed treatments for each skin type used a three step routine for example the du barry beauty care for normal skin involved cleansing with penetrating cleanser or special cleansing cream freshening with skin freshener and then protecting with foundation lotion above  four quick steps the suggestion that you lie down and relax before using the skin freshener a second time may be a hangover from the earlier practice of the beauty angle also see the company booklet help yourself to new beauty by du barry makeup the development of new forms of makeup that started with max factor’s pancake in  then continued with the introduction of new pressed powders as well as cream stick and liquid foundations required richard hudnut to update its makeup lines to keep pace with these new trends by  the du barry range included new types of foundations and face powders foundation lotion “ideal for the dry or normal skin to keep it soft and dewy use it as a protective base before powder or applying one of the dubarry sic tinted foundations” sophisticake “the unique powdercake that’sd nondrying day and night glamour for every type of skin achieves a flawless matfinish that camouflages little imperfections blends easily with moist cotton or sponge” sophisticreme “a luxurious color creamcake in a handytocarry case smooths on like satin covers tiny flaws gives your skin a young radiance keeps powder clinging for hours requires no water” flatterglo “the liquid matfinish foundation that lends your skin a glamourglow whisper light it glides on quickly easily stays fresh for hours pores and tiny flaws seem to disappear” flatterface “the powderplusfoundation in one lovely quick way to achieve a poreless petalsmooth complexion …and it clings for hours” above  du barry foundation lotion sophisticreme sophisticake and flatter glo the s was also the decade of the ‘lipstick wars’ richard hudnut was not a major player in this competitive struggle but the company did provide revlon with a bit of a scare when it released lip quick the first rollon lipstick in  using a patent taken out by joseph pepin us  the rollon lipstick quickly grabbed  of the lipstick market abrams  p  if george abrams is to be believed unfortunately the lipstick mass within the cylinder soon gummed up the ball and the dispenser ceased to work abrams suggests that the problem was soon fixed but by then it was too late it is also possible that most of the initial sales boost was due to the product’s novelty factor and that most customers would have gone back to the standard form of lipstick in any case chen yu nail polish had become more important in the s with the rise of revlon particularly after that company began to make matching coloured lipsticks in  although a liquid nail polish had been a part of richard hudnut’ cosmetic lines for decades it was not a strong suit perhaps to fill this gap in  warnerhudnut acquired chen yu a company with an extensive colour range of lipsticks and nail polish however rather than incorporate chen yu into its other lines the warnerhudnut followed its prewar pattern and elected to turn chen yu into yet another skincare and makeup line cosmetics for men although some products had been developed by richard hudnut that could be used by men and some were produced specifically for them this was another company weakness that became more of a problem after many american men had gotten use to the need for good grooming during the second world war as with chen yu the warnerhudnut fixed the gap through acquisition buying courtley inc in  a company with one of the largest selling men’s lines in the united states at the time the courtley range included colognes shaving soaps face lotions and talcs a second men’s line sportsman was acquired when warnerhudnut bought lambert pharmacal and this led to the sale of the courtley line to lee ltd in  duplication the duplication that had existed for decades in skincare and makeup continued after the war a couple of examples will illustrate sophisticreme introduced into the du barry line in the united states in  was a chen yu cosmetic in france and listed as a richard hudnut product in the united kingdom cloudsilk a chen yu cosmetic introduced in  was also made part of the du barry line in  some examples of duplication were more complicated the american du barry paradox line of skin cream creme cleanser and moisturising lotion which was said to contain nor natural oil replacement was also added to the french gemey line in the form of créme de jour créme de nuit and démaquillant nor however as nor natural oil replacement did not work in the french language it was advertised there as meaning nourrit oxygène and régénère warnerlambert when the wall street financiers andré meyer and ferdinand eberstadt heard that the pfeiffer family were planning to sell a block of their stock they organized a syndicate – american drug products ltd – and bought  of warnerhudnut in  they then pressured the company to acquire other businesses so that the stock price would be pushed up smith  p  elmer bobst probably did not need much convincing given that he had already purchased new jersey chilcott laboratories in  in  warnerhudnut acquired lambert pharmacal – the makers of listerine – resulting in formation of the warnerlambert pharmaceutical company decline warnerlambert’s interest in its skincare and makeup lines came under increasing pressure from two sources within the company the first was haircare products these had already been warnerhudnut’s biggest selling cosmetic lines in  and during the next two decades their relative importance visàvis other cosmetics only increased although many were sold under the du barry banner in the united states elsewhere the company seems to have learnt its lesson and simple sold them as products by richard hudnut the lines were advertise extensively in print as well as on radio and television and included shampoos conditioners home permanents and hair colouring kits the second source of pressure came from pharmaceuticals throughout the s and s warnerlambert continued to make company acquisitions all of which with the exception of eversharp in  were in medical dental optical or pharmaceutically related businesses in  cosmetics had made up  of warnerhudnut but by  this had fallen to  while pharmaceutical dental and optical products and services now made up  of of warnerlambert sales the problem of duplication across diverse product lines poor marketing and the lack of product innovation continued to hamper developments in the company’s cosmetic lines in the s warnerlambert endeavoured to resurrect the du barry line by streamlining its products and introducing new makeup and skincare lines but by  when warnerlambert merged with parke davis  company it had became clear that maintaining the line would require considerable sums of money it was not prepared to spend a decision seems to have been made around this time to allow du barry to die if a buyer for it could not be found drugs  cosmetic industry  remnants gemey would become a part of l’oreal in  and have ricils added to it in  l’oreal then merged gemey with other businesses it owned including diparco in  and maybelline in  chen yu is currently owned by eugene perma españa sa based in barcelona spain both lines are still in production in europe a remnant of three flowers also still exists in the form of tres flores a small men’s line consisting of a liquid and solid brilliantine and an aftershave sold primarily to hispanic communities in the americas by american international industries inc the du barry line was sold to dermatological products of texas inc and then on to carme cosmeceutical sciences inc  carme was bought by senetek plc in  and they licensed it to the united states international trading corporation usitc in  who restarted the line as dubarry in  timeline

philadelphia in  but as his family moved to brooklyn soon after his birth he attended schools there later enrolling at the brooklyn polytechnic institute while richard was growing up his father alexander hudnut c operated a series of drug stores first in court street brooklyn then on the junction of fulton and washington streets the court street drug store opened in  the year before richard’s birth so it is possible that alexander’s wife margaret parker remained in philadelphia until richard the first of six children was born or until alexander had established the business in brooklyn and secured suitable accommodation the family lived in brooklyn while richard was growing up but later built a new home in llewellyn park west orange new jersey where they remained until  in  alexander hudnut opened a pharmacy in the new herald building on the corner of ann street and broadway erected in  on the site of the barnum’s museum which had burnt to the ground in  alexander inaugurated the idea of the allnight drug store and hudnut’s pharmacy soon became the meeting place for nightowls including newspaper reporters actors and drama critics who selected drinks from one of the largest soda fountains installed in new york the fame of the pharmacy was further enhanced when alexander hung a boxedin thermometer at the front of the pharmacy this was used for ‘official unofficial’ temperature readings for new york by various newspapers and made hudnut’s pharmacy a household name above  the herald building on the corner of ann street and broadway sometimes called the bennett building after the herald’s famous editor james gordon bennett it was completed in  the hudnut pharmacy awning can be seen just to the right of the building’s portico entrance in  aged  richard hudnut joined his father’s business some have suggested he had been to princeton but this seems incorrect possibly stemming from confusion with his younger brother william who graduated from princeton college in  wessell  p  exactly how or why he began to make scents for his father’s pharmacy is unclear his brother william notes that alexander hudnut played no part in their development and richard’s first fragrances released in  were formulated before he had visited france to see firsthand how things were done in grasse in  alexander hudnut’s health began to fail and by the end of the year he had sold his pharmacy business to the hudnut  hegeman consolidated drug and chemical company however by this time richard was independent having established his own pharmacy uptown at  broadway new york in  although the original hudnut’s pharmacy was demolished when the herald building was pulled down in  to make way for a storey skyscraper the new owners reopened it in another alternative location this meant there were two hudnut businesses in new york for many years one operated by richard hudnut uptown at  broadway the other downtown at  broadway owned by frederick f anness and george h bancroft the two firms seemed to coexist quite amicably a situation made easier by the fact that richard did not advertise widely apart from some trade promotions and the occasional placement by agents or stores who carried his products in other american cities there is little mention of his wares in the press until  one reason why richard hudnut desisted from advertising broadly was to give his perfumes and cosmetics an air of exclusivity rather than use newspaper or magazine advertisements he distributed booklets to prospective customers that contained details of his various preparations in addition to stop the line being ‘cheapened’ by discounting he employed a strict price maintenance policy and all retailers that carried his products had to sign an agreement to that effect above  a copy of the agreement used by richard hudnut to stop price cutting retailers who broke it were likely to find all their stock bought up and further supplies cut off galloway  harmon  p  this pricecontrol policy would lead to charges being brought against the company by the american federal government in  by  richard hudnut had built up a sizeable range and his products were being sold across the united states as well as perfumes toilet waters cologne waters sachets and scented tablets hair preparations tooth powders tooth washes soaps and a pasta mack

attempt to develop the brand name ‘hudnutine’ as in hudnutine face powder hudnutine rice powder hudnutine toilet cerate royal hudnutine toilet water hudnutine tooth paste and hudnutine tooth wash but in general he followed the perfume tradition which based names on a key ingredient or extract in the cosmetic by  it was evident that the company needed to expand its operations land was acquired at  east th street the two old twostory dwellings on it was demolished and by  a new sixstory building containing manufacturing space offices shipping areas and a pharmacyshowroom had been built on the site then in  the company incorporated above  interior of the richard hudnut drug store designed by edmund ellis at  east th street new york early cosmetics richard hudnut’s primary interest was in making perfumes equal to those produced in france however knowing that price was also important he helped – through his chairmanship of the committee of importations and undervaluations for the manufacturing perfumer’s association – reduce competition from foreign perfumes by securing legislation that allowed raw materials for perfumes into the united states to be free from tariff but increased the duty on overseas manufactured perfumes skin creams early richard hudnut skin creams included cerates glycerine creams cucumber creams by  richard hudnut many of these were replaced with cold and vanishing creams bringing his products more into line with other companies like pond’s marvelous cold cream “marvelous cold cream has all the qualities most sought by fastidious women as an innocent unguent of rare effectiveness in soothing healing and beautifying the skin it will keep indefinitely without change and entirely free from glycerine is guaranteed not to promote the growth of down” cucumber cold cream “this preparation has a base of the finest sweet almond oil rarely employed by manufacturers on account of its high cost it may be described as purely vegetal in character entirely free from the mineral oils so generally used today in cold creams” milk of cucumbers and orris “milk of cucumbers and orris contains a minute percentage of fatty matter and even this is neutralized to such an extent as to make it par excellance the best of all liquid skin improvers not only for oily skins but for general day time use to soften and soothe the skin before applying powder etc” crême violet sec “it contains no oily matter whatever consequently it is most cleanly in use and being instantly absorbed by the skin leaves no apparent trace” toilet cerate “this most useful preparation is readily absorbed by the skin and owing to this and certain other characteristics it is particularly adapted to use as a massage cream while as a general healing application to the skin when burned irritated chapped inflamed etc it has no superior” marvelous cold cream was a mineralbased cold cream which could be used as a cleanser skin protectant or powder base cucumber cold cream was an almond oilbased cold cream with a shorter shelf life for use on injured or more delicate skins milk of cucumbers and orris was a skin protectant and powder base for oily skins violet sec crême was glycerinebased and suggested for oily skins or skins that were inclined to be dry while toilet cerate was marketed as a skin protectant see also cerates glycerine creams and jellies cold creams and vanishing creams makeup by  richard hudnut’s range of face powders included du barry sweet orchid gardenia violet superba royal hudnutine and violet sec they all came in the same shades – white natural rose and brunette – and i expect that there was little or no difference in their formulation apart from the fragrance used to scent them he also made blanc mondain a compact powder in white natural rachel rose and electrique violettinted for use by blondes at night shades and orchid beauty white a cream liquid white in white flesh and brunette shades orchid beauty white “a harmless instantaneous beautifier for the face neck and arms suited to the requirements of society women who do not want exaggerated effects it suffices to apply the cream with a small sponge and when dry to rub the skin gently with a soft cloth or piece of chamois leather” shades white flesh brunette see also liquid face powders the hudnut range of rouges included liquid rouges – permanent rose tint rose and liquid face rouge carmine dry rouges – rouge mondain brunette rouge mandarine orange vanity rouge theatre rouge and modern rouge brunette and rouge leaves hudnut also sold stick rouges for the lips – violet sec lip rouge and permanent lip rouge – which suggests that he was one of the first american cosmetic manufacturers to make what we would now call a lipstick he may also have been one of the first american cosmetic manufacturers to packaged his lipstick in a metal pushup case see also rouge and lipsticks eye makeup was largely absent from richard hudnut’s product range as far as i can tell he did not make a mascarawater cosmetique at this time and only sold eyebrow crayons in shades of black brown and chestnut this is understandable given that eyebrows were then considered a more important facial feature than eyelashes see also water cosmetique mascaro manicure preparations these included nailustre nailstic marvelous nail polish and hudnut’s  nail gloss which if i was to guess would indicate that he made powder stick and liquid powder polish and possibly a nail lacquer as well he also made a rouge pomade to colour in the nail plate pink and cuticle acid an acidbased cuticle remover using oxalic acid common at the time but later superseded by alkaline forms made from sodium andor potassium hydroxide see also nail powder polishes and liquid nail polishes pharmacy closes in  in response to demand manufacturing space at  east th street was more than doubled and two floors of the bush terminal building on east th street – with its fully equipped motortruck delivery service – were rented for stock storage and shipping the following year a branch office was opened at  rue augustine paris the richard hudnut pharmacy at  broadway was shut down in  and the furniture fittings and stock were sold at auction to the c  c pharmacy of williamsburg this enabled the firm to concentrate on manufacturing and ended richard hudnut’s direct interests in pharmacy then in  most of the stock in the company was sold to h pfeiffer g a pfeiffer and g d merner of william r warner  co although initially reaffirmed as president richard hudnut soon retired and the presidency then passed to g a pfeiffer william r warner william r warner was headquartered in philadelphia but after buying richard hudnut the company abandoned a new building under construction there and purchased the former altman building at  west th street new york along with some adjacent property and then moved to new york city in  the building at  east th street was leased from richard hudnut but it eventually became surplus to requirements and richard sold it in  through the hudnut realty co established by him some years previously a new richard hudnut perfume shop was opened in december  at  fifth avenue but as this occurred only a few months after the sale of the company negotiations for its development may have been in the pipeline before the sale of the business took place the store was subsequently moved to  fifth avenue in  the hiatus brought on by the first world war and the postwar slump of the early s was followed by a period of growth a more secure european presence was established with the construction of a laboratoryfactory at surenes paris in  – which produced products that were cheaper to make in france – and by the opening of a retail outlet at  rue de la paix paris in  a new eightstorey factory and loft building was developed at  west th street new york and by  the company had factories branch offices or agencies throughout canada and europe as well as in mexico south america cuba and the far east apeor march  product lines richard hudnut regarded himself as a highclass perfumer rather than a pharmacist or cosmetic chemist and looked to france for inspiration this helped determine the way he did business – the lack of advertising the use of price maintenance and the move to uptown new york – and the products he produced it was common practice for perfumers to create a range of scented toiletries and cosmetics such as a toilet waters sachets talcums face powders soaps or bath salts all based on a common fragrance richard hudnut followed this tradition and used a number of his perfumes to produced small lines some french perfumers like guerlain and bourjois also made and sold cosmetics particularly makeup and richard hudnut did this as well for example his violet sec perfume released in  was by  incorporated into a sachet toilet water soap bath salts talcum powder face powder toilet rice powder leaves almond meal lip rouge and face cream again following the lead of french perfumers like dorin richard hudnut also produced compacts and other accessories designed for discerning clients the new owners of the company continued this tradition through much of the s displaying ‘richard hudnut perfumer’ or ‘richard hudnut parfumeur’ at the bottom of much of their advertising additional perfumes were created – presumably by hudnut’s resident perfumer henry g dusenbury – and a number of limited lines containing items such as perfume toilet water bath salts face powder talcum and rouge with accompanying compacts and chatelaines were created from some of them the deauville line begun in  and the le début line started in  being cases in point however as the beauty industry boomed in the united states during the s it must have become increasingly clear that a wider range of cosmetics was needed some progress was made in this regard with extensions to the three flowers and du barry lines but when you look at a richard hudnut brochure from  it seems clear that the company’s cosmetic items were still limited and those that it sold were a bit of a mishmash  three little jars for exquisite care of the skin three flowers cleansing cream — every night and after any dusty fatiguing experience three flowers skin and tissue cream — every night to nourish the skin three flowers vanishing cream — every morning and always before venturing out—to protect the skin and hold the powder smoothly  for special cases richard hudnut’s almond meal — to remove blackheads and use on sensitive skin in place of soap concrete tincture of benzoin — a tonic astringent to close enlarged pores  for beautiful arms soft elbows and smooth white hands three flowers lotion — every time you wash your hands—to protect their softness and delicacy milk of cucumbers and orris — a creamy lotion to whiten and soften arms and hands orchid beauty cream — a clinging liquid powder and a velvety powder base for evening in white

compact rouge in dark medium light orange nasturtium carmeen crimson geranium stage and natural three flowers compact powder in white naturelle and brunette lipstick three flowers lip stick in shade no  cherry red carmeen crimson and orange three flowers twin lip stick and eyebrow pencil in the desired shades dubarry tandem lip stick and eyebrow pencil in the desired shades eyebrow crayons black brown and chestnut eyebrow pencils black brown and chestnut modified from the way to lovely skin  by the early s this situation had changed somewhat a salon had been opened at  fifth avenue new york in  and four reasonably sized cosmetic lines were in production – three flowers gemey du barry and marvelous each was based on a perfume three of which were developed prior to  reading through the development of each of these lines one should perhaps take note of the words of elmer holmes bobst  who became president of william r warner  company in  “the business was dominated by cosmetic cooks they built their products on the basis of sight smell and feel they had no regard for the needs of the skin and hair” “corporations life begins at ”  although he is probably overstating the case i think it partially explains many of the deficiencies in the skincare products of the company the comparative strength of the makeup lines and the willingness to allow considerable duplication between a number of lines differentiated largely by scent if the company had produce a single comprehensive skincare and makeup range – as was largely the practice at the salonbased cosmetic companies like elizabeth arden helena rubinstein or dorothy gray – things would have been a lot simpler and more tightly focussed three flowers the three flowers perfume  was one of the cheaper perfumes in the richard hudnut range and after going out of production it reappeared in  when many of the products that made up this line were probably introduced as well as the usual perfume toilet water and sachets the range included skincare cosmetics and makeup products available around  included three flowers cleansing cream “penetrates the pores entirely clears them of the day’s dust and grime and leaves the skin soft smooth and fresh” three flowers skin freshener “to remove excess cream and close the pores” three flowers skin and tissue cream “nightly use of this tissue cream after skin has been thoroughly cleansed with three flowers cleansing cream will keep the tissues and pores of the skin in a vigorous condition and ensure firm youthful contours” three flowers vanishing cream “the mission of the cream is to protect and finish apply lightly to the face and all the shine is gone all the little roughnesses have vanished now the powder will cling evenly softly for hours to the velvetsmooth surface of your skin” three flowers face powder “one may obtain in three flowers face powder a tint for every complexion it is caressing to the skin and in so fortunately blended that it combines lightness for the preservation of the skin and body to ensure a lasting effect” shades white natural rose brunette and parisian dark brunette three flowers compact powder shades white natural and brunette a silver finish became available in the s three flowers cream rouge shades carmeen crimson and cherry three flowers compact rouge shades dark medium light orange nasturtium carmeen crimson geranium stage and natural three flowers lip stick shades cherry red carmine crimson and orange three flowers eyebrow pencil shades black brown and chestnut the line was priced more cheaply than either the gemey or du barry ranges and although it was well promoted in places like australia it received less attention in the united states gemey based on the gemey perfume  this line originated in france and was reputedly available there from around  before being released into the united states in  above  richard hudnut gemey the tan and brown mottled effect of the packaging was produced by printing fine brown lines on a rose tan background that was only broken by a vertical silver band displaying the product name gemey and richard hudnut promoted as a prestige parisian line the range started out with a perfume and toilet water along with a face powder lipstick and rouge with the only skincare cosmetic offered being cucumber cleansing lotion face powder shades white naturelle brunette rachel no  and dark brunette rachel no  compact rouge shades carmeen orange geranium nasturtium medium radiant red petal pink and stage lipstick pushup type shades carmeen orange crimson cherry and rose cucumber cleansing lotion dusting powder talcum powder brilliantine perfume and toilet water gemey makeup came in a greater range of shades than was available in the du barry line at the time the meagre skincare line would be later extended and gemey would go on to develop a good following in france and elsewhere in places like australia it was generally sold as a more expensive range alongside the cheaper three flowers line above  richard hudnut in an australian department store with the gemey line sold alongside the three flowers range marvelous marvelous perfume  was not as far as i can tell used to scent a powder in richard hudnut’s time and the marvelous name back then was more closely associated with hudnut’s marvelous cold cream when it debuted in  the creams in the range were packaged in white glass jars with a silver finish metal top with silver labels marked with black lettering and a narrow scarlet border at the bottom displaying the word marvelous other art deco inspired features included a stylised kneeling woman used as an emblem these elements were repeated on other packaging giving the whole line a very modern feel the early marvelous product list included cold cream “it’s a cleansing cream a soothing cream an all round satisfying cream for general everyday use” liquefying cream “light in texture silky to your touch soothing and kind to your skin” skin freshener “that pleasant paradox a soothing astringent stimulating and refreshing soothing to the most delicate skin” tissue cream “rich and luscious—a cream that does wonders for heatfried and wind chapped faces that relaxes taut tissues improves necks” foundation cream “soft fragrant smooth—protects your skin holds powder tenaciously ends nose an cheekbone shine” hand cream “to smooth soften whiten your hands to ward off cracks control cuticle keep your fingertips free from grime” face powder shades white naturelle brunette rachel no  and dark brunette rachel no  compact

radiant red petal pink and stage lip stick pushup type shades carmeen orange crimson cherry and rose lash cosmetic shades black blue and brown eye shadow shades blue brown gray green and violet mascara shades black blue brown nail enamel and remover in combination dusting powder cold cream soap there were similarities between the marvelous and the gemey lines most clearly evident in the shade ranges which were identical and in the compact and lipstick cases which seem to use the same moulds like the gemey line the emphasis was on makeup but the marvelous range had more skincare cosmetics namely liquefying cream skin freshener tissue cream and foundation cream as it was priced below du barry and gemey the line may have been developed in response to the deteriorating economic circumstances of the s to appeal to customers with a limited budget significantly there was no attempt to include a perfume or toilet water with this cheaper line and the metal lipstick and compact cases were made in a silver finish rather than the gold used with gemey the marvelous line seems to have been limited to the united states although a range simply called richard hudnut introduced into britain in the s was a near clone the british version of marvelous was sold in black containers with a prominent red stripe with compacts and lipsticks in a silver finish the same as with the american marvelous line although the shades in the makeup range were initially geared to skin types from around  the british richard hudnut line and the american marvelous line were promoted as eyematched makeup with eye colour advertised as being the key to a person’s ‘personality colour’ your personality colour this key to your type shows why in dress you have always instinctively chosen colours becoming to your eyes as with dressing—so with makeup here is the sure guide now richard hudnut have created eyematched makeup    face powder—rouge—lipstick—eye shadow and mascara in shades that blend    keyed in turn to brown blue hazel and grey eyes — shades correct together for you richard hudnut advertisement  above marvelous eyematched makeup for blue brown hazel and gray eyes also see the company booklet new loveliness for you there are some similarities between this approach and the ‘find yourself’ promotion used by the armand company back in  that also linked colouring with personality see also armand company du barry du barry  was a premium perfume created by richard hudnut that he used to scent one of his more expensive face powders along with a few other items some skin creams such as contour cream and foundation cream were added to the range in the early s but it was not until  that the line was developed as richard hudnut’s premier cosmetic range in the united states above  richard hudnut du barry beauty preparations products available in the early s included special cleansing cream “frees skin of dust an imperfections” skin tonic and freshener “a mild astringent which dissolves all traces of cleansing cream” tissue cream “for normal or oily skins has special softening qualities” special skin food “lubricates dry skin” special astringent “subdues oiliness of the skin” muscle oil “slightly astringent stimulates the tissues” eye lotion “refreshes and soothes the eyes” pore cream “refines enlarged pores” special preparation for blackheads “makes a paste mixed with a little water” beauty lotion “an effective astringent lotion also an excellent powder base” hand beauty cream “a softening whitening cream” foundation cream “a finishing protective powder base” shades white and flesh face powder “a fine texture powder in skin tones” cream rouge shades carmeen crimson cherry and perpétuel indelible liquid rouge shades light and dark like the marvelous line the du barry line was largely restricted to the united states the reason for this may have been due to a trademark conflict with the dubarry perfume company an english firm established in  that william warner  co ltd of england eventually acquired in  there may have been plans to extend the hudnut du barry line into the united kingdom after that but as far as i know this did not take place above  richard hudnut du barry line after it was repackaged in  although not sold in the united kingdom or the british commonwealth here is some evidence that hudnut’s du barry cosmetics were on sale in france before the second world war it does not appear to have been as successful there as the gemey line and after the war when operations were started up again in paris the company seems to have concentrated its efforts on gemey and the chen yu brand it had acquired in  skincare the initial range of skincare cosmetics in the du barry line was rather limited consisting of a single cleanser two skin foods two skin tonicsastringents and a muscle oil there was a limited recognition of skin types – oily and dry – which showed few differences in their treatment plans and special treatment preparations seem to have been limited to a pore cream an eye lotion and a special preparation for blackheads smoothing out facial lines dry type of skin  basic cleansing  special skin food apply to areas of the face showing lines  muscle oil dip cushion fingertips in oil and follow directions for smoothing out lines oily type of skin  basic cleansing  tissue cream apply to

richard hudnut  p  see also skin tonics astringents and toners skin foods and muscle oils du barry hand principle as with other beauty treatments of the time physical manipulation in the form of massage and strapping formed an important part of a du barry facial treatment rather than using a mechanical aid like a vibratory massager or patter the du barry line pinned its hopes on a massage routine it advertised as the du barry hand principle supposedly developed by doris hale the routines – which were nothing out of the ordinary – were combined with du barry cosmetics to cleanse and tone the skin treat enlarged pores and blackheads reduce lines and wrinkles and lift sagging contours as yet i have not found any evidence that doris hale actually existed like madame jeanette of pompeian or jeanne armand of armand she may have been a creation of the marketing department if you follow the simple rules of the hand principle your skin will not grow old before its time pore enlargement lines dropping contours rough texture and loss of color can be corrected by this natural skin beautifying method richard hudnut  p  above  the du barry hand principal chart additional products were added to the line during the s including du barry stimulating cream  du barry dermasec formula  for dry skin du barry eye cream  du barry rose cream mask  and du barry special cleansing cream for dry skin  these helped flesh out the line but total sales remained disappointingly low until the du barry success course was introduced in  this led to a fourfold increase in sales of du barry cosmetics and became an important focus for the company during the war and immediate postwar period see also du barry success course makeup du barry makeup in  included both a liquid and cream foundation face powders rouge cream liquid and compact lipstick eyeshadow eyebrow pencil and mascara although the shade range of each was limited the company did provide suggestions for shade selection based on skin and hair colouring for powder rouge and lipstick or on eye colouring for eyeshadow and mascara lash beauty using a more complicated colour matching system than that provided for the marvelous range above  du barry makeup chart some allowance was also made for the suntanned skins that became fashionable in the s with light tan and dark tan shades of du barry powder lotion and du barry face powder included in the range although the makeup range did not alter very much during the s the du barry colour range did show a marginal improvement with the introduction of new shades salon although the shop at  rue de la paix paris was described as a salon i have no evidence that it was ever anything more than a showroom during the s it was managed by charles adrian pennock  who later became the president of hudnut sales co above photographs of the richard hudnut showroom at  rue de la paix paris the exterior of the building was covered in green marble inside the ceiling was pink with a flight of silver birds flying across it the marble floor was covered by a carpet that was the same colour as the ceiling the walls were covered with engraved glass reflecting the couch and chairs that were upholstered in pink with rims of silver at the back of the showroom was a fountain lit by concealed lighting the building at  fifth avenue new york which opened in  did have a beauty salon it appears to be the only one owned and operated by the company at the time although there were other beauty salons scattered throughout the united states that used du barry products i have the impression that these were not very numerous originally known as the richard hudnut salon the fifth avenue salon was often referred to as the richard hudnut du barry salon after  as described in  the salon and shop extended over three floors the st floor was made up of a showroom where richard hudnut perfumes and du barry beauty preparations were available for sale above  the showroom at  fifth avenue new york decorated with zebra and primavera wood casework with a terrazzo floor covered by a yellow and grey rug woven by loja saarinen at the back in the primavera ceiling there is a recessed gold dome trimmed in nickel silver the nd floor contained a reception area leading into treatment rooms for facials manicures and pedicures but also contained a salon de coiffure in the charge of ferdinand who specialised in partial permanent waves above  the reception area at  fifth avenue new york accessed by a private elevator this mirror lined reception led into individual treatment rooms the rd floor held a slenderizing department where excess pounds were exercised away on a beauty board washed away in du barry beauty baths andor massaged away by a masseuse in addition a sports roof was set up on the top of the building so women could take part in badminton checker tennis rope skipping handball punching bags and medicine ball throwing or practice their golf strokes by  the salon was under the directorship of ann delafield who had come over to richard hudnut from elizabeth arden it was ann delafield who probably introduced the beauty boards used in the slenderizing department and the right angle or beauty angle face treatments that reclined the client at a slight angle so that blood flowed to the face the idea behind tilting the client in this way was that it would increase blood flow to the face and neck without the need for slapping or patting thereby improving sagging contours the appearance of lines and sallowness the right angle face treatment alone should be enough to make any woman an habituée of the richard hudnut salon to say that it is different is to put it mildly for this face treatment is absolutely revolutionary from the minute you relax in the special scientific chair to the time you are pronounced “finished” it is different in that your spine and nerve centers are massaged until every vertebra is relaxed and all tension is relieved it is different in that you are inclined in this astounding chair so that your feet are slightly higher than your head and the blood can flow naturally to your face when your face is thus in repose in its youngest most linefree state you’re given a mirror to prove this the “tieup” best suited to your skin is applied it is that angle of incline that is the secret of the effectiveness of this treatment hence its name richard hudnut advertisement  above  ann delafield demonstrating a rocking device in the gymnasium the ‘scientific chairs’ installed in the salon used a similar principle in  the emphasis on improving circulation was increased with the addition of du barry stimulating cream which “activated the circulation so that the skin can more easily throw off impurities” see also circulation creams apart from the right angle face treatment there seems little else offered by the richard hudnut salon in the way of beauty treatments that would distinguish it from other salons of its time the salon operated until  when the company replaced it with a new showroom on the corner of fifth avenue and th street new york that opened in  above  view of the du barry showroom on the corner of fifth avenue and th street above  another view of the du barry showroom warnerhudnut in  elmer bobst combined william r warner  company and richard hudnut into a new corporation warnerhudnut inc and realigned its component parts into four separate divisions william r warner pharmaceuticals richard hudnut cosmetics standard laboratories proprietary medicines and toiletries and the foreign division which handled the products of the other divisions in  foreign countries stock in the company was then offered for sale the  prospectus released before the sale of the stock indicated that although cosmetics accounted for most of the company’s sales they were barely turning a profit and of those lines it was haircare not skincare or makeup that was generating the most volumes drug  cosmetic industry  additives when the success course closed in  – after running for over a decade – warnerhudnut looked for other ways to promote the du barry line improve sales volumes and increase margins the ‘miracle drug’ craze of the s was the perfect setting for richard hudnut to introduce a number of skincare lines containing quasiscientific additives two additives added to many cosmetics in the s were hormones and vitamins however richard hudnut did not included them in its skincare lines until after the second world war du barry liquid treasure was introduced in  and crème superb in  both contained vitamins a d  e the company also engaged in a limited experiment with hormones when it released du barry penetrating balm containing hormones vitamins and lanolin in  elmer bobst had put a top chemist in charge of warner’s cosmetics research in  to take charge of the ‘cosmetic cooks’ as he put it so these products were the presumably a direct result of this placement du barry liquid treasure “nongreasy blend of light emollients plus vitamins a d and e a moisture balm it supplied and retails essential moisture in the skin” du barry crème superb “contains vitamins a d and e plus smoothing emollients and tocopherol a special ingredient that tones and revives the skin’s dewy radiance du barry penetrating balm “this fabulous beauty treatment is a magical blend and balance of vitamins hormones and lanolin that works wonders under through and on the skin to give it the moist full look of youth” see also hormone creams oils and serums and vitamin creams then in  starting with du barry royal treatment cream a royal treatment line was developed made up of a liquid face lotion royal nectar a hand and body lotion royal balm makeup royal velvet liquid makeup and royal lipstick and hair preparations royal shampoo royal creme rinse and royal hair conditioner all of which contained the additive royal jelly du barry royal treatment cream “now her precious beauty secret is yours in this luxurious queen of creams…to soften and make supple dry or mature skin…to prevent and smooth away fine surface lines” this was followed by a range containing placental extract beginning with du barry elixir natale and du barry creme natale in  and with products containing enzymes such as du barry penetrating cleanser also released in  a fourth group of biological compounds alginates made from seaweed also found their way into du barry cosmetics beginning with a hand cream released in  george j abrams who left revlon to join warnerhudnut in  spoke enthusiastically about these quasiscientific cosmetics branding them as ‘charmaceuticals’s in  woodhead  p  he continued to promotion them through the establishment of the paradox line starting in  with du barry crème paradox a beautysleep cream with nor natural oil replacement containing polyunsaturated oils placentine a placental extract and panthenol but not lanolin or hormones it was marketed as being a close match to the natural oils of the skin by  paradox creme cleanser and paradox moisturising lotion had been added to this luxury line and later this was followed by paradox milk bath paradox body crème and paradox after bath dusting powder see also royal jelly and placental creams and serums another ‘scientific’ ingredient that found its way into du barry skincare products around this time was ‘vibranol’ the identity of this tradenamed ingredient is not known but considering the fact that it was used in flatterglo liquid makeup to “hold beautifying moisture on the skin and retain precious moisture underneath” and also in the du barry penetrating cleanser to “dissolve and float away dirt and stale makeup in seconds” it is possible that it was an acetylated lanolin alcohol skincare many of the limitations of the prewar du barry skincare treatments were rectified by  the range now included programs for normal oily and dry skins – each of which included a morning and evening treatment regime – and there were also suggestions for dealing with a combination skin a plan for teenage skin was outline however as it did not contain any medicated products it used a routine that was similar to that described for oily skin although a fourstep process of cleansing freshening lubricating and toning was recommended as the basis for good skincare most of the proscribed treatments for each skin type used a three step routine for example the du barry beauty care for normal skin involved cleansing with penetrating cleanser or special cleansing cream freshening with skin freshener and then protecting with foundation lotion above  four quick steps the suggestion that you lie down and relax before using the skin freshener a second time may be a hangover from the earlier practice of the beauty angle also see the company booklet help yourself to new beauty by du barry makeup the development of new forms of makeup that started with max factor’s pancake in  then continued with the introduction of new pressed powders as well as cream stick and liquid foundations required richard hudnut to update its makeup lines to keep pace with these new trends by  the du barry range included new types of foundations and face powders foundation lotion “ideal for the dry or normal skin to keep it soft and dewy use it as a protective base before powder or applying one of the dubarry sic tinted foundations” sophisticake “the unique powdercake that’sd nondrying day and night glamour for every type of skin achieves a flawless matfinish that camouflages

hours pores and tiny flaws seem to disappear” flatterface “the powderplusfoundation in one lovely quick way to achieve a poreless petalsmooth complexion …and it clings for hours” above  du barry foundation lotion sophisticreme sophisticake and flatter glo the s was also the decade of the ‘lipstick wars’ richard hudnut was not a major player in this competitive struggle but the company did provide revlon with a bit of a scare when it released lip quick the first rollon lipstick in  using a patent taken out by joseph pepin us  the rollon lipstick quickly grabbed  of the lipstick market abrams  p  if george abrams is to be believed unfortunately the lipstick mass within the cylinder soon gummed up the ball and the dispenser ceased to work abrams suggests that the problem was soon fixed but by then it was too late it is also possible that most of the initial sales boost was due to the product’s novelty factor and that most customers would have gone back to the standard form of lipstick in any case chen yu nail polish had become more important in the s with the rise of revlon particularly after that company began to make matching coloured lipsticks in  although a liquid nail polish had been a part of richard hudnut’ cosmetic lines for decades it was not a strong suit perhaps to fill this gap in  warnerhudnut acquired chen yu a company with an extensive colour range of lipsticks and nail polish however rather than incorporate chen yu into its other lines the warnerhudnut followed its prewar pattern and elected to turn chen yu into yet another skincare and makeup line cosmetics for men although some products had been developed by richard hudnut that could be used by men and some were produced specifically for them this was another company weakness that became more of a problem after many american men had gotten use to the need for good grooming during the second world war as with chen yu the warnerhudnut fixed the gap through acquisition buying courtley inc in  a company with one of the largest selling men’s lines in the united states at the time the courtley range included colognes shaving soaps face lotions and talcs a second men’s line sportsman was acquired when warnerhudnut bought lambert pharmacal and this led to the sale of the courtley line to lee ltd in  duplication the duplication that had existed for decades in skincare and makeup

line of skin cream creme cleanser and moisturising lotion which was said to contain nor natural oil replacement was also added to the french gemey line in the form of créme de jour créme de nuit and démaquillant nor however as nor natural oil replacement did not work in the french language it was advertised there as meaning nourrit oxygène and régénère warnerlambert when the wall street financiers andré meyer and ferdinand eberstadt heard that the pfeiffer family were planning to sell a block of their stock they organized a syndicate – american drug products ltd – and bought  of warnerhudnut in  they then pressured the company to acquire other businesses so that the stock price would be pushed up smith  p  elmer bobst probably did not need much convincing given that he had already purchased new jersey chilcott laboratories in  in  warnerhudnut acquired lambert pharmacal – the makers of listerine – resulting in formation of the warnerlambert pharmaceutical company decline warnerlambert’s interest in its skincare and makeup lines came under increasing pressure from two sources within the company the first was haircare products these had already been warnerhudnut’s biggest selling cosmetic lines in  and during the next two decades their relative importance visàvis other cosmetics only increased although many were sold under the du barry banner in the united states elsewhere the company seems to have learnt its lesson and simple sold them as products by richard hudnut the lines were advertise extensively in print as well as on radio and television and included shampoos conditioners home permanents and hair colouring kits the second source of pressure came from pharmaceuticals throughout the s and s warnerlambert continued to make company acquisitions all of which with the exception of eversharp in  were in medical dental optical or pharmaceutically related businesses in  cosmetics had made up  of warnerhudnut but by  this had fallen to  while pharmaceutical dental and optical products and services now made up  of of warnerlambert sales the problem of duplication across diverse product lines poor marketing and the lack of product innovation continued to hamper developments in the company’s cosmetic lines in the s warnerlambert endeavoured to resurrect the du barry line by streamlining its products and introducing new makeup and skincare lines but by  when warnerlambert merged with parke davis  company it had became clear that maintaining the line would require considerable sums of money it was not prepared to spend a decision seems to have been made around this time to allow du barry to die if a buyer for it could not be found drugs  cosmetic industry  remnants gemey would become a part of l’oreal in  and have ricils added to it in  l’oreal then merged gemey with other businesses it owned including diparco in  and maybelline in  chen yu is currently owned by eugene perma españa sa based in barcelona spain both lines are still in production in europe a remnant of three flowers also still exists in the form of tres flores a small men’s line consisting of a liquid and solid brilliantine and an

hudnut’s du barry line was in the doldrums with sales estimated to be less than two million dollars annually drug and cosmetic industry  p  in the hope of improving this situation gustavus apfeiffer  the president of william r warner decided to revisit an idea first suggested in  by the g lynn sumner advertising agency g lynn sumner established in  this new yorkbased firm had considerable expertise in the development of correspondence courses both through its president g lynn sumner and vicepresident mary brooks picken picken’s reputation in this area came through her publications on fashion needlework and dressmaking that she created for the woman’s institute of domestic arts and sciences and the booklets she developed for the singer sewing company the president of the firm g lynn sumner describes the events leading up to the original proposal in  mary brooks picken a vicepresident of our advertising agency was returning from europe and on shipboard she made the acquaintance of mr g a pfeiffer president of richard hudnut in the course of shipboard conversations he told her that the firm was interested in finding some new way to promote the dubarry sic line and any suggestions would be welcome back in new york mrs picken reported the discussion and together we went to work on a plan as a result of our experience at the international correspondence school and the women’s institute we had long felt that there was an opportunity for some cosmetic manufacturer to promote its goods by teaching women at home to improve their personal attractiveness mr pfeiffer’s invitation looked like the perfect chance for developing the idea we worked out a complete program for a sixweek’s course with a lesson for each day the plan provided that the manufacturer would supply the course with enough beauty and makeup preparations so that the student would be able to use them exclusively for the sixweek period our theory was that if a woman used one group of beauty preparations exclusively for six weeks and during that time received instructions for using them correctly she would be aware of such beneficial results that she would become a regular customer the course would be sold at a price sufficient to pay for the lessons the instruction the preparation and the cost of promotion thus it would finance itself sumner  p  as well as the low sales figures there was another factor that led g a pfeiffer to revisit the idea of marketing du barry through a correspondence course by  richard hudnut was running the richard hudnut success school in its new york salon on fifth avenue and it was doing very well success school the richard hudnut success school had started out as a debutant school for young women in need of ‘conditioning’ for their big ‘coming out’ event for us they were put through a sixweek course covering weight control streamlining deportment fashion makeup hair and nail care mothers of the ‘madeover’ debutants were generally pleased with the results and began requesting something similar for themselves this led to the development of a program for more mature women promoted as the richard hudnut success school many of the ideas and routines used in the richard hudnut success school had been in place in other new york salons for years body conditioning as a beauty regime goes back to the physical culture movement of the nineteenth century but it was elizabeth arden who first introduced physical exercise and diet regimes into new york beauty salons arden’s new salon at  fifth avenue had an entire floor dedicated to exercise and diet and both were also a key part of the beauty program at her maine chance health farm which opened in  gaylord hauser  – a celebrity nutritionist of the s – created lightdiet menus for arden’s clients who also took yoga and other exercise classes in programs overseen by director ann delafield after the strenuous part of the program clients relaxed on ‘tilt boards’ which were supposed to stop the face becoming gaunt when the rest of the body lost weight ann delafield ann delafield – whose real name was may macgregor – came to america in the early s as an actress in a touring company before applying for american citizenship in  for one reason or another she exchanged her acting career with one focused on diet exercise and general deportment after working as the director of the gymnasium at arden’s salon in new york for seven years delafield presumably got fed up with arden’s constant interference and took a position with richard hudnut sometime around  at first she worked in the debutant school but later became director of the richard hudnut success school and then the du barry success course above  director ann delafield interviewing an applicant for the richard hudnut success school the ‘tilt boards’ used in arden’s salon appear to have been based on an idea from gayelord hauser delafield bought the idea with her when she moved to richard hudnut where it was publicised it as the ‘beauty angle’ she later took out two patents covering the idea both of which were assigned to richard hudnut the first in  for a rocking device us  the second in  for a reclining board us  the second patent covered the ‘beauty angle’ ann delafield’s acting experience proved useful when she appeared in short films or in radio and television broadcasts promoting the richard hudnut success school or the du barry success course success course although the richard hudnut success school was profitable there were physical limits to the number of clients it could take to increase the number of participants – and number of women using du barry cosmetics – g a pfeiffer wanted to know if something could be developed that was similar to the success school that women could follow at home mary brooks picken sat in on some of the classes given by ann delafield and others and then with the agreement of g a pfeiffer the g lynn sumner advertising agency set about constructing the du barry success course modelled on the richard hudnut success school in the months that followed a special staff of writers artists and editors produced a new kind of home course one that would virtually take salon methods into the home stenographers took down miss delafield’s talks to her classes while artists sketched exercise and makeup teachers as they demonstrated each movement the result was a radical departure from conventional lesson plans each day’s instructions were given through the “spoken” rather than the written word and more than  pictures showed the student exactly what and how to do it sumner  p  course structure the du barry success course was made up of  daily lessons – one for each weekday over a sixweek period – and four special lessons including one for sundays above typical du barry success course exercise routine they were delivered by mail on a weekly basis although clients could elect to have them sent in a single lot the course was a mixture of positive thinking physical exercises deportment diet fashion tips and makeup classes a number of aspects of it are of particular interest beauty case a complementary beauty case containing du barry skin and makeup preparations came with the course some du barry distributors were unhappy about this seeing it as a disguised direct sale from which they did not get a return however the company saw it as a highclass product sample promotion that would introduce new clients to the du barry product line leading to repeat business drug and cosmetic industry  p  above  success beauty case it contained the following du barry cosmetics cleansing cream special cleansing preparation skin freshener skin firming lotion or special astringent special skin cream or skin softening cream derma sec formula hand beauty cream rose cream mask eye cream foundation lotion face rouge two boxes of face powder lip rouge eye shadow mascara makeup base toilet soap and dainty dry a deodorant i imagine that the cosmetics provided to each participant were adjusted according to what each person stipulated as their skin type and colouring the package underwent some refinements including the replacement of the costly case first with a box and then a tray hair care products were also added when these became more important to richard hudnut after the second world war above  success portable beauty tray the case is gone and the kit now includes the following items du barry cleansing cream special cleansing preparation skin freshener lubricating cream dermasec formula hand beauty cream rose cream mask eye cream foundation lotion cream rouge two boxes of face powder lip rouge eye shadow lash beauty makeup base and daintydry as well as richard hudnut enriched creme shampoo creme rinse creme hair dressing and dandruff treatment in  – possibly in response to reduced enrolments – the course was split into two price points plan a at us full payment that only came with the du barry special cleansing preparation cleansing cream and skin freshener enough product to complete the morning essentials of the beauty ritual and plan b at us full payment that included twenty du barry and richard hudnut skincare makeup and hairdressing preparations beauty routine the du barry beauty routine was a daily ritual introduced in the first week of the course the morning routine began with du barry cleansing cream to ‘remove dirt and grime’ followed by du barry skin freshener to ‘stimulate the skin’ after which du barry foundation lotion was applied to ‘shield the skin from the elements’ and form a basis for powder at night a richer cream was applied to ‘work wonders while you sleep’ by entrenching this routine into the course over the sixweeks richard hudnut hoped for continued sales of its skincare lines and to increase the amount of each product consumed as participants were taught to apply up to  more product than they used previously drug and cosmetic industry  p  the beauty angle as mentioned earlier the ‘beauty angle’ was a reworking of the ‘tilt boards’ ann delafield used in arden’s salon to keep the face looking firm while weight was lost from the rest of the body keystone of our whole success course as you will presently discover is the famous dubarry sic beauty angle face treatment … the development of which has radically changed our whole conception of the treatment for beauty it’s one of the reasons why you can drop pounds and inches and emerge with a face that seems smooth and firm … a neck that looks younger than it has in years an exclusive feature in our salon as an integral part of every face treatment it is a daily treat in your success course you spend a few minutes a day in the beauty angle position lying with your feet higher than your head with your body at a degree angle so that lifegiving fresh tissuebuilding blood can rush to your face neck and the upper portions of your body nourishing the skin cells naturally from within as dubarry sic beauty preparations cleanse smooth and soften from without “six weeks from tonight”  above the beauty angle in this publicity shot at the success school women are using their du barry makeup kits to elevate their feet at home it was suggested that women simply put their feet up on the footboard of their bed but some women put their ironing board to good use to get the required ° angle colorscope chart the course placed a good deal of effort into helping women select clothing and makeup colours that best suited them participants were provided with differently coloured tissue capes to try on so that they could judge which colours suited them best these were later replaced with squares of colour held up to the face in bright light women could also take fabric samples and do the same thing the idea being to choose colours that best suited to them rather than those that just appealed to them size climate and occasion were also considered when choosing apparel and makeup once a colour was selected that best suited her hair colour eye colour and skin tone a woman could then use a colorscope chart to identify the appropriate du barry makeup two examples are given below sky blue       light blue use dubarry peppermint pink or rose cerise lipstick cream rouge compact rouge dubarry peach or champagne beige face powder blue or blue mist eye shadow black lash beauty rose cerise with champagne beige is the preferred combination for this color – peppermint pink with peach powder when a lighter makeup is wanted … red glow       rich true red use dubarry carmeen or emblem red lipstick cream rouge compact rouge dubarry rachel  or special rachel face powder brown eye shadow brown lash beauty rachel  powder to tone down color in skin – special rachel when a little pink is needed to brighten the skin carmeen or emblem red can be used with either shade of face powder du barry success course  medical profession although not specifically backed by the american medical profession the course was approved for advertising in the journal of the american medical association jama which was viewed as a form of endorsement before commencing the success course richard hudnut recommended that women undergo a health check from their doctor and the enrolment application included a section for the doctor to fill in this made the course look more professional and provided the company with some margin of safety to help get doctors onside their wives were offered a free package of du barry face powder lipstick and lipstick brush and along with the physician’s daughter nurse or secretary wives could do the course for half price contest a large number of advertisements for the du barry success course used ‘before and after’ photographs often coupled with a table listing ‘before and after’ measurements and the difference between then early photographs were taken of clients from the richard hudnut success school who agreed to be used in advertising but this was later replaced by achievement award winners selected through a competition four times a year richard hudnut announced a contest for clients who had enrolled in a specific threemonth period the three winners were then brought to new york and were put up at the waldorfastoria hotel for a week during this time they did some post graduate work at the richard hudnut salon were treated to theatre shows and night clubs and made radio and television broadcasts the student must submit a photograph taken at the time she started the course and a complete set of her measurements and submit similar evidence after she had reached her goal of achievement she was asked to send a complete story of what she had accomplished and how the course had helped her in social business or professional advancement and in entering the course she must agree that if she should be one of the three winners she would give permission for the publication of her story and photographs in extending to others the work of the dubarry sic success course sumner  p  the contest therefore provided richard hudnut with a regular supply of advertising copy reception the du barry success course was first advertised in february  and soon became a major money making concern for richard hudnut by  some  courses had been sold at about us each netting the company nearly us in just three years along with longer waiting lists for the richard hudnut success school in the new york salon sales of the du barry line were also lifted to nearly us annually a fourfold improvement widely attributed the success course drug and cosmetic industry  p  although the course was wellconstructed welladministered and widely advertised part of the reason for its success may have been due to the time in which it was introduced america entered the second world war in december  and as new employment opportunities opened up many women were willing to undergo a fairly intensive regime to ‘get in shape’ and become more stylish closure in  elmer h bobst  became william r warner’s new company president bobst instigated a review of the william r warner and then made major management and structural changes to the business supported by charles pennock  – the executive responsible for the development of the richard hudnut du barry line – bobst viewed the du barry success school and the du barry home success course as unprofitable and by the early s had closed them down see also richard hudnut ann delafield was well aware of the developing situation and expressed her frustration with the changes in a letter to her friend mrs doris henry in los angeles california frankly i am discouraged with everything in regard to my business these days not that my business isn’t good as usual it is superb but the working conditions under which i now find myself with the new president and completely new management are unpleasant to say the least charlie pennock has convinced the brand new management that the success school has not been important to the dubarry line at any time nor contributed anything to his success in the past ten years and frankly the idea of having to reeducate this whole bunch of men into the facts of life bores me to say the least under the circumstances i wont be able to take any vacation as such this year … if you hear of anyone who has a couple of million

the firm’s work q why does rockwell group design productsa we create immersive environments where everything you touch helps tell a story that includes every piece of furniture and lighting—so it’s a natural extension to design those objects even for environments we haven’t created they are the touchpoints one remembers from the fabric on the chairs to the wall coverings we thought if we’re paying attention to the total experience we should pay attention to the design at all scales q how do you decide to design one product as opposed to anothera we always have a ton of ideas that are germinating but each product starts with a response to a need in the marketplace and a relationship with a partner we talk about what they need what they’re capable of who the product is for when it should launch how much will it cost we create a visual dialogue it’s a true collaboration that utilizes the partner company’s strengths and our point of view we like doing these products for interiors they are flexible transformable and aren’t so iconic as to be distracting to another designer’s goals for a project q give us a recent example a we previewed a collection for stellar works at clerkenwell design week in london inspired by the idea of a valet the entire collection will launch during milans salone del mobile  we’ve been designing a lot of rustic spaces with reclaimed materials and we wanted furniture that was at home in those spaces the collection is a response to how people live today it includes a bench and standing mirror made with simple straightforward honest materials they are not slick or overly designedq you worked for michael graves before you came to rockwell group in  what did you learn there and how did that experience shape what you do at rockwella there is a tradition of european architects who did everything such as josef hoffmann charles rennie mackintosh le corbusier marcel breuer but most architectural practice in the th century was confined to buildings if you designed furniture it looked nice in your clean white modernist box graves gave architects permission to play with color pattern and products…all those things were part of your practice because david rockwell has a passion for the temporary theatrical and ephemeral product design at rockwell group is intertwined with the narrative of projects we needed to think about

products barry richards a principal and studio leader leads rockwell group’s product design from his first project—a oneoff custom chair for grand central’s lower level—to the firm’s current collections for maya romanoff and shaw hospitality group to watch barry pore over drawings of an upcoming collection is a treat he brings his encyclopedic knowledge of product design history—as well as his intuitive sense for what people want to see touch and live with—to bear with simple words and quick gestures we asked barry about rockwell group’s products and how they complement the rest of the firm’s work q why does rockwell group design productsa we create immersive environments where everything you touch helps tell a story that includes every piece of furniture and lighting—so it’s a natural extension to design those objects even for environments we haven’t created they are the touchpoints one remembers from the fabric on the chairs to the wall coverings we thought if we’re paying attention to the total experience we should pay attention to the design at all scales q how do you decide to design one product as opposed to anothera we always have a ton of ideas that are germinating but each product starts with a response to a need in the marketplace and a relationship with a partner we talk about what they need what they’re capable of who the product is for when it should launch how much will it cost we create a visual dialogue it’s a true collaboration that utilizes the partner company’s strengths and our point of view we like doing these products for interiors they are flexible transformable and aren’t so iconic as to be distracting to another designer’s goals for a project q give us a recent example a we previewed a collection for stellar works at clerkenwell design week in london inspired by the idea of a valet the entire collection will launch during milans salone del mobile  we’ve been designing a lot of rustic spaces with reclaimed materials and we wanted furniture that was at home in those spaces the collection is a response to how people live today it includes a bench and standing mirror made with simple straightforward honest materials they are not slick or overly designedq you worked for michael graves before you came to rockwell group in  what did you learn there and how did that experience shape what you do at rockwella there is a tradition of european architects who did everything such as josef hoffmann charles rennie mackintosh le corbusier marcel breuer but most architectural practice in the th century was confined to buildings if you designed furniture it looked nice in your clean white modernist box graves gave architects permission to play with color pattern and products…all those things were part of
