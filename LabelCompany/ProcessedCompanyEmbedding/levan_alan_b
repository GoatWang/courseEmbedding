their case in a second jury trial starting next week by mike seemuth  march   pm alan levan alan b levan chairman and ceo of fort lauderdalebased bbx capital corp may be near the end of a fiveyear legal fight with the us securities and exchange commission over the company’s public disclosures of loan quality when it owned bankatlantic but the legal issues haven’t kept bbx from investing in multiple real estate projects in south florida and elsewhere since the sale of bankatlantic in  – the same year the sec charged levan and bbx with violations of securities laws in a lawsuit “we are doing business with highquality developers on excellent sites” levan told the real deal “the advantage of being in the banking business is knowing who the good guys are those are the people we chose to be our partners” among its projects bbx is working on a twophase townhouse development in pembroke pines called centra falls with harry posen a former executive of minto communities “we provided some seed capital as an investor in that project” levan said he described posen as a “good guy with a world of experience … he’s just an expert at what he does” when bankatlantic was sold levan said bbx took out and held onto the doubtful loans and foreclosed properties that had been on bankatlantic’s books “what we kept was what everyone called the junk but … it turned out to be gold” he said bbx has since purchased some properties for development and has acquired others by foreclosing on loans that bankatlantic originated in  for example bbx acquired  acres of land in hialeah now known as the bonterra development by foreclosing on a loan to a company headed by home builder sergio pino levan said bbx subsequently sold a third of the land to lennar corp the miamibased home builder and put the rest of the land into housing development ventures with two partners coral gablesbased codinacarr company and boca ratonbased altman development   bbx collected  million of cash distributions last year from its homebuilding joint venture with codinacarr called cc bonterra according to an annual report that publiclyheld bbx filed this month with the sec bbx also disclosed in its annual report that it collected  million in distributions last year from its investment in altis at kendall square a unit apartment in kendall developed by altman development altman sold the property in december “we financed the land for altman development and when joel altman was ready to build that we wanted to participate as an investor in that project” levan said “so we put a portion of our land into the development altman did a great job in building that and selling it” outside south florida bbx has been developing  acres near the mall at millenia in orlando the company acquired the land by foreclosing on a loan that bankatlantic had originated bbx sold part of the land to costco which has opened a store on its site bbx also entered a joint venture with fort lauderdalebased stiles corp to develop a squarefoot shopping center on another site within the acre property bbx is part of a joint venture to build apartments there too   bbx and stiles also are partners in a project to sell developable land at pga station a mixeduse development in palm beach gardens they have a contract to sell part of the land to a hotel developer a deal expected to close by midyear levan said a second federal trial by jury pitting the sec against levan and bbx will start next week the judge in the first trial told the jury that levan lied about the quality of bankatlantic’s loan portfolio during a conference call with stock analysts the judge ordered levan to pay a  million fine and bbx to pay a  million fine he also banned levan from serving as an officer or director of bbx or any other public company for two years but the fines were rescinded and levan rejoined bbx as chairman and ceo after he and the company successfully appealed the trial judge’s partial summary judgment that levan lied during the july  conference call   the eleventh circuit court of appeals ruled that the trial judge should have allowed the jury to decide for itself whether levan lied in a threesentence statement during the conference call so another jury trial is scheduled to start monday – more than five years after the federal agency sued the executive and his company in january  for allegedly violating securities laws in disclosures of loan quality eric bustillo the regional sec director in miami declined to comment on the upcoming trial “i don’t comment on pending litigation” he said the focus of the second trial will be levan’s threesentence statement during the july  conference call gene stearns levan’s attorney told trd stearns said the jury in the first trial rejected the sec’s allegations that bankatlantic made false statements about the quality of its loans in written documents filed with the sec stearns also said levan simply summarized these written disclosures in his threesentence statement during the july  conference call “the judge told the jury that he found before the trial that the three sentences were false and misleading they the jurors had to accept that we lost that issue of course we won everything else” stearns said “we’re going back to court because we have to try that part of the case we didn’t win the first time even though we won everything else” tags alan
