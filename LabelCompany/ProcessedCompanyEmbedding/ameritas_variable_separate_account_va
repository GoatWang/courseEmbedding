by subaccounts of the separate accounts each a “substitution” and together the “substitutions”  the investment objectives and principal investment policies of the replacement fund and the substituted portfolios are as follows ameritas income  growth primarily seeks to provide a high level of dividend income with a secondary goal to provide capital appreciation by investing in dividend paying equity securities such as common or preferred stocks preferably those which the subadviser believes also offer opportunities for capital appreciation alger allcap seeks longterm capital appreciation by investing in equity securities of companies of any size which demonstrate promising growth potential salomon variable all cap seeks capital appreciation by investing primarily in securities which the manager believes have aboveaverage capital appreciation potential a secondary consideration is given to a companys dividend record and the potential for improved dividend return salomon variable

the substituted funds moreover there will be no increase in contract fees and expenses including mortality and expense risk fees and administration and distribution fees charged to the separate accounts as a result of the substitutions applicants believe that if the proposed substitutions are implemented the core investment goals of affected contract owners will not be frustrated and the investment expectations of affected contract owners can continue to be met applicants expect that the substitutions will provide significant benefits to contract owners including improved selection of portfolio managers and simplification of fund offerings through the elimination of overlapping offerings applicants state that ameritas considered the performance history of the substituted funds and the replacement funds and determined that no contract owners would be materially adversely affected as a result of the substitutions applicants believe that the substitutions each of which replaces outside funds with a fund for which ameritas investment acts as investment advisor will permit ameritas investment under a multimanager order granted by the commission and under shareholder approval previously obtained to hire monitor and replace subadvisers as necessary to seek optimal performance and to ensure a consistent investment style applicants further believe that the subadviser to the replacement fund is better positioned to provide consistent aboveaverage performance for its fund than the adviser or subadvisers of the substituted funds applicants state that contract owners will continue to be able to select among a large number of funds with a full range of investment objectives investment strategies and managers applicants believe there will also be a significant savings to contract owners because certain costs such as the costs of printing and mailing lengthy periodic reports and prospectuses for the substituted funds will be substantially reduced  applicants represent that they will not receive for three years from the date of the substitutions any direct or indirect benefits from the new fund its advisors or underwriters or from affiliates of the new funds their

underwriters or from affiliates of substituted funds their advisors or underwriters including without limitation rule b fees shareholder service or administrative or other service fees revenue sharing or other arrangements collectively “revenue arrangements” applicants represent that the substitutions and the selection of the new fund was not motivated by any financial consideration paid or to be paid to applicants or any affiliate of applicants by the new fund its advisors underwriters or affiliates  the proposed substitutions will take place at relative net asset value with no change in the amount of any contract owners contract value cash value or death benefit or in the dollar value of his or her investment in the separate accounts applicants expect that the substitutions will be effected by redeeming shares of a substituted fund and reinvesting the proceeds of such redemption in shares of the replacement fund through a combination of cash and “in kind” transactions  contract owners will not incur any fees or charges as a result of the proposed substitutions nor will their rights or ameritas obligations under the contracts be altered in any way all expenses incurred in connection with the proposed substitutions including brokerage legal accounting and other fees and expenses will be paid by ameritas in addition the proposed substitutions will not impose any tax liability on contract owners the proposed substitutions will not cause the contract fees and charges currently being paid by existing contract owners to be greater after the proposed substitutions than before the proposed substitutions no fees will be charged on the transfers made at the time of the proposed substitutions because the proposed substitutions will not be treated as a transfer for the purpose of assessing transfer charges or for determining the number of remaining permissible transfers in a contract year  following the date on which ameritas is notified that the notice of the application is to be published in the federal register but before the date on which the order requested by the application becomes effective ameritas will send to affected contract owners notice “substitution notice” the substitution notice will inform affected contract owners of a the effective date of the substitutions “effective date” b the right of each affected contract owner under their contract to transfer contract values among the various subaccounts and c the fact that any such transfer involving a transfer from a substituted fund will not be subject to any administrative charge and will not count as one of the “free transfers” to which affected contract owners may otherwise be entitled the substitution notice will also inform affected contract owners that a ameritas will not exercise any rights reserved under any contract to impose additional restrictions on transfers other than with respect to “market timing” activity described in each contracts prospectus until at least

the start printed page replacement fund subaccount to another subaccount without the transfer or exchange being treated as one of a limited number of transfers or exchanges permitted without a

the substitutions were carried out b reiterate that each affected contract owner may transfer all of the contract value or cash value under a contract that is invested in a substituted fund to any other subaccount available under their contract without such transfer being subject to any administrative charge or being counted as one of the “free transfers” or one of the limited number of transfers to which affected contract owners may be entitled under the contracts and c state that other than with respect to “market timing” activity described above ameritas will not exercise any rights reserved by it under the contracts to impose additional restrictions on transfers until at least  days after the effective date  for those who were contract owners on the date of the proposed substitutions ameritas and ameritas investment will reimburse on the last business day of each fiscal period not to exceed a fiscal quarter during the twentyfour months following the date of the proposed substitutions the subaccount investing in the replacement fund such that the sum of the replacement funds operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements and subaccount expenses assetbased fees and charges deducted on a daily basis from subaccount assets and reflected in the calculation of subaccount unit values for such period will not exceed on an annualized basis the sum of the replacement funds operating expenses taking into account fee waivers and expense reimbursements and subaccount expenses for the fiscal year preceding the date of the proposed substitutions in addition for twentyfour months following the proposed substitutions ameritas and ameritas investment will not increase separate account fees or charges for contracts outstanding on the date of the proposed substitutions applicants legal analysis  section c of the  act provides in pertinent part that “it shall be unlawful for any depositor or trustee of a registered unit investment trust holding the security of a single issuer to substitute another security for such security unless the commission shall have approved such substitution” section c of the  act also provides that the commission shall issue an order approving such substitutions if the evidence establishes that the substitutions are consistent with the protection of investors and the purposes fairly intended by the policies and provisions of the  act  the contracts expressly reserve to ameritas the right subject to compliance with applicable law to substitute shares of another investment company for shares of an investment company held by a subaccount of the separate accounts applicants assert that the prospectuses for the contracts and the separate accounts contain appropriate disclosure of this right  in each case applicants believe that it is in the best interests of the contract owners to substitute the replacement fund for the substituted fund in this regard applicants contend that the proposed replacement fund for each substituted fund has an investment objective that is at least substantially similar to that of the substituted fund applicants also assert that the principal investment policies of the replacement funds are similar to those of the corresponding substituted funds in addition with respect to each proposed substitution applicants note that affected contract owners with balances invested in the replacement fund will have a lower or the same expense ratio in all cases  applicants anticipate that contract owners will be better off with the array of subaccounts offered after the proposed substitutions than they have been with the array of subaccounts offered prior to the substitutions the proposed substitutions retain for contract owners the investment flexibility which is a central feature of the contracts if the proposed substitutions are carried out all contract owners will be permitted to allocate purchase payment and transfer contract values and cash values between and among approximately the same number of subaccounts as they could before the proposed substitutions moreover the elimination of the costs of printing and mailing prospectuses and periodic reports of the substituted funds will benefit contract owners  applicants note that contract owners who do not wish to participate in a replacement fund will have an opportunity to reallocate their accumulated value among other available subaccounts without the imposition of any charge or limitation other than with respect to “market timing” activity  applicants assert that for the reasons summarized above the proposed substitutions and related transactions meet the standards of section c of the  act and that the requested order should be granted  sections a and  of the  act prohibit an affiliated person of a registered investment company or affiliated persons of any such affiliated person or any principal underwriter for such company collectively “transaction affiliates” from selling a security to or purchasing a security from the registered investment company applicants may be deemed to be transaction affiliates of one another based upon the definition of “affiliated person” under section a of the  act because the substitutions may be effected in whole or in part by means of inkind redemptions and purchases the substitutions may be deemed to involve one or more purchases or sales of securities or property between transaction affiliates  section b provides that the commission may grant an application exempting proposed transactions from the prohibitions of section a if the terms of the proposed transaction are reasonable and fair and do not involve overreaching on the part of any person concerned the transaction is consistent with the investment policies of each registered investment company concerned and the transaction is consistent with the general purposes of the act applicants state that the consideration to be paid by the replacement fund and each of the substituted funds will be fair and reasonable and will not involve overreaching because the substitutions will not result in the dilution of the interests of any affected contract owners and will not effect any change in economic interest contract value or the dollar value of any variable contract held by an affected contract owner  in addition applicants state that to the extent the substitutions are effected by redeeming shares of the substituted funds and using the redemption proceeds to purchase shares of the replacement funds the substitutions will satisfy each of the procedural safeguards adopted by the board of directors responsible for each of the ameritas portfolios and the substituted funds respectively under rule a under the  act applicants conclusion applicants assert that for the reasons summarized above the proposed substitutions and transactions meet the standards of section c of the act and are consistent with the standards of start printed page section b of the act and that the requested orders should be granted start signature for the commission by the division of
