name when postinguse of abbreviations such as sf will be deleted this board is to be used to discuss sford the company its officers and its stock messages about other posters or intentions the mods name calling profanity deletions etc are off topic at the very least  to answer some of your questions regarding posts please read the following that you should have known already taken from the ihub faq section of the ihub handbook so you can stop with the moronic conspiracy theories about the mods and admins on this board regarding libel and slander suspected posts libel can only become a fact if a judge says it is nobody else including moderators or site admins can nor will determine that member posted content is libelous members are often of the opinion that a post is libelous but no moderator should act based on that opinion libel is decided by a judge in a court of law after conducting proper evidentiary hearings if such a judgment is issued by a court of competent jurisdiction ihub will abide by that ruling otherwise it is not a matter that site admin or mods can decide our only role here is to ensure adherence to the terms of use anecdotally quite often the information that some members allege to be libelous ends up being accurate which is why neither site admins nor moderators remove posts on the basis of being allegedly false or libelous regarding posting lies or what some posters feel are lies mods or admin do not make decisions about the veracity of information posted truth is a very subjective term and neither site admin nor mods remove posts based on judgments of this type each reader has both the right and obligation to decide for themselves if they feel a post is accurate and its author credible as a participant on the board the moderators recourse is the same as any other member to debate the information contained in the post without attacking the member or to ignore it attack the message not the messenger regarding a good dd post with a personal attack lumped in if a post is  on topic and  personal attack it still needs to be removed personal attacks in any form are disrespectful of others and are unwelcome on the site these types of gratuitous comments also create noise and dilute the quality of the board when a member attacks another poster other participants inevitably feel the need to respond either agreeing or defending then others feel the need to respond to these…and so on and so on ad nauseam pretty soon the board has devolved into personal attacks and discussion about other members ie noise and no signal there are plenty of other sites that allow these types of posts and it is difficult to find any meaningful content on such sites the goal at ihub is to have all information whether positive neutral or negative discussed in a civil manner free of personal attacks regarding proof of member post content members do not have to provide proof when offering their opinions there is no requirement for members to substantiate their posts veracity of posts and credibility of the author is determined by the reader   httpwwwstrikeforcetechcomindexaspx     sfor security details outstanding shares
