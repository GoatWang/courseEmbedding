and full prescribing information migergot important safety information warning serious andor lifethreatening peripheral ischemia has been associated with the coadministration of ergotamine tartrate and caffeine with potent cyp a inhibitors including protease inhibitors and macrolide antibiotics because cyp a inhibition elevates the serum levels of ergotamine tartrate and caffeine the risk for vasospasm leading to cerebral ischemia andor ischemia of the extremities is increased hence concomitant use of these medications is contraindicated contraindications do not administer migergot with potent cyp a inhibitors such as protease inhibitors or macrolide antibiotics as this has been associated with acute ergot toxicity ergotism characterized by vasospasm and ischemia of the extremities with some cases resulting in amputation there have been rare reports of cerebral ischemia in patients on protease inhibitor therapy when ergotamine tartrate and caffeine was coadministered at least one resulting in death do not use migergot in women who are or may become pregnant or who are nursing as it may cause harm to the fetus or nursing infant do not use migergot in patients with peripheral vascular disease coronary heart disease hypertension impaired hepatic or renal function or sepsis do not use migergot in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its components warnings and precautions coadministration of ergotamine with potent cyp a inhibitors such as protease inhibitors or macrolide antibiotics has been associated with serious adverse events for this reason these drugs should not be given concomitantly with ergotamine while these reactions have not been reported with less potent cyp a inhibitors there is a potential risk for serious toxicity including vasospasm when these drugs are used with ergotamine there have been reports of patients on ergotamine tartrate and caffeine therapy developing retroperitoneal andor pleuropulmonary fibrosis there have also been rare reports of fibrotic thickening of the aortic mitral tricuspid andor pulmonary valves with longterm continuous use of ergotamine tartrate and caffeine ergotamine tartrate suppositories should not be used for chronic daily administration ergotamine tartrate and caffeine should not be administered with other vasoconstrictors nicotine may provoke vasoconstriction in some patients predisposing to a greater ischemic response to ergot therapy while most cases of ergotism results from frank overdosage some have involved apparent hypersensitivity care should be exercised so that the patient remains within the limits of the recommended dosage in rare instances patients may display withdrawal symptoms consisting of rebound headaches upon discontinuation of the drug rare cases of solitary rectal or anal ulcer have occurred from product abuse spontaneous healing occurs within usually  weeks after drug withdrawal no more than  suppositories should be taken for any single migraine attack no more than  suppositories should be taken during any day period adverse reactions cardiovascular vasoconstrictive complications of a serious nature may occur at times these include ischemia cyanosis absence of pulse cold extremities gangrene precordial distress and pain ekg changes and muscle pains although these effects occur most commonly with longterm therapy at

vimovo is not interchangeable with the individual components of naproxen and esomeprazole magnesium important safety information warning risk of serious cardiovascular and gastrointestinal events cardiovascular thrombotic events nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs nsaids a component of vimovo cause an increased risk of serious cardiovascular thrombotic events including myocardial infarction and stroke which can be fatal this risk may occur early in treatment and may increase with duration of use vimovo is contraindicated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft cabg surgery

nsaids have been reported in such patients in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft cabg surgery warnings and precautions use the lowest effective dose for the shortest duration consistent with individual patient treatment goals there is no consistent evidence that concurrent use of aspirin mitigates the increased risk of serious cv thrombotic events associated with nsaid use vimovo can be administered with low‐dose aspirin ≤ mgday therapy the concurrent use of aspirin and an nsaid such as vimovo increases the risk of serious gi events as with all nsaids concurrent administration of naproxen and aspirin is not generally recommended because of the increased risk of bleeding elevation of one or more liver tests may occur during therapy with nsaids vimovo should be discontinued immediately if clinical signs and symptoms consistent with liver disease develop vimovo is not recommended in patients with severe hepatic insufficiency hypertension can occur with nsaid treatment

for osteoporosis‐related fractures of the hip wrist or spine avoid concomitant use of vimovo with other naproxencontaining products or other nonaspirin nsaids clopidogrel due to a reduction in plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of clopidogrel when using esomeprazole consider alternative anti‐platelet therapy st john’s wort or rifampin due to the potential reduction in esomeprazole levels methotrexate which may elevate andor prolong serum concentrations of methotrexate andor its metabolite possibly leading to toxicity note see full prescribing information for a list of
