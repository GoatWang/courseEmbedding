all companies need to consider such risks of course however for some companies there are also substantial risks associated with social media and content generation on the web this article focuses on “content liability” arising out of a company’s website or from social media content liability is a catchall name for the various risks that are associated with content published by an organization its

nonsponsored social media postings of their employees under certain circumstancesauthors david l coxshouldn’t cyberinsurance cover negligenceaba insurance coverage litigation committee newsletterseptember companies’ own negligence often contributes to data breach losses for example data breaches may be caused by an “oops” negligent employee conduct which includes failure to follow company policies and procedures failure to maintain reasonable expertise in company software website and related applications failure to maintain awareness of current threats to the company and general carelessness in maintaining a secure work environment another cause is the “ghost in the machine” system glitches which include inherent design flaw in security software processing error imperfect software updates or patches application failures and inadvertent data dumps according to a recent survey of united states companies over half of commercial data breaches can be attributed to various types of human error by company employees the ponemon institute’s  cost of data breach study reports that  of the time the root cause for the data breaches in its study were negligent in nature — either “system glitch” or “human error” as opposed to “malicious or criminal attack” policyholders should be aware however that a number of cyber insurance forms contain certain exclusions that if interpreted broadly could operate to significantly limit or eliminate altogether coverage for losses created by the “oops” or the “ghost in the machine” authors david l cox gregory jacobsthe

the internet is in everyones pocket it might be surprising that theres still room for education textbooks one reason is simple while the internet may be everywhere its not always accurate and when it comes to educating people you need to have accurate information thats why approved textbooks are so important they give you the facts not the opinions of someone on the internethelp for the home schooledno one needs textbooks more than the parent who home schools their children there is a growing movement toward home schooling so that parents can focus their childrens education on the aspects engl are most important to them and tailor the curriculum to their own childs individual learning styles from science and mathematics to english and history textbooks are a vital part of any education programfor every age levelno matter what age or grade level your student is at there are education textbooks to cover their needs even if they go to a regular grade school there are supplementary textbooks you can pick up to help them if they need it not every book is the right fit for every student and sometimes the one who is having the most trouble with math in school is the one who flourishes the most as soon as you expose them to a different textbookexplore adult educationeducation isnt just for children many adults have a need for textbooks too from those who left school early and are now looking for textbooks so they can get their ged to professionals looking to further their development theres a huge demand for textbooks from people in all walks of life its not just academic textbooks you can also get textbooks on practical subjects from financial management to woodworking and auto repaircontrol your college educationcollege is more than just an investment in your future its an investment one way to take charge of your college costs is to look outside your college bookstore for your textbooks many textbooks especially in fields such as english and history

principles of biochemistry th edition by david l nelson michael m cox  test bank sample chapter    enzymes multiple choice questions an introduction to enzymes pages − difficulty  ans a one of the enzymes involved in glycolysis aldolase requires zn for catalysis  under conditions of zinc deficiency when the enzyme may lack zinc it would be referred to as the apoenzyme coenzyme holoenzyme prosthetic group substrate an introduction to enzymes page  difficulty  ans d which one of the following is not among the six internationally accepted classes of enzymes hydrolases ligases oxidoreductases polymerases transferases how enzymes work pages − difficulty  ans e enzymes are potent catalysts because they are consumed in the reactions they catalyze are very specific and can prevent the conversion of products back to substrates drive reactions to completion while other catalysts drive reactions to equilibrium increase the equilibrium constants for the reactions they catalyze lower the activation energy for the reactions they catalyze how enzymes work pages − difficulty  ans d the role of an enzyme in an enzymecatalyzed reaction is to bind a transition state intermediate such that it cannot be converted back to substrate ensure that all of the substrate is converted to product ensure that the product is more stable than the substrate increase the rate at which substrate is converted into product make the freeenergy change for the reaction more favorable how enzymes work pages − difficulty  ansd which one of the following statements is true of enzyme catalysts their catalytic activity is independent of ph they are generally equally active on d and l isomers of a given substrate they can increase the equilibrium constant for a given reaction by a thousand fold or more they can increase the reaction rate for a given reaction by a thousandfold or more to be effective they must be present at the same concentration as their substrate how enzymes work pages − difficulty  ans d which one of the following statements is true of enzyme catalysts they bind to substrates but are never covalently attached to substrate or product they increase the equilibrium constant for a reaction thus favoring product formation they increase the stability of the product of a desired reaction by allowing ionizations resonance and isomerizations not normally available to substrates they lower the activation energy for the conversion of substrate to product to be effective they must be present at the same concentration as their substrates how enzymes work pages − difficulty  ans c which of the following statements is false a reaction may not occur at a detectable rate even though it has a favorable equilibrium after a reaction the enzyme involved becomes available to catalyze the reaction again for s → p a catalyst shifts the reaction equilibrium to the right lowering the temperature of a reaction will lower the reaction rate substrate binds to an enzyme’s active site how enzymes work pages − difficulty  ans b enzymes differ from other catalysts in that only enzymes are not consumed in the reaction display specificity toward a single reactant fail to influence the equilibrium point of the reaction form an activated complex with the reactants lower the activation energy of the reaction catalyzed how enzymes work page  difficulty  ans a compare the two reaction coordinate diagrams below and select the answer that correctly describes their relationship  in each case the single intermediate is the es complex a describes a strict “lock and key” model whereas b describes a transitionstate complementarity model the activation energy for the catalyzed reaction is  in a and is  in b the activation energy for the uncatalyzed reaction is given by    in a and by    in b the contribution of binding energy is given by  in a and by  in b the es complex is given by  in a and  in b how enzymes work pages − difficulty  ans b which of the following is true of the binding energy derived from enzymesubstrate interactions it cannot provide enough energy to explain the large rate accelerations brought about by enzymes it is sometimes used to hold two substrates in the optimal orientation for reaction it is the result of covalent bonds formed between enzyme and substrate most of it is derived from covalent bonds between enzyme and substrate most of it is used up simply binding the substrate to the enzyme enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism page  difficulty  ans d the concept of “induced fit” refers to the fact that enzyme specificity is induced by enzymesubstrate binding enzymesubstrate binding induces an increase in the reaction entropy thereby catalyzing the reaction enzymesubstrate binding induces movement along the reaction coordinate to the transition state substrate binding may induce a conformational change in the enzyme which then brings catalytic groups into proper orientation when a substrate binds to an enzyme the enzyme induces a loss of water desolvation from the substrate enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  ans a in the following diagram of the first step in the reaction catalyzed by the protease chymotrypsin the process of general base catalysis is illustrated by the number  and the process of covalent catalysis is illustrated by the number            enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism page  difficulty  ans b the benefit of measuring the initial rate of a reaction v is that at the beginning of a reaction es can be measured accurately changes in s are negligible so s can be treated as a constant changes in km are negligible so km can be treated as a constant v  vmax varying s has no effect on v enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  ans b which of the following statements about a plot of v vs s for an enzyme that follows michaelismenten kinetics is false as s increases the initial velocity of reaction v also increases at very high s the velocity curve becomes a horizontal line that intersects the yaxis at km km is the s at which v   vmax the shape of the curve is a hyperbola the yaxis is a rate term with units of μmmin enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism page  difficulty  ans d michaelis and menten assumed that the overall reaction for an enzymecatalyzed reaction could be written as           k       k e  s      es  →  e  p           k using this reaction the rate of breakdown of the enzymesubstrate complex can be described by the expression k et − es k et − ess k es k es  k es k es enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism page  difficulty  ans c the steady state assumption as applied to enzyme kinetics implies km  ks the enzyme is regulated the es complex is formed and broken down at equivalent rates the km is equivalent to the cellular substrate concentration the maximum velocity occurs when the enzyme is saturated enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  ans c an enzymecatalyzed reaction was carried out with the substrate concentration initially a thousand times greater than the km for that substrate  after  minutes  of the substrate had been converted to product and the amount of product formed in the reaction mixture was  μmol  if in a separate experiment onethird as much enzyme and twice as much substrate had been combined how long would it take for the same amount  μmol of product to be formed  min  min  min  min  min enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  ans d which of these statements about enzymecatalyzed reactions is false at saturating levels of substrate the rate of an enzymecatalyzed reaction is proportional to the enzyme concentration if enough substrate is added the normal vmax of a reaction can be attained even in the presence of a competitive inhibitor the rate of a reaction decreases steadily with time as substrate is depleted the activation energy for the catalyzed reaction is the same as for the uncatalyzed reaction but the equilibrium constant is more favorable in the enzymecatalyzed reaction the michaelismenten constant km equals the s at which v   vmax enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism page  difficulty  ans c the following data were obtained in a study of an enzyme known to follow michaelismenten kinetics v substrate added μmolmin mmoll —————————————      ————————————— the km for this enzyme is approximately  mm  mm  mm  mm  mm enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism page − difficulty  ans c for enzymes in which the slowest ratelimiting step is the reaction k es  →  p km becomes equivalent to kcat the s where v  vmax the dissociation constant kd for the es complex the maximal velocity the turnover number enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism page  difficulty  ans d for the simplified representation of an enzymecatalyzed reaction shown below the statement “es is in steadystate” means that k k e  s   es             e  p k k a k is very slow b k k c k k d kes  kes  kes e kes  kes enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism page  difficulty  ans d the lineweaverburk plot is used to determine the equilibrium constant for an enzymatic reaction extrapolate for the value of reaction rate at infinite enzyme concentration illustrate the effect of temperature on an enzymatic reaction solve graphically for the rate of an enzymatic reaction at infinite substrate concentration solve graphically for the ratio of products to reactants for any starting substrate concentration enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism page  difficulty  ans a the doublereciprocal transformation of the michaelismenten equation also called the lineweaverburk plot is given by v  km vmaxs  vmax to determine km from a doublereciprocal plot you would multiply the reciprocal of the xaxis intercept by − multiply the reciprocal of the yaxis intercept by − take the reciprocal of the xaxis intercept take the reciprocal of the yaxis intercept take the xaxis intercept where v   vmax enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism page  difficulty  ans e to calculate the turnover number of an enzyme you need to know the enzyme concentration the initial velocity of the catalyzed reaction at s  km the initial velocity of the catalyzed reaction at low s the km for the substrate both a and b enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism page  difficulty  ans e the number of substrate molecules converted to product in a given unit of time by a single enzyme molecule at saturation is referred to as the dissociation constant halfsaturation constant maximum velocity michaelismenten number turnover number enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  ans b in a plot of lv against s for an enzymecatalyzed reaction the presence of a competitive inhibitor will alter the curvature of the plot intercept on the ls axis intercept on the lv axis pk of the plot vmax enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  ans d in competitive inhibition an inhibitor binds at several different sites on an enzyme binds covalently to the enzyme binds only to the es complex binds reversibly at the active site lowers the characteristic vmax of the enzyme enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  ans d vmax for an enzymecatalyzed reaction generally increases when ph increases increases in the presence of a competitive inhibitor is limited only by the amount of substrate supplied is twice the rate observed when the concentration of substrate is equal to the km is unchanged in the presence of a uncompetitive inhibitor enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism page  difficulty  ans b enzyme x exhibits maximum activity at ph    x shows a fairly sharp decrease in its activity when the ph goes much lower than   one likely interpretation of this ph activity is that a glu residue on the enzyme is involved in the reaction a his residue on the enzyme is involved in the reaction the enzyme has a metallic cofactor the enzyme is found in gastric secretions the reaction relies on specific acidbase catalysis examples of enzymatic reactions pages − difficulty  ans a phenylmethanesulfonylfluoride pmsf inactivates serine proteases by binding covalently to the catalytic serine residue at the active site this enzymeinhibitor bond is not cleaved by the enzyme  this is an example of what kind of inhibition irreversible competitive noncompetitive mixed ph inhibition examples of enzymatic reactions page  difficulty  ans b both water and glucose share an —oh that can serve as a substrate for a reaction with the terminal phosphate of atp catalyzed by hexokinase  glucose however is about a million times more reactive as a substrate than water  the best explanation is that glucose has more —oh groups per molecule than does water the larger glucose binds better to the enzyme it induces a conformational change in hexokinase that brings activesite amino acids into position for catalysis the —oh group of water is attached to an inhibitory h atom while the glucose —oh group is attached to c water and the second substrate atp compete for the active site resulting in a competitive inhibition of the enzyme water normally will not reach the active site because it is hydrophobic examples of enzymatic reactions pages  difficulty  ans b a good transitionstate analog binds covalently to the enzyme binds to the enzyme more tightly than the substrate binds very weakly to the enzyme is too unstable to isolate must be almost identical to the substrate examples of enzymatic reactions pages − difficulty  ans c a transitionstate analog is less stable when binding to an enzyme than the normal substrate resembles the active site of general acidbase enzymes resembles the transitionstate structure of the normal enzymesubstrate complex stabilizes the transition state for the normal enzymesubstrate complex typically reacts more rapidly with an enzyme than the normal substrate examples of enzymatic reactions page  difficulty  ans d the role of the metal ion mg in catalysis by enolase is to act as a general acid catalyst act as a general base catalyst facilitate general acid catalysis facilitate general base catalysis stabilize protein conformation examples of enzymatic reactions page − difficulty  ans c penicillin and related drugs inhibit the enzyme  this enzyme is produced by  βlacamase bacteria transpeptidase human cells transpeptidase bacteria lysozyme human cells aldolase bacteria regulatory enzymes pages − difficulty  ans e which of the following statements about allosteric control of enzymatic activity is false allosteric effectors give rise to sigmoidal v vs s kinetic plots allosteric proteins are generally composed of several subunits an effector may either inhibit or activate an enzyme binding of the effector changes the conformation of the enzyme molecule heterotropic allosteric effectors compete with substrate for binding sites regulatory enzymes pages − difficulty  ans a a small molecule that decreases the activity of an enzyme by binding to a site other than the catalytic site is termed an allosteric inhibitor alternative inhibitor competitive inhibitor stereospecific agent transitionstate analog regulatory enzymes pages − difficulty  ans c allosteric enzymes are regulated primarily by covalent modification usually catalyze several different reactions within a metabolic pathway usually have more than one polypeptide

the specificity of protein kinases disulfide bonds near the phosphorylation site primary sequence at phosphorylation site protein quaternary structure protein tertiary structure residues near the phosphorylation site regulatory enzymes page  difficulty  ans c how is trypsinogen converted to trypsin a protein kinasecatalyzed phosphorylation converts trypsinogen to trypsin an increase in ca concentration promotes the conversion proteolysis of trypsinogen forms trypsin trypsinogen dimers bind an allosteric modulator camp causing dissociation into active trypsin monomers two inactive trypsinogen dimers pair to form an active trypsin tetramer regulatory enzymes page  difficulty  ans b the allosteric enzyme atcase is regulated by ctp which binds to the tstate of atcase ctp is a a positive regulator b negative regulator c cofactor d competitive inhibitor e coenzyme regulatory enzymes page − difficulty  ans e blood coagulation involves a a kinase cascade b zymogen activation c serine proteases d a and b e b and c short answer questions an introduction to enzymes page  difficulty  define the terms “cofactor” and “coenzyme” ans a cofactor is any chemical component required for enzyme activity it includes both organic molecules called “coenzymes” and inorganic ions how enzymes work page  difficulty  draw and label a reaction coordinate diagram for an uncatalyzed reaction s → p and the same reaction catalyzed by an enzyme e ans see fig  p  how enzymes work page  difficulty  the difference in standard free energy content δg’° between substrate s and product p may vary considerably among different reactions  what is the significance of these differences ans the difference in free energy content between substrate or reactant and product for each reaction reflects the relative amounts of each compound present at equilibrium  the greater the difference in free energy the greater the difference in amounts of each compound at equilibrium how enzymes work page  difficulty  for a reaction that can take place with or without catalysis by an enzyme what would be the effect of the enzyme on the a standard free energy change of the reaction b activation energy of the reaction c initial velocity of the reaction d equilibrium constant of the reaction ans a no change b decrease c increase d no change how enzymes work pages − difficulty  sometimes the difference in standard freeenergy content δg’° between a substrate s and a product p is very large yet the rate of chemical conversion s → p is quite slow why ans the rate of conversion from substrate to product or the reverse reaction from product to substrate does not depend on the freeenergy difference between them  the rate of the reaction depends on the activation energy of the reaction δg’‡ which is the difference between the freeenergy content of s or p and the reaction transition state how enzymes work page  difficulty  write an equilibrium expression for the reaction s → p and briefly explain the relationship between the value of the equilibrium constant and free energy ans keq‘  ps  the value of keq‘ reflects the difference between the free energy content of s and p  free energy and equilibrium constant are related by the expression δg’°  rt ln keq‘ for each change in keq‘ by one order of magnitude δg’° changes by  kjoulemole enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  what is the difference between general acidbase catalysis and specific acidbase catalysis  assume that the solvent is water ans specific acidbase catalysis refers to catalysis by the constituents of water that is the donation of a proton by the hydronium ion ho or the acceptance of a proton by the hydroxyl ion oh–  general acidbase catalysis refers to the donation or acceptance of a proton by weak acids and bases other than water enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  michaelismenten kinetics is sometimes referred to as “saturation” kinetics  why ans according to the michaelismenten model of enzymesubstrate interaction when s becomes very high an enzyme molecule’s active site will become occupied with a new substrate molecule as soon as it releases a product  therefore at very high s v does not increase with additional substrate and the enzyme is said to be “saturated” with substrate enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  two different enzymes are able to catalyze the same reaction a → b  they both have the same vmax but differ their km the substrate a  for enzyme  the km is  mm for enzyme  the km is  mm  when enzyme  was incubated with  mm a it was observed that b was produced at a rate of  mmolesminute a what is the value of the vmax of the enzymes b what will be the rate of production of b when enzyme  is incubated with  mm a  c what will be the rate of production of b when enzyme  is incubated with  m ie  mm a ans a  mmolmin b  mmolmin c  mmolmin enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  an enzyme can catalyze a reaction with either of two substrates s or s  the km for s was found to be  mm and the km for s was found to be  mm  a student determined that the vmax was the same for the two substrates  unfortunately he lost the page of his notebook and needed to know the value of vmax  he carried out two reactions one with  mm s the other with  mm s  unfortunately he forgot to label which reaction tube contained which substrate determine the value of vmax from the results he obtained tube number rate of formation of product   ans vmax   enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  write out the equation that describes the mechanism for enzyme action used as a model by michaelis and menten  list the important assumptions used by michaelis and menten to derive a rate equation for this reaction ans the two equations are k k e  es             e  p k k one assumption is that p   so that the rate of the reaction depends exclusively on the breakdown of es and is not influenced by the reverse reaction that is k can be ignored and v  k es  this condition is possible only if early reaction times are measured the velocity therefore is an initial velocity a second assumption is that the rate of es formation equals the rate of es breakdown in other words the reaction is at a steady state  a third assumption is s  et so that total s which equals free substrate and enzymebound substrate is essentially equal to s enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  for the reaction e  s → es → p the michaelismenten constant km is actually a summary of three terms  what are they  how is km determined graphically ans km  k  k k where k and k are the rate constants for the breakdown and association respectively of the es complex and k is the rate constant for the breakdown of es to form e  p km can be determined graphically on a plot of v vs s by finding the s at which v   vmax more conveniently on a doublereciprocal plot the xaxis intercept  – km enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  an enzyme catalyzes a reaction at a velocity of  μmolmin when the concentration of substrate s is  m  the km for this substrate is  ×  m assuming that michaelismenten kinetics are followed what will the reaction velocity be when the concentration of s is a  ×  m and b  ×  m ans the velocity of  μmolmin is essentially vmax because it is measured at s  km  a when s   m  km v   vmax or  μmolmin  b when s is  m velocity can be calculated from the michaelismenten equation v  vmax s km  s   μmolmin m     μmolmin enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages   difficulty  give the michaelismenten equation and define each term in it  does this equation apply to all enzymes  if not to which kind does it not apply ans the michaelismenten equation is v  vmax s km  s in which v is the initial velocity at any given concentration of s vmax is the velocity when all enzyme molecules are saturated with s s is the concentration of s and km is a constant characteristic for the enzyme  this equation does not apply to enzymes that display sigmoidal v vs s curves but only to those giving hyperbolic kinetic plots enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  a biochemist obtains the following set of data for an enzyme that is known to follow michaelismenten kinetics substrateinitial concentrationvelocity μm μmolmin —————————————        ————————————— a  vmax for the enzyme is   explain in one sentence how you determined vmax b  km for the enzyme is   explain in one sentence how you determined km ans a vmax is about   in a plot of v vs s the asymptote is vmax  simple inspection of the data shows the approach to vmax—the rate increases by only  unit when s increases fivefold b  km is about  μm the s at which the velocity is halfmaximal  because vmax is about   vmax is about   the s at that rate is about  μm enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism page  difficulty  why is the lineweaverburk double reciprocal plot see box  p  more useful than the standard v vs s plot in determining kinetic constants for an enzyme  your answer should probably show typical plots ans the plot of v vs s is hyperbolic maximum velocity is never achieved experimentally because it is impossible to do experiments at infinitely high s  the lineweaverburk transformation of the michaelismenten equation produces a linear plot that can be extrapolated to infinite s where s becomes zero allowing a determination of vmax enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  an enzyme catalyzes the reaction a → b  the initial rate of the reaction was measured as a function of the concentration of a  the following data were obtained a micromolar v nmolesmin              what is the km of the enzyme for the substrate a what is the value of v when a   the above data were plotted as  v vs a and a straight line was obtained what is the value of the yintercept of the line what is the value of the xintercept of the line ans a  micromolar b  nmolesmin c  nmolemin d − micromolar enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  the turnover number for an enzyme is known to be  min from the following set of data calculate the km and the total amount of enzyme present in these experiments substrateinitial concentrationvelocity mmμmolmin       km    b total enzyme   μmol ans km  about  mm the concentration of s needed to achieve onehalf of vmax which is about   the total enzyme present is producing about  μmol of product per minute  because the turnover number is min the amount of enzyme present must be  μmol  μmol of enzyme would produce  μmol productmin enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism page  difficulty  when  μg of an enzyme of mr  is added to a solution containing its substrate at a concentration one hundred times the km it catalyzes the conversion of  μmol of substrate into product in  min  what is the enzyme’s turnover number ans because the velocity measured occurs far above km it represents vmax  ten μg of the enzyme represents  ×  g ×  gmol or  ×  mol of enzyme  in  minutes this amount of enzyme produced  μmol of product equivalent to  ×  mol of product per minute  the turnover number is therefore  ×  molmin ×  mol   ×  min enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism page  difficulty  fifteen μg of an enzyme of mr  working at vmax catalyzes the conversion of  μmol of substrate into product in  min  what is the enzyme’s turnover number ans the amount of enzyme present is  ×  g which is  ×  g ×  gmol   ×  mol of enzyme  the rate of product formation is  ×  mol min or  ×  mol of product per minute  the turnover number is therefore  ×  molmin ×  mol of enzyme or  ×  min enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism page  difficulty  how does the total enzyme concentration affect turnover number and vmax ans the turnover number kcat is the number of substrate molecules converted to product in a given time by a single enzyme molecule so turnover number is not affected by the total enzyme concentration et  for any given reaction however vmax can change because vmax is the product of turnover number × the total enzyme concentration or vmax  kcat et enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  enzymes with a kcat  km ratio of about  ms are considered to show optimal catalytic efficiency  fumarase which catalyzes the reversibledehydration reaction fumarate  ho            malate has a ratio of turnover number to the michaelismenten constant kcat  km of  ×  for the substrate fumarate and  ×  for the substrate malate  because the turnover number for both substrates is nearly identical what factors might be involved that explain the different ratio for the two substrates ans if the turnover number is nearly identical for both substrates then the km for malate must be much larger than for fumarate  similar turnover numbers suggest no significant differences in rate of conversion of substrate to product but the different km values could possibly be explained by a stronger binding affinity of the enzyme for fumarate than for malate or some other aspect of the reaction mechanism that affects km enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  methanol wood alcohol is highly toxic because it is converted to formaldehyde in a reaction catalyzed by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase nad  methanol → nadh  h  formaldehyde part of the medical treatment for methanol poisoning is to administer ethanol ethyl alcohol in amounts large enough to cause intoxication under normal circumstances  explain this in terms of what you know about examples of enzymatic reactions ans ethanol is a structural analog of methanol and competes with methanol for the binding site of alcohol dehydrogenase slowing the conversion of methanol to formaldehyde and allowing its clearance by the kidneys  the effect of ethanol is that of a competitive inhibitor enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  you measure the initial rate of an enzyme reaction as a function of substrate concentration in the presence and absence of an inhibitor  the following data are obtained sv −inhibitor inhibitor            a what is the vmax in the absence of inhibitor b what is the km in the absence of inhibitor c when s   what will v be in the absence of inhibitor d when s  what will v be in the presence of inhibitor e what kind of inhibitor is it likely to be ans a  b  c  d  e competitive enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism page  difficulty  define the term “suicide inhibitor” ans a suicide inhibitor is a molecule that is unreactive until it binds to the active site of an enzyme in the active site it undergoes the first chemical steps of the normal enzymatic reaction and is converted into a highly reactive species that combines irreversibly with the enzyme’s active site rendering the enzyme inactive towards substrate enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  cells can develop a resistance to drugs by increasing the cellular concentration of the enzyme that that drug inhibits if a cell increases its concentration of a given enzyme to  times the normal amount which parameters listed below will be increased tenfold km ki s vmax v when s  km kcat catalytic efficiency ans only vmax and v are linearly dependent on e enzyme kinetics as an approach to understanding mechanism pages − difficulty  an enzyme follows michaelismenten kinetics  indicate with an “x” which of the kinetic parameters at the left would be altered by the following factors  give only one answer for each ans a km b both c both d neither examples of enzymatic reactions pages  − difficulty  the enzymatic activity of lysozyme is optimal at ph  and decreases above and below this ph value  lysozyme contains two amino acid residues in the active site essential for catalysis glu and asp  the pk value for the carboxyl side chains of these two residues are  and  respectively  what is the ionization state of each residue at the ph optimum of lysozyme  how can the ionization states of these two amino acid residues explain the phactivity profile of lysozyme ans for the enzyme to be active it is likely that asp is unprotonated and glu is protonated  when the ph is below  asp becomes protonated and when it is above  glu is deprotonated either of which decreases the activity of the enzyme see fig  p  examples of enzymatic reactions page  difficulty  why does ph affect the activity of an enzyme ans the state of ionization of several amino acid side chains is affected by ph and the activity of many enzymes requires that certain of the amino acid residue side chains be in a specific ionization state see fig  p  examples of enzymatic reactions pages − difficulty  chymotrypsin belongs to a group of proteolytic enzymes called the “serine proteases” many of which have an asp his and ser residue that are crucial to the catalytic mechanism  the serine hydroxyl functions as a nucleophile  what do the other two amino acids do to support this nucleophilic reaction ans in chymotrypsin histidine functions as a general base accepting a proton from the serine hydroxyl thereby increasing serine’s reactivity as a nucleophile the negatively charged asp stabilizes the positive charge that develops on the his examples of enzymatic reactions pages − difficulty  for serine to work effectively as a nucleophile in covalent catalysis in chymotrypsin a nearby amino acid histidine must serve as general base catalyst  briefly describe in words how these two amino acids work together ans the serine is a polar hydroxyl with the oxygen functioning as an electronegative nucleophile  a nearby histidine residue with pka ≈  however functions as a base to abstract the proton from the serine hydroxyl group  the result is to substantially increase the electronegativity of the serine oxygen making it a much stronger nucleophile  this in turn lowers the activation energy of the covalent catalysis between serine and the carbonyl carbon of the substrate peptide bond see fig  pages − examples of enzymatic reactions pages − difficulty  penicillin and related antibiotics contain a membered βlactam ring  explain why this feature is important to the mechanism of action of these drugs ans the strained membered ring is easily opened δg   this energy drives the reaction that covalently inactivates the transpeptidase regulatory enzymes page  difficulty  on the enzyme hexokinase atp reacts with glucose to produce glucose phosphate and adp five orders of magnitude faster than atp reacts with ho to form phosphate and adp  the intrinsic chemical reactivity of the —oh group in water is about the same as that of the glucose molecule and water can certainly fit into the active site  explain this rate differential in two sentences or less ans the binding of glucose to hexokinase induces a conformation change that brings the amino acid residues that facilitate the phosphoryl transfer into position in the active site  binding of water alone does not induce this conformational change examples of enzymatic reactions pages − difficulty  why is a transitionstate analog not necessarily the same as a competitive inhibitor ans the structure of a competitive inhibitor may be similar to the structure of the free substrate  similar structure will mean that the competitive inhibitor can associate with the enzyme at the active site effectively blocking the normal substrate from binding  a transitionstate analog however is similar in structure to the transitionstate of the reaction catalyzed by the enzyme  often a transitionstate analog will bind tightly to an enzyme and it is not easily competed away by substrate regulatory enzymes pages − difficulty  explain how a biochemist might discover that a certain enzyme is allosterically regulated ans the enzyme would show kinetics that do not fit the michaelismenten equation the plot of v vs s would be sigmoidal not hyperbolic the enzyme kinetics would be affected by molecules other than the substrates regulatory enzymes pages − difficulty  what is a zymogen proenzyme  explain briefly with an example ans a zymogen is an inactive form of an enzyme that is activated by one or more proteolytic cleavages in its sequence chymotrypsinogen trypsinogen and proelastase are all zymogens becoming chymotrypsin trypsin and elastase respectively after proper cleavage page   chapter    enzymes page   chapter    enzymes reviews there are no reviews yet be the first to review “lehninger principles
