manuel daes thank you rodny and thanks everyone for participating on todays call i will begin with a review of our first quarter highlights chris will then discuss our operating highlights in greater detail followed by santiago who take us through our market update financial results and outlook we have had a lot of exciting developments in our business since the beginning of  including an expanded backlog a very complementary acquisition entry into several new markets and a strengthened capital position amongst other notable accomplishments collectively our actions demonstrate our ability to further enhance our leadership positions in new and existing markets as a result we ended the quarter more situated to produce another year of outpaced growth on our highly efficient lowcost operations our growth potential is reinforced by our quarter end backlog up  yearoveryear to a record  million the gmp acquisition contributed  million to the quarter one backlog the project pipeline in our legacy business expanded by  million to  million representing a  increase versus quarter four and  above the prior year quarter mainly as a result of a strong activity in our key markets we continue to feel good about our markets based on a stable volume and bidding activity we have ample financial capacity to capitalize on our project pipeline following another quarter of positive free cash flow generation this is made possible by our lean manufacturing initiatives and improving working capital metrics on our largely built out plant network we are generating cash while investing in highly selective capacity enhancements for efficiency in business such as our recently installed solar panels on our soft coat facility this represent the first phase of our multiyear investment to reduce energy consumption and lower our tax cost our gmp acquisition is off to a great start with first quarter  sales improvement reflecting our significantly strengthened and vertically integrated us presence the integration of these assets is progressing according to plan and we took an immediate step forward by establishing a gmp west branch we now have access to new opportunities in california and washington state and we expect to start growing backlog in coming quarter during the quarter we also made progress on our global growth objectives by opening a sales office in pordenone italy from there we can serve and new markets mainly europe and the middle east we have hit the floor running in the europe and middle east region with a contract already signed in lusail qatar for a significant development work approximately  million which gives us a foothold in a rapidly growing city that is preparing to host the  world cup in regards to returns yesterday we were very pleased to announce our plan to increase our dividend by  to an annualized rate of  per share beginning with our third quarter of  distribution we believe this augmented payout reinforces our commitment to our dividend policy which we continue to view as an effective means to return a portion of excess capital to shareholders the refinancing of our debt during quarter one lowered our borrowing costs and improved our capital structure we ended the quarter with a very flexible balance sheet to continue to a have value as we attribute on our growth objectives of maintaining a very attractive dividend policy overall we are encouraged by the very sturdy foundation we continue to build for tecnoglass which supports our unchanged outlook for  i will now turn the call over to chris to provide additional details on our operating highlights chris daes thank you josé manuel and good morning to everyone on the line moving to our first quarter  result summary on slide number five we have grown our business significantly since  with majority of that growth coming from the us during the first quarter we grew topline revenue by  compared to the prior year period this growth was mainly attributable to the addition of one month of gmp revenues in the us which more than offset a shift in the timing of three large commercial us projects in our backlog to subsequent quarters during the year and the late construction activity in colombia us based revenues were  of total sales compared to  in first quarter  adjusted ebitda of  million continue to represent a strong margin at  of sales driven by our low cost vertically integrated operations that being said compared to the prior year quarter ebitda and the associated margins were adversely impacted by higher fixed cost to support our unchanged  growth expectations which should drive margin expansions as we progress through the year moving to our backlog on slide number six demand for our products was strong throughout the quarter resulting in a healthy backlog at quarter end up  to a record  million compared to  million at the end of the prior year quarter these backlog growth includes a  million contribution from the gmp acquisition and an expansion of legacy backlog by  million yearoveryear for a more balanced comparison we also show fourth quarter backlog on a pro forma basis to demonstrate the significant traction for our products and services during first quarter it is important to note that we have revised our first quarter  pro forma backlog to  million versus the prior stated figure of  million which we discussed last quarter the revised figure of  million correctly excludes intercompany sales which were inadvertently included in the  million figure on our prior call with that said on a pro forma basis backlog increased by an impressive  million compared to fourth quarter  partly reflecting pentup demand in addition to our ongoing efforts to expand our geographic footprint enter the new niche markets and introduce new products we ended the quarter with good visibility on a multiyear project pipeline and are already taking steps to further diversify our geographic and end market exposure in a disciplined manner looking to our end market mix in backlog on the slide number seven our end markets are more than  commercial which include multifamily projects we continue to experience a stable phase of quoting activity singlefamily residential represent about  of backlog and represents largely untapped markets for us we are seeing good traction with our prestige and elite product lines recently introduced in the first quarter of  yeartodate we are trying to surpass our target of roughly  million of residential sales for the year we expect to ramp up this quarter to a range of  million to  million of sales in  given the strong interest in these new products as we make larger inroads into the residential market we expect this market to become a larger and more significant portion of our project backlog historically our commercial focus has allowed us to maintain relatively long lead times in backlogs with higher visibility on coming growth or contraction in outer years along these lines our bidding efforts on the residential side are mainly focused on larger regional and national builders where we get meaningful scale on order looking at our geographic breakdown on the slide number eight as represented by first quarter  backlog composition the recent addition of gmp reinforced our commitment to the florida market while significantly enhancing our vertical integrated operations and providing a future opportunity to reach new markets in the us to that point we have already begun diversifying our bidding efforts in the west coast and we expect to populate our backlog in time with a range of attractive projects additionally the europe and the middle east feature significant upside to our business which we will discuss shortly in colombia during the coming quarters we expect activity to ramp up over the year as we catch up on delayed construction activity turning to slide nine i would like to share with you more details about recent energy and tax saving initiatives currently underway in the first quarter  we began a significant green initiative to reduce our external energy consumption we completed the first stage of a multiphase project that will generate approximately  megawatts of solar panel power from over  solar panels on our flagship manufacturing facility in barranquilla colombia during the first phase which is now fully operational we installed nearly  panels or  megawatts of power on the soft coat facility we expect each phase of the multiyear investment totaling  million to generate payback period of less than three years as we reduce energy consumption needs by over  and reap significant tax savings provided by the colombian governments efforts to go green a key element for our successful track record of producing industry leading margin has been our ability to source and execute high return projects focused on innovation productivity and capacity expansion this solar initiative is directly aligned with that aim and we look forward to exploring additional opportunities to improve our business moving to our market update on slide number  before turning the call over to santiago i will provide a bit more color on some exciting new market expansions which we touched on earlier with the addition of gmp we accelerated our path to entering a target list of new markets through gmps deep and expansive customer relationship the west coast represents a very attractive opportunity with a number of metro areas that we have studied for a very long time and that are experiencing strong commercial demand with the immediate startup of gmp west operation we have already identified a number of projects that fit with our product offering we are very encouraged by the bidding environment so far particularly in san francisco and seattle where we now have projects in our backlog these two cities are sound and the logistics make sense with the panama canal providing very efficient access to most west coast markets in the europe and middle east regions we have an immense opportunity ahead of us in march we opened a sales branch in pordenone italy which marked our debut into european and the middle east regions this was made possible after years of cultivating a relationship with local partners with extensive market knowledge the european community is showing signs of recovery with rising consumer confidence and a strong pentup demand in the middle east the growth opportunity lie in the ongoing cultural shift to higher end architectural glass which feature superior and customizable performance versus locally sourced commodity products traditionally used we are very excited to sign a contract for a project in lusail qatar for  million which give us unique foothold a city being built from scratch at a total investment of  billion until  our measured approach to global expansion has worked very well for tecnoglass these new market entries are consistent with a successful track record and we look forward to scaling our indiscernible overtime i would now turn the call to santiago to give you an update on our core markets financial results and outlook santiago giraldo thank you christian and good morning to everyone on the line turning to our us market update on slide number  during the first quarter we continued to broaden our customer relationships and strengthened our presence in new markets across an increasingly diversified footprint our backlog is benefiting from our expanding reach to new markets and project types including multifamily office buildings highrises and hotels underlying us demand is strong and reinforced by a positive outlook suggested by the abi index for the sixth consecutive year especially in our key regions additionally smi data continues to suggest a mid single digit growth environment for  nonresidential spending turning to a colombian market update on slide number  underlying market dynamics are consistent with expectations at the beginning of the year with gdp growth outlook at about  for the year in colombia sales were down during the first quarter of  mainly due to delays in construction activity which we expect to create pentup activity ramping up revenues over the rest of the year overall builder sentiment remains strong and we expect economic activity in the future to rebound nicely as we move through the balance of the year however due to the first quarter impact we believe a flattish market is a fair assumption in colombia for  which implies some acceleration of activity for the remaining of the year moving to our financial highlights on slide number  during the first quarter  we operated on our cost structure built out to support our  growth objectives with revenues expected to ramp up as we move through the year gross margin was primarily impacted by a higher mix of engineering and installation revenue from gmp along with a  million in higher da expense resulting from the robust growth capex program finalized in  as well as by higher direct labor costs sga as a percentage of total revenue was  compared to  in the prior year quarter mainly attributable to higher personnel cost as well as  million associated with nonrecurring cost related to the bond issuance and bad debt writeoff we consider this cost base to be adequate to address our expected growth and expect to gain operating leverage as we advance through the year during the quarter we continued to focus on improving working capital metrics which resulted in improved cash generation from operations excluding gmp in order to normalize the effect of having one month of sales over a full receivable base we saw meaningful improvement in days sales outstanding and inventory days yearoveryear in addition to our focus on working capital management through lean initiatives our capex was significantly reduced with our capacity expansion phase virtually completed in  as a result we ended the quarter with a record cash balance along with ample liquidity and a conservative leverage profile o f times net debt to ebitda on an ltm adjusted ebit basis looking at the drivers of q revenue and adjusted ebitda on slide number  for the first quarter  total revenue increased  to  million as we discussed today our us revenues showed positive growth attributable to gmp whereas columbia revenues was pressured by temporary market factors were partially offset from favorable foreign currency benefit the us accounted for  of quarterly sales with colombia contributing  adjusted ebitda in the first quarter  decreased by  to  million the main catalyst for the decrease was a higher cost structure put in place during our seasonally lowest revenue quarter and a partial quarter impact from a higher mix of revenue from engineering design and installation services which adds greater stability and enhanced control of our manufactured product through the value chain albeit at a relatively lower margin versus products shipped to the external customers our price was essentially flat yearoveryear sga as discussed was higher to support an expected ramp in project activity later in the year interest expense during the quarter was skewed by the fact that after the bond issuance at the end of february was completed we took approximately a month to fully repay the peso denominated debt as foreign exchange rates were not favorable for monetizing the funds going forward we expect to see normalized fixed interest expenses based on current debt levels turning toward cash flow metrics on slide number  i like to highlight a few items which properly reflect our tighter management of capital in the top two charts you can see our ltm inventory days and ltm days sales outstanding are up compared to the fourth quarter of  and prior year first quarter on a reported basis but this is mainly due to the addition of gmps working capital in march with only one corresponding month of revenues on reported figures on the dash lines we present this respective working capital metrics on a pro forma basis assuming a full year of gmp revenue and separately on a legacy basis excluding gmp altogether the key take away is that our working capital metrics improved when adjusting for gmp ltm days sales outstanding on our legacy business improved by  days to  versus the fourth quarter  on a pro forma basis days sales outstanding improved on a sequential basis to  days capex is down significantly versus prior years given relatively low maintenance capex requirements on our modern stateoftheart facility and the conclusion of our growth capex base in  moving to our  outlook on slide number  for the full year  we continue to expect to produce doubledigit revenue growth based on improving commercial construction markets and market share gains this expectation is supported by our higher backlog yearoveryear in  we anticipate revenues to grow to a range of  million to  million which will be largely weighted towards the back half of the year as in prior years we continue to expect our first quarter to be the seasonally lowest revenue quarter and then to build up in each successive quarter on this revenue growth we expect adjusted ebitda to increase to a range of  million to  million based on these outlook we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations for the full year we thank you for your continued support we will be happy to answer your questions operator please open the line to questions questionandanswer session operator operator instructions our first question comes from jeremy hamblin with dougherty  company please proceed with your question jeremy hamblin good morning guys thanks for taking the questions i wanted to first explore some of the revenue trends and you saw a pretty massive acceleration  growth in the united states in terms of thinking about that and looking at your backlog moving forward is that is probably a good benchmark to use for what you are thinking on us growth for most of this year we looking at  just in your us business and in conjunction with that should we be thinking that going forward roughly twothirds or more of your business is going to happen in the us operator jeremy jeremy hamblin yes operator can you hear josé jeremy hamblin i cannot operator give me just one second josé manuel daes it seems like we have a telephone problem sorry jeremy how are you good to hear from you jeremy hamblin i am well thank you josé manuel josé manuel daes listen jeremy we expect the business in the us to keep growing as we are proliferating new markets as i have been telling you now we have work in new york and boston we have work in the west coast in california and also in washington state so we expect business in the us to keep growing and thats a fair assumption jeremy hamblin so in terms of the total portion of business though are we looking at maybe  to  going forward josé manuel daes yes  yes jeremy hamblin okay josé manuel daes  to  on every quarter and even though we are closing a lot of businesses also in colombia but when you take the whole picture it will keep the same proportion jeremy hamblin okay and then in terms of thinking about just the next quarter obviously your guidance implies some pretty significant revenue acceleration how does the flow of revenues santiago look for the year i mean are we looking at  million to  million in q and then accelerating further from there or can you give me anymore color on how q trends are tracking santiago giraldo yes actually jeremy its going to be backloaded into the second half so we are expecting for the second quarter is closer to the  million figure and then ramping up over the last two quarters and thats partially related to the backlog shift that we discussed earlier so we think that sequentially q is going to be stronger and then q and q are going to be the strongest to get to the guidance that we provided jeremy hamblin okay so we are looking at  is the breakdown for q and q relatively equal santiago giraldo yes jeremy hamblin or is it slanted a little more towards  okay josé manuel daes so it is going to be q and q are going to very strong because as i have been telling you three to five large jobs in the us got delayed and instead of starting in december january they are starting in june july and they will end up in june july next year so the second the third and fourth quarter are going to be our strongest this year they are usually the strongest but the four is a little less than the third but this year i believe we are going to be along the same or maybe even more the fourth quarter jeremy hamblin okay and so can i assume that you are going to do at least  million then in q and q josé manuel daes of course we hope so we need to do it jeremy hamblin all right okay josé manuel daes and we need to be on time on the job so if we dont deliver those amounts then we are going to be late and we are never late jeremy hamblin okay and the delays now i also saw though that your international businesses or your business in colombia and panama was down in the first quarter you mentioned some delays in the us projects what are you seeing in those local markets in colombia and panama as well josé manuel daes somehow everything turned out to be the same way in panama we got a slump like for three four months we didnt close any business and now we are closing a lot of business but when you close a business you have to do the shop drawings you have to talk to the architect many many many things that are open items and then to deliver in three to six months you start delivering the job so what happened in the us happened also in panama and in colombia but by the same token we see a lot of quoting going around we are closing a lot of business our backlog is coming up and at the end of the day that means that we are going to deliver one day or another so the third and fourth quarter are going to be strong and we look for  to ramp up a lot too jeremy hamblin okay great and then in the last call i think you mentioned that there was a little softness in the highend luxury market in florida wanted to just see if you could make a comment on whether or not you have seen some improvement in that end market we are hearing that there has been some improvements in that market overall which i think is encouraging for your business but can you comment on that josé manuel daes yes that is true and that is the reason why a few of the jobs got delayed for example flat iron which is around  million business got delayed now in the third or fourth quarter we are going to be delivering around a month or two we start delivering the first windows is our goal it is on a land which is a landmark because its a job designed by a famous architect on the beach already got the approvals already got the financing and by the end of the year we are going to start delivering and like that i can imagine like five or six buildings in miami bought let me tell you this to my surprise there are  new buildings going up but for residential but rental and this rental buildings for example panorama is an  floor building and is the highest the tallest building south of new york and is already up all the way and is all for rentals and the same person the same owner is going to do two more buildings and we are already talking to them and both are around  to  floors jeremy hamblin well thats great to hear i wanted to then shift gears to the new markets that you mentioned which sounds very exciting and thinking about europe and the middle east and obviously lots of construction activity and pickup in those markets you mentioned that you have staffed a sales branch out of italy how should i be thinking about the margins for that business given that its a little bit further away for you to deliver i am assuming that the product that provided to those regions is also coming out of barranquilla are the margins going to be the same are they going to be a little bit lower little a little bit better can you speak to the margin profile of that business that you are winning in europe and the middle east josé manuel daes okay well lets talk about the middle east the one that we already closed that business has the same margin as every other business believe it or not from barranquilla to doha which is the port in qatar we are paying only  more per container than to miami and so it is a minimal amount compared to the cost of the goods in the container so the margins are going good the margins are the same at the beginning for example in europe the first or the second building are going to be a little lower margin in order to get in because a newcomer is not easy to get a business unless you show them a reason why but after that the margins in europe are much better because they have triple panes double insulated and then they have this really welldesigned country walls and that cost a lot of money and since our labor is very cheap it makes our margins improve jeremy hamblin okay great and then in terms of the you mentioned the residential business i recognize thats still a relatively small piece of your sales but it sounds like that has seen some traction can you just speak to the end markets on your residential side in florida how attractive they look the type of growth that you are expecting this year and next josé manuel daes yes well the products have been so well received that we are seeing every month an increase in orders of around  to  even though it is very little we were expected to sell around  million this year i believe its going to at least  to  more than that and for next year if things keep coming like this we expect to do around  million to  million in that line our product we believe is much better than the competition the only thing is that we dont have a track record and people tend to prefer the track record business because they know they deliver and delivery is important in this business but we are penetrating and that line in two three years is going to be at least  to  of our business jeremy hamblin right shifting gears a bit santiago and christian if you could talk a little bit more detail about the solar project the  million investment you mentioned that the natural gas savings could be  or more what does that amount to on a cash savings basis and then what would the cost tax savings be over time on an annualized basis santiago giraldo yes jeremy so this is basically the  that you are mentioning of the overall annual cost ends up being about  million for the first year so thats basically based on the first phase which we have now completed the idea would be to complete subsequent phases so for  what we are estimating is between  and  but after a couple of years that amount could be substantially higher and the first phase has performed well so the intention is to move forward with the second phase which we are expecting to start next month and complete within the next three months so its a substantial saving amount on our sga jeremy hamblin so it could be over  million longterm on annualized savings it sounds like santiago giraldo overtime jeremy hamblin yes santiago giraldo right now we just completed three megawatts of our project that is  megawatts so right now its just a portion of what the overall project could end up being jeremy hamblin and then the savings on the tax side santiago giraldo yes basically you get to write off  of your investment price and that tax savings we are going to realize in  so for your model you wouldnt assume any tax savings for  but that will be done for next great jeremy hamblin great and then the gmp acquisition i wanted to see after you a couple of months here of absorbing the deal what types of synergies on the revenue front and what types of savings are you seeing from that deal santiago giraldo so far we are still integrating the operation jeremy we think we can save some sga basically by integrating both operations but the business are different in the sense that what they do provide is installation engineering and designing which is not something that we have on our end as far as tecnoglass goes so the main synergy are going to come just from the administrative side and the selling side more than the operation itself right now for the first month we are incorporating these savings into the results that you saw hopefully as we move through the year thats going to be ram ping up jeremy hamblin okay and then just one more and i will hop out of the queue and let others ask questions in terms of capex your capex is down meaningfully what is the capex guidance for the year and whats you depreciation and amortization guidance for the soap santiago giraldo so basically we had estimated maximum of  million for the year so if you see our results for the first quarter we are definitely in line with those projections we ended up with about  million which is mainly associated with the solar panel project completion and very little maintenance capex as you know our equipment is less than five years old so our maintenance capex is very limited given the fact that we are going to move forward with the second phase of the solar panel project i think its a fair assumption to assume maximum capex of  million for the year jeremy hamblin and depreciation and amortization santiago giraldo about  million a quarter so i will tell you about  million for the year jeremy hamblin okay great thanks guys and good luck this year josé manuel daes thanks jeremy operator our next question comes from alex rygiel with fbr capital markets please proceed with your question alex rygiel good morning gentlemen nice quarter josé manuel daes good morning alex how are you alex rygiel very good josé manuel could you expand a little bit upon how we should think about the timing of revenue from your new office in italy as it relates to demand coming out of europe and the middle east what should we be looking for in  is there a target that maybe we can look for in  and then i have a followup josé manuel daes well let me tell you  in europe is going to be nonexistent because within the time that you quote you know all the engineering and the final design assist you are going to be delivering at least in march to june of  so we dont expect any business for this year we expect around  million to  million for next year in europe and then on its going to go higher and higher so we show that we can perform and that we can do the buildings people will get more confident and we will get a lot more business now in the middle east we already have a business and we expect this year to deliver  million and next year we hope to get at least another  million or  million from the middle east but that is uncertain until you have the business you cannot but we expect around  million to  million a year from the middle east in the next two to three years every year alex rygiel thats great could you also address raw material cost inflation if you are seeing any and any thoughts of that developing over the next  months chris daes this is christian we actually dont see any  the only price going up is aluminum and we have already signed a deal for aluminum for all of  we bought ahead of time around  tons of aluminum which is what we consume every  hundred tons per month that is what we take every month and so the price is fixed and we are not taking an increase in the price obviously we are closing now having into account the new price of aluminum which is around  and in regards to glass and all other materials we have stability for at least the next  months there is no problem we are right on track and we expect to with the ramp up of sales invoicing now in second quarter third quarter and fourth quarter to start seeing all the benefits of this alex rygiel and lastly as it relates to the three to five projects that experienced some delays was there anything common with regards to those delays was it weatherrelated permit related or financing related josé manuel daes well there were a few reasons why they were delayed and each one is different for example the one in brickell which is flatiron they had some design changes because of the market change so they delayed a little bit that job its already going up then the one in paramount which is a huge tower in downtown miami they were having problems with the financing or not problems delayed financing and finally they got it and they are they are going up also we are released to deliver the windows you can see the building going up  which is designed by renzo piano the italian architect until they reach  of sales the bank wouldnt give them the financing because of the tight conditions now implied by the banks in miami and now they reach their target so the bank gave the financing many things but the buildings are going up and we got the jobs that we already working on the windows to be delivered between june and july and on alex rygiel thats great thank you very much nice quarter santiago giraldo thanks alex operator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of a questionandanswer session i would like to turn the call back to josé manuel for closing comments josé manuel daes well thank you everyone for being on the call we are very enthusiastic to reach this years targets as we said before in the last call this quarter was going to be the slowest one the second quarter is going to be better and the third the fourth are going to be record quarters for the company and we believe that  is going to be a record year too we have many things going that we cannot share right now but sooner than later we will keep it up thank you for being on the call and thank you for investing with us operator this concludes todays conference you may disconnect your lines at this time

laminated glass monolithic glass low e glass projects argentina aruba colombia costa rica panama puerto rico dominican republic usa quality resources   close tecnoglass takes another step in glass production  august main categoryadmin its new plant a   million investment begins operations this week tecnoglass expects its new soft coat glass factory which starts production this week will help open markets to which access has failed providing growth in their sales in  the company from barranquilla could reach sales in excess of  billion pesos and the goal is to sell  billion pesos in  the plant represents an investment of   million and is located in the industrial citadel that tecnoglass has built in barranquilla it occupies an area of  square meters and is kept as sterile as an operating room at the center of the whole process is a german machine known as the  bonarden in honor of its from the outside it resembles a huge metal box  meters long filled with buttons and  portholes where you can see the hightech chemical processes that take place inside within the machine there exist a series of conditions like vacuum chambers and reduced gravity created by the gas emission so that metals such as silver zinc and titanium may adhere to the glass “the technology is similar to what used to separate electrons from uranium in the production of atomic fuel but what we do is separate electrons from silver to help adhere them to the glass”explains tecnoglass vice president carlos amin daes as the process begins the glass is quite normal but at the end it becomes a material with which windows that are capable of maintaining the temperature while letting through visible light are made in other words in hot climates they block the heat from the sun saving on air conditioning expenses and in colder climates the windows trap the heat thus lowering heat expenses these procedures are computer controlled in their entirety the temperature in the compartment where the machine is housed is as cold as a refrigerator a strong contrast to the heat normally felt in barranquilla amin recalls that by the s and s in the united states and other developed countries the heat in buildings was controlled putting reflective layers on glass which is why you see all the huge buildings in new york and chicago that look like giant mirrors the disadvantage to this solution is that most of the light was reflected along with the heat and a lot of artificial lighting is required along with higher energy bill instead the ‘soft coat’ is transparent and allows moderate light reflection to varying degrees from º to º and gives bluish greenish or a tanned color to the surface of the glass six physicists worked on the development of tecnoglass’ plant which shows the high level of thought going into the project in fact according to amin in america there are only two similar factories in ee uu and brazil “as they say we are taking a step further because neither mexico nor chile or argentina have anything similar” he adds guaranteed market today tecnoglass today requires a million square meters of lowemission glass about a third of its sales that are purchased from a us supplier the plant that was opened has an  million square meter capacity which gives the business group a possibility for  large growth according to tecnoglass president christian daes new markets in europe asia usa and canada where the use of soft coat glass in buildings is mandatory are now within reach as well as mexico which is already beginning to introduce similar legislation there is also hope that this initiative will spread to latin america and colombia “for example in the past i could not sell glass in texas or canada but now i have an advantage because my soft coat competitors there do not  insulate or produce laminates like we can with the new factory i assure you that we will conquer the market and we will show growth in that sector and many others” notes christian daes the company will also produce curved glass the president of the tecnoglass conglomerate which is made ​​up of diferent firms  tecnoglass dedicated to glass eswindows windows and alutions aluminum profiles christian daes said that contacts have already been made in europe to sell their ‘soft coat’ products and has even got an order for three million canadian dollars that would not have been possible without the plant they opened in barranquilla in asia daes expects to sell glass sheets for others to process “we have not yet gone to offer although we have connections because we don’t like to sell what we don’t have” notes the businessman who claims that their product exceeds quality standards of products that come from the united states additionally the firm will produce curved glass that they now make by hand and of lower quality a type quite sought after by architects and is only provided by two or three factories in the world from portafolio edited transcript of

coating and building activity we have ample financial capacity to capitalize on our project pipeline following another quarter of positive free cash flow generation this is made possible by our lean manufacturing initiatives and improving working capital metrics on our largely builtout plant network we are generating cash while investing in highly selective capacity enhancements or efficiency initiatives such as our recently installed solar panels on our soft coat facility this represents the first phase of a multiyear investment to reduce energy consumption and lower our tax costour gmp acquisition is off to a great start with first quarter  sales improvement reflecting our significantly strengthened and verticallyintegrated us presence the integration of these assets is progressing according to plan and we took an immediate step forward by establishing a gmp west branch we now have access to new opportunities in california and washington state and we expect to start growing backlog in coming quartersduring the quarter we also made progress on our global growth objectives by opening a sales office in pordenone italy from there we can serve and expand new markets mainly europe and the middle east we have hit the floor running in the europe and middle east region with a contract already signed in lusail qatar for a significant development worth approximately usd  million which give us a foothold in the rapidlygrowing city that is preparing to host the  world cupin regards to returns yesterday we were very pleased to announce our plan to increase our dividend by  to an annualized rate of  per share beginning with our third quarter  distribution we believe this augmented payout reinforces our commitment to our dividend policy which we continue to view as an effective means to return a portion of excess capital to shareholders the refinancing of our debt in quarter  lowered our borrowing costs and improved our capital structure we ended the quarter with a very flexible balance sheet to continue to enhance value as we execute on our growth objectives and maintain a very attractive dividend policy overall we are encouraged by the very sturdy foundation we continue to build for tecnoglass which supports our unchanged outlook for i will now turn the call over to chris to provide additional details on our operating highlightschristian t daes tecnoglass inc  coo and director thank you jose manuel and good morning to everyone on the linemoving to our first quarter  results summary on slide we have grown our business significantly since  with the majority of that growth coming from the us during the first quarter we grew top line revenue by  compared to the prior year period this growth was mainly attributable to the addition of  month of gmp revenues in the us which more than offset a shift in the timing of  large commercial us projects in our backlog to subsequent quarters during the year and delayed construction activity in colombia usbased revenues were  of total sales compared to  in first quarter  adjusted ebitda of  million continue to represent a strong margin at  of sales driven by our lowcost verticallyintegrated operations that being said compared to the prior year quarter ebitda and the associated margins were adversely impacted by higher fixed cost to support our unchanged  growth expectation which should drive margin expansions as we progress through the yearmoving to our backlog on slide  demand for our products was strong throughout the quarter resulting in a healthy backlog at quarter end up  to a record  million compared to  million at the end of the prior year quarter this backlog growth includes a  million contribution from the gmp acquisition and an expansion of legacy backlog by  million yearoveryear for a more balanced comparison we also show fourth quarter backlog on a pro forma basis to demonstrate the significant traction for our products and services during first quarterit is important to note that we have revised our fourth quarter  pro forma backlog to  million versus the prior stated figure of  million which we discussed last quarter the revised figure of  million correctly excludes intercompany sales which were inadvertently included in the  million figure on our prior quarter with that said on a pro forma basis backlog increased by an impressive  million compared to fourth quarter  partly reflecting pentup demand in addition to our ongoing effort to expand our geographic footprint enter the new niche market and introduce new products we ended the quarter with a good visibility on a multiyear project pipeline and are already taking steps to further diversify our geographic and end market exposure in a disciplined mannerlooking to our end market mix in backlog on slide  our end markets are more than  commercial which includes multifamily projects we continue to experience a stable pace of coating activity single family residential represents about  of backlog and represents largely a untapped market for us we are seeing good traction with our prestige and elite product lines recently introduced in the fourth quarter of  yeartodate we are planning to surpass our target of roughly  million of residential sales for the year we expect to ramp up this quarter to a range of  million to  million of sales in  given the strong interest in these new products as we make larger inroads into the residential market we expect this market to become a larger and more significant portion of our project backlog historically our commercial focus has allowed us to maintain relatively long lead times in backlogs with higher visibility on coming growth and contraction in out years along this line our business efforts on the residential side are mainly focused on larger regional and national business where we can meaningfully scale on orderslooking at our geographic breakdown on slide  as represented by first quarter  backlog composition the recent addition of gmp reinforce our commitment to the florida market while significantly enhancing our verticallyintegrated operation and providing future opportunities to reach new markets in the us to that point we have already begun diversifying our business efforts in the west coast and we expect to populate our backlog in time with a range of attractive projects additionally the europe and the middle east feature significant upside to our business which we will discuss shortlyin colombia during the coming quarters we expect activity to ramp up over the year as we catch up on delayed construction activityturning to slide  i would like to share with you more details on our recent energy and taxsaving initiatives currently underway in the first quarter  we began a significant green initiative to reduce our external energy consumption we completed the first stage of a multiphase project that will generate approximately  megawatts of solar panel power from over  solar panels at our flagship manufacturing facility in barranquilla colombia during the first phase which is now fully operational we installed nearly  panels or  megawatts of power on the soft coat facility we expect each phase of the multiyear investment totaling  million to generate payback periods of less than  years as we reduce energy consumption needs by over  and reap significant tax savings provided by the colombian governments efforts to go green a key element for our successful track record of producing industryleading margin has been our ability to source and execute highreturn projects focused on innovation productivity and capacity expansion this solar initiative is directly aligned with that aim and we look forward exploring additional opportunities to improve our businessmoving to our market update on slide  before turning the call over to santiago i will provide a bit more color on some exciting new market expansions which we touched on earlier with the addition of gmp we accelerated our path to entering a target list of new markets through gmps deep and expansive customer relationships the west coast represents a very attractive opportunity with a number of metro areas that we have been installing for a very long time and that are experiencing a strong commercial demand with the immediate startup of our gmp west operation we have already identified a number of projects that fit with our product offering we are very encouraged by the business environment so far particularly in san francisco and seattle where we now have projects in our backlogs these  cities are sound and the logistics makes sense with the panama canal providing very efficient access to most west coast marketsin the europe and middle east region we have an immense opportunity ahead of us in march we opened a sales branch in pordenone italy which mark our debut in our  into european and the middle east region this was made possible after years of cultivating relationships with local partners with extensive market knowledge the european community is showing signs of recovery with rising consumer confidence and a strong pentup demand in the middle east the growth opportunity lie in the ongoing cultural shift to higherend architectural glass which feature superior and customizable performance versus locallysourced commodity products traditionally used we were very excited to sign a contract for a project in lusail qatar for  million which give us a unique foothold on a city being built from scratch at a total investment of  billion to  our measured approach to a global expansion has worked very well for tecnoglass these new market entries are consistent with our successful track record and we look forward to scaling our nation over timei will now turn the call to santiago to give you an update on our core markets financial results and outlooksantiago giraldo tecnoglass inc  head of ir and deputy cfo thank you christian and good morning to everyone on the lineturning to our us market update on slide  during the first quarter we continued to broaden our customer relationships and strengthen our presence in new markets across an increasingly diversified footprint our backlog is benefiting from our expanding reach to new markets and project types including multifamily office buildings high rises and hotels underlying us demand is strong and reinforced by a positive outlook suggested by the abi index for the sixth consecutive year especially in our key regions additionally fmi data continues to suggest a midsingledigit growth environment for  nonresidential spendingturning to our colombian market update on slide  underlying market dynamics are consistent with expectations at the beginning of the year with gdp growth outlook at about  for the year in colombia sales were down during the first quarter of  mainly due to delays in construction activity which we expect to create pentup activity ramping up revenues over the rest of the year overall builder sentiment remains strong and we expect economic activity in the future to rebound nicely as we move through the balance of the year however due to the first quarter impact we believe a flattish market is a fair assumption in colombia for  which implies some acceleration of activity for the remainder of the yearmoving to our financial highlights on slide  during the first quarter  we operated on a cost structure built out to support our  growth objectives with revenues expected to ramp up as we move through the year gross margins was primarily impacted by a higher mix of engineering and installation revenue from gmp along with a  million in higher da expense resulting from the robust growth capex program finalized in  as well as by higher direct labor cost sga as a percentage of total revenue was  compared to  in the prior year quarter mainly attributable to higher personnel costs as well as  million associated with nonrecurring costs related to the bond issuance and bad debt writeoff we consider this cost base to be adequate to address our expected growth and expect to gain operating leverage as we advance through the yearduring the quarter we continued to focus on improving working capital metrics which resulted in improved cash generation from operations excluding gmp in order to normalize the effect of having  month of sales over a full receivable base we saw meaningful improvement in days sales outstanding and inventory days yearoveryear in addition to our focus on working capital management through lean initiatives our capex was significantly reduced with our capacity expansion phase virtually completed in  as a result we ended the quarter with a record cash balance along with ample liquidity and a conservative leverage profile of x net debt to ebitda on an ltm adjusted ebitda basislooking at the drivers of q revenue and adjusted ebitda on slide  for the first quarter  total revenue increased  to  million as we discussed today our us revenue showed positive growth attributable to gmp whereas colombian revenues was pressured by temporary market factors with a partial offset from favorable foreign currency benefit the us accounted for  of quarterly sales with colombia contributing  adjusted ebitda in the first quarter  decreased by  to  million the main catalyst for the decrease was a higher cost structure put in place during our seasonally lowest revenue quarter and a partial quarter impact from a higher mix of revenue from engineering design and installation services which adds greater stability and enhanced control of our manufactured product through the value chain albeit at a relatively lower margin versus products shipped to external customersour price was essentially flat yearoveryear sga as discussed was higher to support an expected ramping project activity later in the yearinterest expense during the quarter was skewed by the fact that after the bond issuance at the end of february was completed we took approximately a month to fully repay the pesodenominated debt as foreign exchange rates were not favorable for monetizing the funds going forward we expect to see normalized fixed interest expenses based on current debt levelsturning to our cash flow metrics on slide  id like to highlight a few items which appropriately reflect our tighter management of capital in the top  charts you can see our ltm inventory days and ltm days sales outstanding are up compared to the fourth quarter  and prior year first quarter on a reported basis but this is mainly due to the addition of gmps working capital in march with only  corresponding month of revenues on reported figures on the dashed lines we present this respective working capital metrics on a pro forma basis assuming a full year of gmp revenue and separately on a legacy basis excluding gmp altogether the key takeaway is that our working capital metrics improved when adjusting for gmpltm days sales outstanding on our legacy business improved by  days to  versus the fourth quarter of  on a pro forma basis days sales outstanding improved on a sequential basis to  days capex is down significantly versus prior years given relatively low maintenance capex requirements on our modern stateoftheart facility and the conclusion of our growth capex phase in moving to our  outlook on slide  for the full year  we continue to expect to produce doubledigit revenue growth based on improving commercial construction markets and market share gains this expectation is supported by our higher backlog yearoveryear in  we anticipate revenues to grow to a range of  million to  million which will be largely weighted toward the back half of the year as in prior years we continue to expect our first quarter to be the seasonally lowest revenue quarter and then to build up in each successive quarter on this revenue growth we expect adjusted ebitda to increase to a range of  million to  million based on this outlook we expect to generate positive cash flow from operations for the full yearwe thank you for your continuous support well be happy to answer your questions operator please open the line to questionsquestions and answersoperator operator instructions our first question comes from jeremy hamblin with dougherty  companyjeremy hamblin dougherty  company llc research division  vp and senior research analyst i wanted to first explore some of the revenue trends and you saw a pretty massive acceleration  growth in the united states in terms of thinking about that and looking at your backlog moving forward is that probably a good benchmark to use for what youre thinking on us growth for most of this year are we looking at kind of  just in your us business in conjunction with that should we be thinking that going forward roughly  or more of your business is going to happen in the usjosé manuel daes tecnoglass inc  ceo and director inaudiblerodny nacier icr llc  svp jeremyjeremy hamblin dougherty  company llc research division  vp and senior research analyst yesrodny nacier icr llc  svp can you hear joséjeremy hamblin dougherty  company llc research division  vp and senior research analyst i cannotrodny nacier icr llc  svp give me just one secondjosé manuel daes tecnoglass inc  ceo and director it seems like we have a telephone problem sorrylisten jeremy we expect the business in the us to keep growing as we are penetrating new markets as ive been telling you now we have work in new york in boston we have work in the west coast in california and also in washington state so we expect business in the us to keep growing thats a fair assumptionjeremy hamblin dougherty  company llc research division  vp and senior research analyst so in terms of the total portion of business though are we looking at maybe  to  going forwardjosé manuel daes tecnoglass inc  ceo and director yes    to  on every quarter and even though we are closing a lot of businesses also in colombia but when you take the whole picture it will keep the same proportionjeremy hamblin dougherty  company llc research division  vp and senior research analyst okay and then in terms of thinking about just the next quarter obviously your guidance implies some pretty significant revenue acceleration how does the flow of revenues santiago look for the year i mean are we looking at kind of  million to  million in q and then accelerating further from there or can you give me any more color on how q trends are trackingsantiago giraldo tecnoglass inc  head of ir and deputy cfo yes actually jeremy its going to be backloaded into the second half so what were expecting for the second quarter is closer to the  million figure and then ramping up over the last  quarters and thats partially related to the backlog shift that we discussed earlier so we think that sequentially q is going to be stronger and then q and q are going to be the strongest to get to the guidance that we providedjeremy hamblin dougherty  company llc research division  vp and senior research analyst okay so were looking at  is the breakdown for q and q relatively equalsantiago giraldo tecnoglass inc  head of ir and deputy cfo yesjeremy hamblin dougherty  company llc research division  vp and senior research analyst or is it slanted a little more towards  okayjosé manuel daes tecnoglass inc  ceo and director so its going to be  q and q are going to be very strong because as ive been telling you  to  large jobs in the us got delayed and instead of starting in december january they are starting in june july and they will end up in june july next year so the second  the third and fourth quarter are going to be our strongest this year they are usually the strongest but the fourth a little less than the third but this year i believe theyre going to be around the same or maybe even more the fourth quarterjeremy hamblin dougherty  company llc research division  vp and senior research analyst okay and so can i assume that youre going to do at least  million then in q and qjosé manuel daes tecnoglass inc  ceo and director of course we hope so i mean we need to do itwe need to be on time on the job so if we dont deliver those amounts then were going to be late and were never latejeremy hamblin dougherty  company llc research division  vp and senior research analyst okay and in the delays  now i also saw though that your international businesses or your business in colombia and panama was down in the first quarter you mentioned some delays in the us projects what are you seeing in those local markets in colombia and panama as welljosé manuel daes tecnoglass inc  ceo and director somehow everything turned out to be the same way in panama we got a slump like for   months we didnt close any business and now were closing a lot of business but when you close a business you have to do the shop drawings you have to talk to the architect about many many many things that are open items and then you deliver in  to  months you start delivering the job so what happened in the us happened also in panama and in colombia but by the same token i mean we see a lot of quoting going around were closing a lot of business our backlog is coming up and at the end of the day that means that were going to deliver one day or another so the third and fourth quarter are going to be strong and we look for  to ramp up a lot toojeremy hamblin dougherty  company llc research division  vp and senior research analyst okay great and then the last call i think you mentioned that there was a little softness in the highend luxury market in florida i wanted to just see if you could make a comment on whether or not youve seen some improvement in that end market were hearing that there has been some improvements in that market overall which i think is encouraging for your business but can you comment on thatjosé manuel daes tecnoglass inc  ceo and director yes that is true and that is the reason why a few of the jobs got delayed for example flatiron which is around a  million business got delayed now its in the third or fourth floor were going to be delivering around a month or  well start delivering the first window is a go  which is a landmark because its a job designed by a famous architect on the beach already got approvals already got the financing and by the end of the year were going to start delivering and like that i can mention like  or  buildings in miami but let me tell you this to my surprise there are like  new buildings going up but for  yes residential but rentals and these rental buildings for example panorama is an floor building and is the highest the tallest building south of new york and is already up all the way and its all for rental and the same person the same owner is going to do  more buildings and were already talking to them and both are around  to  floorsjeremy hamblin dougherty  company llc research division  vp and senior research analyst well thats great to hear i wanted to then shift gears to the new markets that you mentioned which sounds very exciting in thinking about europe and the middle east and obviously lots of construction activity and pickup in those markets you mentioned that youve staffed a sales branch out of italy how should i be thinking about the margins for that business given that its a little bit further away for you to deliver im assuming that the product thats provided to those regions is also coming out of barranquilla are the margins going to be the same are they going to be a little bit lower a little bit better can you speak to the margin profile of that business that youre winning in europe and the middle eastjosé manuel daes tecnoglass inc  ceo and director well lets talk about the middle east the one that we already closed that business has the same margin as every other business believe it or not from barranquilla to doha which is the port in qatar we are paying only  more per container than to miami and so its a minimal amount compared to the cost of the goods in the container so the margins are good the margins are the same at the beginning for example in europe the first  or the second building are going to be a little lower margin in order to get in because a newcomer its not easy to get a business unless you show them a reason why but after that the margins in europe are much better because they have triple panes double insulated and then they have these really welldesigned coated walls and that cost a lot of money and since our labor is very cheap that makes our margins improvejeremy hamblin dougherty  company llc research division  vp and senior research analyst okay great and then in terms of the  you mentioned the residential business i recognize thats still a relatively small piece of your sales but it sounds like that is seeing some traction can you just speak to the end markets on your residential side in florida how attractive they look the type of growth that youre expecting this year and nextjosé manuel daes tecnoglass inc  ceo and director yes well the products have been so well received that we are seeing every month an increase in orders of around  to  even though its very little we were expected to sell around  million this year i believe its going to be at least  to  more than that and for next year if things keep coming like this we expect to do around  million to  million in that line our product we  i mean we believe is much better than the competition the only thing is that we dont have a track record and people tend to prefer the track record business because they know they deliver and delivery is important in this business but we are penetrating and we believe that line in   years is going to be at least  to  of our businessjeremy hamblin dougherty  company llc research division  vp and senior research analyst great shifting gears a bit santiago and christian if you could talk a little bit more detail about the solar project this  million investment you mentioned that the natural gas savings could be  or more what does that amount to on a cash savings basis and then what would the cash tax savings be over time on an annualized basissantiago giraldo tecnoglass inc  head of ir and deputy cfo yes jeremy so this is basically  the  that youre mentioning of the overall annual cost ends up being about  million for the first year so thats basically based on the first phase which we have now completed the idea would be to complete subsequent phases so for  what were estimating is between  and  but after a couple of years that amount could be substantially higher and the first phase has performed well so the intention is to move forward with the second phase which were expecting to start next month and complete within the next  months so its a substantial savings amount on our sgajeremy hamblin dougherty  company llc research division  vp and senior research analyst so it could be over  million longterm on annualized savings it sounds likesantiago giraldo tecnoglass inc  head of ir and deputy cfo over time over time right now we just completed  megawatts out of our project that is  megawatts so right now its just a portion of what the overall project could end up beingjeremy hamblin dougherty  company llc research division  vp and senior research analyst and then the savings on the tax sidesantiago giraldo tecnoglass inc  head of ir and deputy cfo yes basically you get to write off  of your investment price in that tax savings were going to realize in  so for your model you wouldnt assume any tax savings for  but that will be done for next yearjeremy hamblin dougherty  company llc research division  vp and senior research analyst great and then the gmp acquisition i wanted to see after a couple of months here of absorbing the deal what types of synergies on the revenue front and what types of savings are you seeing from that dealsantiago giraldo tecnoglass inc  head of ir and deputy cfo so far were still integrating the operation jeremy we think we can save some sga basically by integrating both operations but the business are different in the sense that what they do provide is installation engineering and designing which is not something that we have on our end as far as tecnoglass goes so the main synergies are going to come just from the administrative side and the selling side more than the operation itself right now for the first month we didnt incorporate any savings into the results that you saw hopefully as we move through the year thats going to be kind of ramping upjeremy hamblin dougherty  company llc research division  vp and senior research analyst okay and then just one more and ill hop out of the queue and let others ask questions in terms of capex your capex is down meaningfully what is the capex guidance for the year and whats your depreciation and amortization guidance for the yearsantiago giraldo tecnoglass inc  head of ir and deputy cfo so basically we had estimated a maximum of  million for the year so if you see our results for the first quarter were definitely in line with those projections we ended up with about  million which is mainly associated with the solar panel project completion and very little maintenance capex as you know our equipment is less than  years old so our maintenance capex is very limited given the fact that were going to move forward with the second phase of the solar plant  panel project i think its still a fair assumption to assume a maximum capex of  million for the yearjeremy hamblin dougherty  company llc research division  vp and senior research analyst and depreciation and amortizationsantiago giraldo tecnoglass inc  head of ir and deputy cfo about  million a quarter for  so i will tell you about  million for the yearoperator our next question comes from alex rygiel with fbr capital marketsalexander john rygiel fbr capital markets  co research division  cohead of diversified industrials in equity research josé manuel could you expand a little bit upon sort of how we should think about the timing of revenue from your new office in italy as it relates to demand coming out of europe and the middle east what should we be looking for in  is there a target that maybe we can look for in  and then i have a followupjosé manuel daes tecnoglass inc  ceo and director well let me tell you  in europe is going to be nonexistent because when you  within the time that you quote you do all the engineering and the final design assist youre going to be delivering at least in march to june of  so we dont expect any business for this year we expect around  million to  million for next year in europe and then on its going to go higher and higher as we show that we can perform and that we can do the buildings i mean people will get more confident and well get a lot more business now in the middle east we already have a business and we expect this year to deliver the  million and next year we hope to get at least another  million or  million from the middle east but that is uncertain i mean until you have the business you cannot but we expect around  million to  million a year from the middle east in the next  to  years every yearalexander john rygiel fbr capital markets  co research division  cohead of diversified industrials in equity research thats great could you also address raw material cost inflation if youre seeing any and any thoughts or  of that developing over the next  monthschristian t daes tecnoglass inc  coo and director this is christian we actually dont see any  i mean the only price going up is aluminum and we have already signed a deal for aluminum for all of  we bought ahead of time around  tons of aluminum which is what we consume every   tons per month that is what we take every month so the price is fixed and we dont  were not taking an increase in the price obviously were quoting now having into account the new price of aluminum which is around  and with regards to glass and other materials we have stability for at least the next  months so there is no problem were right on track and we expect to  with the rampup sales invoicing now in second quarter third quarter and fourth quarter to start seeing all the benefits of thisalexander john rygiel fbr capital markets  co research division  cohead of diversified industrials in equity research and then lastly as it relates to the  to  projects that experienced some delays was there anything common with regards to those delays was it weatherrelated permitrelated or financingrelatedjosé manuel daes tecnoglass inc  ceo and director well there were  there are a few reasons why they were delayed and each one is different for example the one in brickell which is flatiron they had some design changes because of the market change so they delayed a little bit that job its already going up then the one in paramount which is a huge tower in downtown miami they were having problems with the financing  or not problems delayed financing and finally they got it and they are going up also we are released to deliver the windows you can see the building going up and in  which is the one designed by renzo piano an italian architect until they reach  of sales the bank wouldnt give them the financing because of the tight conditions now implied by the banks in miami and now they reached the target so the bank gave the financing there are many things but the buildings are going up and we got the jobs and we are already working on the windows to be delivered between june and july and onoperator ladies and gentlemen we have reached the end of the questionandanswer session id like to turn the call back to josé manuel for closing commentsjosé manuel daes tecnoglass inc  ceo and director well thank you everyone for being on the call we are very enthusiastic to reach this years targets as we said before in the last call this quarter was going to be the slowest one the second quarter is going to be better and the third and fourth are going to be record quarters for the company and we believe that  is going to be a record year too we have many things going that we cannot share right now but sooner than later we will keep it up thank you for being on the call and thank you for investing with usoperator this concludes todays
