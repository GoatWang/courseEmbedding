lawrence ho plans resorts hotels outside gaming hub melco crown plans hotel expansion melco crown entertainment ltd’s billionaire chairman said he wants to be the first resort operator to use macau as the launchpad for a global hotel brand beginning with a  billion project in the the world’s biggest gambling center with ambitions to expand to japan and other asian countriescasino tycoon lawrence ho plans to debut the company’s first morpheus hotel a futuristic highrise designed by late architect zaha hadid on macau’s cotai strip in the first half of  he said in an interview in macau tuesday ho intends “to build something special in big jurisdictions like japan or other parts of asia” to expand the lodging brand aimed at “the most sophisticated international travelers” he saidalong with developing a global hotel brand melco crown is mapping a global expansion beyond its macau flagships with casino projects in cyprus russia and other asian countries the company is looking to branch out internationally as the fight for market share against rivals las vegas sands corp and wynn resorts ltd heats up in the former portuguese colony after a twoyear gaming slump “it’s a global footprint that we are developing” said ho the yearold chairman and chief executive officer of melco crown “we have done well in macau and we want to see how we can do even better internationally”the expansion plan comes as the casino industry has been rocked by the chinese government’s detentions in october of  employees of crown resorts ltd which owns a  percent stake in uslisted melco crown a group of them were formally arrested last week on alleged gambling crimes ho said the arrests haven’t had a direct effect on melco crown as it operates independently of crown and operators in the chinese city of macau could see a boost if the government clamps down on foreign operators luring its citizens to gamble overseasho earlier this month took on a more direct role at melco after complaining he was dissatisfied with the performance at the  billion hollywoodthemed studio city resort that opened in macau last year the resort has “ramped up” and performed well over the last quarter ho said tuesday adding that there’s “more potential for studio city to grow” the company posted thirdquarter profit that topped estimatesmelco shares rose  percent to  at  am in new york while the stock has bounced back from a oneyear low in july it lags behind peers on bloomberg intelligence’s index of macau gaming stocks which has surged about  percent this yearthe company’s overseas growth strategy got a boost earlier this month when its plan to develop a casino resort in the eastern mediterranean country of cyprus won government approval its first major expansion outside of macau is the city of dreams manila which opened in the philippines in early  ho is also the chairman of a holding company that opened a casino in russia last year according to exchange filings “in terms of getting the name out there and growing the customer database it does make sense to pursue nongaming opportunities globally” said grant govertsen a macaubased gaming analyst at union gaming group llc there’s little land available for gaming development in macau he added “new development that can move the needle for most macau’s casino operators effectively has to come from overseas development at this point”while ho wants to expand overseas to japan and vietnam he said he’s confident about the company’s prospects in macau where new resort openings are contributing to a rebound from a twoyear gaming slump“we are in a recovery that recovery is not going to be the same as the recovery during the global financial crisis” ho said “this time around it’s different it’s going to be more of a natural recovery”casino operators in macau the only place in china where casinos are legal may actually benefit from a chinese government crackdown on foreign casinos that woo its citizens to gamble overseas said ho“the view in macau right now is china is trying to crack down on the foreign casinos trying to poach their players to go overseas” said ho who added that his company has always been in compliance “at the end of the day macau is a part of china the reason for macau’s success is china our hope is that for homegrown macau operators we would be safe”melco has said it’s also reexamining the way it runs its business in the wake of the detentions of more than a dozen employees of stakeholder crownaustralia’s crown controlled by melco’s former cochairman james packer

our shareholders melco and pbl melco is a longestablished company listed on the main board of the hong kong stock exchange its major business is the leisure gaming and entertainment business in macau carried on by us among the listed companies in hong kong melco was one of the first to tap the rapidly growing leisure and entertainment market in macau in june  melco established macau gaming as a principal activity with the acquisition of interests in mocha slot group limited or mocha and in september of the same year melco announced its participation in a hotel development project in taipa macau which subsequently evolved to become our existing crown macau project through the leadership and reputation of mr lawrence ho our cochairman and chief executive officer and the chairman and chief executive officer of melco melco has a broad network of business relationships in macau hong kong and elsewhere in greater china we believe these relationships have been and will be important to the successful development and operation of our gaming business in macau melco is the originator of most of our existing projects in macau and its local relationships helped it to initially secure our interests in mocha and the crown macau and city of dreams projects in addition melco�s relationships have helped us to identify sites for mocha club venues on attractive economic terms and helped expand the mocha clubs into the largest noncasino based operations of gaming machines in macau with an approximately  market share by gross gaming machine revenue for the nine months ended september   based in part on the figures from the dicj dr stanley ho mr lawrence ho�s father controls the entities that were the monopoly operators of casino gaming in macau from  to  and was a director and the chairman of melco until he resigned from those positions in march  in connection with forming the joint venture between melco and pbl in march  and in exchange for its ownership interest in us melco

holding company for the mocha clubs melco also contributed to mpbl greater china a  interest in the city of dreams project and a  interest in the crown macau project we later acquired the remaining  interest in mocha from dr stanley ho the remaining  interest in the crown macau project from sociedade de turismo e divers�es de macau or stdm and the remaining  interest in the city of dreams project from a company controlled by a discretionary trust formed for the benefit of members of the ho family in october  after the subconcession was granted to mpbl gaming and we obtained a controlling

magazine publisher acp magazines however it recently announced plans to sell  of its television and magazine business and expects to complete this sale in early      through the successful operation

facilities pbl successfully operates a total of more than  highend and mass market table games and more than  electronic gaming machines at these two casinos in addition to gaming these properties

exclusive championship hole golf course crown operates its successful �crown club� gaming loyalty program we intend to leverage pbl�s operating skills its international experience and its high standards and reputation to strengthen our operations in macau for example we expect pbl will assist us in     �   implementing customer relationship management systems to facilitate our loyalty programs     �   adapting our gaming product analytics systems to maximize revenue potential     �   implementing management reporting practices and operating procedures to ensure accuracy and consistency in our internal control     �   training staff in high quality customer service and     �   adopting a community and government relations framework to promote efficient working

we do not have contractual rights to have such services provided to us we pay pbl and melco for reasonable costs determined on an arm�s length basis in connection with this support and expertise industry background macau is located in the pearl river delta region of china and is approximately an hour away from approximately  million people in hong kong via a hour hydrofoil ferry system all of the main population centers of china as well as taiwan japan korea thailand malaysia singapore indonesia and the philippines lie within an approximately  mile radius of macau according to the economist intelligence unit these countries had a total population of almost two billion people in  with china alone representing approximately  billion people like hong kong macau is a special administrative region of the people�s republic of china between  and  visitation to macau increased at a cagr of  to approximately  million visitors according to the macau statistics and census services we believe that visitation and gaming revenue growth for the macau market have been driven by and will continue to be driven by a combination of factors including     �   proximity to major asian population centers     �   liberalization of travel restrictions in china under china�s �facilitated individual travel scheme� enabling greater numbers of chinese citizens from more provinces to visit macau individually without being in a tour group as was required previously and liberalization of currency restrictions to permit chinese citizens to take significantly larger sums of foreign currency out of china when they travel     �   increasing regional wealth leading to a large and growing middle class with more disposable income and     �   planned infrastructure improvements such as an expanded and upgraded airport new roads tunnels and bridges a light rail system and additional ferry access which are expected to facilitate more convenient access to and travel within macau
