we estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of  shares of common stock net of the shares sold by selling stockholders in the offering will be approximately  based upon the initial public offering price of  per share after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us the principal purposes of the offering are to increase our capitalization and financial flexibility increase our visibility in the marketplace and create a public market for our common stock as of the date of this supplement we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to us from the offering however we currently intend to use the net proceeds to us from the offering primarily for general corporate purposes including working capital sales and marketing activities and general and administrative matters we may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of or investment in technologies solutions or businesses that complement our business although we have no present commitments or agreements to enter into any acquisitions or investments we will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds from the offering and could utilize the proceeds in ways that do not necessarily improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common stock accordingly we expect to use the net proceeds as follows        actual offering         amount      percentage   inventory                adomani china                additional staffing                sales and marketing

                               excludes amount raised by the selling shareholders  the  notes payable have maturity dates ranging from january  to november  all notes maturing from january through june  have been extended by six months pursuant to a provision in the notes  the working capital loans have interest rates equal to  per annum and a maturity date of november    a portion of working capital will be used for officers salaries the foregoing information is an estimate based on our current business plan we may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate portions of the net proceeds reserved for one category to another and we will have broad discretion in doing so pending these uses we intend to invest the net proceeds of the offering in shortterm interestbearing securities    managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of cash are our existing cash and cash equivalents balances sourced primarily from the proceeds received in private placements of common stock convertible promissory notes and notes payable discussed elsewhere in the offering circular as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents of  we believed that our existing cash and cash equivalents would be sufficient to meet our working capital requirements until completion of the offering as a precaution against our liquidity assumptions proving to be incorrect on november   we borrowed  from an unaffiliated  shareholder which our board of directors authorized the loan is for a period of one year with an interest rate of  annually with the principal and interest due at maturity we repaid the note on may   from the proceeds of the initial closing of the offering however due to delays encountered in the completion of the offering and to other working capital requirements including the ongoing costs of the offering our assumptions were incorrect and in march  we borrowed an additional  from the same shareholder the new loan also matures on november   and bears interest at  we also repaid this note on may   from the proceeds of the initial closing of the offering our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors including those set forth in the section titled risk factors in the offering circular we believe that the net proceeds from the offering of approximately  million will be sufficient to fund our operations at least through the end of calendar year  however as stated previously there can be no assurance we will successfully execute our business plan and if we do not we may need additional capital to continue our operations we do not expect to be able to satisfy our cash requirements solely through sales in the near future therefore we expect to rely on the equity funds from the offering to fund our operations the sale of additional equity securities in the future could result in additional dilution to our stockholders and those securities may have rights senior to those of our common stock the incurrence of additional indebtedness in the future would result in increased debt service obligations and could result in operating and financing covenants that would restrict our operations we cannot assure that such capital if required will be available on terms that are favorable to us or at all we are currently incurring operating deficits that are expected to continue for the foreseeable future and as we begin to execute our marketing plan we expect our operating deficit will continue to grow initially until we begin to generate a sufficient level of revenue from our sales and marketing efforts since our initial incorporation in  as a florida corporation we have financed our operations and capital expenditures through issuing equity capital convertible notes and notes payable a significant portion of this funding has been provided by affiliated shareholders although significant equity capital was also raised in late  and the majority of the convertible notes outstanding was also raised in  from nonaffiliated third parties as discussed below and in note  to the audited financial statements contained in this document note financings as of december   the company had borrowed  from acaccia family trust and other parties by issuing notes convertible into common stock at prices ranging from  per share to  per share on january   the notes plus accrued interest a total of  were converted into  shares of common stock as of december   we also had outstanding a total of  of secured promissory notes net of  of these secured notes that were exchanged for  shares of common stock on september   in december  we borrowed an additional  from a third party pursuant to a secured promissory note and immediately made a  loan to another third party who operates in the zeroemissions drivetrain technology industry we repaid this note on may   from the proceeds of the initial closing of the offering all notes referenced in this paragraph will mature in  and  see note  to the audited financial statements contained in this document    equity financings in a series of closings dated in fiscal years ended     and  the company sold an aggregate of  shares of common stock to certain of its officers directors and other related parties for an aggregate purchase price of  the offering net of payments to the selling shareholders was for an additional  shares for an aggregate purchase price of  with net proceeds to the company of approximately  options to purchase common stock as of march   we had granted  options to purchase common stock  of the options are exercisable at an exercise price of  per share the remaining  options are exercisable at the average trading price of our common stock for the first ten days of trading which commenced on june   as of may    of those options exercisable at  per share have vested if all the vested options to purchase common stock at  per share were exercised we would receive proceeds approximating  and we would be required to issue  shares of common stock there can be no assurance however that any such options will be exercised going concern as of december   we had a working capital deficit of  million and a stockholders deficiency of approximately  million during the year ended december   we incurred a net loss attributable to common stockholders of approximately  million we have not generated any material revenues and have incurred net losses since inception our recurring operating losses and our need for additional sources of capital to fund our ongoing operations raise substantial doubt about our ability to continue as a going concern as a result our independent registered public accounting firm included an explanatory paragraph in its report on our financial statements as of and for the years ended december   and  with respect to this uncertainty based on managements plans and the significant capital raised in the offering that substantial doubt has been alleviated plan of operations the delays in connection with the completion of the offering and therefore the availability of the resulting net proceeds which are approximately half of the maximum offering amount has caused subsequent delays in implementing our business plan by executing on the business plan described the offering circular and given our actual proceeds in the offering we expect to generate approximately  million in consolidated revenue including approximately  million from operations of adomani china in  we anticipate that gross profit from those sales will be approximately  million including  from china we expect that net income excluding any adjustment for stockbased compensation which we have not projected will be approximately  million with a loss of  in china in the companys opinion the proceeds from the offering will satisfy its cash requirements for and beyond the ensuing twelve months historically we have primarily focused on and engaged in research and development and product testing as such our strategy to implement our business plan depends upon unknown variables key assumptions underlying the estimates in the preceding paragraph for the remainder of  us operations following the successful completion of the offering are that we sell approximately  new vehicles including school buses transit buses class  trucks and shuttle buses and perform  conversions of vehicles from gasdiesel to all electric we also assume we will receive carbon credit funds of approximately  million from various government programs which we treat as revenue we assume we will sell  conversion kits in china including batteries primarily to manufacturers of electric trucks our assumptions are based on our knowledge of and    experience with the us markets and industries in which we expect to sell our products similarly our assumptions regarding sales in china are based on the knowledge and experience in china augmented by input from resources within china and from consulting firms with extensive experience in china based on the above assumptions we anticipate the need to hire and train  inhouse sales staff and managers in addition to the contract sales people we intend to use this may cost approximately  in the us plus related commissions and bonuses we plan to utilize our developing dealership networks to provide services for our zeroemission replacement drivetrain vehicles and new purposebuilt zeroemission electric and hybrid commercial vehicles through such dealership networks by entering into agreements further we plan to commit approximately  to marketing efforts in the us and  in china these efforts will include providing demonstrations in areas likely to show interest in our product offerings we plan to continue to seek approvals from incentive programs we anticipate the need to lease larger facilities in both the us and in china based on the assumptions in the preceding paragraph which we anticipate will cost  and  respectively over the next  months finally we plan to continue our research and development activities to identify new product offerings and develop our international business we anticipate these costs will be approximately  for our research and development activities in the us and approximately  for our international development based on future projections we assume a gross profit percentage on us sales of  and  on china sales we further assume that general and administrative warranty consulting and research and development costs collectively will be  of revenue in the united states and  in china due to startup activity and delays in procuring sales the largest component of these expenses is salaries bonuses commissions and related benefit and recruiting costs  of sales in the united states and  in china we also assume for the projected operating results the current us debt will not be repaid from the proceeds of the offering so interest expense will continue for a period of time because of the utilization of existing loss carryforwards in the united states we have assumed there will be no income tax expense in the united states in this initial period so the projected net income is  of net sales in china we have no debt but have assumed an income tax liability that is  of sales leaving projected net loss in year one of  of sales based on the projected results described above in the companys opinion the proceeds from the offering will satisfy its cash requirements for and beyond the ensuing twelve months    security ownership of management and certain security holders the following table sets forth information known to us regarding the beneficial ownership of our common stock as
