expanding consciousness margaret newman this page was last updated on november    “health is the expansion of consciousness”  newman  introduction the theory of health as expanding consciousness stems from rogers theory of unitary human beings  the theory of health as expanding consciousness was stimulated by concern for those for whom health as the absence of disease or disability is not possible newman  the theory has progressed to include the health of all persons regardless of the presence or absence of disease newman  the theory asserts that every person in every situation no matter how disordered and hopeless it may seem is part of the universal process of expanding consciousness – a process of becoming more of oneself of finding greater meaning in life and of reaching new dimensions of connectedness with other people and the world newman  bachground of the theorist born on october   bachelor’s degree  university of tennessee in  master’s degree  university of california in  doctorate  new york university in  she has worked in  university of tennessee new york university pennsylvania state university university of minnesotat university of minnesota link to her biography theory development she was influenced by following theorists martha rogers martha roger’s theory of unitary human beings was the main basis of the development of her theory health as expanding consciousness itzhak  bentov – the concept of evolution of consciousness arthur young – the theory of process david bohm – the theory of implicate assumptions health encompasses conditions heretofore described as illness or in medical terms pathology  these pathological conditions can be considered a manifestation of the total pattern of the individual the pattern of the individual that eventually manifests itself as pathology is primary and exists prior to structural or functional changes removal of the pathology in itself will not change the pattern of the indivdual  if becoming ill is the only way an individuals pattern can manifest itself then that is health for that person  health is an expansion of consciousness  description of the theory “the theory of health as expanding consciousness hec was stimulated by concern for those for whom health as the absence of disease or disability is not possible nurses often relate to such people people facing the uncertainty debilitation loss and eventual death associated with chronic illness the theory has progressed to include the health of all persons regardless of the presence or absence of disease the theory asserts that every person in every situation no matter how disordered and hopeless it may seem is part of the universal process of expanding consciousness – a process of becoming more of oneself of finding greater meaning in life and of reaching new dimensions of connectedness with other people and the world” newman  humans are open to the whole energy system of the universe and constantly interacting with the energy with this process of interaction humans are evolving their individual pattern of whole according to newman understanding  the pattern is essential the expanding consciousness is the pattern recognition the manifestation of disease depends on the pattern of individual so the pathology of the diseases exists before the symptoms appear so removal of disease symptoms does not change the individual structure newman also redefines nursing according to  her nursing is the process of recognizing the individual in relation to environment and it is the process of understanding of consciousness the nurse helps to understand people to use the power within to develop the higher level of consciousness thus it helps to realize the disease process its recovery and prevention newman also explains the interrelatedness of time space and movement time and space are the temporal pattern of the individual both have complementary relationship humans are constantly changing through time and space and it shows unique pattern of reality nursing paradigms health “health and illness are synthesized as health  the fusion on one state of being disease with its opposite nondisease results in what can be regarded as health” nursing nursing is “caring in the human health experience” nursing is seen as a partnership between the nurse and client with both grow in the “sense of higher levels of consciousness” human “the human is unitary that is cannot be divided into parts and is inseparable from the larger unitary field” “persons as individuals and human beings as a species are identified by their patterns of consciousness”… “the person does not possess consciousnessthe person is consciousness” persons are  “centers of consciousness” within an overall pattern of expanding consciousness”  environment environment is described as a “universe of open systems” strengths and weaknesses strengths can be applied in any setting “generates caring interventions” w eaknesses abstract multidimensional qualitative little discussion on environment critique clarity semantic clarity is evident in the definitions descriptions and dimensions of the concepts of the theory  simplicity  the deeper meaning of the theory of health as expending consciousness is complex the theory as a whole must be understood nut just the isolated concepts  generality the theory has been applied in several different cultures it is applicable across the spectrum of nursing care situations empirical precision  quantitative methods are inadequate in capturing the dynamic changing nature of this theory derivable consequences newmans theory provides an evolving guide for all healthrelated disciplines conclusion newmans theory can be conceptualized as a grand theory of nursing humans can not be divided into parts health is central to the theory  and is seen “and is seen as a process of developing awareness of self and the environment” “consciousness is a manifestation of an evolving pattern of personenvironment interaction” publications  references newman m a  nursings theoretical evolution nursing outlook   newman ma  theory development in nursing philadelphia fa davis

in margaret newmans own words support of the theory experience with my mother’s illness before entering nursing my study with martha rogers my fascination with the concepts of movement time space and consciousness as i worked with rehab patients the opportunity to present the theory at a  conference which compelled me to put it all together newman  assumptions of the theory person health

encompasses conditions heretofore described as illness or in medical terms pathology  these pathological conditions can be considered a manifestation of the total pattern of the individual  the pattern of the individual that eventually manifests itself as pathology is primary and exists prior to structural or functional changes david bohm’s theory of implicate order ilya prigogine’s theory of dissipative structures arthur young’s theory of the evolution of consciousness a system fluctuates in an orderly manner until the occurrence of a disruptive event internal andor external at which time the system moves in selforganizing but seemingly random disorderly ways until it chooses a new direction at a higher level of organization newman  a person moves through stages of consciousness involving the loss of freedom in the development of selfidentity until a turning point is reached when the old rules dont work anymore the life task is to discover the new rules and move toward increasing freedom and higher consciousness newman  an unseen underlying pattern as the primary order of reality he called this the implicate order the explicate order is a manifestation of the implicate order health and illness as a unity process newman  martha rogers the science of unitary human beings the health of a human being is a unitary phenomenon an evolving pattern of humanenvironment mcewen and wills  itzhak bentovs pendulum theory life is a process of expanding consciousness consciousness can be seen in the quality of interaction of the system with the environment newman  the necessity of unconditional love which manifests itself in sensitivity to self attention to others and creativity the shift from a problem orientation to pattern recognition is a shift to a higher dimension of knowledge it is important that the practitioner of nursing incorporate the knowledge of earlier realms as special cases of the pattern of the whole viewed as the totality of the life process which is evolving toward expanded consciousness  the fusion of one state of being with its opposite nondisease results in health newman  role of the nurse as a caring patternrecognizing presence and health as a transformative process to more inclusive consciousness newman  the nurse develops multifaceted levels of awareness to be able to sense the underlying pattern in a person’s physical appearance and symptoms emotional conveyances spiritual insights mental ponderings tone of voice movements etc one views the client and environment as unitary evolving patterns nurses attend to the physical manifestations and patterns of interaction of their patients to sense the implicate pattern    presented my theory for the first time at a conference in new york caring in this perspective is nonjudgmental noninterventionist and involves being with rather than just doing for caring in its deepest most respectful sense every person in every situation no matter how disordered and hopeless it may seem is part of the universal process of expanding consciousness  removal of the pathology in itself will not change the pattern of the individual  if becoming ill is the only way an individuals pattern can manifest itself then that is health for that person  health is an expansion of consciousness unitary individuals cannot be divided into parts centers of

participants perceived a direct link between their health and their patterns ofliving cut off from their preferred way of living experiencing loss and feeling displaced and devalued this reflects
