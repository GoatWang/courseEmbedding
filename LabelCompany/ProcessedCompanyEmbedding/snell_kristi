fatherdaughter were both top  westinghouse sts competitors doing sciencegeorge fritz dell and kristi snell both competed in the westinghouse sts dell in  and snell in  email print twitter facebook reddit google photo courtesy of kristi snell all other photos courtesy of sspscience is a family affair for the dells george fritz dell was a science talent search finalist in  and his daughter kristi dell snell was a finalist in  kristi and her brother grew up watching their dad george conduct physics research at the brookhaven national laboratory where their mother also worked kristi also interned in the labs biology department while she was in high schooldell and snell discussed their familys shared passion for science with the societywas science and research always a big part of your familyg dell as a physicist at brookhaven national laboratory my daughter and son often went to my office and lab and watched me conduct research on my physics projects they both spent many hours at the laboratory campus touring and participating in lab events my daughter worked as a summer intern in the biology department while in high school and eventually became a biochemist my son is an electrical engineer  k snell my father had many hobbies related to science and our basement was filled with items such as an oscilloscope soldering irons electrical components circuit boards various fossils and a large mineral collection while my brother displayed more interest in these items at an earlier age than i did i do think growing up in this environment helped to develop my interest in science both of my parents worked at brookhaven national laboratory on long island which provided its own influence my father was a high energy physicist and my mother worked in personnel my brother and i were often on the lab grounds during the summer participating in lab programs swimming playing tennis and occasionally accompanying my father to load his computer punch cards or pick up computer printouts my father’s dedication to his work was very evident as he often looked over his computer printouts in the evening while we did our homework i did my first lab work in the biology department at brookhaven lab during a high school summer internshipwhat was it like for both of you to compete in sts g dell the sts competition in  was the highlight of my high school career and i received public recognition in the local newspapers and at my small country school i was very proud to have my daughter enter the sts contest in  and actually be in the top  k snell my father’s prior participation in sts was how i found out about the competition and he encouraged me to enter at the time my high school did not have a program that encouraged students to enter science fairs and they were just starting a program to promote independent projects in science i enrolled in the independent study program and the westinghouse sts was my first science fair after i was selected as part of the sts top  group my father was able to tell me what kind of activities and sessions he participated in during his trip to washington which gave me an idea of what to expectwhat were your most memorable moments as a  dell and  snell sts finalistg dell my most memorable moments were viewing the projects other high school students had created and exhibited i was impressed with the talent and creativity of the other top  participants my favorite moment was attending the awards dinner and hearing the names of the top  winnersk snell my most memorable moment was the formal award dinner in washington at the end of the sts event the dinner’s attendees were really interested in the sts students their work and their future career plans it was a very special experience i also enjoyed visiting the office of new york’s senator daniel moynihan with the other new york students during our time in washington dccan you provide a short description of your research project and how you initially became interested in this topicg dell my project involved a unique form of residential lighting from a tesla coil  an electrical transformer circuit invented by nikola tesla around  after reading about tesla coils in my science classes i worked on a project to submit to the sts contestk snell my family travelled to indiana and ohio two to three times a year to visit relatives for as long as i can remember we often walked through farm fields that were recently plowed to look for indian artifacts my sts project focused on indian artifacts that i found in a field on a farm in indiana where my grandmother grew up i classified arrow heads and other stone tools found in this field based on their shape and style of workmanship since distinct styles and quality of workmanship are associated with different archaeological time periods i was able to compare this information to several literature sources to estimate the time period in which the artifacts were made this data helped me to determine the time periods during which this field was likely an indian sitefor george the winners of your science talent search met with president harry truman on march    what was it like to meet the presidentg dell visiting the white house and meeting harry truman was certainly a highlight of the trip for a young boy from ohio this was my first trip to washington dc and the white house were your experiences with sts influential in your career pathsg dell yes my participation in sts certainly encouraged me to go on to college and study science i chose physics and wanted to work on a phd to follow in the footsteps of a favorite uncle who had a phd in chemistryk snell i was astonished at the breadth diversity and creativity of the projects that were displayed at the sts event where the finalists showcased their research this impressed on me that even young high school students can perform rigorous research and make real discoveries it was an honor to be part of this group of students and certainly provided added incentive and confidence to explore a career in science  for kristi what stemrelated projects are you working on now in your role at metabolixk snell my science career has focused on the metabolic engineering of bacteria and plants to produce valueadded products through metabolic engineering one can genetically alter an organism to redirect a portion of its metabolism to produce a target product such as a molecule or polymer or to enhance its growth and yield i first started work with bacteria while obtaining a phd in organic chemistry from purdue university and continued in this field as a postdoctoral associate at mit in the department of biology at mit i worked on a project related to the production of a class of biodegradable renewable polymers called phas in bacteria in  i joined a small biotechnology company metabolix inc that had previously spun out of mit to commercialize this class of polymers during my first  years at metabolix my work focused on the production of pha biopolymers in plants including switchgrass camelina and tobacco in my more recent role as vice president of research and biotechnology i oversee the company’s research to produce commercial bacterial production strains for our pha polymers as well as plant science research to create pha producing plants or plants with enhanced yieldi am very excited about a new project that i am participating in to spin out metabolix’s plant science research into a new company called yield bioscience the plant science team has developed some proprietary breakthrough technologies based on novel genetic traits and targeted metabolic engineering which can be used to improve yield in major food feed and energy crops improved crop productivity will become increasingly important as we try to feed clothe and fuel a growing world population which the united nations has estimated will increase from  billion to  billion by  to support this growth new novel agricultural solutions will be required to enhance crop yield yield will focus on developing these solutions do you have any career highlights that you would like to shareg dell i worked and visited many national labs during my career in nuclear physics and particle physics i even had the opportunity to work for several years on a particle physics accelerator at cern a physics laboratory in geneva switzerland my last project was working on rhic the relativistic heavy ion collider at brookhaven national laboratory before my retirement in   rhic is still being used for research in k snell i have been very fortunate to be a part of some great teams at metabolix teams that have really pushed the envelope in the field of metabolic engineering our teams have succeeded in rewiring carbon flow in plants to produce the highest levels of polymer ever reported in tobacco switchgrass and oilseeds in some of our more recent work we are applying our metabolic engineering expertise to increase crop productivity and yield and have obtained some exciting results that will form the basis of our new crop spinout yieldwhat is your advice to young students interested in science and mathg dell i would certainly encourage high school students to study science and math and pursue an exciting career with good job opportunities young women need to be encouraged to study science since we need to have more women in the field of science and engineeringk snell i think it is important to have a role model in science that helps you to visualize yourself embarking on a similar career path this is especially important for women and minorities that may be underrepresented in certain stem fields there were several women in science both during my formative high school years and later in life when i had chosen my field that provided me with a positive example of a career path for women in scienceif you would like to be featured on our blog reconnect with the society or email ussticky
