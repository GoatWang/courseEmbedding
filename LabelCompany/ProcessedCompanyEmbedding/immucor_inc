than  mostly from direct contributions from  employees and set up immucor headquarters in an office park in norcross georgia in the united states the food and drug administration fda regulates human blood as a drug and a biological product and the transfusion of blood as the administration of a drug and of a biological product initially unlicensed and lacking fda approval financing was a major
