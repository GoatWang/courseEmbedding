faqs  new harbor financial group  leominster ma faqsyou are here home  faqsfrequently asked questions who owns new harbor financial group new harbor financial group is  owned by us we answer only to you what are your investment management fees and how are they determined we charge a fixedpercentage based on the amount of assets in managed accounts due to economies of scale we charge lowerpercentage fees for larger accounts fees are clearly reported and automatically debited from the client’s account once per calendar quarter in light of our feebased model our compensation for managed accounts is independent of how many or how few transactions are executed simply put clients can take comfort in the fact that we never have a financial incentive to create unnecessary or inappropriate activity within their accounts our fees are very transparent we want our clients to be able to continually compare our fee against the value we add to their financial picture if a client feels they are not getting sufficient value to justify our fees they are free to end their relationship with us at any time without any penalties or constraints what types of investment products do you use exchange traded funds etfs stocks equity securities bonds options mutual funds will you invest in alternative assets like commodities or real estate there are times when these asset classes can be important sources of added return and can potentially reduce overall portfolio risks due to their low correlation with traditional assets such as stocks and bonds when our technical models suggest we will invest modest amounts of client funds in such alternative asset classes as commodities energy agricultural preciousbase metals foreign currencies and real estate these products present unique risks and we will only recommend them when suitable to the investor do you manage individual stocks in the portfolio yes however we often favor diversified equity investment vehicles we believe gaining exposure to an entire sector as opposed to one or a limited number of stocks in that sector will likely deliver superior riskadjusted returns rest assured that if you have individual stock positions that you would like us to manage as part of your portfolio we can apply many of the same valueadded investment management techniques that we employ with other investment vehicles often important considerations such as unrealized capital gains justify maintaining longterm individual stock holdings you talk about riskmanaged investing how do you hedge investment risks in the portfolio we use a variety of strategies to manage risk in the portfolio in terms of portfolio holdings inverse etfs covered call options protective put options and collars are all ways to mitigate the investment risk of other holdings a strategy that hedges risk is not the same thing as a hedge fund see below options involve certain risks and are not suitable for all investors copies of the options disclosure document are available from new harbor financial group at   i’m concerned about hedge funds and other complex investments do you utilize these types of funds we generally do not use illiquid investments such as hedge funds and limited partnerships many hedge fund investors learned that not only can these kinds of investments suffer from significant declines in value but investors may be restricted or limited from withdrawing their money during times of market turmoil how is my account protected from fraud integrity and transparency are very important to us your account is protected from fraudulent activity through a variety of checks and balances we use an independent thirdparty custodian and recordkeeper to track audit and report on all investments deposits to and withdrawals from all client accounts are made directly to them—not us as a federallyregistered investment adviser new harbor financial group is directly regulated by the securities  exchange commission finally you have complete access to all your account information  see below how can i track my portfolio activity and performance clients can access their accounts online  hours a day  days a week through our secure internet login site you will receive printed trade confirmations within a couple days of any transaction and monthly statements showing monthend portfolio values changes in value since prior month summary of any transactions conducted during the month and a detailed list of each investment holding in your account for those clients who prefer electronic delivery of confirmations and statements we offer that as an alternative at least once a year and as often as requested by a client we provide detailed performance summaries which show both graphically and numerically the actual performance of a client account net of our fees this report also compares your account performance relative to appropriate benchmarks so you can assess whether we are delivering the value you expect from us how often does new harbor review my investment portfolio we take an active approach to managing client assets we monitor the investment markets and investment positions held in client portfolios several times a day every day what if i need money or want to withdraw funds how long do i have to wait typically funds will be available to you within a few days of your request we generally use highly liquid investments that do not have redemption restrictions and our custodian is able to process withdrawal requests from such investments very quickly do you have a
