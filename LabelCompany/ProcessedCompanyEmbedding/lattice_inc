allografts bone ligament cartilage tendon or skin transplanted from one person to another are used in the united states alone each year for a wide variety of surgical applications ranging from reconstruction to orthopedic spine sports medicine cardiac dental and cosmetic procedures  allograft transplantation has been used for decades to help everyone from athletes who need knee reconstruction to patients suffering from back pain and cancer patients who undergo surgery  these operations rely on the invaluable gift of donors but not all allograft procedures are successful lattice biologics is passionately committed to honoring the gift of tissue donation and “stacking the deck” to maximize all patients’ results which is why we have devoted extensive ongoing research to improve the surgical outcomes for allograft recipients  this was the impetus for developing next generation allograft technology unlike the undirected scaffold allograft products currently available on the market lattice biologics’ next generation allografts drastically improve postsurgical healing and reduce recovery time for allograft recipients  read on to learn more about this technology and
