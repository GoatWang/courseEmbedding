potential beyond that of the information field virtual learning further invested in a nonrelated business through associations with several large shareholders in the company virtual recognized that the effects of super storm sandy which occurred on october   would be far reaching and cause an almost unlimited demand for specific construction services as well as construction information due to the damage caused by the storm as well as the material changes in the fema flood maps which now require over  homeowners along the new jersey coastline to elevate their homes virtual felt that acquiring an entity in the construction field might provide a stable revenue stream for the company additionally through its previous associations and long standing professional relationships with dream homes ltd virtual felt that dream homes educational division was an excellent fit with the existing platform that virtual has developed to market educational software and materials as such virtual learning acquired for stock a company known as dream building llc which will operate as a wholly owned subsidiary of virtual learning and pursue opportunities in the real estate field specifically in new home construction home elevations and renovations as part of this effort through the end of  virtual through its dream building subsidiary acquired the rights to complete  single family construction renovation and home elevation projects in the central nj region which it will build to completion the contract amount of these projects is as of december   is  in addition to the above projects which are in process dream building llc has also estimated an additional  worth of residential construction projects and added over  active prospects to its data base all of these prospects are prime candidates for educational videos and short books on specific construction and rebuilding topics as well as candidates for rebuilding projects to be built under the dream building llc division management hopes for steady growth in this segment of the company since the rebuilding process will occur over the next  years we anticipate possibly being able to efficiently address    of this market the combined total number of homes affected by storm sandy that will need to be raised or demolished and rebuilt is in excess of  homes of which less than  have been rebuilt this remaining combined market for new construction and elevation projects in the companys market area is estimated to be in the range of  billion dollars the company anticipates being able to efficiently address    of this market among the other assets that virtual acquired with dream builders llc were the rights to operate the educational construction seminar known as dream homes nearly famous rebuilding seminar as well as the informational blog known as the dream homes rebuilding blog the nearly famous rebuilding seminar is held bimonthly and is a powerful educational tool for homeowners who need of rebuilding or renovations this seminar has been presented steadily since early  and is designed to educate and assist homeowners in deciphering the confusion about planning and executing

such forwardlooking statements by their nature involve substantial risks and uncertainties certain of which are beyond our control and actual results for future periods could differ materially from

noble nook these titles have a retail price of  and earn the company a  royalty with each sale the company has one curriculum development contract with lawrence william kazmierczak a professor of mathematics that requires the company to pay him to author courses in precalculus calculus i and ii and to consult on the creation of high school level math courses this agreement provides for professor kazmierczak to receive  royalties on the companys net revenues up to one million dollars of net revenues and  royalty on net revenues beyond one million dollars on projects in which he directly participates and has made material contributions in addition he has received  shares of the companys common stock we determine what projects in which he has directly participated and made material contributions by our internal record keeping as to time devoted to each project we determine the revenue attributed to those projects by monitoring devices that allow us to determine which authorized user has devoted how much time to which module and then comparing the same to the entire revenue stream events and uncertainties critical to our business demand for our products and services are affected by the general economic conditions in the united states when economic conditions are favorable and discretionary income increases purchases of nonessential items like software generally increase when economic conditions are less favorable sales of nonessential educational items are generally lower in addition we may experience more competitive pricing pressures during economic downturns therefore any significant economic downturn or any future changes in consumer spending habits could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations there is no guarantee that we will be able to generate sufficient sales to make our operations profitable we may continue to have little or no sales and continue to sustain losses in the future if we continue to sustain losses we will be forced to curtail our operations and go out of business our success depends in a large part in the of our ability to create additional product lines sufficient to create a catalog of programs to offer allowing us to implement a successful marketing and sales plan while we are currently seeking to hire additional computer programmers and educators to consult with as to program accuracy and content there is no guarantee that these efforts will result in any substantial sales because of the lack of funding we are unable to hire a dedicated programming and research consulting team who will devote their efforts to helping us design and create new programs of high quality in a timely manner if we are able to obtain sufficient funding to become operational there is no guarantee that we will be able to find personnel who will be able to work closely with the company to help design and create new lines of product or to process orders including special orders made via the internet critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with us generally accepted accounting principles the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets liabilities revenue and expenses and related disclosures we review our estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances actual results may differ from these estimates we believe the following accounting policies are critical to the judgments and estimates we use in preparing our financial statements going concern as of december   virtual learning had cash of  and negative working capital of  for the years ended december   and  virtual learning had revenues  and  respectively and sustained net losses of  and  respectively these factors raise substantial doubt about virtual learnings ability to continue as a going concern virtual learning has also unamortized capitalized stockbased and contributed curriculum development costs as of december   and  of  and  respectively the recovery of these asset costs and continuation of future operations are dependent upon virtual learnings ability to obtain additional debt or equity capital and its ability to generate revenues sufficient to continue pursuing its business purposes virtual learning is pursuing financing to fund future operations virtual learning is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other development stage enterprises these risks include but are not limited to rapid technological change dependence on key personnel competing new product introductions and other activities of competitors the successful development and marketing of its products and the need to obtain adequate additional capital necessary to fund future operations there is no assurance that virtual learning can reverse its operating losses or that it can raise additional capital to allow it to continue its planned future operations these factors raise additional substantial doubt about virtual learnings ability to continue as a going concern these financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of recorded asset amounts that might be necessary from an unfavorable resolution of this uncertainty property and equipment property and equipment is presented at stated value upon contribution or at the cost of acquisition depreciation is provided using the straightline method over an estimated useful life of five years repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and renewals and betterments are capitalized use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes actual results could differ materially from these estimates on an ongoing basis virtual learnings management evaluates its estimates including those related to revenue recognition the need for an allowance for uncollectible accounts receivable the need for recognition of an impairment allowance for capitalized curriculum development costs useful lives of intangible assets and property and equipment deemed value of common stock for the purpose of determining stockbased compensation and income taxes among others management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities virtual learnings management board of directors determines the value assigned to shares of common stock in the absence of a public market for these shares fair value of financial instruments fair value is defined as the price that we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date in determining fair value gaap establishes a threelevel hierarchy used in measuring fair value as follows  level  inputs are quoted prices available for identical assets and liabilities in active markets  level  inputs are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data  level  inputs are less observable and reflect our own assumptions our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents and accounts payable approximates fair value because of their short maturities we may adjust the carrying amount of certain nonfinancial assets to fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are impaired no such adjustments were made in years ended december   and  capitalized curriculum development costs virtual learning internally develops curriculum which is primarily provided as web content and accessed via the internet virtual learning also creates text books and other offline materials virtual learning capitalizes curriculum development costs incurred during the application development stage in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles provide guidance for the treatment of costs associated with computer software development and defines those costs to be capitalized and those to be expensed costs that qualify for capitalization are external direct costs payroll and payrollrelated expenses costs related to general and administrative functions are not capitalized and are expensed as incurred virtual learning capitalizes curriculum development costs when the projects under development reach technological feasibility many of our new courses are leveraged off proven delivery platforms and are primarily content which has no technological hurdles as a result a significant portion of our courseware development costs qualify for capitalization due to the concentration of our development efforts on the content of the courseware technological feasibility is established when we have completed all planning designing coding and testing activities necessary to establish that a course can be produced to meet its design specifications capitalization ends when a course is available for general release to our customers at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins the period of time over which these development costs are amortized is generally five years this is consistent with the capitalization period used by others in our industry and corresponds with our product development lifecycle cash and cash equivalents all liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents all liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months are classified as shortterm investments

significant accounting policies and basis of presentation   basis of presentation   the accompanying unaudited financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and the rules and regulations of the united states securities and exchange commission for interim financial information and with the instructions to form q and article  of regulation sx accordingly they may not include all the information and footnotes necessary for a comprehensive presentation of financial position results of operations or cash flows it is management’s opinion however that all material adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments have been made which are necessary for a fair financial statement presentation   the unaudited interim financial statements should be read in conjunction with the company’s annual report filed on form k for the year ended december   which contains the audited financial statements and notes thereto together with management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for the year ended december     nature of operations   the virtual learning company inc “virtual learning” was incorporated on january   as a nevada corporation with  shares of capital stock authorized of which  shares are common shares  par value and  shares are preferred shares  par value   virtual learning has been a subscription based software as a service “saas” provider of education products virtual learning provides standardsbased instruction practice assessments and productivity tools that improve the performance of educators and students via proprietary webbased platforms at wwwmathisbasiccom wwwscienceisbasiccom and wwwreadingisbasiccom   virtual learning is also a producer of a series of practice workbooks published on cd dvd formatted disc and usb drives and in the epub format which have been offered for sale through barnes and noble’s nook and amazon’s kindle since    newly acquired construction business   on august   virtual learning acquired  of dream homesltd “dhl”  of dream building llc “dbl”  a wholly owned subsidiary of dhl and use of all construction licensing and registrations held by atlantic northeast construction llc “ancl” a wholly owned subsidiary of dhl in exchange for the issuance of  restricted shares of virtual learning common stock to dhl at an agreed price of  per common share                  the majority stockholder and chief executive officer of dhl is also the controlling stockholder and chief executive officer of virtual learning as virtual learning and dhl were entities under common control the acquired assets were reflected by virtual learning at dhl’s  carrying amount on the date of transfer pursuant to accounting standards codification “asc”    from august   to august   virtual learning acquired the rights to complete  in process construction contracts of ancl in exchange for the issuance of  restricted shares of virtual learning common stock to dhl at an agreed price of  per common share for those ancl contracts as virtual learning and dhl were entities under common control the acquired rights were reflected at dhl’s  carrying amount on the date of transfer pursuant to asc      going concern uncertainty   these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these standards contemplate continuation of virtual learning as a going concern   as of september   virtual learning had  cash and negative working capital of  for the nine months ended september   and  virtual learning had revenues of  and  respectively and sustained net losses of  and  respectively these factors raise substantial doubt about virtual learning’s ability to continue as a going concern virtual learning has also unamortized capitalized stockbased and contributed curriculum development costs of  as of september   the recovery of these asset costs and continuation of future operations will be dependent upon virtual learning’s ability to obtain additional debt or equity capital and its ability to generate revenues sufficient to continue pursuit of its business purposes virtual learning is actively seeking financing to fund future operations   virtual learning is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other development stage enterprises these risks include but are not limited to rapid technological change dependence on key personnel competing new product introductions and other activities of competitors the successful development and marketing of its products and the need to obtain adequate additional capital necessary to fund future operations   there is no assurance that virtual learning can reverse its operating losses or that it can raise additional capital to allow it to continue its planned future operations these factors raise additional substantial doubt about virtual learning’s ability to continue as a going concern these financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability of recorded asset amounts that might be necessary from an unfavorable resolution of this uncertainty   principles of consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of virtual learning and its wholly owned subsidiary dbl collectively the “company” all intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation                  property and equipment   property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is provided using the straightline method over an estimated useful life of five years repairs and maintenance costs are expensed as incurred and renewals and betterments are capitalized   use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes actual results could differ materially from these estimates     cash and cash equivalents   all liquid investments with stated maturities of three months or less from date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents all liquid investments with stated maturities of greater than three months are classified as shortterm investments   fair value of financial instruments   fair value is defined as the price that we would receive to sell an asset or pay to transfer a liability an exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants on the measurement date in determining fair value gaap establishes a threelevel hierarchy used in measuring fair value as follows   ● level  inputs are quoted prices available for identical assets and liabilities in active markets   ● level  inputs are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly including quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data   ● level  inputs are less observable and reflect our own assumptions   our financial instruments consist of cash and cash equivalents receivables accounts payable and accrued expenses and convertible notes payable and accrued interest the carrying amount of cash and cash equivalents receivables and accounts payable and accrued expenses approximates fair value because of their short maturities the carrying value of the convertible notes payable and accrued interest approximates fair value based on the value of comparable financial instruments with similar terms we may adjust the carrying amount of certain nonfinancial assets to fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are impaired no such adjustments were made for the nine months ended september   and    construction contracts   revenue recognition   the company and its affiliated entities recognize construction contract revenue using the percentageofcompletion method based primarily on contract cost incurred to date compared to total estimated contract cost cost of revenue includes an allocation of depreciation amortization and general overhead cost changes to total estimated contract cost or losses if any are recognized in the period in which they are determined   the company generally provides limited warranties for work performed under its construction contracts with periods typically extending for a limited duration following substantial completion of the company’s work on a project                the company classifies constructionrelated receivables and payables that may be settled in periods exceeding one year from the balance sheet date if any as current assets and liabilities consistent with the length of time of its project operating cycle for example     ● costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings represent the excess of contract costs and profits or contract revenue over the amount of contract billings to date and are classified as a current asset         ● billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings represent the excess of contract billings to date over the amount of contract costs and profits or contract revenue recognized to date and are classified as a current liability   costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings result when either  costs are incurred related to certain claims and unapproved change orders or  the appropriate contract revenue amount has been recognized in accordance with the percentageofcompletion accounting method but a portion of the revenue recorded cannot be billed currently due to the billing terms defined in the contract claims occur when there is a dispute regarding both a change in the scope of work and the price associated with that change unapproved change orders occur when there is a dispute regarding only the price associated with a change in scope of work for both claims and unapproved change orders the company recognizes revenue but not profit when it is determined that recovery of incurred cost is probable and the amounts can be reliably estimated   change in estimates   the company’s estimates of contract revenue and cost are highly detailed and many factors change during a contract performance period that result in a change to contract profitability these factors include but are not limited to differing site conditions availability of skilled contract labor performance of major material suppliers and subcontractors ongoing subcontractor negotiations and buyout provisions unusual weather conditions changes in the timing of scheduled work change orders accuracy of the original bid estimate changes in estimated labor productivity and costs based on experience to date achievement of incentivebased income targets and the expected or actual resolution terms for claims the factors that cause changes in estimates vary depending on the maturation of the project within its lifecycle for example in the rampup phase these factors typically consist of revisions in anticipated project costs and during the peak and closeout phases these fators include the impact of change orders and claims as well as additional revisions in remaining anticipated project costs generally if the contract is at an early stage of completion the current period impact is smaller than if the same change in estimate is made to the contract at a later stage of completion management focuses on evaluating the performance of contracts individually and uses the cumulative catchup method to account for revisions in estimates material changes in estimates are disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial statements   educational software and products   revenue recognition   revenue is recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement the customer has access to full use of the product the collection is reasonably assured and the amount to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable   revenue generated from the company’s subscription based learning service is recognized when all of the following conditions are satisfied there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement the customer has access to full use of the product the collection is reasonably assured and the amount to be paid by the customer is fixed or determinable   revenue from customer subscriptions is recognized ratably over the subscription term beginning on the commencement date of each subscription the average subscription term is twelve  months for our products and all subscriptions are on a noncancelable basis when additional months are offered as a promotional incentive those months are part of the subscription term as part of their subscriptions customers generally benefit from new features and functionality with each release at no additional cost                  although our membership contracts are generally noncancelable customers have the right to cancel their contracts by providing prior written notice to us of their intent to cancel the remainder of the contract term in the event a customer cancels their contract they are not entitled to a refund for prior services we have provided to them   customer support is provided to customers following the sale at no additional charge and at a minimal cost per call   virtual learning does not incur significant upfront costs related to providing its products and services and therefore does not defer any expenses   revenue from the sale of cd’s or dvd’s and other materials is recognized when shipped or available to the customer in a downloadable format   capitalized curriculum development costs   virtual learning has internally developed curriculum which is primarily offered as web content and accessed via the internet virtual learning also creates textbooks and other offline materials   virtual learning has capitalized curriculum development costs incurred during the application development stage in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america these principles provide guidance for the treatment of costs associated with computer software development and defines those costs to be capitalized and those to be expensed costs that qualify for capitalization are external direct costs payroll and payrollrelated expenses costs related to general and administrative functions are not capitalized and are expensed as incurred virtual learning has capitalized curriculum development costs when the projects under development have reached technological feasibility many of our courses are leveraged off proven delivery platforms and are primarily content which has no technological hurdles as a result a significant portion of our courseware development costs have qualified for capitalization due to the concentration of our development efforts on the content of the courseware   technological feasibility is established when we have completed all planning designing coding and testing activities necessary to establish that a course can be produced to meet its design specifications capitalization ends when a course is available for general release to our customers at which time amortization of the capitalized costs begins the period of time over which these development costs have been amortized is five years this is consistent with the capitalization period used by others in our industry and corresponds with our product development lifecycle   virtual learning tests for impairment annually at september   and december   the company’s estimates of future undiscounted cash flows from the courses exceeded the carrying amounts of the capitalized curriculum development costs  and  respectively and therefore no impairment was recognized   income taxes   virtual learning accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability method deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax reporting purposes deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in the provision for income tax in the statements of operations virtual learning evaluates the probability of realizing the future benefits of its deferred tax assets and provides a valuation allowance when realization of the assets is not reasonably assured                  virtual learning recognizes in its financial statements the impact of tax positions that meet a “more likely than not” threshold based on the technical merits of the position the tax benefits recognized from such a position are measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement   net income loss per common share   basic net income basic net loss per common share is calculated by dividing net income loss by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period   diluted net income loss per common share is computed using the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and poten search engine marketing sem
