trial stage during the first three months for the period ended december   we have generated  revenue related to a onetime consulting service research and development during the first three months for the period ended december   and  we have spent approximately  and  respectively on research and development critical accounting policies and estimates we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation basis of presentation the accompanying audited financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap this basis of accounting involves the application of accrual accounting and consequently revenues and gains are recognized when earned and expenses and losses are recognized when incurred the companys financial statements are expressed in us dollars forward stock split on march   the board of directors of the company approved an amendment to articles of incorporation to affect a forward split at a ratio of  to  and increase the number of our authorized shares of common stock par value  per share to  which was effective on april   the majority of the shareholders of the company approved the amendment to articles of incorporation see note  for more details use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ materially from those results fair value measurements the company applies the provisions of asc subtopic  fair value measurements for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements asc  also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  establishes three levels of inputs to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows  level  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets  level  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instruments  level  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value there were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of asc  as of june   cash and cash equivalents the company considers highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents as of december   and september   the companys cash and cash equivalents amounted  and  respectively all of the companys cash deposit is held in a financial institution located in prc where there is currently regulation mandated on obligatory insurance of bank accounts the company believes this financial institution is of high credit quality income taxes the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach which allows the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets to be based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years under the asset and liability approach deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is morelikelythannot that these items will expire before the company is able to realize their benefits or that future deductibility is uncertain under asc  a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is more likely than not that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination with a tax examination being presumed to occur the evaluation of a tax position is a twostep process the first step is to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including the resolution of any related appeals or litigations based on the technical merits of that position the second step is to measure a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements a tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than  percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement tax positions that previously failed to meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is satisfied previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the morelikelythannot criteria should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer satisfied penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the year incurred no significant penalty or interest relating to income taxes has been incurred during the period from july   inception to december   gaap also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosures and transition as of december   and september   the companys income tax expense amounted  and  respectively recent accounting pronouncements from time to time new accounting standards issued by the

december   and september   unaudited    organization and description of business   american brivision holding corporation the “company” or “holding entity” a nevada corporation thru the company’s operating entity american brivision corporation “brivision” which was incorporated in july  in the state of delaware engages in biotechnology and focuses on the development of new drugs and innovative medical devices to fulfill unmet medical needs the business model of the company is to integrate research achievements from worldfamous institutions such as memorial sloan kettering cancer center

reverse merger   on february   a share exchange agreement “share exchange agreement” was entered into by and among american brivision holding corporation the “company” american brivision corporation “brivision” euroasia investment  finance corp limited a company incorporated under the laws of hong kong special administrative region of taiwan “euroasia” being the owners of record of  shares of common stock of the company and the owners of record of all of the issued share capital of brivision the “brivision stock” pursuant to the share exchange agreement upon surrender by the brivision shareholders and the cancellation by brivision of the certificates evidencing the brivision stock as registered in the name of each brivision shareholder and pursuant to the registration of the company in the register of members maintained by brivision as the new holder of the brivision stock and the issuance of the certificates evidencing the aforementioned registration of the brivision

of the issued and outstanding common stock of the company immediately after the closing in exchange for the brivision stock representing  of the issued share capital of brivision because of the exchange of the brivision stock for the acquisition stock the “share exchange” brivision became a wholly owned subsidiary the “subsidiary” of the company and there was a change of control of the company following the closing there were no warrants options or other equity instruments issued in connection with the share exchange agreement   because of the consummation of the share exchange brivision is now our wholly owned subsidiary and its shareholders own approximately  of our issued and outstanding common stock   following the share exchange we have abandoned our prior business plan and we are now pursuing brivision’s historical businesses and proposed businesses which focus on the development of new drugs and innovative medical devices to fulfill unmet medical needs the business model of the company is to integrate research achievements from worldfamous institutions conduct clinical trials of translational medicine for proof of concept “poc” outlicense to international pharmaceutical companies and exploit global markets   accounting treatment of the reverse merger   for financial reporting purposes the share exchange represents a “reverse merger” rather than a business combination and brivision is deemed the accounting acquirer in the transaction the share exchange is being accounted for as a reversemerger and recapitalization brivision is the acquirer for financial reporting purposes and the company is the acquired company consequently the assets and liabilities and the operations reflected in the historical financial statements prior to the share exchange will be those of brivision and recorded at the historical cost basis of brivision in addition the consolidated financial statements after completion of the share exchange will include the assets and liabilities of the company and brivision and the historical operations of brivision and operations of the combined company from the closing date of the share exchange             summary of significant accounting policies   basis of presentation   the accompanying audited financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap this basis of accounting involves the application of accrual accounting consequently revenues and gains are recognized when earned and expenses and losses are recognized when incurred the company’s financial statements are expressed in us dollars the condensed financial statements include all adjustments that in the opinion of management are necessary in order not to make the financial statements misleading   certain information and footnote disclosure normally included in financial statements prepared in accordance with us gaap have been condensed or omitted the results of operations for the periods ended december   are not necessarily indicative of the operating results for the full year   use of estimates   the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ materially from those results   forward stock split   on march   the board of directors of the company approved an amendment to articles of incorporation to effect a forward split at a ratio of  to  and increase the number of our authorized shares of common stock par value  per share to  which was effective on april   the majority of the shareholders of the company approved the amendment to articles of incorporation see note  for more details   fair value measurements   the company applies the provisions of asc subtopic  “fair value measurements” for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements asc  also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements   fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability            asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  establishes three levels of inputs to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows     ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets         ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instruments         ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value   there were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of asc  as of december     cash and cash equivalents   the company considers highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents as of december   the company’s cash and cash equivalents amounted  as of september   the company’s cash and cash equivalents amounted  all of the company’s cash deposits are held in a financial institution located in prc where there is currently regulation mandated on obligatory insurance of bank accounts the company believes this financial institution is of high credit quality   income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach which allows the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets to be based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years under the asset and liability approach deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not these items will expire before the company is able to realize their benefits or future deductibility is uncertain   under asc  a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination with a tax examination being presumed to occur the evaluation of a tax position is a twostep process the first step is to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including the resolution of any related appeals or litigations based on the technical merits of that position the second step is to measure a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot threshold to determine the amount of benefits recognized in the financial statements a tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than  percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement tax positions that previously failed to meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is met previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the morelikelythannot criteria should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer satisfied penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the year incurred no significant penalty or interest relating to income taxes has been incurred during the period from july   inception to december   gaap also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosures and transition   as of december   and december   the company’s income tax expense amounted  and  respectively   recent accounting pronouncements   from time to time new accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” or other standard setting bodies are adopted by the company as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed the company believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption the recent accounting standards are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption             going concern   the accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming the company will continue as a going concern the company has incurred losses since its inception resulting in an accumulated deficit of  as of december   the company also incurred net losses of  and negative cash flow of  during the year ended december   the ability to continue as a going concern is dependent upon the company generating profitable operations in the future andor obtaining the necessary financing to meet its obligations and repay its liabilities arising from normal business operations when they become due these combined financial statements do not include any adjustments to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset

the company determined to fully expense the entire amount of  since currently the related licensing rights do not have alternative future uses  according to asc  absent alternative future uses the acquisition of product rights to be used in research and development activities must be charged to research and development expenses immediately hence the entire amount is fully expensed as research and there was no commercial sales during the period ended december     plan of operations   brivision will select potential drug candidates including but not limited to botanical drugs from different

related to a onetime consulting service            research and development   during the first three months for the period ended december   and  we have spent approximately  and  respectively on research and development   critical accounting policies and estimates   we believe that the following accounting policies are the most critical to aid you in fully understanding and evaluating this “management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation”   basis of presentation   the accompanying audited financial statements and related notes have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america us gaap this basis of accounting involves the application of accrual accounting and consequently revenues and gains are recognized when earned and expenses and losses are recognized when incurred the company’s financial statements are expressed in us dollars   forward stock split   on march   the board of directors of the company approved an amendment to articles of incorporation to affect a forward split at a ratio of  to  and increase the number of our authorized shares of common stock par value  per share to  which was effective on april   the majority of the shareholders of the company approved the amendment to articles of incorporation see note  for more details   use of estimates   the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods actual results could differ materially from those results   fair value measurements   the company applies the provisions of asc subtopic  “fair value measurements” for fair value measurements of financial assets and financial liabilities and for fair value measurements of nonfinancial items that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements asc  also establishes a framework for measuring fair value and expands disclosures about fair value measurements   fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date when determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities required or permitted to be recorded at fair value the company considers the principal or most advantageous market in which it would transact and it considers assumptions that market participants would use when pricing the asset or liability   asc  establishes a fair value hierarchy that requires an entity to maximize the use of observable inputs and minimize the use of unobservable inputs when measuring fair value asc  establishes three levels of inputs to measure fair value the hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities level  measurements and the lowest priority to measurements involving significant unobservable inputs level  measurements the three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows     ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology are quoted prices unadjusted for identical assets or liabilities in active markets         ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology include quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets and inputs that are observable for the assets or liability either directly or indirectly for substantially the full term of the financial instruments         ● level  inputs to the valuation methodology are unobservable and significant to the fair value   there were no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a recurring basis subject to the disclosure requirements of asc  as of june     cash and cash equivalents   the company considers highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased to be cash equivalents as of december   and september   the company’s cash and cash equivalents amounted  and  respectively all of the company’s cash deposit is held in a financial institution located in prc where there is currently regulation mandated on obligatory insurance of bank accounts the company believes this financial institution is of high credit quality            income taxes   the company accounts for income taxes using the asset and liability approach which allows the recognition and measurement of deferred tax assets to be based upon the likelihood of realization of tax benefits in future years under the asset and liability approach deferred taxes are provided for the net tax effects of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is morelikelythannot that these items will expire before the company is able to realize their benefits or that future deductibility is uncertain   under asc  a tax position is recognized as a benefit only if it is “more likely than not” that the tax position would be sustained in a tax examination with a tax examination being presumed to occur the evaluation of a tax position is a twostep process the first step is to determine whether it is morelikelythannot that a tax position will be sustained upon examination including the resolution of any related appeals or litigations based on the technical merits of that position the second step is to measure a tax position that meets the morelikelythannot threshold to determine the amount of benefit to be recognized in the financial statements a tax position is measured at the largest amount of benefit that is greater than  percent likely of being realized upon ultimate settlement tax positions that previously failed to meet the morelikelythannot recognition threshold should be recognized in the first subsequent period in which the threshold is satisfied previously recognized tax positions that no longer meet the morelikelythannot criteria should be derecognized in the first subsequent financial reporting period in which the threshold is no longer satisfied penalties and interest incurred related to underpayment of income tax are classified as income tax expense in the year incurred no significant penalty or interest relating to income taxes has been incurred during the period from july   inception to december   gaap also provides guidance on derecognition classification interest and penalties accounting in interim periods disclosures and transition   as of december   and september   the company’s income tax expense amounted  and  respectively   recent accounting pronouncements   from time to time new accounting standards issued by the financial accounting standards board “fasb” or other standard setting bodies that are adopted by the company as of the specified effective date unless otherwise discussed the company believes that the impact of recently issued standards that are not yet effective will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations upon adoption the recent accounting standards are not expected to have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements upon adoption   offbalance sheet arrangements   we do not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on our financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations liquidity capital expenditures or capital resources that is

of this filing we have not generated any revenues from operations we cannot guarantee we will be successful in our business operations our business is subject to risks inherent in the establishment of a new business enterprise including limited capital resources possible delays in the launching of our games and market or wider economic downturns we do not believe we have sufficient funds to operate our business for the next  months   we have no assurance that future financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all if financing is not available on satisfactory terms we may be unable to continue develop or expand our operations equity financing could result in additional dilution to existing shareholders   if we are unable to raise additional capital to maintain our operations in the future we may be unable to carry out our full business plan or we may be forced to cease operations   the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the audited financial statements of brivision for the period ended september   and accompanying notes that appear in our annual report on form k as filed with the securities and exchange commission on january   and the financial statements included in this report   results of operation   our financial statements have been prepared assuming that we will continue as a going concern and accordingly do not include adjustments relating to the recoverability and realization of assets and classification of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue in operation we expect we will require additional capital to meet our long term operating requirements we expect to raise additional capital through among other things the sale of equity or debt securities but we cannot guarantee that we will be able to achieve the same            results of operations — three months ended december   as compared to december      revenues we generated  and zero in revenues and zero

and all instances of fraud disclosure controls and procedures no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the disclosure controls and procedures are met further the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits must be considered relative to their
