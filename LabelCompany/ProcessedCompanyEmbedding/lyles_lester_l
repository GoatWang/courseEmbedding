members   chairman lyles letterchairman lyles letter lester l lyles  general usaf ret  chairman of the board family strong dear fellow members in this report youll read just a few of the stories from the usaa family these members face their own unique challenges and hopes for the future and — like you — they share a connection to the military as well as a desire to do the right things for their families and our country my own connection to military service — and ultimately to usaa — started with a –year–old young man who enlisted in the army during world war ii my father never talked much about his military service and only after he died did i find out he was part of the nd fighter group — the legendary tuskegee airmen my fathers military–inspired values of dedication to family and hard work were nevertheless a model i tried to follow when i joined the air force usaa in many ways is like an extended family imbued with the values mutual support and camaraderie that are a big part of military life that photo of a young lester lyles is a reminder that i was a part of the usaa family long before i became a general and usaa took good care of me in  we welcomed new family members with the same care grew stronger as an organization and prepared for a new chapter in our history when service members veterans and their families decide to become usaa members its a cause for celebration because it means we can continue to fulfill our mission to facilitate the financial security of military families in  many new members joined the usaa family — as total membership reached  million by the end of the year we hope they like  of our members intend to stay members for life as we welcome more members were working hard to keep delivering the industrys best service although were not perfect were proud that  gave usaa the highest possible marks for service in our overall member satisfaction surveys and usaa continues to be recognized in our industries for service and customer satisfaction for instance usaa received the  customer experience index award of excellence from forrester research inc which also ranked usaas bank credit card and insurance businesses no  in their respective industries property and casualty ratings excellent service a growing family and careful financial management usually translate into positive financial results and  was no exception usaa has never been stronger financially  — or better prepared to help our members usaa was one of only a handful of companies to receive the highest possible ratings for its property and casualty insurance group from all three major rating agencies moodys standard  poors and am best as members of the board of directors we watch these developments closely our role is to oversee the strategic direction of usaa and make sure that human financial and other resources are in place to meet our objectives and fulfill our mission that includes assessing the performance of our top executives and ensuring continuity of leadership last year president and ceo joe robles jr announced he would retire effective feb   after more than seven years as ceo and  in leadership at usaa first let me say that usaa is better for having had joe as its leader from helping open the doors to membership to all who have received a discharge type of honorable to leading veteranhiring efforts promoting innovation and helping navigate usaa financially through tumultuous economic conditions joe has been a transformational ceo by any measure today usaa is more focused than ever on putting our membership first in relentless pursuit of our mission and being a best place to work for our employees thank you joe for your exceptional leadership this year the board conducted an exhaustive internal and external search for our next ceo applying the care and rigor usaa members deserve the process ended in august with the naming of –year usaa employee and air force veteran stuart parker as our next president and ceo as a board we are ensuring that stuart has the resources and support he and his leadership team need to continue taking care of our members and fulfilling the mission the baton passes but what started nearly  years ago when army officers decided to insure one another continues thank you for your membership and for letting usaa be a part of your familys story sincerely lester l lyles general usaf retchairman of the board an organization often reflects the salient characteristics of its leaders with joe robles serving as president and ceo for the past seven years our members and employees are fortunate indeed whats amazing to those who have known and worked with him is not what he has done but who he is as a person and thats a leader of uncommon humility genuine

writing your own code to parse the rdf dumps its often more efficient to read directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in
