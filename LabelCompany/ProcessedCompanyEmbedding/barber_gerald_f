bookreportconference proceeding › conference contribution  citations abstract the viscosity of polymers can be reduced at typical molding stresses and temperatures by the addition of a small amount ≤  percent by weight of a micronscale solid although many solids may exhibit some effect on polymer viscosity naturally occurring nontoxic amorphous aluminosilicate glass is the only solid that is effective over a wide range of polymer compositions and temperatures while at the same time having no demonstrable effect on nucleation of semicrystalline polymers extensive research on polypropylene used as a representative polymer indicates that rheologic properties described herein are dependent on particle composition size range and concentration the effect of the solid on the liquid polymer can thus be selected depending on the chosen particle characteristics for most finishing applications the practical benefit of the solid additive includes increased productivity but may also include lower molding temperature increased mechanical properties of the finished polymer improved dispersion of additives and better fit and finish of the article original languageenglish ustitle of host
