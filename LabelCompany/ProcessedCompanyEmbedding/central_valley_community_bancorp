often called the ‘mother of all ratios’ return on equity tells you how much capital is created in percentage terms for the amount committed by a shareholder to a company but there are multiple other aspects to consider before drawing a conclusion view our latest analysis for central valley community bancorp breaking down roe — the mother of all ratios roe is one of the most popular ratios to calculate the profitability of a company the ratio is arrived by putting net earnings in the numerator and shareholders’ equity in the denominatorany roe north of  implying  cents return on every dollar invested is favourable for any investor but investors seek multiple assets to diversify risk and an industryspecific comparison makes more sense to achieve the goal of choosing the best among a given lot return on equity  net profit ÷ shareholders equity roe above the cost of equity estimate indicates value creation which apparently is the only reason shares rally the cost of equity can be

debtequity profile rapidly rising debt compared to equity while profit margin and asset turnover underperform raises a red flag on the roe it’s important as a company can inflate its roe by consistently increasing debt despite weak operating performance cvcy’s debt to equity ratio currently stands at  investors should be cautious about any sharp change in this ratio more so if it’s due to increasing debt roe – it’s not just another ratio while roe can be calculated through a very simple calculation investors should look at various ratios by breaking it down and how each of them affects the return to understand the strengths and weakness of a company it’s one of the few ratios which stitches together performance metrics from the income statement and the balance sheet what are
