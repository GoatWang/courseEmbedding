carbo ceramics wilks brothers companies have opened the coffin  carbo ceramics inc nysecrr  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»carbo ceramics wilks brothers companies have opened the coffinapr   about carbo ceramics crr long player longshort equity value special situations contrariansummarywilks family companies loaned the company money for interest and an option currently worth nothing to buy more than  shares wilks family companies also own nearly  of the common stock  so they will benefit from the future success of the company two directors loaned the company  million have modified their loans in conformance with the wilks family companies loan agreements sales are projected to increase all year led by increasing new product sales the company finances have stabilized enough to take bankruptcy off the table  the long term loans have pik provisions to minimize cash outflow carbo ceramics crr has had a rough couple of years first commodity prices declined this limited new drilling activity then operators began to take a far shorter view of well life the focus on payback and some minimal return in exchange for premature proppant crushing has taken precedence the continuing large production improvements continue to obscure the need for expensive ceramic proppant so the company has launched several new product lines as its cash flow dried up its once proud balance sheet in tatters with some actual long term debt so along comes the wilks brothers with a lot of cash and a deal for the company this deal will probably save it from the predicted extinction that mr market had it mind two directors had previously loaned the company  million later the company obtained click on  rd quarter q a term loan but this put management in the position of financing the launch and development of a lot of new products while paying back a term loan since cash flow had dried up from the collapse of the ceramic proppant market this financing arrangement was definitely not acceptable the new products could have failed from a lack of sufficient financial support so wilks brothers to the rescue the wilks brothers founded frac tech and sold the company for about  billion so they have hundreds of millions to invest for the right price best of all they understand the business of carbo ceramics far better than most lenders could if the deal is done correctly this could be a match made in financial heaven houston march   prnewswire  carbo ceramics inc nyse crr announced today that it has refinanced its existing bank debt with a debt placement with the wilks brothers llc the new debt placement includes an initial funding of  million plus an additional  million to be released after certain conditions have been satisfied the loan bears interest at  and gives carbo the option to make paymentinkind or pik at  interest during the first two years of the loan the loan is secured by all accounts receivable inventory cash in certain accounts domestic distribution assets residing on owned property plant facilities and equipment in marshfield wisconsin and toomsboro georgia and certain real property interests in mines and minerals the loan does not contain any financial maintenance covenants and cannot be repaid during the first three years without making the lender whole for interest over the entire remaining term of the loan as part of the transaction carbo issued a warrant exchangeable for  shares of carbo common stock upon payment of an exercise price of  per share of the total loan amount of  million  million has been applied to pay off carbos bank debt and the excess is expected to be used for working capital and general corporate purposes the loan shown above has stabilized the company finances and provided the commpany with an avenue for additional funding if that funding is needed the directors who loaned the company another  million have also agreed to pik under certain circumstances as part of this deal source carbo ceramics march  proxy statement not only did the wilks brothers lend the company money but they also have a  stake in the equity of the company plus the wilks companies received an option to purchase more than  more shares this option has to be approved at a shareholders meeting though with management and the wilks brothers voting in favor of the proposal the proposal appears certain to succeed more importantly that option is worth nothing at current prices but should the stock eventually bounce back to  about a third of its previous high price that option could be worth more than  million this would provide the lender with a tidy return on the loan all of the directors own another  of the company between the loans advanced to the company and the common equity stakes held by the major players there is a lot of motivation for this company to succeed both the two directors and the wilks family companies are highly motivated to having the company execute its future plans successfully the launching of several new products has already begun many more are in various development stages the first sales increase has been reported in quite some time management for the first time in awhile is projecting a double digit sales increase for the year this increase will be led by a significant increase in the sales of new products for the first time in a while the company appears to be relatively secure the new products could fail but the presence of the wilks brothers adds a new margin of safety to the situation the stock prices has retreated since the original news of a sales increase for the fourth quarter compared to the third quarter of  was announced but the worst is probably over for this stock however the ride back could be very bumpy until some new products are well established still the company has some game changing new products that are targeting some very large markets some fairly sophisticated investors with deep pockets think these new products have a decent chance of success the guard line of products for example has targeted some potentially hundreds of million dollars markets there are several other product lines that could eventually grow the company much larger than it was at the height of the oil industry boom the latest price was approximately  per common share near that price the stock appears to be a very attractive speculation on the success of the new products the wilks family constitutes some very sophisticated investors who have made a large vote of confidence in this company so while the progress will be irregular there is an excellent chance of a return of ten times the current price over the next decade timing that return could be very tough but investors like the wilks family do not get involved for small returns the markets targeted already exist and the new products launched by the company appear to have some solid advantages plus this company has developed many of its products with industry partners in fact some like the kryptosphere hd were developed at the request of major companies such as chevron for use in ultra deep wells in the gulf of mexico some details of the development process are at various places on the company website using industry partners often helps with the new product introduction partnering with companies such as chevron gives the new product an early visibility that will be a marketing advantage plus many industry concerns are covered during the development process through customer input now all that is needed is time the financing is now in place to give management that time the new product lines give this company several chances to win big for shareholders disclaimer i am not an investment advisor and this article is not meant to be a recommendation of the purchase or sale

centers antilgbt groups and organizations affiliated with alec pinitinstapaperpocketemailprint   cisco chamber of commerce farris and dan wilks principals in frac tech and listed among the worlds richest people by forbes flank their father voy wilks at the  awards banquet of the cisco chamber of commerce this article was produced by and originally published by right wing watch the blog of people for the american way   last june presidential hopefuls rand paul and ted cruz traveled to iowa for an event convened by david lane a political operative who uses pastors to mobilize conservative christian voters  lane is a christiannation extremist who believes the bible should be a primary textbook in america’s public schools and that any politician who disagrees should be voted out lane’s events are usually closed to the media but he has given special access to the christian broadcasting network’s sympathetic david brody brody’s coverage of the iowa event included short video clips of comments by brothers farris and dan wilks who were identified only as members of lane’s pastors and pews group cbn’s brody reported “the wilks brothers worry that america’s declining morals will especially hurt the younger generation so they’re using the riches that the lord has blessed them with to back specific goals” one of those goals may be david lane’s insistence that politicians make the bible a primary textbook in public schools here’s dan wilks speaking to brody “i just think we have to make people aware you know and bring the bible back into the school and start teaching our kids at a younger age and uh you know and focus on the younger generation” and here’s farris “they’re being taught the other ideas the gay agenda every day out in the world so we have to stand up and explain to them that that’s not real that’s not proper it’s not right” that was the first time we had heard of the billionaire wilks brothers who have become generous donors to rightwing politicians and republican party committees while both farris and dan have given to conservative groups and candidates it is older brother farris whose foundation has become a source of massive donations to religious right groups and to the koch brothers’ political network farris also funds a network of “pregnancy centers” that refuse on principle to talk to single women about contraception married women need to check with their husband and pastor like david barton farris thinks conservative economics are grounded in the bible like mitt romney he says people shouldn’t vote for politicians who promise “free this free that” like any number of religious right leaders he saw barack obama’s reelection as a harbinger of the end times and he believes god will punish america for embracing homosexuality unlike all of them he’s on the list of the world’s richest people fracking billionaires dan and farris wilks became successful working in and then running the masonry business that was started by their father they have now turned the company over to the next generation of wilks men but dan and farris really hit the big time when they got in on the ground floor with fracking the controversial natural gas drilling technique that has boomed over the past decade  the fracking boom has produced a surge in wealthy texans in  the wilks brothers created frac tech which produced equipment used in fracking or in industry parlance “well stimulation services”  in may  dan and farris sold frac tech to a group of investors led by singapore’s sovereign wealth fund for  billion their share was reportedly  percent of that total and they showed up on the  forbes  list of the wealthiest americans with an estimated net worth of  billion each  the most recent forbes list put their estimated wealth at  billion each in our gilded age that puts them near the bottom of the forbes  and barely gets them into the top  in texas but you can still do an awful lot with  billion the wilks brothers have gone on a landbuying spree out west amassing huge holdings in montana idaho texas kansas and colorado in december  the billings gazette reported that they had amassed more than  acres in montana or more than  square miles more recent reports say they own more than  acres in the state among their purchases was the historic acre n bar ranch which had been listed for  million  the brothers reportedly started building an airstrip that summer across from the n bar ranch headquarters to make travel to their property on their passenger corporate jet a little easier the wilks brothers have proposed a land swap with the bureau of land management to consolidate their holdings last month their attorney said they were “blindsided” when blm said it would not trade the acre durfee hills after hunters complained about losing access to the land and its elk in january  they bought a nearly acre ranch in idaho which brought their total in that state to almost  acres  in  farris was reported to have paid  million for what was then the most expensive skiaccessible home in the history of snowmass village colorado  an aspen newspaper reported in  that dan owned two homes in aspen one worth  million and another worth  million at the end of  they bought the advancial tower a story skyscraper in dallas reportedly appraised at  million and last august the fort worth startelegram reported that the wilks brothers had bought  acres of land in a business park in southlake texas farris also reportedly paid to have a “world class” recording studio installed in his squarefoot home and to have his church’s audiovisual system similarly upgraded members of the wilks family have been philanthropists in their hometown over the years funding for example a community center and mobile emergency command post for local fire departments   more recently they have distributing their wealth in support of rightwing causes and conservative politicians according to forbes dan has six children farris has  another foundation for the far right the wilks brothers and their wives have stashed a sizeable chunk of money in charitable foundations farris and his wife joann created the thirteen foundation while dan and his wife staci started heavenly father’s foundation the thirteen foundation has become a major funder to religious right organizations and to rightwing political outfits that are part of the koch brother’s network in  farris and joann each put  million into the thirteen foundation and they started writing huge checks in  and  the last year for which giving records are publicly available the foundation gave away more than  million here’s where much of it went   media revolution ministries online for life

organizations that are fighting legal equality for lgbt people access to contraception and abortion services for women and promoting the tea party’s vision of a federal government that is constitutionally forbidden from protecting american workers consumers and communities by regulating corporate behavior  american majority the franklin center the heritage foundation and the state policy networks are all part of the koch brothers’ rightwing political network promoting policy attacks on public employees and their unions outsourcing public resources for private profit privatization of public education and more the franklin center closely allied to the american legislative exchange council and other rightwing groups produces and supports ideological advocacy sites that that it pretends is “nonpartisan” journalism american majority trains and supports tea party activist networks the heritage foundation is a rightwing propaganda behemoth masquerading as a think tank it promotes religious right social conservatism and tea party antigovernment ideology arguing that the two are “indivisible” the state policy network comprises miniheritage foundations – rightwing “think tanks” at the state level that work closely with alec and rightwing lawmakers the thirteen foundation’s gifts are a boon to some of the most extreme religious right groups in the country among the recipients the liberty counsel a legal advocacy group affiliated with liberty university is home to rightwing legal activist mat staver and the increasingly unhinged matt barber liberty counsel promotes extreme antiobama and antigay rhetoric warning that the country is descending into religious tyranny and on the verge of revolution  staver and barber support laws criminalizing homosexuality and call the obama administration’s opposition to such laws in other countries “immoral” the family research council designated an antigay hate group by the southern poverty law center hosts the annual values voter summit the annual family reunion for farright religious and political groups and rightwing politicians frc and its leader tony perkins oppose equality for lgbt americans and promote the myth of antichristian persecution in the us focus on the family founded by james dobson is one of the largest religious right groups in the country earlier this year vice president tim goeglein called gay rights movement “one of the great threats to our religious liberty” president jim daly is reportedly scheduled to speak at the world congress of families’ summit scheduled to be held in moscow in september wallbuilders promotes the historical revisionism of “historian” david barton whose claims have been widely discredited but who remains influential within the religious right and the gop in addition to his “christian nation” history barton argues that the bible opposes the minimum wage progressive taxation capital gains taxes the estate tax and unions and collective bargaining see the section on the war on women below for information about antichoice organizations on the list other gifts supported prime time christian broadcasting inc which runs god’s learning channel “a satellite network dedicated to bringing the gospel of the kingdom into the entire world and teaching everyone about the torah and the true roots of christianity“ the wounded warrior project and a number of local churches that seem to be affiliated with the church at which farris is an elder one gift that seems like an outlier was  to the center for human rights and constitutional law which funds legal services for the poor advocates for immigration reform and filed a lawsuit on behalf of a binational samesex couple farris’s brother dan and his wife staci each gave  million to their heavenly father’s foundation according to the group’s   form that year the foundation reported  million in income but only  in disbursements mostly to the mountain top church in their hometown of cisco  with smaller amounts to a pregnancy center called the open door  and to the american diabetes association  its  contributions were primarily to several churches but also included ministries that provide meals to the poor a fiveyear pledge to a local domestic violence crisis center  to the open door pregnancy center  million to a drug and alcohol treatment center whose th anniversary celebration in may featured mike huckabee and intriguingly  to the eastland county district attorney’s office to cover “budget shortage” of course individual contributions that wilks family members make to advocacy organizations are not publicly reported in politics paying to play the wilks brothers made a bit of a splash in montana when it was revealed that they were the top donors to  republican legislative candidates in the state  a february  report by the national institute on money in state politics found that dan and farris wilks and their wives “donated to more than  candidates all republicans and generally gave the maximum contribution allowed by law to legislative candidates  for a general election” the report said that  percent of montana republican legislators got contributions from the wilkses ap noted that all bills aimed at regulating fracking in the  legislature were killed by republicanled committees according to the institute  of the statelevel candidates the wilks family supported won— legislators and attorney general tim fox the wilkses also gave heavily to dennis rehberg a former republican us congressman from montana who gave up his seat to mount an unsuccessful challenge against sen jon tester in  and to steven daines the republican who won the house seat vacated by rehberg and who is now running to for us senate  collectively dan and farris and their wives gave the rehberg and daines campaigns each  in  with another  going to the rehberg victory committee a joint fundraising committee that funneled money to rehberg’s campaign and the national republican senatorial committee farris and joann have together given  toward steve daines’s  reelection their political giving has not been limited to montana in texas according to state campaign finance records the brothers each gave  to texans for rick perry in  farris also gave  to state rep stefani carter the first republican african american woman to serve in the state house farris and joann also gave  to the failed supreme court campaign of steve smith  last year perry announced he would not run for a fourth term as governor earlier this year texas attorney general greg abbott who is running for governor reported nearly  in inkind contributions from farris and dan wilks for use of an airplane farris also gave  in january to the texas home school coalition pac this year in the election for california’s th assembly district dan staci and farris wilks have given thousands to the campaign of rob mccoy a conservative evangelical pastor who is also backed by rand paul rick perry and mike huckabee in the june  primary the wilksbacked mccoy came in second place to democrat jacqui irwin a city councilwoman from thousand oaks beating the more moderate republican candidate businessman mario de la piedra irwin and mccoy will face off in the general election during the  election cycle according to the federal election commission’s database the brothers and their wives together contributed  to the romney victory committee a joint fundraising committee benefitting the romney campaign and the republican party  joann also contributed  to the faith family freedom fund a “soft money” fund run by a former family research council executive and housed in frc’s washington dc building the fund makes independent expenditures for or against candidates in  it spent in support of todd akin george allen steve king and other rightwing candidates and against claire mccaskill tim kaine barack obama and other democratic candidates in  farris gave the national republican congressional committee  and he gave  to the national rifle association’s political victory fund between  and  in  farris gave nevada senate candidate and tea party darling sharron angle  and in  he gave  to the mccainpalin victory committee wilks and the war on women as kate sheppard reported last august for mother jones the thirteen foundation’s  gift to life dynamics a texasbased antiabortion group funded a campaign to massmail dvds to lawyers encouraging them to sue abortion clinics into oblivion crooks and liars blogger karoli has noted that life dynamics “actively engages in espionage against organizations serving women” and operates campaigns to harass doctors who perform abortions  the more than  million that the thirteen foundation gave to media revolution ministries in  allowed for a vast expansion of the group which had only an  budget the year before the group also known as online for life says it “implements cuttingedge internet and traditional marketing outreaches to connect with abortiondetermined women and men” in other words they try to “intercept” women who search for abortion information and send them to antichoice “pregnancy centers”   those funds may have been used to help “pregnancy centers” buy ads on search terms like “abortion clinics” to “intercept” women who went online  naral prochoice america cited online for life’s google ads  when it announced in april that  its investigations had led google to take down ads from crisis pregnancy centers that violated the search engine’s rules against deceptive advertising the thirteen foundation also gave  in  to care net a network of christian “pregnancy centers” whose “standards of affiliation” include this requirement the pregnancy center does not recommend provide or refer single women for contraceptives married women seeking contraceptive information should be urged to seek counsel along with their husbands from their pastor and physician the wilkses are also backers of open door a local christian “crisis pregnancy center” to which the thirteen foundation gave more than  in  farris and joann have also been benefactors of texas right to life the wilks worldview with the exception of the brief interaction with cbn’s david brody the wilks brothers have generally been mediashy but the worldview of farris the older of the two brothers whose foundation is backing the religious right and tea party movements is quite clearly revealed in the sermons he preaches in addition to his business ventures farris the older brother is also a pastor at the church founded by his father the assembly of yahweh th day  the church’s doctrine seems to be an amalgam based on the elder wilks’ anachronistic interpretations of the bible it combines biblical literalism with a heavy emphasis on the old testament the church celebrates its sabbath on saturday follows the dietary rules laid down in leviticus and celebrates jewish holidays but not “the religious holidays of the gentiles” which include “christmas easter valentine’s day white sunday good friday and halloween”  i had to look up white sunday which is a traditional samoan holiday there’s a significant samoan community in texas women may not speak during worship the church’s doctrinal points align with the religious right on many policy issues abortion is deemed “murder” including for pregnancies resulting from rape and incest homosexuality is “a serious crime—a very grievous sin” a number of farris wilks’ sermons can be heard through his church’s website in november  he was pretty despondent about the reelection of barack obama  “i do believe that our country died that tuesday night to all that’s honorable that’s good that’s ambitious and that has justice—the old way of life that we will take care of ourselves we will be selfsufficient as much as we are able the pride in pulling your own weight or paddling your own canoe”  the sermon includes smallgovernment quotes from thomas jefferson antisocialist quotes from winston churchill and a bootstraps approach to poverty “the best way to get out of poverty is to go to work” he says “that is one of the simplest ways to make it go away” wilks said he was “refreshed” by biblical texts about the end times speculating that the election went the way it did “because maybe it’s time to wrap up some things maybe it’s time to move on to the next one thousand years” and he warned of persecution against christians i will tell you now that you need to be ready for a little bit more scoffing and ridicule than maybe we’ve experienced in the past because i think not only us but the christian community at large is coming under attack not only in america but throughout the world  we see it on the late night talk shows one man in particular and some time you think man it would almost be nice if the judgment would happen so we can see what would happen to those people…for the things they are saying which are so vulgar and violent against yahweh…his mercy must be inexhaustible to put up with that… several months later after his participation in the david lane event in iowa wilks was feeling motivated to do more to impact the future of america in a july   sermon he referred to claims made by discredited religious right “historian” david barton about the country’s founders and barton’s assertion that many of our laws come from the scriptures  and in a sermon he described as a “study of sodom and gomorrah” he laid out his belief that the country is facing a clear choice as most of you probably know by now we are in a battle for our society will we follow the secular religion of man him being supreme and evolving or will we submit to elohim who has the right to give us laws and commandments to follow since he is the one who created us who is in charge is it man or is it our creator he read scripture passages that referred to the story of god’s destruction of sodom and gomorrah in what he said was punishment for “base and demented” sexual practices the tolerance of which in america “could bring about the end of our nation” he warned that allowing samesex couples to get married would soon lead to bestiality being promoted and accepted “i do believe we live in a nation that will start to vomit some of its people out” he warned after reading a passage from isaiah in which the land and its inhabitants are cursed for their depravity he said i fear that that is where we are as a nation we have been in the blessed part of our nation but i think we’re coming to the point now…we’re going to reap what we have sown and what we have sown has not been good…what it says here that the earth lies polluted under its inhabitants think of all the murder that has happened in this country…all the babies that have been murdered…think of all the perversions in the realm of sexual perversion of all kinds…all the breaking of yahweh’s covenant…and so you recognize that at some point yahweh’s going to say it’s time to wrap up… it’s time to move on to a kingdom of people that want to serve me that want to be redeemed that want salvation…we have to draw some lines in the sand for ourselves… he also mocked environmentalism and the effort to save certain animals or the polar caps “we didn’t create the earth so how can we save it”  when you realize that yahweh is in control “it’s much simpler” he says “you can turn over some of those responsibilities to him” maybe the melting of polar ice is us “getting a little scorched here” as a message from god later last summer he returned to the sodom and gomorrah theme denouncing the gay pride movement as an example of lust and defiance of authority described in the bible “what we’re fighting against today is not a sexual revolution particular to our own enlightened age but it’s a return to prechristian pagan sexual immorality or perversion” and farris sounded like the most extreme antigay religious right leaders in portraying gay people as child predators  if we all took on this lifestyle all humanity would perish in one generation…so this lifestyle is a predatorial lifestyle in that they need your children and straight people having kids to fulfill their sexual habits they can’t do it by their self they want your children…but we’re in a war for our children they want your children so what will you teach your children a strong family is the last defense and he said they won’t stop predicting that pedophilia and bestiality will soon be legal just before christmas he preached on spiritual apathy in america he warned that apathy is closing church doors in america just as liberalism and secularism he railed against people forgetting the sabbath and spending too much time on entertainment he warned that god would lift his “mantle of protection” against the us because it is no longer protecting the family earlier this year farris preached on “government that we can believe in” in that sermon he proclaimed that he loves america but that all nations fail at some point the founding fathers did a good job he said but the nation’s cornerstones are now crumbling “it’s because of the lack of morality the lack of continuity of one like belief in our heavenly father—those are the things that are bringing our nation to its knees” but this sermon focused less on sexual immorality and more on the threat of socialism yahweh he preached is “someone who respects private ownership” and the torah is “set up on the free enterprise system” he said “there are only two basic ideas in the whole world”—and those are free enterprise and socialism the us he warned is “inching closer to socialism” you either have more government or more freedom the more money taken from you in taxes the fewer choices you have in life wilks said he acknowledged that he has a “personal stake” in this saying he pays a “huge amount” in taxes he urged congregants not to vote for politicians who promise “free this free that” saying that would lead us to become one of the poor nations of the world “yahweh never intended for us as a people to be afraid and reliant on government” an answer to prayer televangelist james robison recently told participants in a tea party unity conference call that he is praying for a merger of the tea party and the religious right it’s enough to make one wonder where robison has been for the past few years there has always been a overlap between the tea party and the religious right movements and since the early days of the antiobama tea party organizing rightwing strategists like ralph reed and rick scarborough have been trying to more fully merge the organizing energies of the two movements into an electoral machine  groups like the family research council and heritage foundation have worked hard to limit the influence of libertarians in the conservative movement by portraying social and economic conservatism as “indivisible” while republican activists like “historian” david barton have claimed that there is a biblical underpinning for the farright’s antitax antiregulation antigovernment agenda maybe the miracle robison was really looking for was a big pile of cash to fund his next project in which case the answer to his prayers might be found in the person of farris wilks preacher rightwing activist
