news release for release  thursday january   contacts  nancy a condon     nasd regulation charges josephthal  co inc and top execs with fraud and unfair dealing with customers washington dc—nasd regulation inc today announced that it has issued a complaint charging josephthal  co inc new york ny dan d purjes chief executive officer paul h fitzgerald managing director of capital markets and matthew i balk former senior managing director for equity marketing with fraud and unfair business practices with investors in connection with security sales according to nasd regulation’s complaint in late may  josephthal violated federal securities laws and nasd conduct rules during a massive sales effort aimed at selling from their inventory over  million common shares of victormaxx technologies inc vmax as the underwriter of victormaxx’ initial public offering and market maker for the stock josephthal supported the stock from august  until the beginning of may  by midmay  the firm had suffered a loss of between  and  million on the inventory held in the stock in an effort to cut its losses purjes fitzgerald and balk decided to sell the position to the firm’s customers however it is alleged that the firm’s representatives had shown little interest in retailing the stock until midmay when to induce the sales force to move the stock purjes fitzgerald and balk paid them commissions of about  percent of an investor’s total purchase of the stock as a result from may may   the josephthal sales force aggressively recommended victormaxx to its customers during these  business days josephthal brokers sold almost  shares in over  customer transactions at an average price of  per share sales during the twoweek effort represented nearly  percent of the tradable shares of the common stock josephthal remained a market maker in the security throughout the fraudulent sales effort shortly after josephthal sold its position the market price of victormaxx tumbled within a month it was below a dollar where it has remained since on october   it was delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market and by the fourth quarter of  the price ranged from  to  thus an investor in victormaxx who purchased during the may sales effort and held onto that stock for no more than  days would have incurred more than a  percent loss according to the complaint in violation of the firm’s obligation of fair dealing at no time did it disclose to its customers its plan to quickly dispose of its losing inventory position through a massive retail sales effort fueled by an extremely high special sales credit to its sales force the complaint also notes that just days before the start of the victormaxx sales effort josephthal and purjes had settled with the nasd a case with almost identical violations nasd regulation did not allege that victormaxx inc which is listed on the otc bulletin boardsm knew that josephthal was selling off its stock in the marketplace or engaged in any wrongdoing the issuance of a disciplinary complaint represents the initiation of a formal proceeding by nasd regulation in which findings as to the allegations in the complaint have not been made and does not represent a decision as to any of the allegations contained in the complaint because this complaint is unadjudicated the respondents should be contacted before drawing any conclusion regarding the allegations in the complaint under nasd rules the individuals and the firm named in the complaint can file a response and request a hearing before an nasd regulation disciplinary panel possible sanctions include a fine suspension bar or expulsion from the nasd this matter was investigated by nasd regulation’s district office in denver colorado investors can obtain the disciplinary record of any nasdregistered broker or brokerage firm by calling   or by sending an email through nasd regulation’s web site nasd regulation oversees all us stockbrokers and brokerage firms with

matthew mcconaughey talks hair loss american actor matthew mcconaughey is best known for films such as how to lose a guy in  days and the lincoln lawyer you may have also heard the rumours that have been circling for some time with regards to his apparent hair loss and subsequent regrowth pull the plug on transplant rumours the texas native has been rumoured to have had hair plugs otherwise known as fue or follicular unit extraction a surgical procedure where ‘plugs’ of hair are extracted from the back of the scalp where male pattern hair loss does not effect and transplanted onto the areas of hair loss atop the scalp this is the most common form of hair transplant as unlike strip surgery where a strip of skin is removed from the back of the head it leaves no scarring however the actor revealed in the march issue of elle magazine that he has in fact been using a hair loss treatment to get his hair back whilst we can’t comment on the effectiveness of the  year old’s chosen treatment we do know that a medically backed hair loss treatment programme should always be the first method to try before a hair transplant is attempted moony advice the actor also had some other interesting advice although we’re a bit sceptical about its effectiveness he explained “if you want your hair to be thicker cut it when the moon is about to be full – a heavy full waxing moon” it is generally recommended that a treatment plan that contains at least one of the medications licensed by the mhra and approved by the fda for the treatment of hair loss is tried for six months before a transplant is considered many men believe that a transplant is the only effective way to tackle hair loss but by using a plan containing propecia and minoxidil hair can often be regrown and the natural progression of hair loss halted  treatment before transplant finasteride mg – a drug commonly known by its first original brand name propecia – and minoxidil work in different ways so are highly complementary when taken together finasteride mg helps to stop all over thinning of scalp hair by blocking the effects of powerful androgen dht which causes follicle miniaturisation in those genetically predisposed to pattern hair loss minoxidil is a vasodilating substance that can take care of a receding hairline and other areas of stubborn loss such as a thinning crown when recommended formulations of high strength minoxidil are applied directly to the affected areas either once or twice per day as recommended of course mcconaughey can combine his hair loss treatment with many other complementary additions that combine to create a comprehensive hair care and regrowth plan for instance the fda cleared lasercomb is a device that emits a low power laser to stimulate deep into scalp and encourage a faster rate of regrowth there is also the option of taking the supplement hair vitalics which ensures that even a busy actor like mcconaughey is getting the right vitamins and minerals for optimum hair growth the belgravia centre the belgravia centre is the leader in hair loss treatment in the uk with two clinics based in central london if you are worried
