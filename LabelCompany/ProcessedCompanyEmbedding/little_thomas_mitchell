them further and further away from the originals afghani and durban poison are popular landraces that are usually easy to find around town and i’ve come across maui wowie and hindu kush from time to

childhood by his uncle thomas livingstone of parkhall stirlingshire on the death of his uncle he joined the british army in portugal as a volunteer at the age of sixteen on  june  at the age of nineteen he received his first commission as nd lieutenant in the st battalion th rifles later the rifle brigade  royal green jackets utilising his skills as a draughtsman of outstanding ability he was occasionally employed in the quartermastergeneral’s department under sir george murray he was present at the storming of the fortresses of ciudad rodrigo badajos and san sebastian as well as the battles of salamanca and the pyrenees subsequently he would receive the military general service medal with bars for each of these engagements when the war was over murray obtained permission from the treasury for an officer to reside in spain and portugal for four years to complete the sketches of the battlefields which had been begun during the war for the military depot lieutenant mitchell was selected as a person well qualified in every respect to aid in the accomplishment of the undertaking the first duty allotted to him was the completing of such sketches begun during the war as had remained unfinished and adding to these several other important surveys for the execution of which it had been impossible to allot officers whilst operations were in progress in the field but in the summer of  the continuance of the disbursements made by government for the undertaking became doubtful so he was called home he then devoted himself to the second part of his task which was that of making finished drawings from the materials compiled by himself and from other documents of ascertained authenticity but with the cessation of the government allowances he had to stop this work on  june  during his posting in spain and portugal he married mary blunt daughter of general richard blunt in lisbon and gained promotion to a company in the th regiment with the reductions in the military establishment of the country which followed the withdrawing of the army of occupation from france captain mitchell was placed on halfpay it was not until a lapse of several years whilst mitchell was in london between  –  that the work was completed the finished drawings were published by the london geographer james wyld in  wyld’s atlas containing the principle battles sieges and affairs of the peninsular war together with a memoir annexed to it consisted of a text of the movement orders prepared at the same time by murray of almost unimpeachable accuracy it is the prime source for the topography of the war in  with the support of sir george murray mitchell became assistant surveyor general of new south wales with the right to succeed john oxley oxley died the following year and on  may  mitchell became surveyor general in this post he did much to improve the quality and accuracy of surveying – a vital task in a colony where huge tracts of land were being opened up and sold to new settlers one of the first roads surveyed under his leadership was the great north road built by convict labour between  and  linking sydney to the hunter region the great south road now replaced by the hume highway also convictbuilt linked sydney and goulburn he kept a record of his progress in roads and public works in new south wales to  including sketches and plans of sydney emu plains the blue mountains victoria pass roads to bathurst wisemans ferry and indigenous australians as surveyor general mitchell also completed maps and plans of sydney including darling point point piper the city and port jackson in  he was commissioned to survey a map of the nineteen counties the map he produced was done with such skill and accuracy that he was awarded a knighthood first expeditionedit in  a runaway convict george clarke who had lived with aborigines in the area for several years claimed that a large river called kindur flowed northwest from the liverpool ranges in new south wales to the sea charles sturt believed that the murraydarling system formed the main river system of new south wales and mitchell wanted to prove sturt wrong mitchell formed an expedition consisting of himself assistant surveyor george boyle white and  convicts who were promised remission for good conduct mitchell took  bullocks three heavy drays three light carts and  horses for supplies and transport and set out on  november  to investigate the claim on reaching wollombi in the hunter valley the local assistant surveyor heneage finch expressed a desire to join the expedition he had established his credentials by surveying a route from sydney to wollombi so mitchell approved his request provided he obtained extra supplies and men and followed along later the expedition continued northward climbed the liverpool range on  december and made quirindi on  december shortly afterwards finch arrived but inexplicably had not brought provisions so mitchell immediately sent him back to get them by  december the expedition had reached wallamoul station near tamworth the northern extent of white settlement at the time mitchell continued his northward push into new territory taking local aboriginal guides of the kamilaroi people to assist in finding water and to express his peaceful intentions in early january  he was in the vicinity of the present town of narrabri reached the gwydir river in midjanuary and found the barwon by the end of the month where he set up camp mitchell left the main party and made a reconnaissance down the barwon until he found its junction with the gwydir after mitchell rejoined the main camp finch arrived with tragic news he had been travelling with three convicts and provisions but because of a shortage of water had separated leaving two men behind while he attempted to locate the main expedition this he failed to do and on the second day returned to discover that the campsite had been ransacked supplies scattered and beneath the wreckage were two dead men the immediate effect was that mitchell decided to abandon the expedition and return south the party reached the gwydir on  february and was near the site of the attack on  february mitchell buried the two bodies salvaged some equipment and once back at wallamoul placed white in charge of the main party while mitchell returned hastily to sydney he was satisfied that there was no truth about a river kindur claimed by clarke fourteen years after the attack mitchell revealed that the convicts had indulged in sexual relations with aboriginal women second expeditionedit mitchells next expedition was in  the purpose was to explore the path of the darling river from where sturt had turned back in  to where it joined the murray river there were  men in the party with james larmer assistant surveyor as second in command richard cunningham colonial botanist and  other men the main party under larmer left sydney on  april to rendezvous with mitchell at boree near the township of orange the expedition passed quickly into territory known to be occupied by wiradjuri people as mitchell made his way along the south bank of the bogan river on  april  richard cunningham wandered away from the party while looking for botanical specimens some hours later he was reported missing the party halted and frantically searched for  days coming across his horse that had died with the saddle still on they followed cunninghams tracks along the bogan for  miles until they disappeared near an encampment of aborigines at the camp they found the skirt of cunninghams coat and fragments of a map he was carrying his fate was not known until the expedition had returned after a fruitless search for cunningham mitchell decided to continue the expedition he followed the bogan river downstream sometimes employing aboriginal guides with the usual payment being a tomahawk after several days and about – miles of travel a brief confrontation between a member of the party and an aborigine resulted in the aborigine being wounded by shotgun pellets he survived and his wounds were dressed at a tent after which he left the darling river was reached at the end of may and the expedition continued for about  miles down the left bank mitchell decided to build a fort for safety while allowing time for the animals to refresh he named the location fort bourke in honour of the governor richard bourke two whale boats had been transported the whole distance on the bullock drays so on  june mitchell launched the boats on the darling to transport the party down river however the river became shallower and unnavigable downstream resulting in the expedition resorting once again to overland progress on  june the expedition departed fort bourke once again encountering many tribes as they headed south and by  june were  miles from the fort one tribe appeared more hostile than others kicking up dust and spitting at party members when they were retrieving water from the river mitchell and party were just north of menindee on  july and while camped for three days noticed several tribes congregating which he took to be premeditated he was planning on splitting the party to advance down the darling faster but he assessed the situation as becoming dangerous and decided instead to keep the men together and return to sydney mitchell noted that just after he communicated to the party his decision to retreat they heard shots from a forage party up the river following a brief skirmish at least three aborigines had been killed including a woman and her child one of the members of the expedition had been knocked unconscious on  july the party commenced their return via the outbound route mitchell decided to avoid contact with the various tribes as much as possible on their return they were at the fort bourke on  august and peak hill close to the frontier on  september where they learned from station stockmen of the death of cunningham when back in sydney mitchell added some passages which were not in his journal that seemed to implicate some of his men in the deadly incident near menindee while mitchell did not trace the darling river to its junction with the murray river the course and terrain of the bogan river and  km of the darling river had been charted the place where cunningham was killed is marked on an  map by mitchell showing the positions of exploring parties when most assailed by aborigines third expeditionedit piper the goal of mitchells third expedition was to explore and survey the lower part of the darling river with instructions to head up the murray river and return to sydney via the settled areas around yass second in command was assistant surveyor granville stapylton and  convicts made up the rest of the party he set out on  march  and when passing bathurst engaged a wiradjuri aboriginal guide john piper mitchell made his way to boree and the bogan river as on previous journeys then veered south to the lachlan river to approach the darling from its southern end where it joined the murray the party travelled along the lachlan passing condobolin and lake cargelligo both found by john oxley in  piper was able to converse with tribes to learn where vital waterholes were as the lachlan was drying out on  may an aboriginal widow named turandurey with her fouryearold daughter ballandella from the muthi muthi tribe joined the expedition as a guide she remembered oxley from nineteen years earlier and sturt as well and knew the lower lachlan the murrumbidgee river was reached on  may but at a point downstream from the junction with the lachlan the party camped while mitchell took five men and went upstream to find the junction once found they turned about and continued down the murrumbidgee until  may when they were close to the junction with the murray river a depot was established at this point so mitchell left staplyton and eight men to guard the stock while he ventured downstream with fifteen men on  may mitchell noticed that barkindji tribesmen from the darling river were gathering in large numbers and by  may the hostile intentions of these men became known when local murray river people told piper that the barkindji were planning to kill mitchell and his men mitchell had to decide whether to wait for an attack or plan a preemptive manoeuvre his numbers were reduced as staplyton and eight men were still at the depot he split his party again leaving half the men to hide in the scrub in ambush while he continued ahead with the carts when the armed barkindji warriors approached the convict charles king who was involved in the earlier killings fired without waiting for orders the tribesmen ran but in the ensuing skirmish many shots were fired killing seven aborigines and wounding four mitchell wrote about the loss of life in his journal describing the barkindji as treacherous savages and detailing how his men had chased them away pursuing and shooting as many as they could this section was withheld from mitchells report when it was released to the public in sydney the report indicated that mitchell and his men had been taken by surprise the expedition continued and on  may they reached the junction of the darling and murray rivers mitchell travelled up the eastern side of the darling for some distance and when he was certain that it was the same river he had explored in  he turned back and headed upstream on the murray to join stapylton at the depot the reunited expedition now travelled southeast following the murray crossed the river on  june and named swan hill on  june at the end of june the country had improved considerably so mitchell chose to leave the murray to investigate better looking lands to the southwest upon climbing the  foot pyramid hill he was so impressed with the country he saw he named it australia felix in early july the party crossed the loddon river and made their way in a southwesterly direction which brought them to the grampians and later to the mouth of the glenelg river on the coast it was now august so mitchell altered direction towards portland and the southeast when portland was reached on  august mitchell was surprised to find an established farm manned by the henty brothers edward and frank there were several whaling boats on portland bay as well after a brief sojourn the expedition commenced the return to sydney in a northeasterly direction meeting few aborigines on the way though they were aware of being watched on  september in order to speed his return mitchell split the party in two once more taking  men with him and leaving the remainder with stapylton to follow with the bullocks and drays the young girl ballandella went with mitchell while turandurey remained with the rear party on  september mitchell climbed and named mount macedon from the summit of which he had a view of port phillip progress was slow due to wet ground and the murrumbidgee was not reached until  october when mitchell arrived in sydney in early november he was received with great joy however when the remainder of his party arrived two weeks later rumours circulated about the mass killing on the murray he subsequently faced a legislative council inquiry in december  receiving an official rebuke ballandella joined mitchells family of eight other children and learnt to read and write fourth expeditionedit mitchells fourth expedition was into queensland in  he was convinced that a significant river must flow northwest into the gulf of carpentaria this being the main thrust of the endeavour on  december  mitchell started from boree buree in mitchells journal with a large party including edmund kennedy as second in command later speared to death at escape river near cape york he struck the darling river above fort bourke then continued to the narran river the balonne and the culgoa on  april  he came to a natural bridge of rocks on the main branch of the balonne which he called stgeorge bridge now the site of the town of st george kennedy was left in charge of the main body here and was instructed to follow on slowly while mitchell pushed ahead with a few men mitchell followed the balonne to the maranoa and the cogoon now called muckadilla creek near roma this rivulet led him to a magnificent pastoral district in the midst of which stood a solitary hill that he named mount abundance he then crossed a low watershed to the maranoa and awaited kennedys arrival kennedy rejoined mitchell on  june  leaving kennedy for a second time he set out on an extensive excursion of more than four months mitchell traversed the country at the head of the maranoa and discovered the warrago river keeping north over the watershed he traversed the claude and nogoa rivers then reached the belyando river an upper reach of the burdekin river this had already been discovered by ludwig leichhardt on his expedition to port essington on  april  intensely mortified to find that he was on a tributary of the burdekin river and approaching the ground already trodden by leichhardt he returned to the head of the nogoa and struck west after dividing his party and forming a stationary camp he continued west making a new discovery which he was certain was the fabled northwest river in honour of the sovereign of the time he decided to call it victoria river having run out of time he turned back towards the main party it was here that mitchell first noticed the well known grass that bears his name on the homeward journey he trekked along the maranoa river to stgeorge bridge arriving in sydney  january  later that year kennedy proved beyond doubt that the victoria did not continue northwest but turned southwest and joined cooper creek he renamed the watercourse the barcoo river from a name mentioned by local aborigines later careeredit sketch of major sir thomas mitchell in  mitchell sought  months leave from his position and in may he left sydney for london during his leave he published an account of his explorations called three expeditions into the interior of eastern australia with descriptions of the recently explored region of australia felix and of the present colony of new south wales mitchell sought additional periods of leave and finally arrived back in australia in  mitchell left sydney again in march  on another period of leave by the time he arrived back in mid he had published his journal of an expedition into the interior of tropical australia in search of a route from sydney to the gulf of carpentaria mitchells journals proved a rich source for historians and anthropologists with their close and sympathetic observations of the aboriginal peoples he had encountered these publications made him the most celebrated australian explorer of his daycitation needed but he was a difficult man to get on with made evident by this passage made by governor charles augustus fitzroy it is notorious that sir thomas mitchells unfortunate impracticability of temper and spirit of opposition of those in authority over him misled him into frequent collision with my predecessorscitation needed in a byelection for the electoral district of port phillip in april  mitchell was elected to the new south wales legislative council he found it difficult to separate his roles of government employee and elected member of the legislature and after only five months he resigned from the legislative council mitchell is also remembered as the last person in australia to challenge anyone to a duel in september  mitchell issued a challenge to sir stuart alexander donaldson because donaldson had publicly criticised excessive spending by the surveyor generals department the duel took place in sydney on  september with both duellists missing their marks the french  calibre pistols used in the duel are in the collection of the national museum of australia ophir gold fieldsedit in  mitchell was instructed by governor fitzroy to make a report on and survey of the extent and productiveness of the goldfield reported to have been discovered in the county of bathurst he travelled west during winter to visit the ophir gold diggings accompanied by his son roderick and samuel stutchbury the government geologist in june  mitchell selected the site for the township of ophir wr davidson plotted a survey of the ground and mitchell planned the streets and allotments for the town mitchell returned with a collection of specimens from the diggings mostly quartz with  of these stored in a wooden chest his report of the goldfields was presented to the legislative council in february  story of the bomerang propelleredit the search for a method of screw propulsion of ships intrigued many inventors during the latter half of the th century and the beginning of the th an englishman k p smith patented a screw propeller in  and shortly afterwards captain john ericsson formerly an officer of the swedish army patented another on his travels mitchell must have been evolving the idea of his boomerang propeller—he spelled it bomerang while newspapers used bomarang and boomerang the first test was made in the sydney harbour in may  an iron propeller being fitted to the screwsteamer keera the results of this trial were considered satisfactory the ships progress being calculated on two runs at  and a little over  knots and sir thomas mitchell took his invention to england in  the propeller was fitted to the genova and a trial was conducted on the mersey then the admiralty gave it a test on hms conflict the genova ran at  knots as against  with a screw propeller and the conflict  knots as against the screw propeller  and at a lower engine speed the boomerang propeller can be simply described as a screw propeller with much of the blades close to the shaft which contribute little to propulsion but much to drag cut away a principle which is well understood today family lifeedit thomas mitchell and mary had twelve children livingstone roderick murray campbell thomas richard georgina maria emily camilla alicia blanche georgina and maria died young and murray before  roderick and campbell died during the last years of mitchells life his family enjoyed a privileged upbringing and blanche mitchell his youngest daughter recorded her daily activities and social life in childhood diaries and notebooks her sister emily married george edward thicknessetouchet st baron audley in  mitchell completed his new gothic home carthona on the waters edge in darling point

south wales survey department before its report was published mitchell contracted a chill while surveying the line of road between nelligen and braidwood he developed a severe attack of bronchitis and died a few days later at carthona at darling point at pm  october  newspapers of the day commented for a period of twentyeight years sir thomas mitchell had served the colony much of that service having been exceedingly arduous and difficult among the early explorers of australia his name will occupy an honoured place in the estimation of posterity he is buried at camperdown cemetery newtown with his grave being maintained by the seniors group of surveyors namingedit some of the places mitchell named on his expeditions were the avoca river balonne river belyando river campaspe river
