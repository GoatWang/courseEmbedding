book about a great manread morecomment one person found this helpful was this review helpful to youyesnoreport abuse out of  starssol price san diegos gift to retailingbygary petersonon april  i first moved to san diego in  i was hired as a professor with san diego state college in the welcoming people explained san diego to me and told me where the shopping centers were and stuff like that several people mentioned that the best place to shop was at a place called fed mart about nine years later i bought a house in the san carlos part of sa diego and a fed mart store was only about two miles away naturally i went to look it over and found it to be an astonishingly different shopping experience it was like a supermarket in that it had all sorts of foodstuffs but didnt have meat or fresh vegetables what but maybe while you were there you might have a new set of tires installed if you needed them theyd cost only half of what youd pay elsewhere or they had a pretty good garden shop and a small indoor lumber yard which came in real handy with my new house what a strange assortment of stuff oh and i ended up buying my dining room set there and thats where i got my first color tv it was a japanese set and everyone had doubts about the quality of japanese goods but it had the best picture and was half the cost of the two available american brandsfed mart was a strange place indeed i gradually came to recognize however that if you could find what you needed you neednt look any farther that was the cheapest price youd find in san diego fed mart became ever more widely known and bought out several other discounters for a while fed marts became almost one of the most common large discount stores in san diego and had spread all over southern california and even arizona and texas it was an astonishingly successful business and i could easily understand why sol price was the founder and brains behind the operationthen a sad thing happened fed mart merged with a german company and it wasnt long before the fed mart i had grown to love gradually deteriorated finally it was shut down i remember the event the store where i had been shopping sold all their goods and even the furnishings the prices were lowered every few days until nothing was left except the empty building to me it was a sad and unfortunate event fed mart was gone but almost before the smoke faded i was hearing about another sol price enterprise that was starting up the price club it was supposedly a lot like fed mart but a lot larger i only shopped there once but i used to joke that if i ever needed a gallon of mustard i knew where to get it well some exfed martpriceclub people then started costco wholesale in seattle and it proved so successful that it began to invade the whole country including san diego home of the price club it wasnt too long before costco and the price club merged with costco being the surviver in a lot of ways the new costco stores are still a lot like the old fed mart stores but much much larger and far superiorbasically sol price was the innovator behind all of this and i recently bought a biographical book of his life by his son robert e price its an interesting book especially if you have a few remembrances of the old fed mart and price club price was revolutionary in his business thinking and the average big box shopper owes a lot to him i bought the book at where else costco it has a price tag stuck on the cover that reads  just like a lot of things you couldnt possibly buy it other than at costco for a price that low it fitsgary
