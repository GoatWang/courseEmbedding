condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations in conjunction with the condensed consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this quarterly report and with our audited consolidated financial statements included in our annual report on form k for the year ended december   as filed with the securities and exchange commission on february   in addition to historical condensed consolidated financial information the following discussion contains forwardlooking statements that reflect our plans estimates and beliefs our actual results could differ materially from those discussed in the forwardlooking statements factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this quarterly report particularly in part ii item a risk factors overview of our business in the discussion below when we use the terms we us and our we are referring to viveve medical inc and our whollyowned subsidiaries viveve inc and viveve bv we design develop manufacture and market a medical device for the noninvasive treatment of vaginal laxity for improved sexual function and for vaginal rejuvenation depending on the relevant countryspecific clearance or approval that we refer to as genevevetm which includes a radio frequency rf generator which we refer to as the viveve system singleuse treatment tips and other ancillary disposables currently geneveve is cleared for marketing in  countries throughout the world under the following indications for use indication for use no of countries general surgical procedures for coagulation and hemostasis  including the us for treatment of vaginal laxity  for treatment of the vaginal introitus after vaginal childbirth to improve sexual function  for vaginal rejuvenation  in the us geneveve is indicated for use in general surgical procedures for coagulation and hemostasis and we market and sell primarily through a direct sales force outside the us we market and sell through distribution partners as of march   we have sold  viveve systems and approximately  singleuse treatment tips in countries primarily outside of the us because the revenues we have earned to date have not been sufficient to support our operations we have relied on sales of our securities loans from related parties and bank term loans to fund our operations we are currently located in sunnyvale california we plan to relocate the corporate headquarters in the second quarter of  as discussed below in recent events we are subject to risks expenses and uncertainties frequently encountered by companies in the medical device industry these risks include but are not limited to intense competition whether we can be successful in obtaining us food and drug administration the fda clearance or approval for the sale of our product and whether there will be a demand for the geneveve given that the cost of the procedure will likely not be reimbursed by the government or private health insurers in addition we will continue to require substantial funds to support our clinical trials and fund our efforts to expand regulatory clearance or approval for our products in locations in which we do not currently have clearance or approval to market our product including the us we cannot be certain that any additional required financing will be available when needed or on terms which are favorable to us as noted above our operations to date have been primarily funded through the sales of our securities loans from related parties and bank term loans various factors including our limited operating history with minimal revenues to date and our limited ability to market and sell our product have resulted in limited working capital available to fund our operations there are no assurances that we will be successful in securing additional financing in the future to fund our operations going forward failure to generate sufficient cash flows from operations raise additional capital or reduce certain discretionary spending could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives recent events on march   in connection with the closing of a public offering the march  offering the company issued an aggregate of  shares of common stock including the shares issued in connection with the exercise of the underwriters overallotment option at a public offering price of  per share for gross proceeds of approximately  the net proceeds to the company after the deduction of underwriting discounts commissions and other offering expenses were approximately  on february   the company entered into a sublease agreement the sublease for approximately  square feet of building space for the relocation of the companys corporate headquarters to englewood colorado the sublease premises which is effective as of january   physical relocation is planned in the second quarter of  pending completion of the buildout of all office and warehouse facilities the term of the sublease will commence on the later of i  days after the date sublandlord delivers possession of the sublease premises to the company or the monthly base rent under the sublease will be equal to  per rentable square foot of the sublease premises during the first year the monthly base rent will be equal to  and  per rentable square foot during the second and third years respectively in connection with the execution of the sublease the company also agreed to pay a security deposit of approximately  the company is entitled to an allowance of approximately  for certain tenant improvements relating to the engineering design and construction of the sublease premises plan of operation we intend to increase our sales both internationally and in the united states market by seeking regulatory clearances or approvals for the sale and distribution of our products identifying and training qualified distributors and expanding the scope of physicians who offer the geneveve to include plastic surgeons dermatologists general surgeons urologists urogynecologists and primary care physicians in addition we intend to use the strategic relationships that we have developed with outside contractors and medical experts to improve our products by focusing our research and development efforts on various areas including but not limited to  designing new treatment tips optimized for both easeofuse and to reduce procedure times for patients and physicians and  developing new rf consoles which may include increased security features to prevent piracy or new cooling systems to maintain compliance with environmental regulations the net proceeds received from sales of our securities and the term loans have been used to support commercialization of our product in existing and new markets for our research and development efforts and for protection of our intellectual property as well as for working capital and other general corporate purposes we expect that our cash will be sufficient to fund our activities for at least the next  months however we will continue to require funds to fully implement our plan of operation our operating costs include employee salaries and benefits compensation paid to consultants professional fees and expenses costs associated with our clinical trials capital costs for research and other equipment costs associated with research and development activities including travel and administration legal expenses sales and marketing costs general and administrative expenses and other costs associated with an early stage public company subject to the reporting requirements of the securities exchange act of  as amended the exchange act we also expect to incur expenses related to obtaining regulatory clearances or approvals in the us and internationally as well as legal and related expenses to protect our intellectual property we expect capital expenditures for the foreseeable future to be less than  annually we intend to continue to meet our operating cash flow requirements through the sales of our products and by raising additional funds from the sale of equity or debt securities if we sell our equity securities or securities convertible into equity to raise capital our current stockholders will likely be substantially diluted we may also consider the sale of certain assets or entering into a strategic transaction such as a merger with a business complimentary to ours although we do not currently have plans for any such transaction while we have been successful in raising capital to fund our operations since inception other than as discussed in this quarterly report on form q we do not have any committed sources of financing and there are no assurances that we will be able to secure additional funding or if we do secure additional financing that it will be on terms that are favorable to us if we cannot obtain financing then we may be forced to curtail our operations or consider other strategic alternatives results of operations comparison of the three months ended march   and  revenue

reporting standards ifrs the financial accounting standards board fasb issued accounting standards update asu  revenue from contracts with customers topic  the new guidance sets forth a new fivestep revenue recognition model which replaces the prior revenue recognition guidance in its entirety and is intended to eliminate numerous industryspecific pieces of revenue recognition guidance that have historically existed in us gaap the underlying principle of the new standard is that a business or other organization will recognize revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects what it expects in exchange for the goods or services the standard also requires more detailed disclosures and provides additional guidance for transactions that were not addressed completely in the prior accounting guidance the asu provides alternative methods of initial adoption and is effective for annual and interim periods beginning after december   the fasb has issued several updates to the standard which i defer the original effective date from january   to january   while allowing for early adoption as of january   asu  ii clarify the application of the principal versus agent guidance asu  iii clarify the guidance on inconsequential and perfunctory promises and licensing asu  and clarify the guidance on certain sections of the guidance providing technical corrections and improvements asu  in may  the fasb issued asu  revenue from contracts with customers topic  narrowscope improvements and practical expedients to address certain narrow aspects of the guidance including collectability criterion collection of sales taxes from customers noncash consideration contract modifications and completed contracts this issuance does not change the core principle of the guidance in the initial topic issued in may  we are currently evaluating the impact that this standard will have on our condensed consolidated financial statements in july  the fasb issued asu  simplifying the measurement of inventory asu  asu  requires that an entity should measure inventory within the scope of this pronouncement at the lower of cost and net realizable value net realizable value is the estimated selling prices in the ordinary course of business less reasonably predictable costs of completion disposal and transportation the pronouncement does not apply to inventory that is being measured using the lastin firstout lifo or the retail inventory method subsequent measurement is unchanged for inventory measured using lifo or the retail inventory method asu  will be effective for the companys fiscal year beginning january   and subsequent interim periods with earlier adoption permitted we adopted this standard on january   and the adoption did not have a significant impact on the condensed consolidated financial statements in february  the fasb issued asu  leases topic  under this    may   c  cybernet data systems inc all

is off to a strong start we expect domestic sales to accelerate throughout   vive hopes to eventually gain fda clearance of the viveve system for an indication related to the improvement of sexual function while we had hoped the pivotal study would begin this year that timeline may now be pushed to  given that fda recently asked for additional safety related data  theres several reasons why we expect international sales to pick up throughout  including the agreement with their distributor in china requiring that company to purchase at least  units this year innovative company focused on

pathways into the us marketplace of which the first has been approved  the second approach that the company plans to pursue would entail a clinical proven pathway trial for approval which would likely be for the treatment of vaginal tissue to improve sexual function we believe that the company is currently in discussion with the agency and that a formal ide would be submitted in the coming months such that a study viveve ii would commence in late  anthony vendetti maxim group  we would continue to be buyers of viveve medical inc following its seventh consecutive quarter of doubledigit revenue growth driven by a successful launch of the us commercialization coupled with reaffirmed guidance for the quarter  of its betterthanexpected sales were attributed to the us market which was commercialized in late january  vive expanded its south korean indication to include vaginal laxity and received regulatory approval in malaysia  we believe managements focus on supporting its

million and loss of  million and   q revenue increased  on an annual basis and  equentially as the companys commercial and clinical activities continue to drive adoption and penetration in the

and disposable treatment tip unit sales that increased more than  sequentially  vive is currently awaiting fda authorization to begin a study for the indication of improving sexual function moreover in january  it announced regulatory clearances in columbia costa rica and malaysia  we believe managements focus on attaining additional regulatory clearances supporting its global distribution partners expanding its direct sales force and investing in market awareness should position it for continued growth brian marckx zacks equity research  viveve medical inc recently crossed what we characterize as a major milestone with the entry of the viveve system into the us market and the recent announcement last week that they have begun deployment of their initial domestic sales force while other energybased devices targeted to the us vaginal laxity market have preceded viveves entry none are fda cleared for an indication related to that use  the viveve system is the only device that has demonstrated significant efficacy for the improvement in vaginal laxity andor sexual function brian marckx zacks equity research  viveve medical incs randomized clinical study results confirmed earlier findings that viveve system significantly improves sexual function and reduces vaginal laxity this marketing study along with data from previous studies and the recent significantly beefedup distribution is expected to help accelerate the rollout of the viveve system  geneveve is now cleared for sale in  countries and the company expects to have approval in another two to four by

america comprising roughly    and  of sales  vive received an fda k clearance in the us and it has begun commercialization  we view the companys recent regulatory clearances as significant milestones ie s korea brazil and the us as approval in these countries represents large market opportunities   we believe managements focus should position it for growth brian marckx zacks equity research  viveve medical inc continues to make substantive progress towards their quest to commercialize the viveve system in the us in late september the company submitted an ide to fda seeking approval to commence viveve ii a pivotal usbased study expected to support an eventual regulatory filing seeking clearance for an indication related to improvement in sexual function  so assuming fda concurs with a proposed fsfi endpoint and eventual fda clearance for the treatment  in our opinion could be a gamechanger for viveve jeff cohen ladenburg thalmann  viveve medical inc announced that the viveve system has received k regulatory clearance from the us food and drug administration fda  we had previously expected the clearance to occur during q and towards the end of the calendar year thus the slightly earlierthanexpected clearance could bolster q and  revenues beyond our current estimates  the company has plans for dual pathways into the us marketplace currently viveve is in discussion with the fda for a k clearance the life sciences report interview with anthony vendetti  viveve medical inc recently announced that it submitted its investigational device exemption for the us food and drug administration fda under de novo k to begin a study which will involve about  patients  we believe this doubleblind randomized trial has the potential to get fda approval for something that other companies with devices for vaginal rejuvenation dont have so we believe that if this patient trial is successful viveve could have fda approval for the treatment of vaginal tissue to improve sexual function in women that could be a very powerful approval if viveve is able to get it were estimating in  that viveve could be the first company to have that approval which would open up a huge market for viveve in our opinion  viveve has the technology its putting together a worldwide distribution network and it has the management team to execute which is a significant part of any equation of a company that is at the stage of viveve read more  jeff cohen ladenburg thalmann  the viveve medical inc treatment is a noninvasive solution for vaginal laxity that is performed in less than  minutes in a physicians office and does not require the use of anesthesia  the company has been able to demonstrate successful clinical study results in multiple trials to date three human studies have been performed with extremely encouraging results  within one month after the viveve treatment patients reported a statistically significant improvement in vaginal laxity scores sexual function and sexual satisfaction scores as compared to prechildbirth levels  the system also demonstrated a strong safety profile throughout the study anthony vendetti maxim group  we would continue to be buyers of viveve medical inc following its fourth consecutive quarter of doubledigit revenue growth driven by the continued commercialization of the viveve system in new international markets  we view the companys recent regulatory clearances as incrementally positive ie south korea singapore as approval in these countries represents another large market opportunity in asia  to account for the q results as well as our expectations we are raising our   and  revenue estimates to m m and m from m m and m respectively charles haff craighallum capital  we expect viveve medical inc to launch in the us with a general product label in early  but they are also pursuing an expanded label which would allow them to market and sell their product for vaginal laxity or sexual dysfunction  given the enormous size of the market opportunity the elegance of vives solution and a strong management team that we believe can execute on the opportunity we see the stock reaching  based on the general product label in the us and only  penetration of target markets brian marckx zacks equity research  viveve medical incs randomized clinical study results confirmed earlier findings that viveve system significantly improves sexual function and reduces vaginal laxity this marketing study along with data from previous studies and the recent significantly beefedup distribution is expected to help accelerate the rollout of the viveve system  distribution agreement in brazil which leads the world in cosmetic surgery just consummated and could be a particularly strong catalyst in  next steps are to conduct us study in support of fda filing study could initiate this year anthony vendetti maxim group  we would continue to be buyers of viveve medical inc after a betterthanexpected quarter  the revenue growth was driven by better thanexpected placements of viveve systems and sales of disposable treatment tips around the world  the company released positive results for viveve i clinical trial which further ensures efficacy of the viveve system for the treatment of vaginal introital lexity  vive may be the first company with an fdaapproved device for the treatment of vaginal tissue   vive is wellpositioned to gain regulatory clearances in additional countries which should lead to the viveve system gaining further traction brian marckx zacks equity research  in midmay viveve medical inc reported financial results for the first quarter ending march  revenue  was just a hair shy of m this represents sequential growth of  and x the k booked in q of last year vive recognized sales of  systems and approximately  treatment tips in the most recent quarter as of the q  the systems installed base stood at approximately  units  which implies the recent placement rate of  units per month is continuing to hold anthony vendetti maxim group  the positive results of viveve i clinical trial builds upon the two previous clinical studies conducted in the us and japan to further validate the safety and efficacy of its system for the treatment of vaginal laxity  approximately  of the active subjects showed a positive change in vsq score at  months based on mean vsq score over time patients

the vaginal introitus to evaluate efficacy viveve i clinical study based on positive interim results announced in july  of  participants we are not surprised by yesterdays strong results  this

months after treatment  the proportion of patients reporting no vaginal laxity in the active group was  vs the sham group of  anthony vendetti maxim group  given that viveve medical incs monalisa touch continues to be a critical driver of topline growth the company plans on expanding its salesforce to  representatives from  over the next  months to bolster distribution efforts  the companys entry into womens intimate wellness intima builds upon elos core platform to perform gynecological and genitourinary treatments  the recently announced core intima laser system should enable elos to penetrate the large and growing vaginal rejuvenation market which according to vive presents a total nearterm global market opportunity of b over the next four years anthony vendetti maxim group  we are initiating coverage of viveve medical inc an emerging player in the noninvasive vaginal rejuvenation market  with a network spanning  countries worldwide and regulatory approval in  of those countries viveve has a strong distribution platform that should incrementally drive system placements until expected fda approval is attained in he we opine that over the next few years additional clearances should propel growth and catalyze the companys penetration of the fastgrowing multibillion dollar vaginal rejuvenation market gregory chodaczek sterne agee  viveve medical inc preannounced topline financial results for q of k including revenue from the sale of  viveve system and  treatment tips over the quarter viveve doubled its total installed base bringing the total ous commerical installed base to  systems  while the market for the treatment of vaginal introitus is relatively new we think the market is large and the uptake and usage of the viveve system could be quicker than
