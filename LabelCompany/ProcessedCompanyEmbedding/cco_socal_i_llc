chief media bureauopposition to petitioncco socal i llc charter or the company hereby opposes the petition for issuance of order to show cause filed by kjla llc licensee of kjla ventura california kjla or the station in the abovecaptioned proceeding  the station does not dispute that charter is properly carrying kjlas digital must carry signal in a digital format on its cable systems in the los angeles dma  rather it alleges that the company discontinued carriage of kjlas signal in analog format in violation of the commissions  viewability order by failing to provide adequate notice to either kjla or its own subscribers the station also claims the commission docketed the stations petition for issuance of order to show cause as a must carry complaint petition see special reliefand show cause petitions report no  march   the petition does not identify particular communities instead it refers broadly to charters analog subscribers in the los angeles dma see eg petition at  this opposition addresses those communities to which charter currently retransmits kjlas signal in digitalonly format including big bear lake burbank cerritos glendale hesperia long beach malibu rancho cucamonga riverside san bernardino san gabriel valley ventura victorville and whittier the cable communities carriage ofdigital television broadcast signals amendment to part  ofthe commissions rules fifth report and order  fcc red   viewabiliity orderdwtvl that charter has failed to make affordable equipment available that would enable analog subscribers to continue to view stations such as kjla subject to the digital migration the stations factual allegations are wrong charter properly notified both kjla and its own subscribers that the company was terminating analog delivery of kjlas signal and it offers digital equipment for continued viewing ofkjla by analog subscribers free of chargein the  viewability order the commission announced the sunset ofthe viewability rule which had required cable operators with hybrid analogdigital systems to carry digital must carry signals in an analog format after december   operators of hybrid cable systems may avoid such dual carriage and instead satisfy the viewability requirements of section b ofthe act by offering digital equipment eg settop boxes to analog subscribers at no cost or at an affordable cost the commission also expects cable operators to notify affected must carry stations  days and affected cable subscribers  days in advance of suspending analog delivery of a must carry station  charter has fully complied with these requirements and expectations accordingly charter respectfully requests the petition be denied i charter provided proper notice to the station that it was suspending analogdelivery of kjla the petition initially contends that charter failed to provide the station with notification of the companys plan to deliver kjla in digitalonly format in fact charter sent a letter dated november   to the station at the exact address identified on the fccs website the november notice  the november notice clearly advises the station that on or after see  viewability order at   see id at    see exhibit  the same address appears on kjlas website see iddwt vl february   charter will convert the analog presentation of your stations primary broadcast signal into a digital format on various identified channel lineups  the november notice further explains that kjla will continue to be available to all of charters customers  in a digital format on the basic tier of service the electronic receipt from the us postal service attached hereto as exhibit  confirms that the november notice was actually delivered to and received by the station despite the stations claims to the contrary charter did in fact provide the station with proper notice that on or after february  l it would deliver only a digital version ofkjlas signal on the relevant cable systems ii charter properly notified its subscribers that it was suspending analog deliveryofkjla the petition criticizes charters subscriber notices as underwhelming but ultimately concedes that charter did in fact notify subscribers of the proposed channel delivery format change  indeed the petition includes a copy of a charter customer bill which includes a message entitled important notice unambiguously advising subscribers effective on or after february   charter will offer the following channels including kjla exclusively in a digital format  the bill message is equally clear in explaining that the planned format change will require digital equipment in order to view these channels on all of your television sets charter included the digital migration notice in the bills of all of its subscribers in the affected communities issued during the period december   to january   kjla may not a copy of the november notice is attached hereto as exhibit   d emphasis in original  petition at   see petition at  and exhibit a  see iddwt vl like charters bill message but it clearly satisfies the notification requirements and expectations set forth in the commissions rules and the  viewability order which does not dictate specific notification language or methodologiesthe petition erroneously contends that beyond the billing inserts which by themselves clearly provide adequate notification to customers charter has not engaged in any more extensive efforts to educate analog subscribers of the steps that need to be taken to transition to digital service to retain the programming of mustcarry stations such as kjla again the station is wrong although not required to do so charter sent a separate letter on january i  regarding the digital transition to all of its limited basic service tier subscribers which are the subscribers most likely to be affected by charters delivery format change the january subscriber notice  as was the case with the bill messages this standalone notification clearly advises subscribers that after february  charter would deliver certain signals including kjla exclusively in digital format the january subscriber notice goes on to explain that the format change will require digital equipment to view the channels at issue and that charter will provide the necessary equipment at no cost petition at  while the petition is quick to criticize charters subscriber notification process it says nothing about kjlas own viewer outreach efforts despite the fact that the station claims to have become aware of charters format change in november  charter is not aware that kjla itself notified viewers ofthe change as expressly contemplated by the commission in the  viewability order  viewability order at  advance notice about planned carriage changes will allow mustcarry stations to notify their viewers  through onair messages website postings mailings or other forms of communications of their choosing about the planned change in carriage and about the viewers options to ensure continued access to the stations programming see exhibit  see id ddwt vl in addition to the bill messages and standalone subscriber notifications described above charter published a legal notice regarding charters proposed transition to digitalonly service in each of seven newspapers available to subscribers in the affected communities including the big bear grizzly  the burbank leader  the glendale news press  the press telegram long beachl the press enterprise riverside the san gabriel valley tribune  and the daily press victorvillel  thus despite the stations claims to the contrary charters digital service transition notice to subscribers was more than adequate iii charter is offering analog customers free settop boxes to assist with thetransition to digitalonly service the station also incorrectly contends that charter does not offer viable lowcost equipment to allow analog subscribers to access digitalonly stations such as kjla  as noted above charters subscriber notifications emphasize that such digital equipment is necessary for continued viewing of the subject channels and provide a phone number for subscribers to call to obtain the equipment charters january subscriber notice also clearly indicates that charter will provide the necessary digital equipment for free  in fact charter has supplied its subscribers with thousands of free settop boxes since first notifying them in december  of its plans to deliver multiple channels of programming including kjla in digital format only the language in each newspaper notice is the same as in charters bill notifications a sample legal notice from the press enterprise is attached hereto as exhibit  see petition at  see exhibit dwtvl the petition complains bitterly that charter customer service representatives inform analog subscribers about available digital packages  but as the station well knows there is nothing in the commissions rules or the  viewability order that prohibits such marketing°efforts  charter concedes that customer service representatives may promote charters variousdigital packages but it vehemently denies that its customer service representatives are instructed to present charters various digital packages as the only means by which analog subscribers may view recently migrated stations as the station claims charter has already distributed large numbers of settop boxes to analog customers at no cost and it continues to do so in response to customer calls to charter representatives in connection with the digital channel migration the stations specious claims about charters marketing practices are further undermined by the fact that the tollfree number on the january subscriber notice permits subscribers to order free settop boxes without ever speaking with a customer service representativethe commission has determined that a range of charges for dtas and set top boxes ie free or a monthly fee of no more than  would satisfy the requirement for affordable see petition at  the stations criticism of comments made by charters ceo thomas rutledge regarding the companys plans to go all digital on a nationwide basis is similarly flawed see petition at  notwithstanding the stations views digital transmission is the inevitable successor to analog transmission having itself transitioned to digital delivery several years ago the station can hardly criticize charter for embarking down the same path indeed the commission has long contemplated and encouraged the cable industrys transition to alldigital operations see  viewability order at  we continue to expect most cable operators will eventually transition to alldigital systems see exhibit dwt vl equipment    as noted above charter offers to provide settop boxes to analog customers free of charge  in short charter is providing affordable digital equipment that allows customers continued access to channels that are no longer delivered in analog format in full compliance with the commissions expectations as set forth in the  viewability order iv charters approach to transitioning its systems to alldigital is consistent withthe  viewability order finally the petition makes much of the fact that charters february   digital channel migration included some but not all of the broadcast stations carried on charters cable systems the commission however has already considered and rejected this objection there is no requirement under  viewability order that a cable operator must treat all local broadcast signals consistently with regard to analog carriage to the contrary the  viewability order is premised on the fundamental notion that the operator of a hybrid analogdigital cable system shall have sole discretion to determine whether it carries a particular must carry signal in analog or digital format provided that the operator complies with the specific conditions set forth in that order in the end it is clear that kjla disagrees with the commissions conclusion that a must carry station is no longer entitled to analog carriage simply because other programming services are delivered in analog but the stations disagreement with commission rules and policy does not justify requiring charter to resume analog carriage of kjla  viewability order at  the commission referenced several specific examples of compliant equipment offers including comcasts offering of two or three free dtas time warners provision of one or more free dtas for two years and bright houses offer to provide settop boxes to basic service tier customers for  a month charter is prepared to extend a free or lowcost settop box offer if its transition to alldigital operations on any of the systems at issue extends beyond its current equipment offer perioddwt vl conclusion charter timely informed the station and its own subscribers that it was suspending analogdelivery ofkjla it advised subscribers that this change would require digital equipment and itnas provided such equipment to thousands of subscribers free of charge  all in full compliance with the commissions rules and stated expectations for the foregoing reasons charter
