institutional investors according to a global survey of  organizations conducted by the economic intelligence unit source eiu  against a backdrop of ultralow interest rates sluggish growth and ongoing uncertainty nearly half of these investors have increased their allocations to at least one real asset category in the last three years more than half expect to increase in one or more categories within the next  months they cite two main drivers for their greater investment a desire to increase returns and their view of the macroeconomic environment a need for income is the third major motivation other objectives commonly associated with real assets—notably diversification and protection against possible inflation—are also cited but rank lowerinvestors are using a variety of vehicles and strategies to get exposure to real assets nearly all respondents  invest in real estate which has long played a role in institutional portfolios infrastructure the newest and fastestgrowing category is owned by  of the respondents just under onethird of the respondents  invest in commodities the median allocation to real assets was  of the total portfolio a percentage that will rise further if the respondents maintain their current course overall the survey results signal the continued evolution of real assets as building blocks in institutional portfolios with many organizations adding staff to support such effort however there is an important caveat resulting from the same unusual financial conditions that have been a tailwind for this asset class a majority of
