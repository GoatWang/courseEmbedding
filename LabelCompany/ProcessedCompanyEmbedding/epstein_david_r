about metastat inc metastats proprietary platform technologies are the result of over 5 years of collaboration involving four scientificacademic institutions which enabled us to characterize the behavior mechanics and genetics of metastatic cancer cells our metasite breast™ and menacalc™ diagnostic product lines are designed to accurately predict the probability of cancer metastasizing they are intended to allow clinicians to better customize cancer treatment decisions by positively identifying and differentiating highrisk patients who need aggressive therapy and by sparing lowrisk patients from the harmful side effects and expense of chemotherapy and radiation therapies furthermore we believe our menacalc™ diagnostic platform may be applicable in up to 0 of all solid epithelial
