of directors as the managing member of bml investment partners a  holder of marsh b class securities i strongly disagree with your decision to sell the company to an affiliate of sun capital partners �sun� for  per share i do not believe that the  per share transaction fully reflects the asset value of our company as my analysis yields an asset value of between �per share even assuming additional impairment charges for future store closings such as the recently announced naperville store closure there�s a substantial gap between book value and the sun offer in �s except per share amounts � �

per share ��  ��  cusip no  � page  of  pages sun stated in a letter addressed to the special committee of the board of directors special committee dated may�  that the �real estate appraisals independently appraised at  million above carrying value and disclosed in the q  earnings release dated feb   grossly overstate the value of marsh�s assets and that leverage against these assets would be far below expectations generated by those appraisals� assuming that sun is correct and that the value of the real estate is only worth half as much as abovestated appraisal marsh�s asset value is still well above sun�s  offer in �s except per share amounts � � �� low �� high book value  ��  ��  less goodwill  ��  ��  � value of real estate above stated book value  ��  ��  adjusted tangible book value ��  ��  diluted share count  ��  ��  adjusted book value per share ��  ��  i also take issue with the board of director�s decision to ignore the potential offer from cardinaldrawbridge and its decision to reject financial buyer d�s request to match any superior offer according to the prema filed on june�  the following events took place � � � � on april�  financial buyer d submitted a revised indication of value of  per share together with a request for exclusivity on april� merrill lynch advised financial buyer d that marsh was not willing to grant exclusivity at that time financial buyer d withdrew its offer the next day � � � � on april�  financial buyer d advised merrill lynch that it would be interested in reentering the auction process if it was provided a right to match any superior offer � � � � on april�  cardinal indicated that although its current valuation range was between its previous ranges of  and �per share it had not yet refined its view and would attempt to submit a revised indication by the end of the following week � � � � on april�  the board rejected financial buyers d�s request to match any superior offers cusip no  � page  of  pages � � � � on april�  the company signed a letter of intent with sun at a price of  per share and agreed to a  day exclusivity period to allow sun to complete due diligence � � � � on april�  the company received a joint indication from cardinal and drawbridge for  per share cardinaldrawbridge indicated that they would need  days to complete due diligence and agree to definitive merger terms they also indicated that they would be willing to undertake a transaction without a financing contingency � � � � on april�  the board met telephonically to review the indication of interest from cardinaldrawbridge and decided against pursuing it instead instructing management and the marsh advisors to continue working with sun to finalize an agreement this sequence of events is baffling the board had clear knowledge that a likely higher indication of interest was coming from cardinal when it signed off on the april� letter of intent with sun when it received an indication from cardinaldrawbridge on april� in the amount of  per share it still decided to pursue the transaction with sun how is this in the best interest of shareholders when the potential offer from cardinaldrawbridge was  higher than the sun offer what was the reasoning behind denying financial buyer d�s request to match any superior offer isn�t the purpose of an auction to receive the highest offer in my opinion the board breeched its fiduciary duty to shareholders there is more to marsh than the value of its real estate as reported in form q filed on august�  fy q earnings were  per diluted share versus  last year net of adjustments for merger related expenses real estate gains restructuring charges and adjusting the tax rate earnings were  per diluted share see below this was

always traded at a premium to the current offer price of  only in late  and early  did the stock trade at any meaningful cusip no  � page  of  pages discount to this price in my opinion this was due largely to the dividend suspension announced on november�  along with inaccurate rumors of the companies� demise the market may be a �voting machine� in the short term but is a �weighing machine� over longer periods of time this means that the market eventually gets it right the average trading price over this time period  is  for the a shares and  for the b�s if the time period from november�  is removed the average increases to  for the a�s and  for the b�s why then is the board willing to sell at a discount to the average trading price over these  quarters when the company just reported its nd best quarterly results in the last  years only recently has cardinaldrawbridge withdrawn its indication of interest to acquire marsh for  per share after an unfavorable court ruling prohibited marsh from pursuing an indication of interest from cardinaldrawbridge not surprisingly cardinaldrawbridge was appeased by an affiliate of sun with a possible saleleaseback transaction announced on august�  further according to the defma filed on august�  if a definitive saleleaseback is not agreed upon cardinal and drawbridge will have certain coinvestment rights in connection with ownership of marsh following the merger in my opinion it appears that cardinaldrawbridge was offered an incentive to step aside one that�s not in the best interest of shareholders the board may be concerned that without sun marsh will be left without a potential buyer in this unlikely case i would remind shareholders that they are owners of a company whose asset value far exceeds the current price and one that just posted its nd best quarterly results in the last  years for the reasons explained above bml cannot support the merger with an affiliate of sun capital and intends to vote against it we hope that other shareholders will come to a similar decision bml intends to consider all courses of action to maximize the value of its investment finally as a shareholder and customer i want to thank all of the marsh employees for their hard work and excellent service during this time of uncertainty sincerely braden m leonard managing member notes � �  from page  condensed consolidated balance sheet

alpha home about disclaimer contact the newsletter the very best actionable opportunities for eventdriven and value investors bml capital unwilling to tender matrix initiatives shares january   mtxx activist target see our earlier post on mtxx dated  bml capital management llc  e cedar – suite  zionsville in  phone  fax  january   via email   mr william c egan chairman of the board mr william j hemelt chief executive officer and director the board of directors matrixx initiatives inc  e anderson drive scottsdale az    dear madam and sirs   bml investment partners lp is a holder of  shares of common stock of matrixx initiatives the “company” or approximately  of the outstanding shares this makes us the second largest shareholder according to public records as managing member i am writing to express my disappointment in the proposed transaction with affiliates of hig capital llc “hig” the proposed deal with hig at  per share is at the extreme low end of any reasonable fair value estimate and the timing of the announcement to coincide with the announced settlement of the bulk of the company’s pending product liability cases makes no sense at all on the day of the announcement december   i contacted bill hemelt matrixx ceo to express my concerns that the  per share offer seemed quite low in fact it’s my strong belief that the stock would have reacted very favorably to the settlement alone and would likely approach  per share without any mention of the proposed hig transaction after reading the company’s schedule d filed on december   my feelings regarding the deal remained unchanged in addition the company’s third quarter earnings released on january   revealed no data point that would indicate the  per share offer from hig is fair in fact bml thought the results to be quite positive and indicative of a higher intrinsic value though hindered by many charges and tough comparisons to last year’s hn scare the results revealed important underlying strengths of the zicam brand such as strong gross margins above  and growing consumer acceptance december retail units sales of zicam cold remedy  vs entire coldcough category of  i again contacted bill hemelt on january   to express my view that the latest quarterly data confirmed my earlier view that the hig offer of  per share was inadequate the following simplistic analysis will reveal as much   reported   nine months ended dec      s     reported ebit  adjustments   personal injury settlement net  reserve for potential settlement of economic injury claims  merger related expenses  total adjustments      adjusted ebit  note the above number includes the ytd net legal defense costs of  million  million in costs offset by  million of insurance reimbursement this amounts to k per quarter which is a reasonable estimate on a post settlement basis the company’s annual guidance for the year ending march   is for revenue to increase  to  above last years  million the midpoint of which would put annual revenue at  million and q revenue at  million as shown below using a similar gross margin percentage  and sga level as in q the company would produce an additional mm of ebit in q   bml estimate     three months ended march       s         revenue based on midpoint of company guidance    cost of sales    gross profit      sga q sga of  less  in adjustments    research and development          ebit          note the q estimate includes the third quarter level of net legal expense of mm which is likely higher than normal on a post settlement basis and thus is conservative the above analysis puts full year ebit at  million or about  per share i believe this number is achievable realistic and something that can be improved upon in the future   considering the q profit estimate outlined above and the seasonal nature of the company’s working capital needs which requires higher levels of inventory and receivables in quarters  and  it is likely the company will finish the year with somewhere in the neighborhood of  million in cash not including the  million in restricted cash   while i recognize that the company still has to pay  million over the next  months for the personal injury settlement and around  million to settle the economic injury claims much of these cash outflows will likely be offset by receipt of an income tax receivable though the exact amount and timing of the receivable has not yet been reported   i believe it will be enough to largely offset the above mentioned payouts as such the company should finish the year with around  per share in net cash a back of the envelope analysis shows the  per share offer by hig to be only five times pretax earnings net of cash i believe this is extremely inadequate hig offer  per share market cap   million year end cash bml estimate  million enterprise value  share  million ebit for year ending march   bml estimate  million evebit  share x   as mentioned above the timing of the announced deal is also extremely puzzling while one can only speculate as to what might have happened i strongly believe that the shares would be approaching  based on the very positive settlement news alone if so the current offer amounts to a deal with virtually zero premium with the legal overhang largely removed i believe the shares have strong potential to move higher on a standalone basis as investors focus on the strength of the zicam brand and the company’s earnings power as such i am baffled as to why the board felt the need to enter a deal at this time in light of the recent settlement news and positive underlying fundamentals bml has no interest in selling its shares at  so will not participate in the current tender   regards s braden m leonard braden m leonard ticker
