surya n mohapatra by mlo staff    october     testing    testing interview by dottie dunham associate editor dottie dunham quest diagnostics is a major player in diagnostic testing what trends do you believe will influence the direction of the clinical laboratory industry in the next five years surya n mohapatra advances in technology particularly genebased testing will continue to have a significant impact on our company and on the industry new diagnostic tests are continually being introduced enabling physicians to predict and prevent disease detect disease at an earlier stage and more effectively tailor treatment options in addition to technology advances we believe there will be an increased focus on the quality of healthcare services quest diagnostics is highly focused on quality in all aspects of our business we were the first major healthcare company to pursue six sigma a rigorous approach aimed at achieving virtual perfection we are in our fourth year and have seen improvements in customer satisfaction process efficiency and financial benefits we are using our commitment to six sigma quality as a differentiator quality providers should and will be paid a premium some payers are providing additional payments to physicians who meet defined criteria finally we will see an expansion in the number of people likely to use diagnostic testing services driven primarily by a growing and aging population increasingly informed about their availability and importance dunham among quest diagnostics personal health testing products liquidbased pap technology increases the early detection of precancerous cells in cervical cancer screening what other significant personal health testing products has quest diagnostics introduced in the last year what can we expect in the coming year that will advance improvements for patients mohapatra first it is important to emphasize that in general no single test alone is used to make a diagnosis or medical decision we look at how physicians diagnose and treat disease and offer the broadest testing menu so that we can support the way physicians practice medicine we focus on conditions with sharply increasing prevalence cardiology cancer and infectious diseases epidemiology has taught us that a significant percentage of cardiovascular disease cannot be attributed to lipids in fact a significant number of people who have heart attacks have low cholesterol important diagnostic markers independent of cholesterol such as homosycteine and creactive protein crp offer important insights into patients cardiovascular health our cardio crp test a sensitive marker of systemic inflammation has emerged as a powerful predictor of cardiovascular diseases and increasingly physicians and patients are embracing its predictive value today through relationships with biotechnology companies we are able to offer potentially lifesaving screening tests for the early and accurate diagnosis of cancers when they are still at a curable stage we have recently introduced insure an fdacleared fecal immunochemical and patientfriendly test that represents a dramatic improvement for patients over traditional colorectal cancer screening tests we expect insure to improve averagerisk patient adherence with routine screenings which would save lives we also examine biopsies from patients undergoing colonoscopy where precancerous lesions are suspected and we offer a test to detect a genetic predisposition to colorectal cancer dunham has bioterrorism stimulated strategic planning within your company which counts among its customers government agencies what kinds of testing information and services have been or might be generated by quest diagnostics in response to such threats mohapatra bioterrorism and emerging infectious diseases such as sars and the west nile virus present potential public health crises underscoring the need to rapidly respond to new health threats we believe that collaboration with governmental health organizations through our trade association the american clinical laboratory association is central to an effective national response we are moving to establish a closer working relationship with the centers for disease control that is predicated on rapid information reporting for public health surveillance purposes governmental health agencies can benefit from our unparalleled access to important trend data derived from our nationwide testing as well as our sophisticated logistics and operations network that swiftly moves specimens around the nation and quickly delivers test results today we offer testing for a number of potentially lethal bioterrorism agents that cause serious disease including anthrax tularemia plague and botulism as a sentinel clinical reference laboratory for government health agencies formerly referred to as classified level a laboratory we accept patient samples with the goal of ruling out the presence of these bioterrorism agents if we are unable to do so we are then required to send out specimens to a governmental health laboratory for confirmation and a definitive diagnosis dunham what are the most significant challenges that the company will face in the near future with regard to the genetictesting area of its business can you address the most likely expansions in genebased testing products mohapatra the genebased testing arena is undergoing rapid change technology advances and new tests reflect those advances our new test efforts are focused in the areas of cancer cardiovascular disease and infectious disease the leading killers today we believe the next wave of new tests will be proteinbased such as the recognition of protein patterns the human body has approximately  genes and more than  different proteins physician acceptance of new tests takes time the tests showing the most rapid growth today were introduced one or more years ago a challenge we face is helping physicians stay abreast of these changes and appropriately incorporate new tests into their standard practices we are focused on introducing new tests for our customers that provide better or timelier medical information as well as having our medical staff available to answer questions about test use or interpretation of test results dunham what challenges have you faced and what solutions has the company begun to provide to aid in resolving the issue of the growing shortage of clinical laboratory professionals mohapatra it is an industrywide challenge to find qualified clinical laboratory professionals to fill certain positions personnel shortages have not affected our ability to meet the needs of our customers we have taken steps to help rebuild the medical technologist personnel pool and are developing recruitment strategies at three levels local regional and national to attract and retain qualified laboratory personnel among the strategies are a loan program at the labaide level to encourage further med tech training university scholarships and internships distancelearning programs through local colleges and universities periodic evaluations of total compensation packages to ensure competitiveness in the marketplace and onthejob training additional recruitment strategies include exploring affiliations with schools where online education is developing rapidly as well as establishing and maintaining affiliations with state universities that run programs dunham how does quest diagnostics service its customer base via the web how has this changed the way you do business does the company plan to expand such interaction in the future also would you give an update on your directtoconsumer testing service mohapatra online communication with our customers enables us to make our services easier to use and increases our stickiness with the physicians and hospitals that use our services every day just a year and a half ago we started a secure orders and reports online capability enabling physicians to use the internet to order tests and to receive the results online wherever they may be we have gone from a zero starting point to having approximately  of our orders and  of our test results transmitted over the internet that is a tremendous change over a short period of time and makes getting timely and secure access to their results easier for customers our emaxx patientcentric physician portal offers doctors a secure electronic patient record that lets them share information with other authorized doctors regardless of physical location no other patientcentric data repository has this level of clinical and administrative functionality which does not require physicians to change their workflow regarding our consumerdirected health testing we are still in the early stages of establishing a new business in tampa florida we have had a successful collaboration with cvs offering questest consumertesting services in cvspharmacy stores for the past year this year we launched questest services in stop  shop stores throughout connecticut results from this service are available through a secure internet connection as well as in printed reports dunham what does nichols institute do is it your only source for new tests or do you rely on relationships with other technology developers mohapatra quest diagnostics nichols institute fulfills a number of distinctive roles in the laboratory industry in addition to being our hub for new test development nichols institute is a valued supplier of lowvolume complex tests that would be costprohibitive for each hospital to set up and perform nichols institute is also home to our esoterictesting specialists who serve in a consultative capacity to our hospital and physician customers providing consultations on complextest interpretation one of the most significant diagnostic test contributions to recently come from nichols institute is the comprehensive laboratorydeveloped cf complete test which is able to identify up to  rare mutations that cause cystic fibrosis we bring new tests to market through established strategic relationships with technology companies with whom we collaborate to develop new or to commercialize existing technologies for example we have a broadbased alliance with roche diagnostics to develop and commercialize new genebased medical tests a strategic relationship with celera diagnostics will provide access to new potentially significant genetic markers for the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes we are working with correlogic systems to commercialize their proteomic test for the early detection of ovarian cancer surya n mohapatra phd is president and chief operating officer of quest diagnostics
