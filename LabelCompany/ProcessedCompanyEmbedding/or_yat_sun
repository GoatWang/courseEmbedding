report relating to dr suns illness and death could not be found in the files of the department of pathology at peking union medical college hospital pumch however a copy of the autopsy report is preserved in the museum section of the sun yatsen memorial in guangzhou china it had been widely believed and reported in both the chinese and foreign press  at the time of his death that dr sun died of liver cancer this was based on the exploratory laparotomy that was performed by dr adrian taylor head of the department of surgery at pumch on january   dr taylor found that dr suns liver was extensively infiltrated with a malignant tumor and that it had spread to the abdominal organs and lungs based on this observation he concluded that dr sun had liver cancer and that he only had a short

clinical summary dr sun over ten years had had digestive disturbances several months before his admission to pumch a mass was noted in his right upper abdomen and by early  this had become larger causing him much discomfort and weakness significantly however he did not have fever jaundice or loss of weight based on the autopsy report the true cause of dr suns death was an adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder with obstruction of the cystic duct direct extension to liver and diaphragm widespread metastasis to lungs peritoneum and small and large intestines in addition to his cancer he had gallstones which frequently can be associated with gallbladder cancer moderate generalized atherosclerosis pulmonary emphysema and edema and healed tuberculosis of the lungs how then was it that in  the popular press in china reported that dr sun had died of gallbladder and not liver cancer most likely it must have been based on dr cashs autopsy report which probably had been on display for many

and autopsy report relating to dr suns illness and death could not be found in the files of the department of pathology at peking union medical college hospital pumch however a copy of the autopsy report is preserved in the museum section of the sun yatsen memorial in guangzhou china it had been widely believed and reported in both the chinese and foreign press  at the time of his death that dr sun died of liver cancer this was based on the exploratory laparotomy that was performed by dr adrian taylor head of the department of surgery at pumch on january   dr taylor found that dr suns liver was extensively infiltrated with a malignant tumor and that it had spread to the abdominal organs and lungs based on this observation he concluded that dr sun had liver cancer and that he only had a short time to live on february   against the advice of his doctors dr sun was transferred to the former residence of wellington koo who previously had been the foreign minister of the republic of china despite the ministrations of old style chinese doctors dr sun became weaker and weaker eventually refusing all food and he died at the age of  on  march  his body then was transported to the

a brief clinical summary dr sun over ten years had had digestive disturbances several months before his admission to pumch a mass was noted in his right upper abdomen and by early  this had become larger causing him much discomfort and weakness significantly however he did not have fever jaundice or loss of weight based on the autopsy report the true cause of dr suns death was an adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder with obstruction of the cystic duct direct extension to liver and diaphragm widespread metastasis to lungs peritoneum and small and large intestines in addition to his cancer he had gallstones which frequently can be associated with gallbladder cancer moderate generalized atherosclerosis pulmonary emphysema and edema and healed tuberculosis of the lungs how then was it that in  the popular press in china reported that dr sun had died of gallbladder and not liver cancer most likely it must have been based on dr cashs autopsy report which probably had been on display for many

and autopsy report relating to dr suns illness and death could not be found in the files of the department of pathology at peking union medical college hospital pumch however a copy of the autopsy report is preserved in the museum section of the sun yatsen memorial in guangzhou china it had been widely believed and reported in both the chinese and foreign press  at the time of his death that dr sun died of liver cancer this was based on the exploratory laparotomy that was performed by dr adrian taylor head of the department of surgery at pumch on january   dr taylor found that dr suns liver was extensively infiltrated with a malignant tumor and that it had spread to the abdominal organs and lungs based on this observation he concluded that dr sun had liver cancer and that he only had a short time to live on february   against the advice of his doctors dr sun was transferred to the former residence of wellington koo who previously had been the foreign minister of the republic of

larger causing him much discomfort and weakness significantly however he did not have fever jaundice or loss of weight based on the autopsy report the true cause of dr suns death was an adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder with obstruction of the cystic duct direct extension to liver and diaphragm widespread metastasis to lungs peritoneum and small and large intestines in addition to his cancer he had gallstones which frequently can be associated with gallbladder cancer moderate generalized atherosclerosis pulmonary emphysema and edema and healed tuberculosis of the lungs how then was it that in  the popular press in china reported that dr sun had died of gallbladder and not liver cancer most likely it must have been based on dr cashs autopsy report which probably had been on display for many

and autopsy report relating to dr suns illness and death could not be found in the files of the department of pathology at peking union medical college hospital pumch however a copy of the autopsy report is preserved in the museum section of the sun yatsen memorial in guangzhou china it had been widely believed and reported in both the chinese and foreign press  at the time of his death that dr sun died of liver cancer this was based on the exploratory laparotomy that was performed by dr adrian taylor head of the department of surgery at pumch on january   dr taylor found that dr suns liver was extensively infiltrated with a malignant tumor and that it had spread to the abdominal organs and lungs based on this observation he concluded that dr sun had liver cancer and that he only had a short time to live on february   against the advice of his doctors dr sun was transferred to the former residence of wellington koo who previously had been the foreign minister of the republic of china despite the ministrations of old style chinese doctors dr sun became weaker and weaker eventually refusing all food and he died at the age of  on  march  his body then was transported to the

larger causing him much discomfort and weakness significantly however he did not have fever jaundice or loss of weight based on the autopsy report the true cause of dr suns death was an adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder with obstruction of the cystic duct direct extension to liver and diaphragm widespread metastasis to lungs peritoneum and small and large intestines in addition to his cancer he had gallstones which frequently can be associated with gallbladder cancer moderate generalized atherosclerosis pulmonary emphysema and edema and healed tuberculosis of the lungs how then was it that in  the popular press in china reported that dr sun had died of gallbladder and not liver cancer most likely it must have been based on dr cashs autopsy report which probably had been on display for many

and autopsy report relating to dr suns illness and death could not be found in the files of the department of pathology at peking union medical college hospital pumch however a copy of the autopsy report is preserved in the museum section of the sun yatsen memorial in guangzhou china it had been widely believed and reported in both the chinese and foreign press  at the time of his death that dr sun died of liver cancer this was based on the exploratory laparotomy that was performed by dr adrian taylor head of the department of surgery at pumch on january   dr taylor found that dr suns liver was extensively infiltrated with a malignant tumor and that it had spread to the abdominal organs and lungs based on this observation he concluded that dr sun had liver cancer and that he only had a short time to live on february   against the advice of his doctors dr sun was transferred to the former residence of wellington koo who previously had been the foreign minister of the republic of china despite the ministrations of old style chinese doctors dr sun became weaker and weaker eventually refusing all food and he died at the age of  on  march  his body then was transported to the

stipulated that no organs could be removed from his body and apparently dr cash was allowed to take only one tissue section and that was of the tumor following the autopsy in the face of considerable

a brief clinical summary dr sun over ten years had had digestive disturbances several months before his admission to pumch a mass was noted in his right upper abdomen and by early  this had become larger causing him much discomfort and weakness significantly however he did not have fever jaundice or loss of weight based on the autopsy report the true cause of dr suns death was an adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder with obstruction of the cystic duct direct extension to liver and diaphragm widespread metastasis to lungs peritoneum and small and large intestines in addition to his cancer he had gallstones which frequently can be associated with gallbladder cancer moderate generalized atherosclerosis pulmonary emphysema and edema and healed tuberculosis of the lungs how then was it that in  the popular press in china reported that dr sun had died of gallbladder and not liver cancer most likely it must have been based on dr cashs autopsy report which probably had been on display for many decades but no one ever really appreciated its significance until an american pathologist saw a barely legible document that turned out to be a copy of dr suns autopsy report at the sun yatsen

and autopsy report relating to dr suns illness and death could not be found in the files of the department of pathology at peking union medical college hospital pumch however a copy of the autopsy report is preserved in the museum section of the sun yatsen memorial in guangzhou china it had been widely believed and reported in both the chinese and foreign press  at the time of his death that dr sun died of liver cancer this was based on the exploratory laparotomy that was performed by dr adrian taylor head of the department of surgery at pumch on january   dr taylor found that dr suns liver was extensively infiltrated with a malignant tumor and that it had spread to the abdominal organs and lungs based on this observation he concluded that dr sun had liver cancer and that he only had a short time to live on february   against the advice of his doctors dr sun was transferred to the former residence of wellington koo who previously had been the foreign minister of the republic of china despite the ministrations of old style chinese doctors dr sun became weaker and weaker eventually refusing all food and he died at the age of  on  march  his body then was transported to the pumch and with the reluctant agreement of his family a limited autopsy was performed on march   by james r cash md associate professor in the department of pathology furthermore dr suns family had stipulated that no organs could be removed from his body and apparently dr cash was allowed to take only one tissue section and that was of the tumor following the autopsy in the face of considerable opposition the family had the courage to arrange for a christian funeral service that was held in the beautiful auditorium of the pumch following this the body then was embalmed  preserved in mineral oil and taken to the temple of azure clouds a buddhist shrine in the western hills a few miles outside of beijing he also left a short political will  penned by wang jingwei which had a widespread

in the spring of  on june   dr suns remains were moved from beijing and interred in the sun yatsen mausoleum however as revealed in the recently discovered copy of dr suns autopsy report according to a brief clinical summary dr sun over ten years had had digestive disturbances several months before his admission to pumch a mass was noted in his right upper abdomen and by early  this had become larger causing him much discomfort and weakness significantly however he did not have fever jaundice or loss of weight based on the autopsy report the true cause of dr suns death was an adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder with obstruction of the cystic duct direct extension to liver and diaphragm widespread metastasis to lungs peritoneum and small and large intestines in addition to his cancer he had gallstones which frequently can be associated with gallbladder cancer moderate generalized atherosclerosis pulmonary emphysema and edema and healed tuberculosis of the lungs how then was it that in  the popular press in china reported that dr sun had died of gallbladder and not liver cancer most likely it must have been based on dr cashs autopsy report which probably had been on display for many

and autopsy report relating to dr suns illness and death could not be found in the files of the department of pathology at peking union medical college hospital pumch however a copy of the autopsy report is preserved in the museum section of the sun yatsen memorial in guangzhou china it had been widely believed and reported in both the chinese and foreign press  at the time of his death that dr sun died of liver cancer this was based on the exploratory laparotomy that was performed by dr adrian taylor head of the department of surgery at pumch on january   dr taylor found that dr suns liver was extensively infiltrated with a malignant tumor and that it had spread to the abdominal organs and lungs based on this observation he concluded that dr sun had liver cancer and that he only had a short time to live on february   against the advice of his doctors dr sun was transferred to the former residence of wellington koo who previously had been the foreign minister of the republic of

a brief clinical summary dr sun over ten years had had digestive disturbances several months before his admission to pumch a mass was noted in his right upper abdomen and by early  this had become larger causing him much discomfort and weakness significantly however he did not have fever jaundice or loss of weight based on the autopsy report the true cause of dr suns death was an adenocarcinoma of the gallbladder with obstruction of the cystic duct direct extension to liver and diaphragm widespread metastasis to lungs peritoneum and small and large intestines in addition to his cancer he had gallstones which frequently can be associated with gallbladder cancer moderate generalized atherosclerosis pulmonary emphysema and edema and healed tuberculosis of the lungs how then was it that in  the popular press in china reported that dr sun had died of gallbladder and not liver cancer most likely it must have been based on dr cashs autopsy report which probably had been on display for many
