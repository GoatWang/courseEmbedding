component of the american economy accounting for more than  percent of the nation’s gross domestic product it is also the fastest growing segment forecast to increase above  percent of gdp in the next few years source centers for medicare and medicaid services  in the midst of this growth the affordable care act “aca” or as commonly referred to as “obamacare” is driving dynamic changes to the healthcare economy as it transforms patient access to care while modernizing and reengineering the current infrastructure of medical delivery we believe the changes precipitated by the implementation of the aca will result in “winners” that are able to effectively adapt and thrive in the new environment as well as “losers” that are unable to access the necessary capital and expertise to compete for investors this historic period of change may offer significant opportunity to those able to identify the difference between those firms able to thrive and those that will struggle nexpoint capital

specialized expertise we will be able to successfully identify the “winners” and to provide nexpoint capital investors with a unique opportunity to potentially benefit from the ongoing strength and historic change in the quickly evolving healthcare sector   there is no assurance that the healthcare industry will experience growth in line with this forecast prior performance is no guarantee of
