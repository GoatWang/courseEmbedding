nearing first gold pour at the giant brucejack projectmay  about pretium resources pvg fabio herrero gold  precious metals oil  gas long only deep valuesummarypretium owns the brucejack project a highgrade underground gold mine complex in british columbia canada it is weeks from cash flow and has an  years minimum mine lifecommissioning is nearing completion and ore is being introduced to the mill production is expected to be oz au at a very high grade  gt compared to industry averagesthe project sports an industry low allinsustaining cost of  with a  irr and an npv of almost b at a gold price of pretium additionally owns the snowfield deposit with m ounces of gold just north of the existing mine it is the th biggest undeveloped gold deposit in the worldpretium nysepvg is one of the biggest stories of the last few years in the gold mining space the sheer size of it made believers and detractors of this project even leading to a fullblown controversy i am squarely bullish on pretium and since at least  i have seen the project grow thus with the project now being in the final stages of construction i am happy to see the share price momentarily depressed and will soon start to buy i wrote about pretium for the first time some months ago when i penned an article about  junior gold miners finishing construction in  currently pretium is doing as expected as they are currently finishing construction on the brucejack project in this article i will explain in detail why the brucejack project and the whole pretium endeavor is a winning story and a strong buy at the current market price this article will be organized as follows firstly we will describe brucejack as a mine project in general included the exploration potential around it next we will revisit a controversy surrounding the consistency of the ore and outline why i firmly believe that there is actually more gold present on site than the conservative estimates that were made back in the day indicate after assessing the quality of the assets in portfolio we will move to the management track record and capital structure sections in order to inform an eventual trading decision finally in the valuation section we will go deeper into how much pretium is really worth vis a vis its market price the amount of ore in the ground and its industry peers this will be followed by a buy recommendation in the conclusion the brucejack project the brucejack project is located in british columbia canada which is a safe and reliable jurisdiction the company is very involved in the region and has different agreements with the local communities this is reflected by for instance the fact that around  of the workforce is locally sourced from northwestern british columbia  from the rest of british columbia while the remaining  is from elsewhere in canada moreover commercial contracting and employment of local first nations workforce has been ongoing since the projects discovery brucejack location company presentation may  construction of the mine is almost completed and as of the beginning of may the construction team has in fact successfully handed over underground development to the operations crew while two longhole drills are currently drilling off the stopes this means that we are only weeks away from the moment that cash flow will literally start to pour in brucejack does not only include the gigantic valley of the kings vok deposit  which is where the mine is currently being built  but also other satellite deposits that are already at the exploration stage as per the map above the other significant known deposit on the property is the snowfield gold deposit which we will discuss at further length in the exploration section here it must be noted that the brucejack and snowfield deposits are generally seen as the th and th biggest undeveloped gold deposits in the world see below hence making pretium a potentially huge player top  undeveloped deposits  global gold mine  deposit ranking natural resource holdings as for now the primary focus of the mine is the valley of the kings deposit which is comprised of highgrade visible gold going up to kilograms per tonne in some intercepts this is within a lower grade gold quartz stockwork system proven and probable mineral reserves in the valley of the kings of m oz au m tonnes grading  gt au were outlined with a feasibility study completed in june  and updated in december  mine life is projected to be eighteen years with a total gold production of m oz au december  mineral reserve estimate may  corporate presentation gold and silver recoveries are respectively  and  while average annual gold production will be between a sizeable  oz in the years  and  oz average during the expected life of mine this is without considering the already known mineralization systems that were previously found nearby the existing mine plan in short we are talking about high grades and a gigantic deposit or is this too good to be true the controversy back in  there was a controversy surrounding the resignation of strathcona mineral services ltd one of the companies dealing with pretium resources bulk sample they had a disagreement with snowden mining industry consultants which was the other independently qualified party for the feasibility studies according to strathcona the snowden studies were not valid and could thus not interpreted as mineral resources and reserves the controversy was also covered by hebba investments in this article of october  and it took quite some time for the dust to settle however strathconas reservations were proven unfounded by the spectacular results of a t bulk sampling process that was made later in  in my opinion snowdens methods were more than redeemed as results proved in accordance with their earlier assessments on both the lateral and vertical continuity of the vein systems comprising the stockwork as well as the location of highgrade corridors of mineralization in between the more vastly mineralized envelope to go into the details the oz of gold that were produced from the  dry tonnes of excavated material surpassed the target of  oz of gold which were estimated to be produced from the bulk sample by almost  this is clearly remarkable and i am eager to see the actual numbers when production will be properly underway later during the year moreover since  pretium has released hundreds of drill holes with fantastic results at every point they consistently found equal or greater amounts of gold than expected in the estimations i hence feel confident that this past controversy is no longer relevant and we will not discount pretiums data and resource estimates in our valuation exploration near the valley of the kings deposit there are a number of satellite deposits that have shown very promising results the west zone has a proven and probable mineral resource estimate of m oz au and m oz ag with respectively  and  gt moreover the company encountered high grade intercepts in many other places including on the east side while there is also potential at depth nearby exploration potential corporate presentation june  snowfield is where the real unlocked value lies for pretium it lies just north of brucejack and hosts a nearsurface lowgrade bulk tonnage porphyrystyle gold deposit with goldcopper molybdenum and rhenium mineralization currently a higher grade goldcopper core with silver and molybdenum has been outlined the company completed a ni  resource estimate in february  the gold resource includes an astounding m oz au of measured and indicated resources and m oz of inferred resources at a cutoff grade of g equivalent per tonne in short we can say that this is a relatively low grade yet gigantic deposit as mineral resources furthermore include silver resources of m oz measured and indicated  m oz inferred copper resources of  billion oz measured and indicated and  billion oz inferred  molybdenum resources of m oz measured and indicated and m oz inferred rhenium resources of m oz measured and indicated and m oz inferred snowfield is at the moment in standby as the company wants to stay opportunistic on the way it will realize value pretium has however entered into a confidentiality and cooperation agreement with seabridge gold nysemktsa whose ksm project shares a common boundary with snowfield the two are operating on a winwin basis and the company does not need to expend further funds on the project until  overall despite the standby status this is an enormous asset that the market is valuing at almost zero in my opinion this is one of many reasons why this stock is undervalued and thus a good buy currently something which we will elaborate more on in the valuation section let´s now move on and check management track record and capital structure of the company management pretium is the creation of robert a quartermain the current executive chairman over his year career in the resource industry he gained an extensive global experience in geology exploration and development here is the bio from the company website dr quartermain was the president of silver standard resource nasdaqssri from  to  over which time the company grew from a small exploration company with a market capitalization of over  million to a company with a producing mine five advanced development properties a pipeline of early stage exploration properties and a market capitalization of over  billion dr quartermain is currently the executive chairman of pretium resources which he incorporated in   and is now completing construction of a gigantic high grade gold mine joseph ovsenek is the president director and ceo of pretium he joined the company in january  and is the person in charge of all daytoday operations ovsenek has over  years of international management and legal experience in the precious metals industry before pretium he served in senior management roles for silver standard for fifteen years apart from being responsible for the company financing he was also instrumental in developing the corporate strategy here via the acquisition and sale of several assets george paspalas acts as the lead director of pretium he was previously president and ceo of mag silver nysemktmag president and ceo of aurizon mines and coo of silver standard resources inc before this he worked with placed dome and was responsible for constructing and operating complex open pit and underground mines in canada south africa tanzania australia and south america current cfo is tom yip who brings with him  years of financial management experience in the mining industry until recently he was the cfo for international tower hill mines nysemktthm the other directors and managers are all experienced and i believe able to well manage this company capital structure share capitalization is clean with m incentive options and no warrants against m shares outstanding meaning an acceptable and normal dilution that is actually substantially lower than usual when benchmarked against the junior gold miners peer group share capitalization and top shareholders company website management has a  ownership  incentive options something that i always like to see blackrock  with  trillion in assets under management the worlds largest asset manager  is the biggest shareholder followed by another asset management company van eck associates silver standard is a historical partner of pretium while zijin mining participated in a preconstruction financing orion mine finance is the partner in the m construction package that financed the mine the other major shareholders are a mix of merchant banks and asset management firms we can confidently assess that the quality of the share structure is good with strong hands keeping management on track while management itself has skin in the game and as we have said is willing and capable to deliver valuation as the company will become a producer over the next few months much of the execution risk associated with mine building will be behind pretium the main incognito is the price of the main commodities produced namely gold and silver as we and the company are price takers in this we will consider a flat gold price in the next foreseeable future for the purpose of our analysis in this valuation we will value the snowfield project at  as it is too speculative in nature and the monetization path is not clear at this point it is however a fantastic asset and makes that pretium is not a one asset company and hence it offers a lower risk profile compared to others that are economics of the brucejack project corporate presentation may  i am not the only bullish analyst on may st the streetwisereport published three analyst views that in my opinion are spot on bmo capital markets analyst andrew kaip notes that pretium continues to make positive progress at its brucejack mine with a number of components and services commissioned or moving thereto and wet commissioning nearing completion the company remains on track for the production of gold concentrate and doré in the coming weeks he highlights that pvg has over kt of ore stockpiled on surface and underground up from kt in late march and rates pretium as an outperform with a target price of  moreover eric zaunscherb an analyst with canaccord genuity maintaining the target price of  and reiterating a buy recommendation zaunscherb highlights that pretium resources is trading at a x pnav this is a premium to the means of peer covered development companies at x and covered small to midcap producers at x a premium is justified given the projects scale scalability exploration potential low sovereign risk and potential appeal as an ma target it is important to note here that the pretium share price went down somewhat from the beginning of the month making the pnav closer to  even better for new investors finally roth capital partners analyst joe reagor believes that brucejack will begin initial gold production in the coming weeks and that it will steadily increase production over the remainder of  he also explains that the company will avoid running high value ore through the mill until it optimizes recoveries and throughput estimating production of   and  ounces of gold over the three remaining quarters of  respectively he stated that the firms valuation for pvg is usd b or usd per fully diluted share pretiums share price was  at the close of may th  which i think is a steal considering that starting now it will literally become a cash machine as it has some of the lowest allin sustaining cash cost per oz in the industry at  per oz of gold brucejacks aisc compared to intermediate gold producers corporate presentation september  here we must consider that at a gold price of  the company would generate b in cash flow in the event of a gold bull market in the next years pretium will generate billions of dollars more in free cash flow at almost no added cost production estimates and economics corporate fact sheet march  some other positive factors that are not fully considered by the market is that the constructionfinancing package included a stream that the company could decide to buy back pretium has the flexibility to buy back some of the stream that it sold to orion mine finance further enhancing the economics of the project here you can find the details of the stream stream agreement between pretium and orion finance company website before moving to the conclusion i would also highlight that all present calculation use a conservative cadusd of  while it is presently closer to  costs are mainly in cad while revenue are in usd meaning that if the canadian dollar would fall more the company would benefit from an even lower production cost note here that of course the opposite is also possible before we conclude we must consider a last valuation metric that is always interesting to take into account the market cap is now b and for this a shareholder gets m oz gold at brucejack and m an snowfield ie a grand total of m this leads to a price of  per oz of gold in the ground   oz    relatively cheap compared to industry peers especially if we consider a rerate as a producer and that it is in a safe jurisdiction with a pnav of  that will be soon be rerated as pretium becomes a producer no more dilution expected the possibility to enhance the economics of the project by buying back some of the stream the ownership of snowfield i feel confident into recommending a buy of pretium at this price conclusion pretium is highly leveraged to the price of gold and as such it has some inherent risk that are not company specific but industry specific that said if we consider a flat gold environment in the foreseeable future at  per share it is a compelling buy as we have seen our valuation is robust as we are entirely discounting the value of snowfield the th biggest undeveloped gold deposit in the world i recommend to immediately open a buy order with a limit at  or lower with a target of  or  more in the next  months which is when the company rerates as a high margin producer supporting documents globalgoldmineanddepositrankingspdf disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned but may initiate a long position in pvg over the

pretium resources inc bob quartermains monstersized superhighgrade gold play in british columbia whats interesting is that its on the verge of pouring its first bar of gold but the stock has not yet risen as much as wed expect thats despite the company completing construction ahead of schedule the reason is that because the deposit is so exceptional pretium has done some things differently this has some critics saying the mine will not produce as much gold as projected but pretiums bulk sample produced something like  more gold than was expected based on the model that tells me that the

interesting developer over the last few years as the gold market turned down it was up against the wind developing its deposit in the valley of the kings in northern british columbia theres been a lot of criticism of the project but im very hopeful and excited to watch as it goes into commercial production in the next year it has identified amazing grades i feel very comfortable that it is going to achieve its objectives we might see sporadic production over the years because of the nature of that deposit and the nature of the high grade there but im quite optimistic that itll work out well i think the naysayers will be humbled in due course but there probably will be ups and downs along the way which will make it exciting for investors if they like to trade  as much as the mine management team is well prepared for operating in difficult weather conditions and mining a highgrade deposit with relatively narrow veins there will likely be periods when operations dont go as planned and yet it is an amazing ore deposit which in time should yield tremendous value read more  eric zaunscherb canaccord genuity  we recently completed a site visit to pretium resources incs valley of the kings high grade underground gold deposit  mineralization is hosted in a relatively complex epithermal system ma overprinted or remobilized on a ma deformation event key individual veins are fairly continuous and traceable between levels  geologists have been experimenting with various proxy indicators but a powerful indicator has emerged recently a package defined by anomalous fesas

message of commercial production around mid of  they are set to have everything ready by the end of the year i wont be surprised if they start turning the mill and producing some gold either the end of this year or early next year ahead of schedule  when i asked management for comments on my observation the official answer i got was due to favorable weather condition and dedicated workforce we are slightly ahead of schedule joe reagor roth capital partners  roth attended a site visit to pretium resources incs brucejack project in northern british columbia ca we came away impressed with the

brucejack has been derisked from a financial standpoint joe reagor roth capital partners  pretium resources inc announced an updated resource estimate for the valley of the kings deposit the updated resource was slightly larger than the previous resource estimate and confirmed the highgrade nature of the deposit in our view  the mi resource increased from  moz to  moz due to an increase of

of   at yearend pretium had cash and cash equivalents of usm and working capital of usm the gold report interview with joe reagor  we like pretium resources inc because it has very highquality assets with a large number of gold ounces high grade in a good jurisdiction and has a solid management team with a proven track record if a company has those things then its in position to turn it into a worldclass producing asset  pretiums recent drill results are a further confirmation of what everyone sees in that deposit its essentially a lowgrade halo around some recordhigh gold intercepts over very short lengths sub meter intercepts sometimes subm intercepts of apparently significant highgrade gold having been underground at that deposit i saw spots in the wall where a drill hole missed by two or three inches what would have been a significant highgrade intercept instead it shows up as just a lowgrade intercept so the point of pretiums infill drilling is to delineate as much as it can ahead of time an estimate of what production might look like so that it can provide reasonable guidance to the market once its in production sometime next year one of the concerns that a lot of people still have is it will be very difficult to put a range on what production will be given the highly variable nature of the deposit thats why its still doing additional drilling even as it brings it

expect from valley of the kings which includes some very high grade hits and visible gold this set of results for instance included five intersections grading greater than  gt gold  there are questions about how continuous the mineralization is along each vein and whether the nuggetyness of the gold will cause problems around head grades or recoveriesthis kind of intense and focused drill

overshoot the average especially if gold continues to perform through q heiko ihle rodman  renshaw  on feb  pretium resources inc announced several updates for its highgrade brucejack project  capital costs at brucejack were lowered from the initial june  feasibility study of m which was calculated at a  caus exchange rate we highlight that the updated capital cost estimate of m is inline and actually slightly beyond our previous estimate of m  construction is proceeding on schedule  we are reiterating our buy rating on the companys stock while increasing our price target to share from share  we believe the project should reach commercial production sometime in h chen lin what is chen buying what is chen selling  pretium resources inc just announced an update on its brucejack project budget it looks like the capital costs dropped from m to m mainly due to the depreciation of the canadian dollar the company is seeking to raise about cam to get it into production i think this will be the companys last raise and a good opportunity to load up on its shares greg mccoach mining speculator  for pretium resources inc its mine is already under construction and will generate an opportunity to profit as  approaches  the companys stock is a buy eric zaunscherb canaccord genuity  pretium resources inc provided an update on the development of its wholly owned brucejack highgrade underground gold mine in northwestern british columbia including a significantly lower capital expenditure estimate for its completion project engineering is at the  completion mark and the project is on target for commissioning in q with commercial production in late   management estimates that total preproduction capital will amount to m including working capital of m as compared to m in the june  feasibility study not including working capital and m in our current model the gold report interview with joe reagor  last year after pretium resources inc made its construction decision and announced its financing without any equity component its stock value improved significantly despite a flat gold and silver price because there was short covering on the name  a lot of investors expected pretium to be bought by now but the rubicon situation has deterred companies from acquiring highgrade but highly variable deposits highly variable deposits are always difficult to estimate pretiums brucejack has a unique geological structure that is more geologically similar to a pacific island than a traditional highgrade canadian gold deposit as such a lot of canadian producers have balked at acquiring pretiumtheyd rather let it prove itself in production and pay more later than have it underperform and be punished by the market the company is in a holding pattern until it reaches production but it trades at a healthy discount to its net asset value  if pretium were able to get to the production levels and cash costs in the current mine model it would be remarkably similar in size and cost level to what used to be osisko mining corps canadian malartic mine something close to that valuation would probably make the private equity folks very happy it would be a multiple of what it paid for its investment  any large private equity investment in a company is usually a vote of confidence but its not to say that they were privy to anything that the rest of us werent pretium is still using the same models and information there may be confidentiality agreements to get additional information but in a project of this nature the vast majority of the information you want to know to make an investment is publicly available private equity is just confident that management is derisking it as much as it can before production read more  the gold report interview with ralph aldis  pretium resources inc is getting there  is the expected date for brucejack to be in production it continues to put out very good drill holes after the drama with the initial bulk sample in late  it delivered  koz as estimated the company just released the fifth set of fan drill definitions and it is continuing to hit i think it had one hole that was  gt one of the brokers jokingly suggested measuring in number of rolexes per ton i think pretium is doing the right work to understand the geometry of the ore body thats so important pretium is getting the right threedimensional picture of the ore and its distribution the great thing is it could literally mine here and repay all its capital in a modestly short period of time even after it depletes the high grade it will still be a huge gold camp who knows where gold prices will be in  years maybe all that other  gt gold will actually be worth something  working capital as of sept   was m we should get an updated funding capital expenditure estimate for the project this quarter because there are other cost savings that will probably come in certainly the exchange rate is very favorable sourcing the equipment with the market in a distressed state could lower prices as well pretium still has a little bit more funding to do but i dont really look at that as a major headwind i was very pleased with the deal that it did for this last set of funding where it negotiated with private equity it also put a cap on the royalty so the company has been very astute about trying to preserve the value for the shareholders and the management team owns a lot of stock themselves im pretty happy with what pretium is doing read more  eric zaunscherb canaccord genuity  pretium resources inc released the

been doing streaming deals for quite some time but the number of ounces that are covered under this streaming deal is capped royalty and streaming companies typically want lifeofmine exposure to give
