share on messenger close steve holland thursday  march   edt first published on thursday  march   edt when james herbert published his first novel the rats  at the age of  it was an immediate bestseller copies of the book – produced cheaply in paperback with a viciouslooking rodent on the cover its jaws open and eyes bloodshot – flew off the shelves the initial print run of  selling out in three weeks behind its cover star the title was printed in bold red type edition after edition came out and changes were subtly made the rat remained but eventually it was the name of herbert who has died aged  that dominated the cover herberts early novels were literary nasties the rats opens with a tramp being devoured alive soon afterwards a baby is killed and partly eaten before her mother can rescue the mutilated body the fog  continued his uncompromisingly explicit visceral exploration of horror innocent villagers and schoolchildren turn psychotic under the influence of a mysterious fog and torture and murder each other the gruesome and depraved events seem all the more horrific for taking place in rural respectable england these novels of catastrophe were compared by stephen king to the music of the sex pistols if the rats with its scenes of gruesome horror and its blasted east end landscape is not a literary version of anarchy in the uk what is but just as a host of brutal horror novels was unleashed in bookshops in the wake of herberts success its progenitor changed tack and took his readers into other fearful territories while the paperback horror genre collapsed under the weight of rats ripoffs and subherbert savagery herberts  novels have sold m copies worldwide he was published in  languages including russian and chinese in  he was made an obe and received the grand master award at the world horror convention he was born in the east end of london the third son of herbert herbert and his wife kitty his parents sold fruit and veg from stalls at brick lane and bethnal green growing up in whitechapel which was damaged by bombing during the second world war herbert attended a local catholic school and earned a scholarship to st aloysius college in highgate north london as a boy herbert was inspired by the american comic book casey ruggles which he found on the market stalls in petticoat lane thats where i learned to write he said for a cowboy comic it was incredible the only time i wrote a fan letter in my life was to its writer and artist warren tufts and that was when i was  i rang up hannabarbera because somebody told me he was working there as an animator and got his address wrote a letter and got a cautious reply back his next letter –  pages explaining his appreciation of ruggles – led to herbert and tufts becoming penpals he also grew up on ghost stories and american horror comics that his brother peter brought home there were the additional reallife horrors of the whitechapel area one of jack the rippers victims had been murdered close to herberts home and a more immediate menace could be found in the stables where his parents stock of fruit and vegetables attracted hordes of rats from the age of  herbert attended hornsey college of art where he spent four years studying graphic design print and photography he worked as a pasteup artist and a typographer at one advertising agency and then became art director and subsequently group head at charles barker advertising herbert had no burning desire to become an author but found himself surrounded by copywriters who were working on novels in order to get out of advertising looking for a challenge he decided to write a novel himself inspired by an image he saw during a latenight showing of dracula  starring bela lugosi – a scene in which renfield has a vision of thousands of rats – herbert poured his energies into the rats for  months and sent out six copies of his finished manuscript to publishers three weeks later he had three replies two rejections and from new english library nel an acceptance the survivor  his third novel concerned the sole survivor of a plane crash who begins to experience visions of the afterlife fluke  was an even greater departure in which a murdered man reincarnated as a dog tracks down his family and solves the mystery surrounding his death in the thriller the spear  a private eye finds himself involved with a neonazi cult that plans to use the power of the spear that pierced the side of christ to take over the world the books brief historical prefaces led to problems when herbert and nel were sued for plagiarism these sections were removed for the paperback edition which thanks to the notoriety of the case returned herbert to the bestseller charts with his next novel lair  herbert regaled readers with the return of the rats and he completed the trilogy with domain  set in a future where rats are now dominant following a nuclear war that has devastated civilisation herberts the city  a graphic novel illustrated by ian miller was set in the same postapocalypse world in which only a handful of people have survived an ancient force is at the centre of the dark  which was reminiscent of the fog and the bane of bad luck dogs a policeman in the jonah  in shrine  a deafmute girl blessed with the power of healing discovers that it is actually a curse and in moon  a man finds himself telepathically linked to a serial killer with the magic cottage  herbert created one of his best novels an unconventional haunted house yarn that is part fairytale part ghost story haunted  originally plotted as a bbc tv movie is also a ghost story the first of three novels featuring david ash a sceptical parapsychologist and psychic investigator who returned in the ghosts of sleath  and ash  the best of herberts later books were more characterdriven creed  features a sleazy paparazzo who can photograph things invisible to the naked eye others  introduces nicholas dismas a private investigator with physical defects and the secret of crickley hall  relates how a couple move to the west country to try to recover from the disappearance of their son it was adapted for bbc tv in  the film and tv versions of herberts other novels were not always successful the survivor  directed by david hemmings and starring robert powell was shot in australia and heavily cut for uk release rats  released in the us as deadly eyes featured dachshunds in rodent costumes haunted and fluke both  received mixed reviews calling upon his background in typography and design herbert saw his books all the way through from the first draft written in longhand in jumbo pads to the finished product he was actively involved in the presentation and promotion of his work he is survived by his wife eileen whom he
