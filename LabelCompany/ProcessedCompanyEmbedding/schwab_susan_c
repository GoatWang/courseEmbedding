jd power ratings data please visit wwwjdpowercomcars and wwwjdpowercomratings  back charles schwab  co inc ranks highest in full service investor satisfaction for second consecutive year costa mesa calif  april  — emerging affluent investors—defined as millennials with  in investable assets—currently control the largest portion of atrisk assets managed by full service financial advisors according to the jd power  us full service investor satisfaction studysm released today surprisingly half  of emerging affluent investors currently working with an advisor say they “probably will” or “definitely will” leave their current firm compared with just  among all other generations of investors wealth managers have been slow to focus on millennials because they don’t yet have the assets boomers do but when looking at potential money in motion—even in the short term—the picture looks quite different said mike foy director of the wealth management practice at jd power with the emergence of roboadvisors and selfdirected platforms investors have more options than ever both within and outside the traditional fullservice channelthe study captures the clearest evidence to date of a historic generational shift that is currently unfolding in the wealth management space noting distinct differences between millennials and other generational groups on indicators such as overall satisfaction economic outlook advisor and firm loyalty and advocacyreferrals this year’s study suggests that advisory firms will need to tailor their offerings to the unique needs of this growing customer basefollowing are some of the key generational findings in the studymillennial money in motion an alarming  of emerging affluent millennials indicate they will definitely or probably leave their current provider in the next  months versus only  of other investors while emerging affluent millennials still represent just  of the overall available investable asset pool they represent  of assets held by investors who are currently at risk of leaving their current investment firmevolving investor needs today just  of full service investors have a documented financial plan and while those plans generally address retirement planning these investors are much less likely to feel they are addressing other financial goals that are a higher priority for millennials eg major purchase or education planning or for boomers who are leaving the work force eg capital preservation or estate planningbrave new world of referrals the firms that are able to create loyalty among millennial clients today can expect significant ongoing rewards among those clients identified as highly likely to recommend millennials made more positive recommendations during the past  months an average of  per client than did boomers  per client and gen x  per client combined but advisors and firms need to actively cultivate this referral source millennials indicated they would be more likely to provide referrals if their advisor asked  or they were incentivized to do so risk of channel defection onefourth  of fullservice millennial investors have either tried or are actively using a roboadvisor platform and  of them rate their satisfaction with this platform higher than for their fullservice firm also more than onethird  have a secondary selfdirected account suggesting a flexibility and openness to a variety of service models not exhibited by investors in other generational groups study rankingscharles schwab  co inc  ranks highest in overall investor satisfaction for a second

susan c schwab united states trade representative biography november   susan c schwab good afternoon this is an exciting time in trade policy there are few issues as important to our nations economic health and security and yet there are few issues as misunderstood i hope todays discussion sheds some light on both aspects of trade firas from california writes how will this free trade agreement benefit america the most why are only these countries listed on the free trade agreement keep up the good work susan c schwabthank you the pending agreements will give american farmers manufacturers workers and service providers access to growing markets for years we have imported nearly all products from peru colombia and panama dutyfree finally our producers will have the same access to their markets when you consider that the population of the three latin american countries is over  million people and korea has another  million it is easy to see that these are pretty significant commercial opportunities in fact the us international trade commission estimates that the korea agreement will add from  to  billion per year to our gdp through enhanced trade in goods alone  not to mention the enhanced export opportunities the fta will afford us service providers or savings it stands to provide to us consumers in addition to these compelling commercial considerations these agreements will strengthen strategic alliances with critical allies the united states had free trade agreements in force with  countries before the bush administration and now we have agreements in place with  countries only three were in place when we came into office that is unprecedented number of free trade agreements ftas under president bushs leadership america has been hard at work opening markets for the products and services americans produce so well we are always looking for new opportunities however not all countries are ready for the comprehensive approach we take to the ftas these agreements must truly level the playing field they are complex and significant undertakings and they have to be done right debbie from texas writes question  what do say to those that say nafta is the cause of the invasion of mexican nationals crossing our borders illegally leaving behind their families to seek employment question  and what do you say to the millions americans that lost their outsource jobs to cheaper labor question  because of the skyrocket home closures do you agree just maybe that free trade is not a good idea at this time for our country susan c schwabdebbie im glad you asked these questions because there are a lot of misperceptions out there about trade nafta has actually resulted in economic opportunities on both sides of the border in the dozen years since nafta us economic growth has been higher and unemployment is lower than in the dozen years before nafta even our manufacturing output has gone up economic change is a permanent part of modern economic life and the transformation can cause dislocations however immigration from mexico as a policy issue predate nafta but you can pretty certain that without nafta and the opportunities it has created on both sides of the border the illegal immigration picture would have looked worse you simply need to be careful not to blame trade for other things going on in the economy in fact the best estimates we have is that trade accounts for two maybe three percent of annual job losses the vast majority of dislocations results from increases in productivity changes in consumer preferences competition among us companies here at home and even the weather when trade does result in job losses however we must assist the communities and individuals involved president bush has emphasized this with support for a better trade adjustment assistance program but we should not be trying to help those adversely affected by trade in ways that hurts the vast majority of americans who benefit from trade what we have to remember is that the economy grew at an annualized rate of  percent this year third quarter with export expansion accounting for almost half of that growth unemployment is also at a low  percent overall we have created over  million jobs in the last four years we have seen that exports have made an important contribution to this economic growth with the problems in the housing market and gas prices on the rise again restricting one source of our growth would be precisely the wrong thing to do at this time john from tx writes lately it seems like free trade means giving away our industries jobs and trade secrets away for free to our competitors why cant we have fair trade where we get something back of equal value now it just serves as a way for our industries to export environemntal problems and workers rights abuses to other countries in the name of corporate profits of course wed like to open up us markets to developing countries so they can become selfsufficient but our trade with china and oilproducing countries seems to be in the longterm selfdestructive especially since we dont produce anything anymore that people cant get elsewhere cheaper now places like dubai and china own us like a colony where they get to exploit our resources susan c schwabas i noted earlier the four trade agreements before the congress open new markets for us exports that already have virtually unlimited access to our market free trade must be fair trade and the benefits of trade must be broadly shared these principles help shape our countrys trade policy the free trade agreements have concluded now have enforceable provisions to safeguard labor rights and environmental protections instead of the us exporting bad practices us companies operating closer to emerging export markets often bring with them high standards that are emulated in other countries it is hard to see how workers or the environment in developing countries will be any better off without these trade agreements the ftas are the best leverage we have to raise standards similarly our trade relationship with china has allowed us to encourage chinas adoption of marketoriented economic reforms the us worked closely to bring china into the rulesbased trading system and china has changed literally thousands of laws to meet its world trade organization obligations we still have a long way to go and we continue to use all the tools we have to ensure china plays by the rules  including bringing legal cases before the wto four of which are currently pending what we cannot do is deny american families and business the goods and services they need closing our market to trade and investment from other countries will only impede job creation foreign direct investment employs some five million americans directly and exports expand opportunities to create additional wellpaying jobs we need to keep goods and capital flowing both ways for fair and mutual benefit i would add however that the united states has the worlds largest production of manufactured products and further that us production of manufactures over the last  years  has grown  slightly fast than the overall us economic  overall job loss in manufacturing reflects to a significant degree the high rates of worker productivity growth achieved in that sector in recent years kim from kentucky writes hi susan what exactly is a trade agreement supposed to accomplish and why were these countries chosen thank you susan c schwabhere is why trade is so important economically for the american economy to grow  for us to be able to create good jobs  we need to open new markets the best way to do that is with free trade agreements congress is set to vote on a free trade agreement with peru this week agreements with colombia panama and korea are right behind peru the united states has long been open to the goods and services from these countries now we have a chance to open their markets to our goods and services these four countries have stated their eagerness to forge deeper and stronger trade ties with us our response must be to grasp their extended hands we know there are leaders around the world who do not share our values of economic and political freedom we will accomplish a lot by establishing stronger relationships with countries that share our vision and in providing their people an alternative path to economic development and political stability hernan from lima  peru writes dear ambassador susan c schwab in the trade agrement between the united states and peru i would like to know what improvement will bring this trade agreement to peruvian workers and american workers because in your country you have higher salaries than peru and in your country you have an equal opportunity employer way of recruiting employees and worker in most companies very different of my country peru thank you very much for your sincerity susan c schwabdear mr herrera the us peru trade promotion agreement will lock in perus preferential access to the us market on a permanent basis this will create a more consistent predictable economic relationship than conditional trade preferences and will generate new trade and investment flows more than that the agreement will encourage more transparency in perus legal and commercial systems stronger protections for intellectual property rights and better access to american services this will help peru continue to modernize and grow its economy together these changes will help peru attract more foreign direct investment create quality jobs and make it easier for perus own entrepreneurs to operate successfully cliff from brimfield ohio writes ambassador schwab you always read about the trade with china but just how much trade do we do with peru colombiaonly thing you hear about them is drugs panama and south korea thank you susan c schwabthere is detailed information on the ustr website wwwustrgov but here are some basic facts our twoway trade with peru has doubled in the last three years to  billion twoway trade with colombia has reached  billion and  billion with panama korea is our seventh largest goods trading partner with twoway trade totaling  billion a year together these four countries represent  million potential consumers for our exports of food manufactured products and services thanks in part to trade initiatives in the s which were aimed at encouraging people to move into the licit formal economy drug trafficking and the violence associated with it in latin america have been greatly reduced members of congress who have visited colombia with administration officials in recent months have discovered a different country than the one that had dominated their perceptions medellin for example once known for its high level of violence is now a city where families are thriving in peace the leaders and the people of peru and colombia have courageously made great strides in establishing peace and stability and are looking to the united states to support those efforts with deeper and stronger trade relationships tarik from springfieldil writes why is free trade good for america why is our current trade defict not a worry for this administration we import more than we export so free trade benefits everyone else more than us why is that a good strategy susan c schwabfrom an economic standpoint trade is good for the economy in two ways one imports allow families to more easily purchase what they want and need whether it is shoes for the kids or the latest hightech gadget imports also allow businesses to obtain the parts and inputs they need at prices to allow them to stay competitive in the international marketplace competition also requires americans to be more efficient to become productive and to concentrate in areas where we have competitive advantages over most other countries more and more our advantage is in the highskill highwage jobs of cuttingedge industries and services this freetrade formula has worked to create an economic system that is the envy of most of the world two trade benefits america because it allows us to send the food we grow the products we make and the services we provide to the rest of the world ninety five percent of the worlds consumers live outside our borders to stay prosperous we need to reach them we cannot build a sustainable economic future by only buying and selling from each other at home recently for example trade has contributed significantly to our economic growth with exports generating some  percent of our gdp growth in the past four quarters the best way to bring down the trade deficit is to expand exports not to restrict imports and in fact this year us exports have increased so much faster than imports that our trade deficit has actually been declining if we want more balance in our trade relationships our trading partners must grow faster and purchase more of what we produce most countries recognize that the path to economic growth is to embrace the market principles that have worked so well for us as other countries prosper from commerce we should see ever expanding opportunities for the united states one final thought about trade deficits is that we have often enjoyed trade surpluses but mainly during recessions the trade deficit while large is also a sign of our prosperity strong consumer demand and a high standard of living matt from university of miami writes madam ambassador thank you for serving president bush and our country we all appreciate your efforts how do you usually respond to people out there who stand against free trade and dont see how crucial it is to support such agreements thank you for taking my question and god bless america susan c schwabby speaking the truth trade is easy to demagogue that is because its occasional negative effects though small overall are often concentrated while its broad benefits are spread so widely in the economy trade gets the blame for all economic ills and is the source of all of our economic anxiety todays pace of economic change can be unsettling and critics of trade often pander to peoples fear rather than stirring their hopes all we can do is to explain that trade helped create prosperity at home and stoked development overseas and warn of the perils of retrenching economically the president has used highlevel platforms such as the united nations to emphasize how important trade is to the promotion of freedom and economic opportunity around the world along with my administration colleagues i devote a lot of time to meeting with stakeholders from agriculture industry services and other groups to lay out the compelling facts about the benefits of trade we give speeches author articles and opinion pieces in the news media supporters of trade need to engage in the debate as well and not be complacent as skepticism about trade continues to be on the rise we also spend a lot of time talking to members of congress from both major political parties listening to their concerns and responding to their suggestions to make the global trading system work better for all yes we do need to help the limited number of individuals and communities that are impacted by trade  but we need to do so in ways that does not jeopardize the significant gains that trade produces for the vast majority of americans susan c schwab it has been a pleasure to explain how trade benefits our economy and enhances our strategic and security interests we are fortunate that more and more countries are eager to use trade to boost their peace freedom and prosperity we should welcome every chance to deepen and strengthen our commercial ties with them thank you printerfriendly

visit wwwjdpowercomcars and wwwjdpowercomratings  back charles schwab  co inc ranks highest in full service investor satisfaction for second consecutive year costa mesa calif  april  — emerging affluent investors—defined as millennials with  in investable assets—currently control the largest portion of atrisk assets managed by full service financial advisors according to the jd power  us full service investor satisfaction studysm released today surprisingly half  of emerging affluent investors currently working with an advisor say they “probably will” or “definitely will” leave their current firm compared with just  among all other generations of investors wealth managers have been slow to focus on millennials because they don’t yet have the assets boomers do but when looking at potential money in motion—even in the short term—the picture looks quite different said mike foy director of the wealth management practice at jd power with the emergence of roboadvisors and selfdirected platforms investors have more options than ever both within and outside the traditional fullservice channelthe study captures the clearest evidence to date of a historic generational shift that is currently unfolding in the wealth management space noting distinct differences between millennials and other generational groups on indicators such as overall satisfaction economic outlook advisor and firm loyalty and advocacyreferrals this year’s study suggests that advisory firms will need to tailor their offerings to the unique needs of this growing customer basefollowing are some of the key generational findings in the studymillennial money in motion an alarming  of emerging affluent millennials indicate they will definitely or probably leave their current provider in the next  months versus only  of other investors while emerging affluent millennials still represent just  of the overall available investable asset pool they represent  of assets held by investors who are currently at risk of leaving their current investment firmevolving investor needs today just  of full service investors have a documented financial plan and while those plans generally address retirement planning these investors are much less likely to feel they are addressing other financial goals that are a higher priority for millennials eg major purchase or education planning or for boomers who are leaving the work force eg capital preservation or estate planningbrave new world of referrals the firms that are able to create loyalty among millennial clients today can expect significant ongoing rewards among those clients identified as highly likely to recommend millennials made more positive recommendations during the past  months an average of  per client than did boomers  per client and gen x  per client combined but advisors and firms need to actively cultivate this referral source millennials indicated they would be more likely to provide referrals if their advisor asked  or they were incentivized to do so risk of channel defection onefourth  of fullservice millennial investors have either tried or are actively using a roboadvisor platform and  of them rate their satisfaction with this platform higher than for their fullservice firm also more than onethird  have a secondary selfdirected account suggesting a flexibility and openness to a variety of service models not exhibited by investors in other generational groups study rankingscharles schwab  co inc  ranks highest in overall investor satisfaction for a second consecutive year followed by
