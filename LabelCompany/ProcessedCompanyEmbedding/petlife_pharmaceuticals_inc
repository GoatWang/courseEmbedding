cancer in pets and humans each year in the us alone more than eleven million cases of cancer in dogs and cats are reported a number that continues to increase annually petlife’s new patentpending formulation has created a “cancer cocktail” combining both blue scorpion venom chlorotoxin with plantbased phytonutrients preliminary testing has shown inhibition against certain cancer cell line studies without toxicity across the world researchers have recognized that many cells which cause disease to have the ability to become resistant to treatment when only one drug is used combination therapy is increasing recommended for the treatment of both neoplastic cancer and infectious disease the “hiv cocktail” which changed the world approach to the treatment of hiv is a similar approach comparison petlife’s new “cancer cocktail” may prove to be the nontoxic alternative to the harmful and sometimes deadly side effects of radiation and chemotherapy the patent pending formulation of petlife’s new “cancer cocktail” has the curious ability to bind selectively to cancer cells and inhibit their growth demonstrating little to no side effects to the patient for hundreds if not thousands of years plantbased medicinals have formed the foundation of therapeutic treatment in the chinese native american and ayurvedic traditions more recently scientists have discovered the mode of action of many of these therapies in many cases the chemical compounds have been manipulated or synthesized to create new chemical entitles “nce” along with the creation of nces comes the inherent risk of unintended consequences and adverse reactions by maintaining an allnatural formulation petlife intends to capture the therapeutic benefit of plantbased therapy without the creation of any unintended consequences our team has identified certain phytonutrients which can work synergistically with blue scorpion venom for inhibition of cancer cell growth “our new formulation rxcxn will become the basis of petlife pharmaceutical’s new product portfolio vitalzultm a novel treatment option for the treatment of cancer and potentially other indications the low toxicity of our formulation gives additional benefit given the comparative biology of animals and humans it is our hope that success in treatment of cancer in animals will lead to similar results in humans our new formulation has been designed with both human and animal applications in mind once testing is completed the company will strategically determine the best course of development in both the pet and human markets” stated dr vivekananda ramana chief medical officer of the company “this groundbreaking patent pending bio technology will serve as the core ingredient in our pharma product vitalzul™ once we complete the much anticipated fda trials it is well known that animal research and studies are the foundation of human applications our first goal is to complete the successful testing fda application and commercialization for the benefit of animals then we will move aggressively in expanding our research in the human arena where we anticipate strong interest from industry leaders” added dr salvagno

first to offer an allnatural “cancer cocktail” combining the therapeutic benefits of the plant and animal kingdoms hancock md  june    petlife pharmaceuticals inc otcqb ptlf the company a developer of a new generation of high potency veterinary cancer medications and nutraceuticals for pets reports on its solution to the ever increasing problem of drug resistance and high toxicity in the treatment of cancer in pets and humans each year in the us alone more than eleven million cases of cancer in dogs and cats are reported a number that continues to increase annually petlife’s new patentpending formulation has created a “cancer cocktail” combining both blue scorpion venom chlorotoxin with plantbased phytonutrients preliminary testing has shown inhibition against certain cancer cell line studies without toxicity across the world researchers have recognized that many cells which cause disease to have the ability to become resistant to treatment when only one drug is used combination therapy is increasing recommended for the treatment of both neoplastic cancer and infectious disease the “hiv cocktail” which changed the world approach to the treatment of hiv is a similar approach comparison petlife’s new “cancer cocktail” may prove to be the nontoxic alternative to the harmful and sometimes deadly side effects of radiation and chemotherapy the patent pending formulation of petlife’s new “cancer cocktail” has the curious ability to bind selectively to cancer cells and inhibit their growth demonstrating little to no side effects to the patient for hundreds if not thousands of years plantbased medicinals have formed the foundation of therapeutic treatment in the chinese native american and ayurvedic traditions more recently scientists have discovered the mode of action of many of these therapies in many cases the chemical compounds have been manipulated or synthesized to create new chemical entitles “nce” along with the creation of nces comes the inherent risk of unintended consequences and adverse reactions by maintaining an allnatural formulation petlife intends to capture the therapeutic benefit of plantbased therapy without the creation of any unintended consequences our team has identified certain phytonutrients which can work synergistically with blue scorpion venom for inhibition of cancer cell growth “our new formulation rxcxn will become the basis of petlife pharmaceutical’s new product portfolio vitalzultm a novel treatment option for the treatment of cancer and potentially other indications the low toxicity of our formulation gives additional benefit given the comparative biology of animals and humans it is our hope that success in treatment of cancer in animals will lead to similar results in humans our new formulation has been designed with both human and animal applications in mind once testing is completed the company will strategically determine the best course of development in both the pet and human markets” stated dr vivekananda ramana chief medical officer of the company “this groundbreaking patent pending bio technology will serve as the core ingredient in our pharma product vitalzul™ once we complete the much anticipated fda trials it is well known that animal research and studies are the foundation of human applications our first goal is to complete the successful testing fda application and commercialization for the benefit of animals then we will move aggressively in expanding our research in the human arena where we anticipate strong interest from industry leaders” added dr salvagno

management comments on recent market activity hancock md  may    petlife pharmaceuticals inc otcqb ptlf the company a developer of a new generation of high potency veterinary cancer medications and nutraceuticals for pets announced the companys comments on recent developments in its stock price and trading performance the company is confident that the main reason of the investors interest in its stock is our business performance which is reflected on the companys website and its press releases httpwwwpetlifepharmacominvestorrelations as well as has been presented to numerous investors during road shows conducted by the company in several cities we have been pleased to announce a string of positive developments with our business which we believe to have been the procuring cause of investors buying our stock at or about the times when the company announced such good businessrelated news or has investor presentations at the same time we became aware of the efforts to promote our stock by various penny stocktouting websites newsletter publishers and ir marketing services unknown to and unaffiliated with the company we first noticed that activity in february  and observed the same type of efforts recently it is our understanding that such promotional activities happen when companies quoted on otc markets publish news which cause the prices of their respective stocks to move third party stock promoters scan the market mention stocks which they find on the move to their subscribers claim credit for such moves and solicit payments from both subscribers and others we do not believe that such promotional activities unauthorized unrelated to and not approved by the company can cause a significant number of investors to buy our stock we strongly believe that the main reasons for the investors buying the stock of our company have been our business performance reflected in press releases and presented to multiple accredited investors during our road shows unfortunately the activities of third party stock promoters seeking to exploit positive developments in our business and appreciation of our stock price have a clear adverse effect on our stock price as follows apparently market makers engaged in predatory short selling are among the most active subscribers to the services of such stock promoters for example our stock price moved up recently as

medications and nutraceuticals for pets announced today that they are exploring various new products for their product line petlife research has verified that scorpion venoms may also have antibacterial and antiinflammatory properties the action of most venoms may be due to the primary toxin but also is likely influenced by other components in the venom these components even in small

formulation the effect of certain venoms as antitumor agents has been cited in the literature aside from the known antitumorigenic action of the primary toxin other components of the venom may explain the venoms action on other disease state cells the petlife research team is evaluating the potential for scorpion venombased therapy for common companion pet diseases such as lyme disease and

focus of many generations from scorpion fossils in the silurian period  million years ago to the pharaohs and chinese dynasties to cuban and dominican traditional remedies scorpion venom is now the focus of today’s modern scientifically based research across the globe the interest has been so great that several eu countries formed venomics sponsored by the french government to specifically study and identify the therapeutic possibilities of all known venoms including scorpion venom the university of chicago cedars sinai in los angeles cornell university michigan state university and the university of washington have extensively researched the therapeutic effects of scorpion venom scientists at petlife have taken this research to another level instead of separating the single molecule from the original complex natural structure and synthesizing it our scientists decided to keep the scorpion peptide in its original form since the mechanism of action of the scorpion venom is multidimensional and complex since the histology cellular biology of humans dogs and cats is quite similar at the molecular level and given the growing body of new preclinical research demonstrating the effectiveness of polarized scorpion venom in human malignancy many companion animal owners as well as veterinarians have been drawn to use vitalzul for pets™ applying science to discover therapies
