comfort rated stars style rated stars was this review helpful these fit wonderfully and look conservative the price is reasonable as well zappos also provided excellent shipping my only complaint is that shoes have quite a bit of oil on the inside which has been rubbing off onto light colored socks it always happens on this type of shoe but it seems the manufacturer went overboard on slathering the leather with too much of this treatment do not let this stop you from getting these shoes id also recommend asics fit very nearly the same fit survey runs small runs large felt true to size runs
