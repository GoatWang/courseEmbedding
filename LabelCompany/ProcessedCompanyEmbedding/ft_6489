operating expenses nongaap operating income nongaap interest and other expense net nongaap income tax expense benefit nongaap net income and nongaap diluted income per common share “nongaap measures” these nongaap measures are not in accordance with or an alternative for measures prepared in accordance with gaap and may be different from nongaap measures used by other companies western digital corporation believes the presentation of these nongaap measures when shown in conjunction with the corresponding gaap measures provides useful information to investors for measuring the company’s earnings performance and comparing it against prior periods specifically we believe these nongaap measures provide useful information to both management and investors as they exclude certain expenses gains and losses that we believe are not indicative of our core operating results or because they are consistent with the financial models and estimates published by many analysts who follow us and our peers as discussed further below these nongaap measures exclude the amortization of acquired intangible assets stockbased compensation expense employee termination asset impairment and other charges acquisitionrelated charges charges related to cost saving initiatives charges related to arbitration award convertible debt activity debt extinguishment costs other charges and income tax adjustments and we believe these measures along with the related reconciliations to the gaap measures provide additional detail and comparability for assessing our results these nongaap measures are some of the primary indicators management uses for assessing our performance and planning and forecasting future periods these measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with gaap but should not be considered a substitute for or superior to gaap results as described above we exclude the following items from our nongaap measures amortization of acquired intangible assets we incur expenses from the amortization of acquired intangible assets over their economic lives such charges are significantly impacted by the timing and magnitude of our acquisitions and any related impairment charges stockbased compensation expense because of the variety of equity awards used by companies the varying methodologies for determining stockbased compensation expense the subjective assumptions involved in those determinations and the volatility in valuations that can be driven by market conditions outside our control we believe excluding stockbased compensation expense enhances the ability of management and investors to understand and assess the underlying performance of our business over time and compare it against our peers a majority of whom also exclude stockbased compensation expense from their nongaap results employee termination asset impairment and other charges from timetotime in order to realign our operations with anticipated market demand or to achieve cost synergies from the integration of acquisitions we may terminate employees andor restructure our operations from timetotime we may also incur charges from the impairment of intangible assets and other longlived assets these charges including any reversals of charges recorded in prior periods are inconsistent in amount and frequency and we believe are not indicative of the underlying performance of our business acquisitionrelated charges in connection with our business combinations we incur expenses which we would not have otherwise incurred as part of our business operations these expenses include thirdparty professional service and legal fees thirdparty integration services severance costs noncash adjustments to the fair value of acquired inventory contract termination costs and retention bonuses we may also experience other accounting impacts in connection with these transactions these charges and impacts are related to acquisitions are inconsistent in amount and frequency and we believe are not indicative of the underlying performance of our business charges related to arbitration award in relation to an arbitration award for claims brought against the company by seagate technology llc which was satisfied in october  and the related dispute over the calculation of postaward interest we have recorded loss contingencies the resulting expense is inconsistent in amount and frequency charges related to cost saving initiatives in connection with the transformation of our business we have incurred charges related to cost saving initiatives which do not qualify for special accounting treatment as exit or disposal activities these charges which we believe are not indicative of the underlying performance of our business primarily relate to costs associated with rationalizing our channel partners or vendors transforming our information systems infrastructure integrating our product roadmap and accelerated depreciation on assets convertible debt activity net we exclude noncash economic interest expense associated with the convertible senior notes the gains and losses on the conversion of the convertible senior notes and call option and unrealized gains and losses related to the change in fair value of the exercise option and call option these charges and gains and losses do not reflect our operating results and we believe are not indicative of the underlying performance of our business debt extinguishment costs from timetotime we replace our existing debt with new financing at more favorable interest rates or utilize available capital to settle debt early both of which generate interest savings in future periods we incur debt extinguishment charges consisting of the costs to call the existing debt andor the writeoff of any related unamortized debt issuance costs these gains and losses related to our debt activity occur infrequently and we believe are not indicative of the underlying performance of our business other charges from timetotime we sell or impair investments or other assets which are not considered necessary to our business operations are a party to legal or arbitration proceedings which could result in an expense or benefit due to settlements final judgments or accruals for loss contingencies or incur other charges or gains which we believe are not a part of the ongoing operation of our business the resulting expense or benefit is inconsistent in amount and frequency income tax adjustments income tax adjustments reflect the difference between income taxes based on a forecasted annual nongaap tax rate and a forecasted annual gaap tax rate as a result of the timing of certain nongaap pretax adjustments view source version on businesswirecom
