the difference between a fund’s actual returns and its expected performance given its level of risk as measured by beta a positive alpha figure indicates the fund has performed better than its beta would predict in contrast a negative alpha indicates the fund’s underperformance given the expectations established by the fund’s beta all mpt statistics alpha beta and rsquared are based on a leastsquares regression of the fund’s return over treasury bills called excess return and the excess returns of the fund’s benchmark index alpha can be used to directly measure the value added or subtracted by a fund’s manager alpha depends on two factors  the assumption that market risk as measured by beta is the only risk measure necessary  the strength of the linear relationship between the fund and the index as it has been measured by rsquared in addition a negative alpha can sometimes result from the expenses that are present in a fund’s returns but not in the returns of the comparison index example a fund has an alpha of  a beta of  and an rsquared of  the high rsquared lends further credibility to the accuracy of the fund’s alpha and beta the alpha of  indicates that the fund produced a return  higher than its beta would predict betaa measure of a fund’s sensitivity to market movements the beta of the market is  by definition morningstar calculates beta by comparing a fund’s excess return over treasury bills to the market’s excess return over treasury bills so a beta of  shows that the fund has performed  better than its benchmark index in up markets and  worse in down markets assuming all other factors remain constant conversely a beta of  indicates that the fund’s excess return is expected to perform  worse than the market’s excess return during up markets and  better during down markets beta can be a useful tool when at least some of a fund’s performance history can be explained by the market as a whole beta is particularly appropriate when used to measure the risk of a combined portfolio of mutual funds it is important to note that a low beta for a fund does not necessarily imply that the fund has a low level of volatility a low beta signifies only that the fund’s marketrelated risk is low standard deviation is a measure of a fund’s absolute volatility a specialty fund that invests primarily in gold for example will usually have a low beta as its performance is tied more closely to the price of gold and goldmining stocks than to the overall stock market thus the specialty fund might fluctuate wildly because of rapid changes in gold prices but its beta will remain low rsquared is a necessary statistic to factor into the equation because it reflects the percentage of a fund’s movements that are explained by movements in its benchmark index example a fund has an alpha of  a beta of  and an rsquared of  the high rsquared lends further credibility to the accuracy of the fund’s alpha and beta the beta of  indicates the fund’s performance is very close to that of the market which would be represented by  compounded annual returnthe compound return is the rate of return usually expressed as a percentage that represents the cumulative effect that a series of gains or losses have on an original amount of capital over a period of time compound returns are usually expressed in annual terms meaning that the percentage number that is reported represents the annualized rate at which capital has compounded over time correlation coefficientthe correlation coefficient is a measure that determines the degree to which two variables’ movements are associated the range of values for the correlation coefficient is  to  if a calculated correlation is greater than  or less than  a mistake has been made a correlation of  indicates a perfect negative correlation while a correlation of  indicates a perfect positive correlation cumulative returnthe aggregate amount that an investment has gained or lost over time independent of the period of time involved presented as a percentage the cumulative return is the raw mathematical return of the following calculation downside deviationdownside deviation is a measure of downside risk that focuses on returns that fall below a minimum threshold or minimum acceptable return mar it is used in the calculation of a risk measure known as the sortino ratiostandard deviation the most widely used measure of investment risk has some limitations such as the fact that it treats all deviations from the average – whether positive or negative – as the same however investors are generally more concerned with negative divergences than positive ones ie downside risk is a bigger concern downside deviation resolves this issue by focusing only on downside riskanother advantage over standard deviation is that downside deviation can also be tailored to the specific objectives and risk profile of different investors who have various levels of minimum acceptable return maximum drawdowna maximum drawdown mdd is the maximum loss from a peak to a trough of a portfolio before a new peak is attained maximum drawdown mdd is an indicator of downside risk over a specified time period it can be used both as a standalone measure or as an input into other metrics such as “return over maximum drawdown” and calmar ratio rsquaredrsquared is a statistical measure that represents the percentage of a fund or security’s movements that can be explained by movements in a benchmark index for fixedincome securities the benchmark is the tbill for equities the benchmark is the sp  sharpe ratiothe sharpe ratio is a measure for calculating riskadjusted return and this ratio has become the industry standard for such calculations it was developed by nobel laureate william f sharpe the sharpe ratio is the average return earned in excess of the riskfree rate per unit of volatility or total risk subtracting the riskfree rate from the mean return the performance associated with risktaking activities can be isolated one intuition of this calculation is that a portfolio engaging in “zero risk” investment such as the purchase of us treasury bills for which the expected return is the riskfree rate has a sharpe ratio of exactly zero generally the greater the value of the sharpe ratio the more attractive the riskadjusted return sortino ratioa modification of the sharpe ratio that differentiates harmful volatility from general volatility by taking into account the standard deviation of negative asset returns called downside deviation the sortino ratio subtracts the riskfree rate of return from the portfolio’s return and then divides that by the downside deviation a large sortino ratio indicates there is a low probability of a large loss standard deviationstandard deviation is a measure of the dispersion of a set of data from its mean the more spread apart the data the higher the deviation standard deviation is calculated as the square root of variancein finance standard deviation is applied to the annual rate of return of an investment to measure the investment’s volatility standard deviation is also known as historical volatility and is used by investors as a gauge for the amount of expected volatilitystandard deviation is a statistical measurement that sheds light on historical volatility for example a volatile stock will have a high standard deviation while the deviation of a stable blue chip stock will be lower a large dispersion tells us how much the return on the fund is deviating from the expected normal returnssources morningstar investopedia share this fachttpswwwfacebookcomelitewealthmgmtrefbrrsebook twitterhttpstwittercomelitewealthmgmt
