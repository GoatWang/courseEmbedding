reprint  printable view  comments    by loraine debonis editorinchief when william bill y tauscher was an undergraduate at yale he negotiated with local merchants to create a discount card for students decades later the yale discount program still is going strong and tauscher is still working with retailers—now as chairman and ceo of blackhawk network “that began my entrepreneurial career … there’s nothing greater than entrepreneurialism” says tauscher who has spent his career building companies making them more profitable and taking some of them public “business makes the world go ’round” he adds “and i like very much being able to play a significant role in providing the direction and in building a team” in his own words in five years prepaid will be “morphing in ways we do not understand today other than knowing that the digital revolution will be the major force for change” the prepaid industry must “make sure it’s always answering a consumer need in everything it does to keep growing” mobile payments “will be a battle fundamentally to own a digitized wallet that can provide an enhanced consumer shopping experience” the most exciting part of my job is “personally engaging with the business partners that make up our network” if i’m not in the office “i’m spending time with family or exercising” tauscher started his professional career at ibm in the retail and distribution division but since the age of  has been his own boss he has acquired and grown several private and public companies including foxmeyer vertical communications coast america acquired by true value and vanstar corporation he also served as managing member of the tauschergroup a company that invests and assists in the management of enterprises and he continues to sit on the board of several companies moving toward autonomy tauscher took the reins as ceo of blackhawk in august of  although he began serving as executive chairman in  coming in a few days a week and working with thenceo don kingsborough on moving the company toward independence “i’ve helped several private companies substantially grow and have taken four companies public this was a role i was wellsuited for” he says tauscher could not give details about a possible blackhawk spinoff from parent safeway although it’s something safeway ceo steven a burd has been open about in earnings calls but tauscher did say the company has been making investments to strengthen its independence “all of our processing platforms are now our own we have our own duplexed data centers with a highavailability setup we have our own financials and our own audits” he explains “those things are important for this business which is very different from the grocery retail business” when he talks about blackhawk’s future and that of the prepaid industry tauscher becomes animated “we view our focus to be in sync with the hot and growing areas” he says although blackhawk’s paypower products are in the spotlightstealing general purpose reloadable gpr segment he begins by talking about the company’s explosive growth in gift “we have to start with our gift card business it’s growing even faster than some of the market leaders in the gpr space” he notes the strong doubledigit growth is largely coming from samestore sales although blackhawk continues to add new locations as well “we’re continuing to expand and our retailers are giving more floor space to gift cards and we’re working with them to increase their promotional activity “we’re spending significant marketing dollars and have proven these expansions are profitable” he says in addition tauscher stresses the importance of execution and “getting back to basics” “in a business like ours the basics of instore merchandising marketing and promotion cannot be understated” it’s that focus that is forging blackhawk’s presence overseas as well where the company is achieving three times the growth of its domestic business another growth area tauscher has his eye on is prepaid wireless minutes and phones “one in five wireless phones is now a prepaid program with no contract” he says “this is the market that’s getting all the growth and it’s predicted to move up to one in three” as such blackhawk is stepping up its efforts in the prepaid wireless arena and providing large destination displays with a broad handset offering in many of its partner locations midwestern roots tauscher attributes his business acumen to being a pragmatist with an analytical mind something he inherited from his parents his dad worked for caterpillar for years and his mother was a school teacher both prized logic the family—tauscher has two brothers—moved around a lot tauscher was born in washington dc but didn’t stay long and although he lived as far west as montana tauscher claims the midwest as his home he spent his high school years in peoria ill and was the first from his public high school to go to an ivy league college today tauscher makes his home in northern california with his wife who runs two businesses they own including a consumer goods company and a gym he has five children—two business owners in their early s who live in dallas one who just graduated college and two still in college when asked about his career tauscher says he’s known since age  that he wanted to be a ceo “my background has been in retail distribution and technology but at the end of the day it’s all about execution” he notes “if you think about the fundamentals of prepaid—we often get caught up in the product its features and its functions—how you acquire customers how you take care of those customers who your partners are and how you manage your whole online presence those are the things that determine the success of anybody in prepaid “you can have a great strategy but what wins in business is outexecuting your competitors”    comment cancel reply your email address will not be published required fields are marked comment name  email

wednesday march     pdt contra costa  political life has taken its toll on more than a few washington marriages but those in the know say that wasnt the case with representative ellen tauscher of contra costa county who has stunned supporters by filing for divorce from her husband of seven years multimillionaire william tauscher this is not a product of her going to washington insists one friend of tauscher what is publicly known is that william tauscher has admitted having an affair  and there apparently were signs that not all was well in paradise even before his democratic wife unseated republican bill baker back in  latest news videos im not surprised in the least said the source we spoke to there were indications that this marital trouble was going on back then still william tauscher a republican was regularly seen at his wifes side throughout the campaign and he contributed  million to her winning effort and from the looks of things his money apparently played a big role in the couples lifestyle as well  which included a washington townhouse on embassy row valued at  million and a home in the tassajara valley valued at  million as tauscher said of her husband in her divorce papers bill has always insisted that we live large he always ensured that we traveled firstclass stayed in fivestar hotels stayed in suites rather than just regular rooms ordered caviar at restaurants rather than regular appetizers drank crystal not just ordinary champagne and paid the tab at each and every meal regardless of who we were with or how many people were dining with us william tauscher said their lifestyle was established mutually he also corrected his wife on another detail he drank dom perignon not crystal the messy divorce is not only a personal embarrassment for tauscher but also a potential political liability if details of the split are dragged out until the next election cycle however few details of the split are spared in divorce papers the couples descent from cloud nine began in november  when ellen tauscher visited the atlanta home where her husband stayed on business for his computer company vanstar and found a card from one of her husbands female employees she also found a photograph of hubby and the other woman at new yorks famous rainbow room where the tauschers themselves were married july   tauscher said that when she pressed her husband about the photo he admitted he was having an affair tauscher said she failed to persuade her husband to stick with counseling to save the marriage  and hence the divorce tauscher now wants to depose the other woman to find out whether her husband was funneling a significant amount of the family income into gifts and entertainment for his girlfriend tauscher a former stockbroker claims she knew little of the couples financial affairs including her husbands assertion that their family bookkeeper had embezzled millions from them tauscher who earns  a year as a member of congress is asking for at least  a month in spousal support and support for the couples daughter her attorney robert nachshin of los angeles who also represented giants slugger barry bonds in his recent divorce said the case is so complicated that documents alone could fill an entire room in fact lawyers in the case have agreed to set up two identical data rooms one in northern california and one in southern california so far ken starr has stayed out of it all  but now that he has so much time on his hands who knows batter upthe andy dolich joe morgan and george zimmer group looking to buy the oakland as

asking price for the as if that does not happen the owners have the option to move the team mr joewe all know joe dimaggio was tough to approach for an autograph  but heres a story about what happened when someone refused to sign one for him it was back in  when japanese emperor akihito and his wife were in town for a blacktie dinner at the asian art museum in golden gate park an avid baseball fan the emperor went out of his way to have both dimaggio and willie mays invited as former protocol chief richard goldman recalls dimaggio said yes even after being told that he would have to pay his own
