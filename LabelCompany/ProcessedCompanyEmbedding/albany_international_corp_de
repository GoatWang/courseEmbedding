forecasts m loss union leader staff july   pm   albany international corp ceo joseph morone said the company is still on track to grow revenue this year  to  percent union leader file  albany international corp said it expects to record a secondquarter pretax charge of approximately  million associated with revisions in the estimated profitability of two contracts in its rochesterbased albany engineered composites segment the charge which will be recorded as part of the companys secondquarter financial results aug  is due to secondquarter  downward revisions of estimated customer demand for the components manufactured by the composites segment related to the two contracts the company said in a news release albany international has a contract to manufacture composite components for the rollsroyce br  engine which powers gulfstreams g business jet the contract obligates the company to supply the components for the life of the br  program during the second quarter albany revised its estimate of the profitability of the contract and determined that an additional charge of approximately  million should be recorded as a provision for anticipated losses through the end of the program the charge is driven primarily by a reduction in the estimated future demand for these components albany said the company previously recorded a charge of  million in the second quarter of  for the program including  million for the writeoff of development costs for nonrecurring engineering and tooling and  million for anticipated future losses albany engineered compositess subsidiary albany aerospace composites llc has a contract to make composite struts for the airbus a under which it is obligated to supply composite wing box struts through  and floor beam struts through  during the second quarter the company revised its estimate of the profitability of the contract and determined that a charge of approximately  million should be recorded as a provision for anticipated losses through contract completion the revision is driven by a decrease in estimated demand for these components during the contract term as well as by program inefficiencies unlike aecs key growth and legacy programs these two programs are exposed to the weakest segments in the commercial aerospace market  business jets and super widebodies ceo joseph morone said in a statement we do not consider either program to be strategic or material to aecs growth prospects combined revenue of the contracts for the first quarter was  million the company said we are meeting customer expectations in both programs but because of very challenging legacy contracts we lost money on both in q  and had been expecting both programs to continue to lose money for several more years before turning profitable morone said albany international is on track to grow revenue  to  percent this year said morone citing what he noted in the companys firstquarter release he said the company has the potential for revenue to reach  million to  million by  while the recording of these projected future losses will obviously have a material impact on q results our outlook for aec  both in  and beyond  remains

file  albany international corp said it expects to record a secondquarter pretax charge of approximately  million associated with revisions in the estimated profitability of two contracts in its rochesterbased albany engineered composites segment the charge which will be recorded as part of the companys secondquarter financial results aug  is due to secondquarter  downward revisions of estimated customer demand for the components manufactured by the composites segment related to the two contracts the company said in a news release albany international has a contract to manufacture composite components for the rollsroyce br  engine which powers gulfstreams g business jet the contract obligates the company to supply the components for the life of the br  program during the second quarter albany revised its estimate of the profitability of the contract and determined that an additional charge of approximately  million should be recorded as a provision for anticipated losses through the end of the program the charge is driven primarily by a reduction in the estimated future demand for these components albany said the company previously recorded a charge of  million in the second quarter of  for the program including  million for the writeoff of development costs for nonrecurring engineering and tooling and  million for anticipated future losses albany engineered compositess subsidiary albany aerospace composites llc has a contract to make composite struts for the airbus a under which it is obligated to supply composite wing box struts through  and floor beam struts through  during the second quarter the company revised its estimate of the profitability of the contract and determined that a charge of approximately  million should be recorded as a provision for anticipated losses through contract completion the revision is driven by a decrease in estimated demand for these components during the contract term as well as by program inefficiencies unlike aecs key growth and legacy programs these two programs are exposed to the weakest segments in the commercial aerospace market  business jets and super widebodies ceo joseph morone said in a statement we do not consider either program to be strategic or material to aecs growth prospects combined revenue of the contracts for the first quarter was  million the company said we are meeting customer expectations in both programs but because of very challenging legacy contracts we lost money on both in q  and had been expecting both programs to continue to lose money for several more years before turning profitable morone said albany international is on track to grow revenue  to  percent this year said morone citing what he noted in the companys firstquarter release he said the company has the

item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations managements discussion and analysis mda is intended to help the reader understand the results of operations and financial condition of the company mda is provided as a supplement to and should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes business environment overview and trends our reportable segments machine clothing mc and albany engineered composites aec draw on the same advanced textiles and materials processing capabilities and compete on the basis of proprietary productbased advantage that is grounded in those core capabilities the machine clothing segment is the companys longestablished core business and primary generator of cash while the paper and paperboard industry in our traditional geographic markets has suffered from welldocumented declines in publication grades the industry is still expected to grow slightly on a global basis driven by demand for packaging and tissue grades as well as the expansion of paper consumption and production in asia and south america we feel we are now wellpositioned in these markets with highquality lowcost production in growth markets substantially lower fixed costs in mature markets and continued strength in new product development field services and manufacturing technology because of pricing pressures and industry overcapacity the machine clothing and paper industries will continue to face top line pressure nonetheless the business has potential for flat earnings in the future it has been a significant generator of cash and we seek to maintain the cashgenerating potential of this business by maintaining the low costs that we achieved through restructuring and competing vigorously by using our differentiated products and services to reduce our customers total cost of operation and improve their paper quality the aec segment provides significant growth potential for our company both near and long term our strategy is to grow by focusing our proprietary technology on highvalue aerospace and defense applications that cannot be served effectively by conventional

approximately  over the next five years driven primarily by secular demand increases in asia and south america with stabilization in the mature markets of europe and north america shifting demand for paper across different paper grades as well as across geographical regions continues to drive the elimination of papermaking capacity in areas with significant established capacity primarily in the mature markets of europe and north america at the same time the newest most efficient machines are being installed in areas of growing demand including asia and south america generally as well as tissue and towel paper grades in all regions recent technological advances in paper machine clothing while contributing to the papermaking efficiency of customers have lengthened the useful life of
