products will face competition from products currently marketed for the treatment of prostate cancer many of which are marketed by firms with significantly greater financial and technical resources than tkai numerous other firms are also developing treatments for prostate cancer that may compete with galeterone major potential competitors include johnson  johnson nysejnj orion corporation janssen biotech inc astellas pharma us inc medivation inc nasdaqmdvn bayer dendreon corporation nasdaqdndn exelixis inc nasdaqexel and bavarian nordic as president and ceo jodie p morrison has served in her current roles and as a member of tkais board since march  she previously held other roles with tkai including coo head of clinical affairs and program operations and vice president of clinical affairs and program operations ms morrison has also served as director of clinical operations and medical affairs at dyax corporation and worked in clinical management positions at curis inc and at diacrin inc ms morrison holds a ba in neuroscience from mount holyoke college her clinical research certification from the boston university school of medicine and her business training through the greater boston executive program at the mit sloan school of management valuation tkai offers the following figures in its s balance sheet for the six months ended june   revenue  net loss  total assets  total liabilities  stockholders equity  tkais current lack of revenue is typical of a precommercial biopharmaceutical firm and should not be interpreted as a sign of its potential for future success tkai will not be able to generate significant revenues until it has commercialized one or more of its product candidates conclusion not yet a buy we are neutral on this stock though tkai remains a significant distance from commercializing galeterone the treatment has shown very promising results in early trials and an improved treatment for prostate cancer would no doubt prove highly profitable for tkai that said the firm will face massive competition even if does receive approval for galeterone and there is no guarantee that another firm will not develop an even better treatment by the time galeterone has been commercialized buying into tkai is more or less a bet on galeterone especially since tkai has little else in its arsenalinvestors will win big or lose big depending on the treatments success we invite readers wishing to join the discussion on ipos to click the follow button above the title of this article and those looking for the latest updates to click get
