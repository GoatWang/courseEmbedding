leaving company to be succeeded by dish cto vivek khemka updated   am eastern last updated at   am by jeff baumgartner follow thebauminator there are big changes afoot at echostar dish network’s technology and settop spinoff as the company has decided to exit the retail home securityautomation market while also announcing that longtime president mark jackson is leaving the company to pursue other opportunities   echostar made note of jackson’s departure in this sec filing jackson who joined echostardish in  as director of engineering has been president of echostar technologies since  and has played a major role in product development at the company through the years   “the entire echostar management team wishes mark the best and we’ll miss his friendship and contribution” mike dugan echostar’s ceo said tuesday on the company’s q earnings call   dugan said he has vivek khemka recently promoted to cto at dish network from svp of product management to succeed jackson and will be transitioning between roles “over the next few months”  dish has been asked if it has yet named a successor cto    update dish confirmed that khemka will remain cto of dish and will be an employee of both companies satellite business news reported monday august  that echostar informed the  to  employees who worked in atlantabased sage facility that they would be losing their jobs as a result of the decision to shut down the product line   dugan said the decision to discontinue its sage by hughes product represents an “initial cut” as echostar looks to focus on “areas that we are confident will produce positive bottom line impact”   echostar didn’t give sage much time to resonate in the market sage by hughes was launched as a retail doityourself product in march and later announced support for products from google’s nest division  a key cog in sage’s engine is a “hub” that connects to tvs echostar has not release any sales figures on sage which had been selling a basic starter kit for  along other packages and platform accessories that can be purchased separately   “although the product had a number of groundbreaking features a dramatic change in the competitive landscape heavily impacted our chance of this product to achieve a significant positive longterm results for echostar” dugan said   dugan later said the decision to get out of that business comes amid the rise of general competition and amid the emergence of small startups that have come on the scene he said it was deemed more prudent to focus on other parts of echostar’s business   “i still think the product has potential it has some great features and so on but for echostar we just werent ready to proceed with that at this time” he said “etc will continue to develop consumerfacing products and we will take some hard lessons learned from our sage efforts” citing other recently introduced products for dish such as the hoppergo and voice remote   echostar’s decision to exit home security and automation also comes as comcast looks to double down its efforts following its recent deal to acquire a big piece of icontrol for a more detailed look at how service providers are targeting the smart home market see this week’s multichannel news cover story subscription required   dugan said echostar will also “continue to heavily invest and develop the sling tv service” referring to dish’s otttv service   echostar posted q revenues of  million down from  million in the yearago quarter and net income of  million up from  million   echostar technology revenues dropped from  million to  million due to lower equipment sales to dish and international customers but were partly offset to increases in billing to dish to support sling tv and other engineering services   want to read more stories
