he handled my divorce quickly my deed transfer solely into my name child support hearing pfa against my ex bf pfa my childrens father put against me between me and our children and most importantly eric was there for me to help our family get justice for my deceased son i was very touched how eric did so much for me and cared about my circumstances he did many extra things to help me that i cannot place a monetary value on when i needed an attorney i was very lucky to be introduced to eric jackson lurie esq by my friend who also had an excellent experience with eric winning his case for him in court i recently retained eric for a pfa that was put against me by my ex between me  my children who ive had custody of for  yrs  still do it was false allegations but eric took the time to explain to me the process of what could happen and i knew he could help me i felt like eric genuinely cared about me and he went above and beyond helping me he thoroughly explained his agreement of his duties and the details when i retained him before i signed the contract and paid he asked me if i had any questions about everything he spoke with me about and he made me feel welcomed to call him if i had any other questions that i thought of after i left his office i had heard how well he was in court but that did not prepare me enough for what an excellent job he actually did in court  when it was court day i felt confident in eric that he was going to do a good job and i was able to be at ease eric did talk to me prior to court day to explain the different possibilities of the outcomes and i valued his honesty i was amazed at how well he cross examined opposing counsel  we won in court with the allegations that were against me i knew if i didnt have eric i may not have had the same outcome eric met with me on a saturday even though it was the weekend before christmas eve to give me a copy of the order to dismiss so i could get my kids back in time to enjoy the holidays with them i would highly recommend eric jackson lurie esq to anyone in need of an attorney and have already recommended him to people eric helped me with many things and i value his knowledge in criminal

exemplary ability to formulate a plan and execute it when she tells me that she is going to do something i do not wonder if it will get done jill does what she says she will do when she says she will
