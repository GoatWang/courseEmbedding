affecting sales in light of changing buyer expectations and behaviors as well as a shifting global economy gap has made deliberate moves towards a radically different retail strategy by drew hendricks drew hendricks is a tech social media and environmental addict hes written for many major publications such as forbes and entrepreneur drewahendricks contributor inccomdrewahendricks write a comment credit shutterstock images not long ago gap and its related retailers were among the most popular destinations for backtoschool shoppers with apparel and accessory options at various price points for all age groups the classic brand once enjoyed spiked sales and soaring profits during the late summer and early fallhowever gaps most recent sales numbers appear to show a shift away from its favored status in the hearts and wallets of shoppers although the company aggressively advertised and discounted throughout backtoschool season sales remained stagnant the lone bright spot during the month was the positive momentum gained by its old navy storesrecent changes to gap incs retail strategy are raising the question of whether the brand is making the right choices to remain competitive could its august sales slump be an indicator of more bad news to comewhat has been changing at gap inc the companys multipronged approach shows several deviations from its previous approach includingexpansion in asia the growing apparel markets in the east have attracted the retailer which is set to open  stores in india and  in china over the next year rising incomes and massive populations in the region make it an area of enormous potential for gap and its related lifestyle brandsacquisition of new brands shoppers have been familiar with gap brands banana republic and old navy for years but the company has continued to acquire new online and virtual brands such as piperlime athleta and intermix this has diversified its offerings as well as its target audiencesfewer brick and mortars in  gap closed the doors to  of its stores in the united states at the time the retailer cited higher efficiency and profit margins as the objective for its store closingsonline sales focus at the same time gap has been placing a greater emphasis on sales through gapcom which also conveniently links to its other brands for a seamless and allencompassing shopping experience for its brand enthusiasts although these tactics have met with varying levels of success their impact on the brands longterm growth and global reputation will continue to unfold over the next several years this will certainly serve as a lesson to its competitors as they formulate their global strategies both virtually and online how balancing physical  virtual locations helps companies when companies like gap operate brick and mortar retail establishments in addition to ecommerce websites the balancing act between the two can be a challenge however when businesses achieve this it yields a number of benefits to the corporation and its customers alike includingpersonal connections the ability to walk into a store try on clothes and talk with retail associates is something many shoppers value when too few physical stores remain within an individuals area he or she may choose companies with a stronger brick and mortar presencetouch points brands that meet their customers wherever they are stand the best chance of remaining competitive in a multidimensional economy those unlikely to visit a mall or shopping center may be more apt to make a purchase from an online retailer while online advertising and sales efforts may be lost on those preferring a more traditional shopping experiencepurchasing options online and instore shopping each present their own advantages and disadvantages which may apply to the same shoppers at different times during the same day month or week someone who needs a new outfit the next day cant afford to wait for a purchase to ship whereas someone with a busy work schedule may be unable to walk into a store during its business hours in addition an online purchase remains impossible for those seeking to pay with cashwhen providing online and instore shopping options one of the most important components of the retail experience is the point of sale a business offering a wide range of payment options and making the process as quick and uncomplicated as possible will enjoy the highest numbers of converted and returning customersone way to achieve this is by utilizing highquality pointofsale systems businesses of all sizes can accept a wide range of payment types with new mobile payment options such as square and paypal which attach directly to ones mobile device and allow them to complete transactions anywhere they travel for
