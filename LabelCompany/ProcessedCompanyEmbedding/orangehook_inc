value is very positive registration time was cut from four minutes to one minute we are issuing an average of  smart cards daily significantly diminishing the amount of time needed by our people to

patient identity is the basis for healthcare without it the industry struggles to ensure that each party is sharing correct information about the correct patient current registration is set up to capture patient demographics and generate a record for that patient however this process stops short of establishing a highly reliable identity making it difficult for a patient’s record to be confidently known and shared across the care continuum this puts the patient and organization at risk common elements that contribute to this obstacle are human error and fraud name spelling name change from marriage nick names outdated vs current addresses insurance status and others  news and press how the solution works establishing a source of truth for health systems globally starts by establishing multifactor authentication for patients – a design that confirms identity by utilizing a combination of least two different factors something you have something you know something you are we call this a secure patient token and it establishes the “ patient  record” or “ patient all correct records” concept this platform can be applied across public and private healthcare environments

disruptive technology solutions centered on healthcare big data safety and banking transaction designed to establish public company platform that adds the orangehook suite of product and service offerings to nuvel’s existing operations substantially reduce nuvel’s existing debt and preserve value opportunity for existing nuvel shareholders los gatos calif and minneapolis july   globe newswire  nuvel holdings inc otc pinknuvl has entered into a definitive merger agreement with orangehook inc of minneapolis minnesota a privatelyheld software as a service saas conglomerate  upon closing of the transaction the combined company will be fully reporting and publiclytraded and will consist of five operating entities that use complementary proprietary technology to offer disruptive and potentially lifechanging applications centered on healthcare bigdata safety and banking the material terms of the agreement are summarized in a current report on form k of nuvel filed with the securities and exchange commission on friday july    in the transaction nuvel will issue shares of two new classes of preferred stock to orangehook shareholders in exchange for all of orangehook’s preferred and common stock  following the merger nuvel will effect a reverse split of its common stock after which the preferred shares issued in the merger to orangehook’s common shareholders will convert into one share of common stock in the combined company for each share of orangehook common stock held immediately prior to the merger and a substantial majority of nuvel’s existing debt will be exchanged for equity in the combined company    the existing shareholders of nuvel will have the opportunity to participate in ongoing growth opportunities in the combined company such shareholders who hold nuvel common stock immediately after closing of the merger or a record date declared shortly thereafter will be eligible to receive up to an aggregate of  shares of nuvel common stock on a prorata basis if the nuvel inc operating entity achieves a  million revenue milestone as measured and within the timeframes specified in the agreement  based on current projections management of the combined company is optimistic about the achievement of the earnout milestone  for purposes of structuring the transaction the parties used an assumed  per share valuation for orangehook’s common stock which is the same valuation that orangehook used to structure the prior acquisitions of its other portfolio companies  based on the assumed  per share valuation of orangehook common stock the value of these prior transactions totaled approximately  million  this assumed valuation of orangehook common stock was arbitrarily determined based upon proforma financial projections of orangehook management and there exists no quantifiable valuation analysis to support the same aside from internal projections based upon existing contracts of the combined companies among other factors following the merger the combined company will change its name to orangehook and plans to trade under a yet to be determined orangehookrelated trading symbol the combined company will immediately encompass the expanded offerings of the orangehook portfolio within the newly formed and recapitalized company subsequent to the merger the combined company plans to apply for listing on a national securities exchange as soon as reasonably practical rick resnick nuvel’s ceo commented “this transaction allows nuvel to more freely move forward as a result of the elimination of the vast majority of our current debt which we believe positions the company for substantial growth and stability  we believe the transaction offers a fair exchange for existing nuvel common shareholders through the participation in a future earnout distribution based on a revenue milestone we are confident of achieving” james mandel orangehook ceo commented “we are very pleased to achieve the next step in our company’s evolution which sets the stage for the public launch of our suite of disruptive and potentially lifechanging applications designed to change the world we live in for the better in areas including mobile payments healthcare information billing and payments data compression and storage and emergency responder coordination  although we acknowledge that we are setting a high bar with our operating goals we strongly believe that customer acceptance of our solutions and the real world need for the same will validate our optimism  we expect the coordinated and sophisticated deployment of our product and service offerings will create substantial value for existing orangehook and nuvel shareholders as well as future investors” subject to satisfaction or waiver of closing conditions set forth in the merger agreement the parties expect to close on the merger portion of the transaction in august  and to effect the postmerger reverse split recapitalization to be completed by
