commodity trading advisor nfa member and commodity pool operator in october of  investment goal forts goal is to generate the highest quality of riskadjusted returns   capital is allocated dynamically over time frames models and markets contracts based on a statistical learning process this learning process tends to favor winners and losers for an allocation while shying away from average performers time frame models and markets markets traded interest rates currencies equity indices energy precious metals strategy fort’s goal is to generate the highest quality of riskadjusted returns for its clients fort’s contrarian strategy is a technical fully systematic trendanticipation strategy that tries to capture performance around trends in a novel way traditional trendfollowing strategies are usually late to enter and late to exit because they must wait for confirmation of a trend to enter or exit their positions by design the contrarian strategy is usually early in entering and exiting trends the strategy systematically tries to identify price behaviors that signal turning points in the markets and then takes positions in those markets while the price is still moving in the opposite direction  in addition to capturing a fundamentally different part of the trend movement from traditional trendfollowers this system design allows the contrarian strategy to perform better than traditional trendfollowers in choppy markets because it also captures performance in shorterterm market movements or noise around the trend the strategy is constructed to be statistically robust which enables it to perform well over the longterm capital is allocated dynamically over time frames models and markets contracts based on a statistical learning process this learning process tends to favor winners and losers for an allocation while shying away from average performers time frame models and markets the selection process uses bayesian statistical techniques where fort’s prior is the statistical prediction of the past thus the strategy evolves incrementally each day  key personnel dr yves balcer phd principal — dr balcer has been a principal of fort since  from  to

with managed futures programs the success of an investment in such a program is dependent upon the ability of a commodity trading advisor “cta” to identify profitable investment opportunities and successfully trade the identification of attractive trading opportunities is difficult requires skill and involves a significant degree of uncertainty the high degree of leverage often obtainable in futures trading can work against you as well as for you and can lead to large losses returns generated from a cta’s trading if any may not adequately compensate you for the business and financial risks you assume you can lose all or a substantial amount of your investment managed futures accounts may be subject to substantial charges for management and advisory fees it may be necessary for accounts that are subject to these charges to make substantial trading profits in order to avoid depletion or exhaustion of their assets ctas may trade highly illiquid markets or on foreign markets and may not be able to close or offset positions immediately upon request you may have market exposure even after the cta has a request for closure or liquidation past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results there is risk of loss you can lose money in a managed futures program
