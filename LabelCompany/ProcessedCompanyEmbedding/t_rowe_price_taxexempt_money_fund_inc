fund is appropriate for you this section takes a closer look at their investment objectives and approach the fund or funds you select should reflect your individual investment goals but should not represent your complete investment program no fund should be used for shortterm trading purposes what are the funds objectives and investment programs taxexempt money fund the funds objectives are to seek preservation of capital liquidity and consistent with these objectives the highest current income exempt from federal income taxes the funds yield will fluctuate in response to changes in the general level of interest rates but the share price is managed to remain stable at  although the fund has maintained a constant share price since its inception and fund managers will make every effort to continue to meet this objective the price could drop below  under certain circumstances such as a major change in interest rates or default on one or more fund holdings unlike a bank account or certificate of deposit your investment is not insured or guaranteed by the us government the fund generally purchases securities with maturities of  months or less and its dollarweighted average maturity will not exceed  days all securities purchased by the fund will have ratings in the two highest categories established by nationally recognized rating agencies or if unrated will be of equivalent quality as determined by t rowe price analysts the fund may retain a security that is downgraded after purchase but only in accordance with rule a under the investment company act of  for further details about the funds investment programs risks and fundamental policies please see the section investment policies and practices taxfree shortintermediate fund the funds objective is to seek a high level of income exempt from federal income taxes consistent with modest price fluctuation by investing primarily in municipal securities in the four highest credit categories the fund will not purchase any bonds rated below investment grade eg bbb by a national rating agency or if unrated the t rowe price equivalent this policy does not prohibit the fund from retaining a security that is downgraded after purchase investmentgrade securities include a range of securities from the highest rated to medium quality bbb securities in the bbb category may be more susceptible to adverse economic conditions or changing circumstances and securities at the lower end of the bbb category have certain speculative characteristics this is the most conservative of the four t rowe price taxfree bond funds under normal market conditions its dollarweighted average maturity will range between two and five years and as a result its price fluctuation should be modest in response to changes in interest rates its interest income should be above the money fund but lower than the other bond funds taxfree insured intermediate bond fund the funds objective is to seek a high level of income exempt from federal income taxes and moderate price fluctuation while minimizing credit risk by investing primarily in insured municipal securities by maintaining a dollarweighted average maturity between  and  years this fund should provide higher income and volatility than the short intermediate fund and lower income and volatility than the other bond funds for extra credit quality protection the fund will invest at least  of its total assets in municipals insured by companies carrying the highest credit rating from a national rating  t rowe price  about the funds the bond funds may retain a security whose credit quality is downgraded after purchase organization eg aaa by standard  poors or aaa by moodys investors service the insurers rating determines the rating of the insured bond up to  of assets may also be invested in other municipals rated at least aa or aa by rating agencies or if unrated believed to be of comparable quality at the time of purchase taxfree income fund the funds objective is to seek a high level of income exempt from federal income taxes by investing primarily in longterm investmentgrade municipal securities the fund has no maturity restrictions but normally its dollarweighted average maturity will exceed  years as such the fund is suitable for more aggressive investors than the funds with shorter average maturities it will be actively managed to seek capital appreciation and minimize losses due to interest rate movements from time to time the fund may purchase belowinvestmentgrade securities including those that have received the lowest rating or are not rated by a national rating agency however no such purchase will be made if it would cause the funds investments in noninvestment grade bonds to exceed  of total assets the combination of long maturity and lower credit quality makes the high yield fund potentially the most risky as well as potentially the most rewarding of the taxfree funds see high yield high risk investing taxfree high yield fund the funds objective is to seek a high level of income exempt from federal income tax by investing primarily in longterm low to uppermediumquality municipal securities this is the most aggressive of our bond funds and should provide the highest income because the average credit quality of its holdings is lower than our other funds less creditworthy borrowers must offer higher interest payments to compensate investors for taking greater risk the fund may invest a substantial portion of assets in noninvestmentgrade municipal bonds which have a higher risk of default than investmentgrade bonds similar bonds in the taxable bond market are called junk the fund may also purchase bonds that are in default but such bonds are not expected to exceed  of the funds total assets lowerquality municipals are more vulnerable to real or perceived changes in the business climate than higherquality bonds and they may also be considerably less liquid and more volatile in price as a result we rely heavily on our proprietary research when selecting investments and judgment may play a bigger role in valuing the funds securities the fund has no maturity restrictions but normally  of its total assets will have maturities over  years a more detailed discussion of these and other risk considerations is contained in the funds statement of additional information what are the main risks of investing in municipal bond and money market funds since they are managed to maintain a  share price money market funds should have little risk of principal loss the potential for realizing a loss of principal in a bond or money fund could derive from  interest rate or market risk the decline in fixedincome securities and funds that may accompany a rise in the overall level of interest rates please see table  a sharp and unexpected rise in interest rates could cause a money funds price to drop below one dollar however the extremely shortterm securities held in money market portfoliosa means of achieving an overall fund objective of principal safetyreduces much of their potential for price fluctuation t rowe price   about the funds  credit risk the chance that any of a funds holdings will have its credit rating downgraded or will default fail to make scheduled interest and principal payments potentially reducing the funds income level and share price money funds invest in very highly rated securities thus reducing this risk  political risk the chance that a significant restructuring of federal income tax rates or even serious discussion on the topic in congress could cause municipal bond prices to fall the demand for municipal bonds is strongly influenced by the value of taxexempt income to investors broadly lower tax rates could reduce the advantage of owning municipal bonds  geographical the chance of price declines resulting from developments in a single state the yield of each fund will fluctuate with changing market conditions and interest rate levels the share price of the bond funds will also fluctuate when you sell your shares you may lose money how does t rowe price try to reduce risk consistent with each funds objective the portfolio manager actively manages bond and money funds in an effort to manage risk and increase total return risk management tools include  diversification of assets to reduce the impact of a single holding on a funds net asset value  thorough credit research by our own analysts  adjustments in a funds duration to try to reduce the negative impact of rising interest rates or take advantage of the favorable effects of falling rates depending on market outlook the investment manager may shorten or lengthen a funds average effective maturity and duration within the ranges and guidelines established in this prospectus what are derivatives and can the funds invest in them the term derivative is used to describe financial instruments whose value is derived from an underlying security eg a stock or bond or a market benchmark eg an interest rate index many types of investments representing a wide range of potential risks and rewards fall under the derivatives umbrellafrom conventional instruments such as callable bonds futures and options to more exotic investments such as stripped mortgage securities and structured notes while the term derivative has only recently become widely known among the investing public derivatives have in fact been employed by investment managers for many years each fund will invest in derivatives only if the expected risks and rewards are consistent with its objective policies and overall risk profile as described in this prospectus the money fund does not invest in high risk highly leveraged derivatives the other funds limit their use of derivatives to situations in which they may enable the fund to increase yield hedge against a decline in principal value invest in eligible asset classes with greater efficiency and lower cost than is possible through direct investment or adjust the funds duration these funds will not invest in any high risk highly leveraged derivative instrument which is expected to cause the price volatility of the portfolio to be meaningfully different from that of  a fiveyear investmentgrade bond for the shortintermediate fund  an intermediateterm investmentgrade bond for the insured intermediate bond fund or  a longterm investmentgrade bond for both the income and high yield funds  t rowe price  about the funds before choosing a fund you may wish to review these characteristics of municipal securities who issues municipal securities state and local governments and governmental authorities sell notes and bonds usually called municipals to pay for public projects and services who buys municipal securities individuals are the primary investors and a principal way they invest is through mutual funds prices of municipals may be affected by major changes in flows of money into or out of municipal funds for example substantial and sustained redemptions from municipal bond funds could result in lower prices for these securities what is taxfree about municipal bonds and bond funds the regular income dividends you receive from the fund are exempt from federal income taxes in addition your state may not tax that portion of the funds income earned on the states own obligations if any however capital gains distributed by the funds are taxable to you see useful information on distributions and taxes for details municipal securities are also called taxexempts because the interest income they provide is usually exempt from federal income taxes is interest income from municipal issues always exempt from federal taxes no for example since  income from socalled private activity municipals has been subject to the federal alternative minimum tax amt for instance some bonds financing airports stadiums and student loan programs fall into this category shareholders subject to the amt must include income derived from private activity bonds in their amt calculation relatively few taxpayers are required to pay the tax normally the funds will not purchase any security if as a result more than  of the funds income would be subject to the amt the funds will report annually to shareholders the portion of income if any subject to amt please see distributions and taxestaxes on fund distributions why are yields on municipals usually below those on otherwise comparable taxable securities since the income provided by most municipals is exempt from federal taxation investors are willing to accept lower yields on a municipal bond than on an otherwise similar in quality and maturity taxable bond how can i tell if a taxfree or taxable fund is more suitable for me the primary factor is your expected federal income tax rate the higher your tax bracket the more likely taxfrees will be appropriate if the aftertax yield on a taxable bond or money market security is less than a municipal funds taxexempt yield then your income will be higher in the municipal fund to find what a taxable fund would have to yield to equal the taxfree yield on a municipal bond divide the municipal bonds yield by one minus your tax rate what are the major differences between money market and bond funds  price bond funds have a fluctuating share price money market funds are managed to maintain a stable share price  maturity short and intermediateterm bond funds have longer average maturities from  to  years than money market funds  days or less longerterm bond funds have the longest average maturities  years or more of course unlike a money market fund the share prices of bond funds will fluctuate and your investment may be worth more or less on redemption than at purchase t rowe price   about the funds  income short and intermediateterm bond funds typically offer more income than money market funds and less income than longerterm bond funds you may want to review some fundamentals that apply to all fixedincome investments is a funds yield fixed or will it vary it will vary the yield is calculated every day by dividing a funds net income per share expressed at annual rates by the share price since both income and share price will fluctuate a funds yield will also vary although money fund prices are stable income is variable is a funds yield the same thing as the total return no for bond funds your total return is the result of reinvested income and the change in share price for a given time period income is always a positive contributor to total return and can enhance a rise in share price or serve as an offset to a drop in share price since money funds are managed to maintain a stable share price their yield and total return should be the same what is credit quality and how does it affect a funds yield credit quality refers to a bond issuers expected ability to make all required interest and principal payments in a timely manner because highly rated bond issuers represent less risk they can borrow at lower interest rates than less creditworthy issuers therefore a fund investing in highquality securities should have a lower yield than an otherwise comparable fund investing in lower credit quality securities what is meant by a bonds or bond funds maturity every bond has a stated maturity date when the issuer must repay the securitys entire principal value to the investor some types of bonds may also have an effective maturity that is shorter than the stated date many corporate and municipal bonds are callable meaning the principal can be repaid before their stated maturity dates on or after specified call dates bonds are most likely to be called when interest rates are falling because the issuer wants to refinance at a lower rate in such an environment a bonds effective maturity is usually its nearest call date a bond or money market mutual fund has no maturity in the strict sense of the word but does have a dollarweighted average maturity this number is an average of the stated maturities of the underlying bonds with each maturity weighted by the percentage of fund assets it represents funds that target effective maturities would use the effective rather than stated maturities of the underlying instruments when computing the average targeting effective maturity provides additional flexibility in portfolio management but all else being equal could result in higher volatility than a fund targeting a stated maturity or maturity range what is meant by a bonds or bond funds duration duration is the timeweighted value of discounted future interest and principal payments expressed in years it measures bond price sensitivity to interest rate changes more accurately than maturity because it takes into account the time value of cash flows generated over the bonds life future interest and principal payments are discounted to reflect their present value and then are multiplied by the number of years they will be received to produce a value that is expressed in years ie the duration effective duration takes into account call features and sinking fund payments that may shorten a bonds life  t rowe price  about the funds since duration can also be computed for bond funds you can estimate the effect of interest rates on a bond funds share price simply multiply the funds duration available for t rowe price bond funds in our shareholder reports by an expected change in interest rates for example the price of a bond fund with a duration of five years would be expected to fall approximately  if rates rose by one percentage point how is a municipals price affected by changes in interest rates when interest rates rise a municipals price usually falls and vice versa in general the longer the bonds maturity the greater the price increase or decrease in response to a given change in interest rates as shown in the table to the right how interest rates affect bond prices bond maturity coupon price per  of bond face value if interest rates increase decrease        year         years         years         years         years        table  coupons reflect yields on aaarated municipals as of april   this is an illustration and does not represent expected yields or share price changes of any t rowe price fund do money market securities react to changes in interest rates yes as interest rates change the prices of money market securities fluctuate but changes are usually small because of their very short maturities how can i decide which investments are most appropriate for me review your own financial objectives time horizon and risk tolerance use table  which summarizes the funds main characteristics to help choose a fund or funds for your particular needs for example only the taxexempt money fund provides principal stability which makes it a good choice for money you may need for contingencies however if

pricing shares and receiving sale proceeds here are some procedures you should know when investing in a fund this section applies to all t rowe price taxfree bond and money funds the various ways you can buy sell and exchange shares are explained at the end of this prospectus and on the new account form these procedures may differ for institutional accounts how and when shares are priced bond and money funds the share price also called net asset value or nav per share for each fund is calculated at  pm et each day the new york stock exchange is open for business to calculate the nav a funds assets are valued and totaled liabilities are subtracted and the balance called net assets is divided by the number of shares outstanding money fund navs which are managed to remain at  are calculated at noon et each day as well as  pm amortized cost or amortized market value is used to value money fund securities that mature in  days or less how your purchase sale or exchange price is determined if we receive your request in correct form before  pm et your transaction will be priced at that days nav if we receive it after  pm it will be priced at the next business days nav we cannot accept orders that request a particular day or price for your transaction or any other special conditions when filling out the new account form you may wish to give yourself the widest range of options for receiving proceeds from a sale note the time at which transactions are priced and the time until which orders are accepted may be changed in case of an emergency or if the new york stock exchange closes at a time other than  pm et how you can receive the proceeds from a sale if your request is received by  pm et in correct form proceeds are usually sent on the next business day proceeds can be sent to you by mail or to your bank account by ach transfer or bank wire proceeds sent by ach transfer should be credited the second day after the sale ach automated clearing house is an automated method of initiating payments from and receiving payments in your financial institution account ach is a payment system supported by over  banks savings banks and credit unions which electronically exchange the transactions primarily through the federal reserve banks proceeds sent by bank wire should be credited to your account the next business day if for some reason we cannot accept your request to sell shares we will contact you exception  under certain circumstances and when deemed to be in the funds best interests your proceeds may not be sent for up to five business days after receiving your sale or exchange request if you were exchanging into a bond or money market fund your new investment would not begin to earn dividends until the sixth business day t rowe price   about your account useful information on distributions and taxes the funds distribute all net investment income and realized capital gains to shareholders dividends and other distributions dividend and capital gain distributions are reinvested in additional fund shares in your account unless you select another option on your new account form the advantage of reinvesting distributions arises from compounding that is you receive interest and capital gain distributions on a rising number of shares dividends not reinvested are paid by check or transmitted to your bank account via ach if the post office cannot deliver your check or if your check remains uncashed for six months the fund reserves the right to reinvest your distribution check in your account at the then current nav and to reinvest all subsequent distributions in shares of the fund income dividends  bond funds declare income dividends daily at  pm et to shareholders of record at that time provided payment has been received on the previous business day  money funds declare income dividends daily at noon et to shareholders of record at that time provided payment has been received by that time  bond and money funds pay dividends on the last business day of each month  bond and money fund shares will earn dividends through the date of redemption shares redeemed on a friday or prior to a holiday will continue to earn dividends until the next business day generally if you redeem all of your shares at any time during the month you will also receive all dividends earned through the date of redemption in the same check when you redeem only a portion of your shares all dividends accrued on those shares will be reinvested or paid in cash on the next dividend payment date capital gains  a capital gain or loss is the difference between the purchase and sale price of a security  if the fund has net capital gains for the year after subtracting any capital losses they are usually declared and paid in december to shareholders of record on a specified date that month if a second distribution is necessary it is usually declared and paid during the first quarter of the following year tax information although the regular monthly income dividends you receive from the funds are expected to be exempt from federal income taxes you need to be aware of the possible tax consequences when  you sell fund shares including an exchange from one fund to another or  the fund makes a short andor longterm capital gain distribution to your account due to  tax legislation a portion of the capital gains realized on the sale of market discount bonds with maturities beyond one year may be treated as ordinary income and cannot be offset by other capital losses therefore to the extent the fund invests in these securities the likelihood of a taxable gain distribution will be increased  t rowe price  about your account note you must report your total taxexempt income on irs form  the irs uses this information to help determine the tax status of any social security payments you may have received during the year the funds send timely information for your tax filing needs taxes on fund redemptions when you sell shares in any fund you may realize a gain or loss an exchange from one fund to another is still a sale for tax purposes if you realize a loss on the sale or exchange of fund shares held six months or less your capital loss is reduced by the taxexempt dividends received on those shares in january the funds will send you form b indicating the date and amount of each sale you made in the fund during the prior year this information will also be reported to the irs for accounts opened new or by exchange in  or later we will provide you the gain or loss of the shares you sold during the year based on the average cost method this information is not reported to the irs and you do not have to use it you may calculate the cost basis using other methods acceptable to the irs such as specific identification to help you maintain accurate records we send you a confirmation immediately following each transaction except for systematic purchases and redemptions and a yearend statement detailing all your transactions in each fund account during the year capital gain distributions are taxable whether reinvested in additional shares or received in cash taxes on fund distributions in january the funds will send you form div indicating the tax status of any capital gain distribution made to you this information will also be reported to the irs all capital gain distributions are

section should help you understand the terms used to describe the funds performance you will come across them in shareholder reports you receive from us four times a year in our newsletter insights in reports in t rowe price advertisements and in the media total return is the most widely used performance measure detailed performance information is included in the funds annual reports and quarterly shareholder reports total return this tells you how much an investment in the fund has changed in value over a given time period it reflects any net increase or decrease in the share price and assumes that all dividends and capital gains if any paid during the period were reinvested in additional shares including reinvested distributions means that total return numbers include the effect of compounding ie you receive income and capital gain distributions on a rising number of shares advertisements for the fund may include cumulative or compound average annual total return figures which may be compared with various indices other performance measures or other mutual funds cumulative total return this is the actual rate of return on an investment for a specified period a cumulative return does not indicate how much the value of the investment may have fluctuated between the beginning and the end of the period specified average annual total return this is always hypothetical working backward from the actual cumulative return it tells you what constant yearbyyear return would have produced the actual cumulative return by smoothing out all the variations in annual performance it gives you an idea of the investments annual contribution to your portfolio provided you held it for the entire period in question  t rowe price  more about the funds yield you will see frequent references to the funds yields in our reports in advertisements in media stories and so on the current or dividend yield on the fund or any investment tells you the relationship between the investments current level of annual income and its price on a particular day the dividend yield reflects the actual income paid to shareholders for a given period annualized and divided by the average price during the given period for example a fund providing  of annual income per share and a price of  has a current yield of  yields can be calculated for any time period the money fund may advertise a current yield reflecting the latest day income annualized or an effective yield which assumes the income has been reinvested in the fund for the bond funds the advertised or sec yield is found by determining the net income per share as defined by the sec earned by the fund during a day base period and dividing this amount by the per share price on the last day of the base period the sec yield may differ from the dividend yield investment policies and practices this section takes a detailed look at some of the types of securities the funds may hold in their portfolios and the various kinds of investment practices that may be used in daytoday portfolio management each funds investment program is subject to further restrictions and risks described in the statement of additional information each fund adheres to applicable investment restrictions and policies at the time it makes an investment a later change in circumstances will not require the sale of an investment if it was proper at the time it was made fund managers have considerable leeway in choosing investment strategies and selecting securities they believe will help the funds achieve their objectives shareholder approval is required to substantively change a funds objective and certain investment restrictions noted in the following section as fundamental policies the managers also follow certain operating policies which can be changed without shareholder approval however significant changes are discussed with shareholders in fund reports each funds holdings of certain kinds of investments cannot exceed maximum percentages of total assets which are set forth herein for instance the bond funds are not permitted to invest more than  of total assets in residual interest bonds while these restrictions provide a useful level of detail about a funds investment program investors should not view them as an accurate gauge of the potential risk of such investments for example in a given period a  investment in residual interest bonds could have significantly more than a  impact on the funds share price the net effect of a particular investment depends on its volatility and the size of its overall return in relation to the performance of all the funds other investments changes in the funds holdings the funds performance and the contribution of various investments are discussed in the shareholder reports sent to you types of portfolio securities in seeking to meet their investment objectives the funds may invest in any type of municipal security or instrument including certain potentially highrisk derivatives whose yield credit t rowe price   more about the funds quality and maturity characteristics are consistent with the funds investment programs these and some of the other investment techniques the funds may use are described in the following pages fundamental policy the funds will not purchase a security if as a result with respect to  of its total assets more than  of its total assets would be invested in securities of a single issuer or more than  of the voting securities of the issuer would be held by a fund provided that these limitations do not apply to a funds purchases of securities issued or guaranteed by the us government its agencies or instrumentalities in purchasing municipals the funds rely on the opinion of the issuers bond counsel regarding the taxexempt status of the investment municipal securities each funds assets are invested primarily in various tax free municipal debt securities the issuers have a contractual obligation to pay interest at a stated rate on specific dates and to repay principal the bonds face value on a specified date or dates an issuer may have the right to redeem or call a bond before maturity and the investor may have to reinvest the proceeds at lower rates there are two broad categories of municipal bonds general obligation bonds are backed by the issuers full faith and credit that is its full taxing and revenue raising power revenue bonds usually rely exclusively on a specific revenue source such as charges for water and sewer service to generate money for debt service private activity bonds while income from most municipals is exempt from federal income taxes the income from certain types of socalled private activity bonds a type of revenue bond may be subject to the alternative minimum tax amt however only persons subject to amt pay this tax private activity bonds may be issued for purposes such as housing or airports or to benefit a private company being subject to the amt does not mean the investor necessarily pays this tax for further information please see distributions and taxes fundamental policy under normal market conditions the funds will not purchase any security if as a result less than  of the funds income would be exempt from federal income taxes the income included under the  test does not include income from securities subject to the alternative minimum tax operating policy during periods of abnormal market conditions for temporary defensive purposes the funds may invest without limit in highquality short term securities whose income is subject to federal income tax in addition to general obligation and revenue bonds the funds investments may include but are not limited to the following types of securities municipal lease obligations a lease is not a full faith and credit obligation of the issuer and is usually backed only by the borrowing governments unsecured pledge to make annual appropriation for lease payments there have been challenges to the legality of lease financing in numerous states and from time to time certain municipalities have considered not appropriating money to make lease payments in deciding whether to purchase a lease obligation the funds would assess the financial condition of the borrower the merits of the project the level of public support for the project and the legislative history of lease financing in the state these securities may be less readily marketable than other municipals the funds may also  t rowe price  more about the funds purchase unrated lease obligations based on information supplied by t rowe price the funds board of directors will periodically review the credit quality of nonrated leases and assess the likelihood of their being cancelled operating policy each fund may invest no more than  of its assets in lease obligations municipal warrants bond funds municipal warrants are essentially call options on municipal bonds in exchange for a premium they give the purchaser the right but not the obligation to purchase a municipal bond in the future the fund might purchase a warrant to lock in forward supply in an environment where the current issuance of bonds is sharply reduced like options warrants may expire worthless and they may have reduced liquidity operating policy each fund will not invest more than  of its total assets in municipal warrants securities with puts or other demand features some longerterm municipals give the investor the right to put or sell the security at par face value within a specified number of days following the investors requestusually one to seven days this demand feature enhances a securitys liquidity by dramatically shortening its effective maturity and enables it to trade at a price equal to or very close to par if the demand feature were terminated prior to being exercised the funds would hold the longerterm security securities with credit enhancements  letters of credit letters of credit are issued by a third party usually a bank to enhance liquidity andor ensure repayment of principal and any accrued interest if the underlying municipal security should default  municipal bond insurance this insurance which is usually purchased by the bond issuer from a private nongovernmental insurance company provides an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee that the insured bonds principal and interest will be paid when due insurance does not guarantee the price of a bond or the share price of any fund the credit rating of an insured bond reflects the credit rating of the insurer based on its claimspaying ability t rowe price periodically reviews the credit quality of the insurer the obligation of a municipal bond insurance company to pay a claim extends over the life of each insured bond although defaults on insured municipal bonds have been low to date and municipal bond insurers have met these claims there is no assurance this will continue a higher than expected default rate could strain the insurers loss reserves and adversely affect its ability to pay claims to bondholders such as the funds the number of municipal bond insurers is relatively small and not all of them have the highest rating while all the funds may buy insured bonds from time to time such bonds will compose at least  of the total assets of the insured intermediate fund the insured intermediate funds purchase of insured bonds will be limited to those which at the time of purchase have the highest credit rating from a national rating agency there is no guarantee that this rating will be maintained  standby repurchase agreements a standby bond purchase agreement sbpa is a liquidity facility provided to pay the purchase price of bonds that cannot be remarketed the obligation of the liquidity provider usually a bank is only to advance funds to purchase tendered t rowe price   more about the funds bonds which cannot be remarketed and does not cover principal or interest under any other circumstances the liquidity providers obligations under the sbpa are usually subject to numerous conditions including the continued creditworthiness of the underlying borrower synthetic or derivative securities these securities are created from existing municipal bonds  residual interest bonds bond funds a potentially highrisk derivative the income stream provided by an underlying bond is divided to create two securities one shortterm and one longterm the interest rate on the short term component is reset by an index or auction process normally every  to  days after income is paid on the shortterm securities at current rates the residual income goes to the longterm securities therefore rising shortterm interest rates result in lower income for the longerterm portion and vice versa the longerterm bonds can be very volatile and may be less liquid than other municipals of comparable maturity operating policy each bond fund will not invest more than  of its total assets in residual interest bonds  participation interests this term covers various types of securities created by converting fixed rate bonds into shortterm variable rate certificates these securities have been developed in the secondary market to meet the demand for shortterm taxexempt securities the funds will invest only in securities deemed taxexempt by a nationally recognized bond counsel but there is no guarantee the interest will be exempt because the irs has not issued a definitive ruling on the matter  embedded interest rate swaps and caps bond funds in a fixed rate longterm municipal bond with an interest rate swap attached to it the bondholder usually receives the bonds fixed coupon payment as well as a variable rate payment that represents the difference between a fixed rate for the term of the swap which is typically shorter than the bond it is attached to and a variable rate shortterm municipal index the bondholder receives excess income when shortterm rates remain below the fixed interest rate swap rate if shortterm rates rise above the fixedincome swap rate the bondholders income is reduced at the end of the interest rate swap term the bond reverts to a single fixed coupon payment embedded interest rate swaps enhance yields but also increase interest rate risk an embedded interest rate cap allows the bondholder to receive payments whenever shortterm rates rise above a level established at the time of purchase they normally are used to hedge against rising shortterm interest rates both instruments may be volatile and of limited liquidity and their use may adversely affect a funds total return operating policy each bond fund will not invest more than  of its total assets in embedded interest rate swaps and caps private placements the funds may seek to enhance their yield through the purchase of private placements these securities are sold through private negotiations usually to institutions or mutual funds and may have resale restrictions their yields are usually higher than comparable public securities to compensate the investor for their limited marketability  t rowe price  more about the funds operating policy each bond fund may not invest more than   for the money fund of its net assets in illiquid securities including unmarketable private placements types of management practices cash reserves provide flexibility and serve as a shortterm defense during periods of unusual market volatility cash position bond funds each fund will hold a portion of its assets in shortterm taxexempt money market securities maturing in one year or less the reserve position provides flexibility in meeting redemptions expenses and the timing of new investments can help in structuring a funds weighted average maturity and serves as a shortterm defense during periods of unusual market volatility each funds cash reserve position will be comprised of shortterm investmentgrade securities including taxexempt commercial paper municipal notes and shortterm maturity bonds some of these securities may have adjustable variable or floating rates whenissued securities all funds and forwards bond funds new issues of municipals are often sold on a whenissued basis that is delivery and payment take place  days after the buyer has agreed to the purchase some bonds called forwards have longer than standard settlement dates in some cases exceeding one to three years when buying these securities each fund identifies cash or highgrade marketable securities held by its custodian equal in value to its commitment for these securities the funds do not earn interest on whenissued and forward securities until settlement and the value of the securities may fluctuate between purchase and settlement municipal forwards typically carry a substantial yield premium to compensate the buyer for their greater interest rate credit and liquidity risks interest rate futures bond funds futures a potentially highrisk derivative are often used to manage risk because they enable the investor to buy or sell an asset in the future at an agreed upon price specifically the funds may use futures and options on futures to hedge against a potentially unfavorable change in interest rates and to adjust their exposure to the municipal bond market the use of futures for hedging and nonhedging purposes may not always be successful their prices can be highly volatile using them could lower the funds total return and the potential loss from their use could exceed a funds initial investment in such contracts operating policy initial margin deposits on futures and premiums on options used for nonhedging purposes will not equal more than  of a funds net asset value borrowing money and transferring assets each fund can borrow money from banks as a temporary measure for emergency purposes to facilitate redemption requests or for other proper purposes consistent with each funds investment objective and program such borrowings may be collateralized with fund assets subject to restrictions fundamental policy borrowings may not exceed   of a funds total assets operating policy each fund may not transfer as collateral any portfolio securities except as necessary in connection with permissible borrowings or investments and then such transfers may not exceed   of a funds total assets each fund may not purchase additional securities when borrowings exceed  of total assets t rowe price   more about the funds the funds portfolio turnover rates for the previous three fiscal years are shown in table  portfolio turnover bond funds each fund generally purchases securities with the intention of holding them for investment however when market conditions or other circumstances warrant securities may be purchased and sold without regard to the length of time held due to the nature of each funds investment program a funds portfolio turnover rate may exceed  although the funds do not expect to generate any taxable income a high turnover rate may increase transaction costs and may affect taxes paid by shareholders to the extent short term gains are distributed portfolio turnover rates      shortintermediate      insured intermediate      income      high yield      table  sector concentration it is possible that each fund could have a considerable amount of assets  or more in securities that would tend to respond similarly to particular economic or political developments an example would be securities of issuers related to a single industry such as health care or nuclear energy operating policy each

commonly referred to as junk bonds can be expected to fluctuate more than the total return and yield of higher quality shorterterm bonds junk bonds are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuers continuing ability to meet principal and interest payments successful investment in low and lowermediumquality bonds involves greater investment risk and is highly dependent on t rowe prices credit analysis a real or perceived economic downturn or higher interest rates could cause a decline in high yield bond prices because such events could lessen the ability of issuers to make principal and interest payments these bonds are thinly traded and can be more difficult to sell and value accurately than highquality bonds because objective pricing data may be less available judgment may play a greater role in the valuation process credit quality considerations the credit quality of most bond issues is evaluated by rating agencies such as moodys and standard  poors credit

funds are not fundamental policies each funds operating policies are subject to change by its board of directors without shareholder approval however shareholders will be notified of a material change in an operating policy each funds fundamental policies may not be changed without the approval of at least a majority of the outstanding shares of the fund or if it is less  of the shares represented at a meeting of shareholders at which the holders of  or more of the shares are represented risk factors all funds page  the funds are designed for investors who because of their tax bracket can benefit from investment in municipal bonds whose income is exempt from federal taxes the funds are not appropriate for qualified retirement plans where income is already tax deferred municipal securities there can be no assurance that the funds will achieve their investment objectives yields on municipal securities are dependent on a variety of factors including the general conditions of the money market and the municipal bond market the size of a particular offering the maturity of the obligation and the rating of the issue municipal securities with longer maturities tend to produce higher yields and are generally subject to potentially greater capital appreciation and depreciation than obligations with shorter maturities and lower yields the market prices of municipal securities usually vary depending upon available yields an increase in interest rates will generally reduce the value of portfolio investments and a decline in interest rates will generally increase the value of portfolio investments the ability of all the funds to achieve their investment objectives is also dependent on the continuing ability of the issuers of municipal securities in which the funds invest to meet their obligations for the payment of interest and principal when due the ratings of moodys sp and fitch represent their opinions as to the quality of municipal securities which they undertake to rate ratings are not absolute standards of quality consequently municipal securities with the same maturity coupon and rating may have different yields there are variations in municipal securities both within a particular classification and between classifications depending on numerous factors it should also be pointed out that unlike other types of investments municipal securities have traditionally not been subject to regulation by or registration with the sec although there have been proposals which would provide for regulation in the future the federal bankruptcy statutes relating to the debts of political subdivisions and authorities of states of the united states provide that in certain circumstances such subdivisions or authorities may be authorized to initiate bankruptcy proceedings without prior notice to or consent of creditors which proceedings could result in material and adverse changes in the rights of holders of their obligations proposals have been introduced in congress to restrict or eliminate the federal income tax exemption for interest on municipal securities and similar proposals may be introduced in the future proposed flat tax and valued added tax proposals would also have the effect of eliminating the tax preference for municipal securities some of the past proposals would have applied to interest on municipal securities issued page  before the date of enactment which would have adversely affected their value to a material degree if such a proposal were enacted the availability of municipal securities for investment by the funds and the value of a funds portfolio would be affected and in such an event a fund would reevaluate its investment objectives and policies although the banks and securities dealers with which the fund will transact business will be banks and securities dealers that t rowe price believes to be financially sound there can be no assurance that they will be able to honor their obligations to the fund with respect to such securities after purchase by a fund a security may cease to be rated or its rating may be reduced below the minimum required for purchase by the fund for the money fund the procedures set forth in rule a under the investment company act of  may require the prompt sale of any such security for the other funds neither event would require a sale of such security by the fund however t rowe price associates inc t rowe price will consider such event in its determination of whether the fund should continue to hold the security to the extent that the ratings given by moodys investors service inc moodys standard  poors corporation sp or fitch investors service inc fitch may change as a result of changes in such organizations or their rating systems the fund will attempt to use comparable ratings as standards for investments in accordance with the investment policies contained in the prospectus when purchasing unrated securities t rowe price under the supervision of the funds board of directors determines whether the unrated security is of a qualify comparable to that which the fund is allowed to purchase municipal bond insurance all of the funds may purchase insured bonds from time to time the taxfree insured intermediate fund must purchase such bonds municipal bond insurance provides an unconditional and irrevocable guarantee that the insured bonds principal and interest will be paid when due the guarantee is purchased from a private nongovernmental insurance company there are two types of insured securities that may be purchased by the funds bonds carrying either  new issue insurance or  secondary insurance new issue insurance is purchased by the issuer of a bond in order to improve the bonds credit rating by meeting the insurers standards and paying an insurance premium based on the bonds total debt service the issuer is able to obtain a higher credit rating for the bond once purchased municipal bond insurance cannot be cancelled and the protection it affords continues as long as the bonds are outstanding and the insurer remains solvent the funds may also purchase bonds which carry secondary page  insurance purchased by an investor after a bonds original issuance such policies insure a security for the remainder of its term generally the funds expect that portfolio bonds carrying secondary insurance will have been insured by a prior investor however the funds may on occasion purchase secondary insurance on their own behalf each of the municipal bond insurance companies has established reserves to cover estimated losses both the method of establishing these reserves and the amount of the reserves vary from company to company the obligation of a municipal bond insurance company may have to pay a claim extends over the life of each insured bond municipal bond insurance companies are obligated to pay a bonds interest and principal when due if the issuing entity defaults on the insured bond although defaults on insured municipal bonds have been low to date and municipal insurers have met these claims there is no assurance this low rate will continue in the future a higher than expected default rate could deplete loss reserves and adversely affect the ability of a municipal bond insurer to pay claims to holders of insured bonds such as the fund money fund the fund will limit its purchases of portfolio instruments to those us dollardenominated securities which the funds board of directors determines present minimal credit risk and which are eligible securities as defined in rule a under the investment company act of   act eligible securities are generally securities which have been rated or whose issuer has been rated or whose issuer has comparable securities rated in one of the two highest shortterm rating categories by nationally recognized statistical rating organizations or in the case of any instrument that is not so rated is of comparable high quality as determined by t rowe price pursuant to written guidelines established in accordance with rule a under the investment company act of  under the supervision of the funds board of directors in addition the funds may treat variable and floating rate instruments with demand features as shortterm securities pursuant to rule a under the  act there can be no assurance that the money fund will achieve its investment objectives or be able to maintain its net asset value per share at  the price stability and liquidity of the money fund may not be equal to that of a taxable money market fund which exclusively invests in shortterm taxable money market securities the taxable money market is a broader and more liquid market with a greater number of investors issuers and market makers than the shortterm municipal securities market the weighted average maturity of the fund varies subject to a  day maximum under rule a the shorter the average maturity of a portfolio the less its price page  will be impacted by interest rate fluctuations bond funds because of their investment policies the bond funds may not be suitable or appropriate for all investors the funds are designed for investors who wish to invest in nonmoney market funds for income and who would benefit because of their tax bracket from receiving income that is exempt from federal income taxes the funds investment programs permit the purchase of investment grade securities that do not meet the high quality standards of the money fund since investors generally perceive that there are greater risks associated with investment in lower quality securities the yields from such securities normally exceed those obtainable from higher quality securities in addition the principal value of long term lowerrated securities generally will fluctuate more widely than higher quality securities lower quality investments entail a higher risk of defaultthat is the nonpayment of interest and principal by the issuer than higher quality investments the value of the portfolio securities of the bond funds will fluctuate based upon market conditions although these funds seek to reduce credit risk by investing in a diversified portfolio such diversification does not eliminate all risk the funds are also not intended to provide a vehicle for shortterm trading purposes special risks of high yield investing junk bonds are regarded as predominantly speculative with respect to the issuers continuing ability to meet principal and interest payments because investment in low and lower medium quality bonds involves greater investment risk to the extent the funds invest in such bonds achievement of their investment objectives will be more dependent on t rowe prices credit analysis than would be the case if the funds were investing in higher quality bonds high yield bonds may be more susceptible to real or perceived adverse economic conditions than investment grade bonds a projection of an economic downturn or higher interest rates for example could cause a decline in high yield bond prices because the advent of such events could lessen the ability of highly leverage issuers to make principal and interest payments on their debt securities in addition the secondary trading market for high yield bonds may be less liquid than the market for higher grade bonds which can adversely affect the ability of a fund to dispose of its portfolio securities bonds for which there is only a thin market can be more difficult to value inasmuch as objective pricing data may be less available and judgment may play a greater role in the valuation process reference is also made to the sections entitled types of securities and portfolio management practices for page  discussions of the risks associated with the investments and practices described therein investment programs throughout the discussion on investments the term the fund is intended to refer to each of the funds eligible to invest in the security or engage in the practice being described type of securities municipal securities subject to the investment objectives and programs described in the prospectus and the additional investment restrictions described in this statement of additional information each funds portfolio may consist of any combination of the various types of municipal securities described below or other types of municipal securities that may be developed the amount of each funds assets invested in any particular type of municipal security can be expected to vary the term municipal securities means obligations issued by or on behalf of states territories and possessions of the united states and the district of columbia and their political subdivisions agencies and instrumentalities as well as certain other persons and entities the interest from which is exempt from federal income tax in determining the taxexempt status of a municipal security the fund relies on the opinion of the issuers bond counsel at the time of the issuance of the security however it is possible this opinion could be overturned and as a result the interest received by the fund from such a security might not be exempt from federal income tax municipal securities are classified by maturity as notes bonds or adjustable rate securities municipal notes municipal notes generally are used to provide for shortterm operating or capital needs and generally have maturities of one year or less municipal notes include tax anticipation notes tax anticipation notes are issued to finance working capital needs of municipalities generally they are issued in anticipation of various seasonal tax revenue such as income property use and business taxes and are payable from these specific future taxes revenue anticipation notes revenue anticipation notes are issued in expectation of receipt of other types of revenue such as federal or state revenues available under the revenue sharing or grant programs page  bond anticipation notes bond anticipation notes are issued to provide interim financing until longterm financing can be arranged in most cases the longterm bonds then provide the money for the repayment of the notes taxexempt commercial paper taxexempt commercial paper is a shortterm obligation with a stated maturity of  days or less it is issued by state and local governments or their agencies to finance seasonal working capital needs or as shortterm financing in anticipation of longer term financing municipal bonds municipal bonds which meet longer term capital needs and generally have maturities of more than one year when issued have two principal classifications general obligation bonds and revenue bonds two additional categories of potential purchases are lease revenue bonds and pre refundedescrowed to maturity bonds another type of municipal bond is referred to as an industrial development bond general obligation bonds issuers of general obligation bonds include states counties cities towns and special districts the proceeds of these obligations are used to fund a wide range of public projects including construction or improvement of schools public buildings highways and roads and general projects not supported by user fees or specifically identified revenues the basic security behind general obligation bonds is the issuers pledge of its full faith and credit and taxing power for the payment of principal and interest the taxes that can be levied for the payment of debt service may be limited or unlimited as to the rate or amount of special assessments in many cases voter approval is required before an issuer may sell this type of bond revenue bonds the principal security for a revenue bond is generally the net revenues derived from a particular facility or enterprise or in some cases the proceeds of a special charge or other pledged revenue source revenue bonds are issued to finance a wide variety of capital projects including electric gas water and sewer systems highways bridges and tunnels port and airport facilities colleges and universities and hospitals revenue bonds are sometimes used to finance various privately operated facilities provided they meet certain tests established for taxexempt status although the principal security behind these bonds page  may vary many provide additional security in the form of a mortgage or debt service reserve fund some authorities provide further security in the form of the states ability without obligation to make up deficiencies in the debt service reserve fund revenue bonds usually do not require prior voter approval before they may be issued lease revenue bonds municipal borrowers may also finance capital improvements or purchases with taxexempt leases the security for a lease is generally the borrowers pledge to make annual appropriations for lease payments the lease payment is treated as an operating expense subject to appropriation risk and not a full faith and credit obligation of the issuer lease revenue bonds are generally considered less secure than a general obligation or revenue bond and often do not include a debt service reserve fund to the extent the funds board determines such securities are illiquid they will be subject to the funds  limit on illiquid securities  limit for the money fund there have also been certain legal challenges to the use of lease revenue bonds in various states the liquidity of such securities will be determined based on a variety of factors which may include among others  the frequency of trades and quotes for the obligation  the number of dealers willing to purchase or sell the security and the number of other potential buyers  the willingness of dealers to undertake to make a market in the security  the nature of the marketplace trades including the time needed to dispose of the security the method of soliciting offers and the mechanics of transfer and  the rating assigned to the obligation by an established rating agency or t rowe price prerefundedescrowed to maturity bonds certain municipal bonds have been refunded with a later bond issue from the same issuer the proceeds from the later issue are used to defease the original issue in many cases the original issue cannot be redeemed or repaid until the first call date or original maturity date in these cases the refunding bond proceeds typically are used to buy us treasury securities that are held in an escrow account until the original call date or maturity date the original bonds then become prerefunded or escrowed to maturity and are considered as high quality investments while still taxexempt the security is the proceeds of the escrow account to the extent permitted by the securities and exchange commission and the internal revenue service a page  funds investment in such securities refunded with us treasury securities will for purposes of diversification rules applicable to the fund be considered as an investment in the us treasury securities private activity bonds under current tax law all municipal debt is divided broadly into two groups governmental purpose bonds and private activity bonds governmental purpose bonds are issued to finance traditional public purpose projects such as public buildings and roads private activity bonds may be issued by a state or local government or public authority but principally benefit private users and are considered taxable unless a specific exemption is provided the tax code currently provides exemptions for certain private activity bonds such as notforprofit hospital bonds smallissue industrial development revenue bonds and mortgage subsidy bonds which may still be issued as taxexempt bonds some but not all private activity bonds are subject to alternative minimum tax industrial development bonds industrial development bonds are considered municipal bonds if the interest paid is exempt from federal income tax they are issued by or on behalf of public authorities to raise money to finance various privately operated facilities for business and manufacturing housing sports and pollution control these bonds are also used to finance public facilities such as airports mass transit systems ports and parking the payment of the principal and interest on such bonds is dependent solely on the ability of the facilitys user to meet its financial obligations and the pledge if any of real and personal property so financed as security for such payment adjustable rate securities municipal securities may be issued with adjustable interest rates that are reset periodically by predetermined formulas or indexes in order to minimize movements in the principal value of the investment such securities may have longterm maturities but may be treated as a shortterm investment under certain conditions generally as interest rates decrease or increase the potential for capital appreciation or depreciation on these securities is less than for fixedrate obligations these securities may take the following forms variable rate securities variable rate instruments are those whose terms provide for the page  adjustment of their interest rates on set dates and which upon such adjustment can reasonably be expected to have a market value that approximates its par value subject to the provisions of rule a under the investment company act of   a variable rate instrument the principal amount of which is scheduled to be paid in  days or less is deemed to have a maturity equal to the period remaining until the next readjustment of the interest  a variable rate instrument which is subject to a demand feature which entitles the purchaser to receive the principal amount of the underlying security or securities either i upon notice of usually  days or ii at specified intervals not exceeding  days and upon no more than  days notice is deemed to have a maturity equal to the longer of the period remaining until the next readjustment of the interest rate or the period remaining until the principal amount can be recovered through demand and  an instrument that is issued or guaranteed by the us government or any agency thereof which has a variable rate of interest readjusted no less frequently than every  days may be deemed to have a maturity equal to the period remaining until the next readjustment of the interest rate should the provisions of rule a change the fund will determine the maturity of these securities in accordance with the amended provisions of such rule floating rate securities floating rate instruments are those whose terms provide for the adjustment of their interest rates whenever a specified interest rate changes and which at any time can reasonably be expected to have a market value that approximates its par value subject to the provisions of rule a under the investment company act of   the maturity of a floating rate instrument is deemed to be the period remaining until the date noted on the face of the instrument on which the principal amount must be paid or in the case of an instrument called for redemption the date on which the redemption payment must be made and  floating rate instruments with demand features are deemed to have a maturity equal to the period remaining until the principal amount can be recovered through demand should the provisions of rule a change the fund will determine the maturity of these securities in accordance with the amended provisions of such rule put option bonds longterm obligations with page  maturities longer than one year may provide purchasers an optional or mandatory tender of the security at par value at predetermined intervals often ranging from one month to several years eg a year bond with a fiveyear tender period these instruments are deemed to have a maturity equal to the period remaining to the put date residual interest bonds these are a type of highrisk derivative bond funds the funds may purchase municipal bond issues that are structured as twopart residual interest bond and variable rate security offerings the issuer is obligated only to pay a fixed amount of taxfree income that is to be divided among the holders of the two securities the interest rate for the holders of the variable rate securities will be determined by an index or auction process held approximately every  to  days while the bond holders will receive all interest paid by the issuer minus the amount given to the variable rate security holders and a nominal auction fee therefore the coupon of the residual interest bonds and thus the income received will move inversely with respect to shortterm  to  day taxexempt interest rates there is no assurance that the auction will be successful and that the variable rate security will provide shortterm liquidity the issuer is not obligated to provide such liquidity in general these securities offer a significant yield advantage over standard municipal securities due to the uncertainty of the shape of the yield curve ie short term versus long term rates and consequent income flows unlike many adjustable rate securities residual interest bonds are not necessarily expected to trade at par and in fact present significant market risks in certain market environments residual interest bonds may carry substantial premiums or be at deep discounts this is a relatively new product in the municipal market with limited liquidity to date participation interests the funds may purchase from third parties participation interests in all or part of specific holdings of municipal securities the purchase may take different forms in the case of shortterm securities the participation may be backed by a liquidity facility that allows the interest to be sold back to the third party such as a trust broker or bank for a page  predetermined price of par at stated intervals the seller may receive a fee from the funds in connection with the arrangement in the case of longer term bonds the intermediate and income funds may purchase interests in a pool of municipal bonds or a single municipal bond or lease without the right to sell the interest back to the third party the funds will not purchase participation interests unless a satisfactory opinion of counsel or ruling of the internal revenue service has been issued that the interest earned from the municipal securities on which the funds holds participation interests is exempt from federal income tax to the funds however there is no guarantee the irs would treat such interest income as taxexempt embedded interest rate swaps and caps bond funds in a fixedrate longterm municipal bond with an interest rate swap attached to it the bondholder usually receives the bonds fixedcoupon payment as well as a variable rate payment that represents the difference between a fixed rate for the term of the swap which is typically shorter than the bond it is attached to and a variable rate shortterm municipal index the bondholder receives excess income when shortterm rates remain below the fixed interest rate swap rate if shortterm rates rise above the fixedincome swap rate the bondholders income is reduced at the end of the interest rate swap term the bond reverts to a single fixedcoupon payment embedded interest rate swaps enhance yields but also increase interest rate risk an embedded interest rate cap allows the bondholder to receive payments whenever shortterm rates rise above a level established at the time of purchase they normally are used to hedge against rising shortterm interest rates both instruments may be volatile and of limited liquidity and their use may adversely affect a funds total return the funds may invest in other types of derivative instruments as they become available there are of course other types of municipal securities that are or may become available and the funds reserve the right to invest in them page  for the purpose of the funds investment restrictions the identification of the issuer of municipal securities which are not general obligation bonds is made by the funds investment manager t rowe price on the basis of the characteristics of the obligation as described above the most significant of which is the source of funds for the payment of principal and interest on such securities whenissued securities new issues of municipal securities are often offered on a whenissued basis that is delivery and payment for the securities normally takes place  to  days or more after the date of the commitment to purchase the payment obligation and the interest rate that will be received on the securities are each fixed at the time the buyer enters into the commitment a fund will only make a commitment to purchase such securities with the intention of actually acquiring the securities however a fund may sell these securities before the settlement date if it is deemed advisable as a matter of investment strategy each fund will maintain cash andor highgrade marketable debt securities with its custodian bank equal in value to commitments for whenissued securities such securities either will mature or if necessary be sold on or before the settlement date securities purchased on a whenissued basis and the securities held in a funds portfolio are subject to changes in market value based upon the public perception of the creditworthiness of the issuer and changes in the level of interest rates which will generally result in similar changes in value ie both experiencing appreciation when interest rates decline and depreciation when interest rates rise therefore to the extent a fund remains fully invested or almost fully invested at the same time that it has purchased securities on a whenissued basis there will be greater fluctuations in its net asset value than if it solely set aside cash to pay for whenissued securities in the case of the money fund this could increase the possibility that the market value of the funds assets could vary from  per share in addition there will be a greater potential for the realization of capital gains which are not exempt from federal income tax when the time comes to pay for whenissued securities a fund will meet its obligations from thenavailable cash flow sale of securities or although it would not normally expect to do so from sale of the whenissued securities themselves which may have a value greater or less than the payment obligation the policies described in this paragraph are not fundamental and may be changed by a fund upon notice to its shareholders forwards bond funds page  the funds may purchase bonds on a whenissued basis with longer than standard settlement dates in some cases exceeding one to two years in such cases the funds must execute a receipt evidencing the obligation to purchase the bond on the specified issue date and must segregate cash internally to meet that forward commitment municipal forwards typically carry a substantial yield premium to compensate the buyer for the risks associated with a long whenissued period including shifts in market interest rates that could materially impact the principal value of the bond deterioration in the credit quality of the issuer loss of alternative investment options during the whenissued period changes in tax law or issuer actions that would affect the exempt interest status of the bonds and prevent delivery failure of the issuer to complete various steps required to issue the bonds and limited liquidity for the buyer to sell the escrow receipts during the whenissued period investment in taxable money market securities although the funds expect to be solely invested in municipal securities for temporary defensive purposes they may elect to invest in the taxable money market securities listed below without limitation when such action is deemed to be in the best interests of shareholders the interest earned on these money market securities is not exempt from federal income tax and may be taxable to shareholders as ordinary income us government obligations  direct obligations of the government and its agencies and instrumentalities us government agency securities  obligations

securities held or intended to be acquired by the fund the fund could sell interest rate futures as an offset against the effect of expected increases in interest rates and purchase such futures as an offset against the effect of expected declines in interest rates futures can also be used as an efficient means of regulating a funds exposure to the market the fund will enter into futures contracts which are traded on national futures exchanges and are standardized as to maturity date and underlying financial instrument a public market exists in futures contracts covering various taxable fixed income securities as well as municipal bonds futures exchanges and trading in the united states are regulated under the commodity exchange act by the commodity futures trading commission cftc although techniques other than the sale and purchase of futures contracts could be used for the above referenced purposes futures contracts offer an effective and relatively low cost means of implementing the funds objectives in these areas regulatory limitations the fund will engage in futures contracts and options thereon only for bona fide hedging yield enhancement and risk management purposes in each case in accordance with rules and regulations of the cftc and applicable state law the fund may not purchase or sell futures contracts or related options if with respect to positions which do not quality as bona fide hedging under applicable cftc rules the sum of the amounts of initial margin deposits and premiums paid on those positions would exceed  of the net asset value of the fund after taking into account unrealized profits and unrealized page  losses on any such contracts it has entered into provided however that in the case of an option that is inthemoney at the time of purchase the inthemoney amount may be excluded in calculating the  limitation for purposes of this policy options on futures contracts traded on a commodities exchange will be considered related options this policy may be modified by the board of directors without a shareholder vote and does not limit the percentage of the funds assets at risk to  in accordance with the rules of the state of california the fund will apply the above  test without excluding the value of initial margin and premiums paid for bona fide hedging purposes the funds use of futures will not result in leverage therefore to the extent necessary in instances involving the purchase of futures contracts or the writing of calls or put options thereon by the fund an amount of cash us government securities or other liquid highgrade debt obligations equal to the market value of the futures contracts and options thereon less any related margin deposits will be identified in an account with the funds custodian to cover the position or alternative cover such as owning an offsetting position will be employed assets used as cover or held in an identified account cannot be sold while the position in the corresponding option or future is open unless they are replaced with similar assets as a result the commitment of a large portion of a funds assets to cover or identified accounts could impede portfolio management or the funds ability to meet redemption requests or other current obligations if the cftc or other regulatory authorities adopt different including less stringent or additional restrictions the fund would comply with such new restrictions trading in futures contracts a futures contract provides for the future sale by one party and purchase by another party of a specified amount of a specific financial instrument eg units of a debt security for a specified price date time and place designated at the time the contract is made brokerage fees are incurred when a futures contract is bought or sold and margin deposits must be maintained entering into a contract to buy is commonly referred to as buying or purchasing a contract or holding a long position entering into a contract to sell is commonly referred to as selling a contract or holding a short position it is possible that the funds hedging activities will occur primarily through the use of municipal bond index futures contracts since the uniqueness of that index contract should better correlate with the funds portfolio and thereby be more effective however there may be times when it is deemed in the page  best interest of shareholders to engage in the use of treasury bond futures and the fund reserves to right to use treasury bond futures at any time use of these futures could occur as an example when both the treasury bond contract and municipal bond index futures contract are correlating well with municipal bond prices but the treasury bond contract is trading at a more advantageous price making the hedge less expensive with the treasury bond contract than would be obtained with the municipal bond index futures contract the funds activity in futures contracts generally will be limited to municipal bond index futures contracts and treasury bond and note contracts unlike when the fund purchases or sells a security no price would be paid or received by the fund upon the purchase or sale of a futures contract upon entering into a futures contract and to maintain the funds open positions in futures contracts the fund would be required to deposit with its custodian in a segregated account in the name of the futures broker an amount of cash us government securities suitable money market instruments or liquid highgrade debt securities known as initial margin the margin required for a particular futures contract is set by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be significantly modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract futures contracts are customarily purchased and sold on margins that may range upward from less than  of the value of the contract being traded if the price of an open futures contract changes by increase in the case of a sale or by decrease in the case of a purchase so that the loss on the futures contract reaches a point at which the margin on deposit does not satisfy margin requirements the broker will require an increase in the margin however if the value of a position increases because of favorable price changes in the futures contract so that the margin deposit exceeds the required margin the broker will pay the excess to the fund these subsequent payments called variation margin to and from the futures broker are made on a daily basis as the price of the underlying assets fluctuate making the long and short positions in the futures contract more or less valuable a process known as marking to the market the fund expects to earn interest income on its margin deposits although certain futures contracts by their terms require actual future delivery of and payment for the underlying instruments in practice most futures contracts are usually closed out before the delivery date closing out an open futures contract purchase or sale is effected by entering into an offsetting futures contract sale or purchase respectively for the same aggregate amount of the identical securities and the same delivery date if the offsetting purchase price is less page  than the original sale price the fund realizes a gain if it is more the fund realizes a loss conversely if the offsetting sale price is more than the original purchase price the fund realizes a gain if it is less the fund realizes a loss the transaction costs must also be included in these calculations there can be no assurance however that the fund will be able to enter into an offsetting transaction with respect to a particular futures contract at a particular time if the fund is not able to enter into an offsetting transaction the fund will continue to be required to maintain the margin deposits on the futures contract as an example of an offsetting transaction in which the underlying instrument is not delivered the contractual obligations arising from the sale of one contract of september municipal bond index futures on an exchange may be fulfilled at any time before delivery of the contract is required ie on a specified date in september the delivery month by the purchase of one contract of september municipal bond index futures on the same exchange in such instance the difference between the price at which the futures contract was sold and the price paid for the offsetting purchase after allowance for transaction costs represents the profit or loss to the fund special risks of transactions in futures contracts volatility and leverage the prices of futures contracts are volatile and are influenced among other things by actual and anticipated changes in the market and interest rates which in turn are affected by fiscal and monetary policies and national and international political and economic events most united states futures exchanges limit the amount of fluctuation permitted in futures contract prices during a single trading day the daily limit establishes the maximum amount that the price of a futures contract may vary either up or down from the previous days settlement price at the end of a trading session once the daily limit has been reached in a particular type of futures contract no trades may be made on that day at a price beyond that limit the daily limit governs only price movement during a particular trading day and therefore does not limit potential losses because the limit may prevent the liquidation of unfavorable positions futures contract prices have occasionally moved to the daily limit for several consecutive trading days with little or no trading thereby preventing prompt liquidation of futures positions and subjecting some futures traders to substantial losses because of the low margin deposits required futures trading involves an extremely high degree of leverage as a result a relatively small price movement in a futures contract may result in immediate and substantial loss as well as gain to the investor for example if at the time of purchase  of page  the value of the futures contract is deposited as margin a subsequent  decrease in the value of the futures contract would result in a total loss of the margin deposit before any deduction for the transaction costs if the account were then closed out a  decrease would result in a loss equal to  of the original margin deposit if the contract were closed out thus a purchase or sale of a futures contract may result in losses in excess of the amount invested in the futures contract however the fund would presumably have sustained comparable losses if instead of the futures contract it had invested in the underlying financial instrument and sold it after the decline furthermore in the case of a futures contract purchase in order to be certain that the fund has sufficient assets to satisfy its obligations under a futures contract the fund earmarks to the futures contract money market instruments equal in value to the current value of the underlying instrument less the margin deposit liquidity the fund may elect to close some or all of its futures positions at any time prior to their expiration the fund would do so to reduce exposure represented by long futures positions or short futures positions the fund may close its positions by taking opposite positions which would operate to terminate the funds position in the futures contracts final determinations of variation margin would then be made additional cash would be required to be paid by or released to the fund and the fund would realize a loss or a gain futures contracts may be closed out only on the exchange or board of trade where the contracts were initially traded although the fund intends to purchase or sell futures contracts only on exchanges or boards of trade where there appears to be an active market there is no assurance that a liquid market on an exchange or board of trade will exist for any particular contract at any particular time in such event it might not be possible to close a futures contract and in the event of adverse price movements the fund would continue to be required to make daily cash payments of variation margin however in the event futures contracts have been used to hedge the underlying instruments the fund would continue to hold the underlying instruments subject to the hedge until the futures contracts could be terminated in such circumstances an increase in the price of underlying instruments if any might partially or completely offset losses on the futures contract however as described below there is no guarantee that the price of the underlying instruments will in fact correlate with the price movements in the futures contract and thus provide an offset to losses on a futures contract hedging risk a decision of whether when and how to hedge involves skill and judgment and even a wellconceived hedge may be unsuccessful to some degree because of unexpected market behavior market or interest rate trends there are page  several risks in connection with the use by the fund of futures contracts as a hedging device one risk arises because of the imperfect correlation between movements in the prices of the futures contracts and movements in the prices of the underlying instruments which are the subject of the hedge t rowe price will however attempt to reduce this risk by entering into futures contracts whose movements in its judgment will have a significant correlation with movements in the prices of the funds underlying instruments sought to be hedged successful use of futures contracts by the fund for hedging purposes is also subject to t rowe prices ability to correctly predict movements in the direction of the market it is possible that when the fund has sold futures to hedge its portfolio against a decline in the market the index indices or instruments underlying futures are written might advance and the value of the underlying instruments held in the funds portfolio might decline if this were to occur the fund would lose money on the futures and also would experience a decline in value in its underlying instruments however while this might occur to a certain degree t rowe price believes that over time the value of the funds portfolio will tend to move in the same direction as the market indices used to hedge the portfolio it is also possible that if the fund were to hedge against the possibility of a decline in the market adversely affecting the underlying instruments held in its portfolio and prices instead increased the fund would lose part or all of the benefit of increased value of those underlying instruments that it has hedged because it would have offsetting losses in its futures positions in addition in such situations if the fund had insufficient cash it might have to sell underlying instruments to meet daily variation margin requirements such sales of underlying instruments might be but would not necessarily be at increased prices which would reflect the rising market the fund might have to sell underlying instruments at a time when it would be disadvantageous to do so in addition to the possibility that there might be an imperfect correlation or no correlation at all between price movements in the futures contracts and the portion of the portfolio being hedged the price movements of futures contracts might not correlate perfectly with price movements in the underlying instruments due to certain market distortions first all participants in the futures market are subject to margin deposit and maintenance requirements rather than meeting additional margin deposit requirements investors might close futures contracts through offsetting transactions which could distort the normal relationship between the underlying instruments and futures markets second the margin requirements in the futures market are less onerous than margin requirements in the securities markets and as a result the futures market might attract more speculators than the securities markets do increased participation by speculators in the futures market page  might also cause temporary price distortions due to the possibility of price distortion in the futures market and also because of the imperfect correlation between price movements in the underlying instruments and movements in the prices of futures contracts even a correct forecast of general market trends by t rowe price might not result in a successful hedging transaction over a very short time period options on futures contracts the fund might trade in municipal bond index option futures or similar options on futures developed in the future in addition the fund may also trade in options on futures contracts on us government securities and any us government securities futures index contract which might be developed in the opinion of t rowe price there is a high degree of correlation in the interest rate and price movements of us government securities and municipal securities however the us government securities market and municipal securities markets are independent and may not move in tandem at any point in time the fund will purchase put options on futures contracts to hedge its portfolio of municipal securities against the risk of rising interest rates and the consequent decline in the prices of the municipal securities it owns the funds will also write call options on futures contracts as a hedge against a modest decline in prices of the municipal securities held in the funds portfolio if the futures price at expiration of a written call option is below the exercise price the fund will retain the full amount of the option premium thereby partially hedging against any decline that may have occurred in the funds holdings of debt securities if the futures price when the option is exercised is above the exercise price however the fund will incur a loss which may be wholly or partially offset by the increase of the value of the securities in the funds portfolio which were being hedged writing a put option on a futures contract serves as a partial hedge against an increase in the value of securities the fund intends to acquire if the futures price at expiration of the option is above the exercise price the fund will retain the full amount of the option premium which provides a partial hedge against any increase that may have occurred in the price of the debt securities the fund intends to acquire if the futures price when the option is exercised is below the exercise price however the fund will incur a loss which may be wholly or partially offset by the decrease in the price of the securities the fund intends to acquire options on futures are similar to options on underlying instruments except that options on futures give the purchaser the right in return for the premium paid to assume a position in a page  futures contract a long position if the option is a call and a short position if the option is a put rather than to purchase or sell the futures contract at a specified exercise price at any time during the period of the option upon exercise of the option the delivery of the futures position by the writer of the option to the holder of the option will be accompanied by delivery of the accumulated balance in the writers futures margin account which represents the amount by which the market price of the futures contract at exercise exceeds in the case of a call or is less than in the case of a put the exercise price of the option on the futures contract purchasers of options who fail to exercise their options prior to the exercise date suffer a loss of the premium paid from time to time a single order to purchase or sell futures contracts or options thereon may be made on behalf of the fund and other t rowe price funds such aggregated orders would be allocated among the fund and the other t rowe price funds in a fair and nondiscriminatory manner special risks of transactions in options on futures contracts the risks described under special risks of transactions on futures contracts are substantially the same as the risks of using options on futures in addition where the fund seeks to close out an option position by writing or buying an offsetting option covering the same index underlying instrument or contract and having the same exercise price and expiration date its ability to establish and close out positions on such options will be subject to the maintenance of a liquid secondary market reasons for the absence of a liquid secondary market on an exchange include the following i there may be insufficient trading interest in certain options ii restrictions may be imposed by an exchange on opening transactions or closing transactions or both iii trading halts suspensions or other restrictions may be imposed with respect to particular classes or series of options or underlying instruments iv unusual or unforeseen circumstances may interrupt normal operations on an exchange v the facilities of an exchange or a clearing corporation may not at all times be adequate to handle current trading volume or vi one or more exchanges could for economic or other reasons decide or be compelled at some future date to discontinue the trading of options or a particular class or series of options in which event the secondary market on that exchange or in the class or series of options would cease to exist although outstanding options on the exchange that had been issued by a clearing corporation as a result of trades on that exchange would continue to be exercisable in accordance with their terms there is no assurance that higher than anticipated trading activity or other unforeseen events might not at times render certain of the facilities of any of the clearing corporations inadequate and thereby result in the institution by an exchange of special page  procedures which may interfere with the timely execution of customers orders in the event no such market exists for a particular contract in which the fund maintains a position in the case of a written option the fund would have to wait to sell the underlying securities or futures positions until the option expires or is exercised the fund would be required to maintain margin deposits on payments until the contract is closed options on futures are treated for accounting purposes in the same way as the analogous option on securities are treated in addition the correlation between movements in the price of options on futures contracts and movements in the price of the securities hedged can only be approximate this risk is significantly increased when an option on a us government securities future or an option on a municipal securities index future is used to hedge a municipal bond portfolio another risk is that the movements in the price of options on futures contracts may not move inversely with changes in interest rates if the fund has written a call option on a futures contract and the value of the call increases by more than the increase in the value of the securities held as cover the fund may realize a loss on the call which is not completely offset by the appreciation in the price of the securities held as cover and the premium received for writing the call the successful use of options on futures contracts requires special expertise and techniques different from those involved in portfolio securities transactions a decision of whether when and how to hedge involves skill and judgment and even a wellconceived hedge may be unsuccessful to some degree because of unexpected market behavior or interest rate trends during periods when municipal securities market prices are appreciating the fund may experience poorer overall performance than if it had not entered into any options on futures contracts general considerations transactions by the fund in options on futures will be subject to limitations established by each of the exchanges boards of trade or other trading facilities governing the maximum number of options in each class which may be written or purchased by a single investor or group of investors acting in concert regardless of whether the options are written on the same or different exchanges boards of trade or other trading facilities or are held or written in one or more accounts or through one or more brokers thus the number of contracts which the fund may write or purchase may be affected by contracts written or purchased by other investment advisory clients of t rowe price an exchange board of trade or other trading facility may order the liquidations of positions found to be in excess of these limits and it may impose certain other sanctions page  additional futures and options contracts although the fund has no current intention of engaging in futures or options transactions other than those described above it reserves the right to do so such futures and options trading might involve risks which differ from those involved in the futures and options described above federal tax treatment of futures contracts although the fund invests almost exclusively in securities which generate income which is exempt from federal income taxes the instruments described above are not exempt from such taxes therefore use of the investment techniques described above could result in taxable income to shareholders of the fund generally the fund is required for federal income tax purposes to recognize as income for each taxable year its net unrealized gains and losses on futures contracts as of the end of the year as well as those actually realized during the year gain or loss recognized with respect to a futures contract will generally be  longterm capital gain or loss and  short term capital gain or loss without regard to the holding period of the contract futures contracts which are intended to hedge against a change in the value of securities may be classified as mixed straddles in which case the recognition of losses may be deferred to a later year in addition sales of such futures contracts on securities may affect the holding period of the hedged security and consequently the nature of the gain or loss on such security on disposition in order for the fund to continue to qualify for federal income tax treatment as a regulated investment company at least  of its gross income for a taxable year must be derived from qualifying income ie dividends interest income derived from loans of securities and gains from the sale of securities gains realized on the sale or other disposition of securities including futures contracts on securities held for less than three months must be limited to less than  of the funds annual gross income in order to avoid realizing excessive gains on securities held less than three months the fund may be required to defer the closing out of futures contracts beyond the time when it would otherwise be advantageous to do so it is anticipated that unrealized gains on futures contracts which have been open for less than three months as of the end of the funds fiscal year and which are recognized for tax purposes will not be considered gains on securities held less than three months for purposes of the  test the fund will distribute to shareholders annually any page  net gains which have been recognized for federal income tax purposes from futures transactions including unrealized gains at the end of the funds fiscal year such distributions will be combined with distributions of ordinary income or capital gains realized on the funds other investments shareholders will be advised of the nature of the payments the funds ability to enter into transactions in options on futures contracts may be limited by the internal revenue codes requirements for qualification as a regulated investment company options on

by t rowe price t rowe price is also responsible for implementing these page  decisions including the negotiation of commissions and the allocation of portfolio brokerage and principal business the funds purchases and sales of portfolio securities are normally done on a principal basis and do not involve the payment of a commission although they may involve the designation of selling concessions that part of the discussion below relating solely to brokerage commissions would not normally apply to the funds however it is included because t rowe price does manage a significant number of common stock portfolios which do engage in agency transactions and pay commissions and because some research and services resulting from the payment of such commissions may benefit the funds how brokers and dealers are selected fixed income securities fixed income securities are generally purchased from the issuer or a primary marketmaker acting as principal for the securities on a net basis with no brokerage commission being paid by the client although the price usually includes an undisclosed compensation transactions placed through dealers serving as primary marketmakers reflect the spread between the bid and asked prices securities may also be purchased from underwriters at prices which include underwriting fees t rowe price may effect principal transactions on behalf of the fund with a broker or dealer who furnishes brokerage andor research services designate any such broker or dealer to receive selling concessions discounts or other allowances or otherwise deal with any such broker or dealer in connection with the acquisition of securities in underwritings t rowe price may receive brokerage and research services in connection with such designations in fixed price underwritings how evaluations are made of the overall reasonableness of brokerage commissions paid on a continuing basis t rowe price seeks to determine what levels of commission rates are reasonable in the marketplace for transactions executed on behalf of the fund in evaluating the reasonableness of commission rates t rowe price considers a historical commission rates both before and since rates have been fully negotiable b rates which other institutional investors are paying based on available public information c rates quoted by brokers and dealers d the size of a particular transaction in

dealers t rowe price receives a wide range of research services from brokers and dealers these services include information on the economy industries groups of securities individual companies statistical information accounting and tax law interpretations political developments legal developments affecting portfolio securities technical market action pricing and appraisal services credit analysis risk measurement analysis performance analysis and analysis of corporate responsibility issues these services provide both domestic and international perspective research services are received primarily in the form of written reports computer generated services telephone contacts and personal meetings with security analysts in addition such services may be provided in the form of meetings arranged with corporate and industry spokespersons economists academicians and government representatives in some cases research services are generated by third parties but are provided to t rowe price by or through brokerdealers research services received from brokers and dealers are supplemental to t rowe prices own research effort and when utilized are subject to internal analysis before being incorporated by t rowe price into its investment process as a practical matter it would not be possible for t rowe price to generate all of the information presently provided by brokers and dealers t rowe price pays cash for certain research services received from external sources t rowe price also allocates brokerage for research services which are available for cash while receipt of research services from brokerage firms has not reduced t rowe prices normal research activities the expenses of t rowe price could be materially increased if it attempted to generate such additional information through its own staff to the extent that research services of value are provided by brokers or dealers t rowe price may be relieved of expenses which it might otherwise bear t rowe price has a policy of not allocating brokerage business in return for products or services other than brokerage or research services in accordance with the provisions of section e of the securities exchange act of  t rowe price may from time to time receive services and products which serve both research and nonresearch functions in such event t rowe price makes a good faith determination of the anticipated research and nonresearch use of the product or service and allocates brokerage only with respect to the research component commissions to brokers who furnish research services certain brokers and dealers who provide quality brokerage and execution services also furnish research services to t rowe price with regard to the payment of brokerage page  commissions t rowe price has adopted a brokerage allocation policy embodying the concepts of section e of the securities exchange act of  which permits an investment adviser to cause an account to pay commission rates in excess of those another broker or dealer would have charged for effecting the same transaction if the adviser determines in good faith that the commission paid is reasonable in relation to the value of the brokerage and research services provided the determination may be viewed in terms of either the particular transaction involved or the overall responsibilities of the adviser with respect to the accounts over which it exercises investment discretion accordingly while t rowe price cannot readily determine the extent to which commission rates or net prices charged by broker dealers reflect the value of their research services t rowe price would expect to assess the reasonableness of commissions in light of the total brokerage and research services provided by each particular broker t rowe price may receive research as defined in section e in connection with selling concessions and designations in fixed price offerings in which the funds participate internal allocation procedures t rowe price has a policy of not precommitting a specific amount of business to any broker or dealer over any specific time period historically the majority of brokerage placement has been determined by the needs of a specific transaction such as marketmaking availability of a buyer or seller of a particular security or specialized execution skills however t rowe price does have an internal brokerage allocation procedure for that portion of its discretionary client brokerage business where special needs do not exist or where the business may be allocated among several brokers or dealers which are able to meet the needs of the transaction each year t rowe price assesses the contribution of the brokerage and research services provided by brokers or dealers and attempts to allocate a portion of its brokerage business in response to these assessments research analysts counselors various investment committees and the trading department each seek to evaluate the brokerage and research services they receive from brokers or dealers and make judgments as to the level of business which would recognize such services in addition brokers or dealers sometimes suggest a level of business they would like to receive in return for the various brokerage and research services they provide actual brokerage received by any firm may be less than the suggested allocations but can and often does exceed the suggestions because the total business is allocated on the basis of all the considerations described above in no case is a broker or dealer excluded from receiving business from t rowe price because it has not been identified as providing research services page  miscellaneous t rowe prices brokerage allocation policy is consistently applied to all its fully discretionary accounts which represent a substantial majority of all assets under management research services furnished by brokers or dealers through which t rowe price effects securities transactions may be used in servicing all accounts including nonfund accounts managed by t rowe price conversely research services received from brokers or dealers which execute transactions for the fund are not necessarily used by t rowe price exclusively in connection with the management of the fund from time to time orders for clients may be placed through a computerized transaction network the fund does not allocate business to any broker dealer on the basis of its sales of the funds shares however this does not mean that brokerdealers who purchase fund shares for their clients will not receive business from the fund some of t rowe prices other clients have investment objectives and programs similar to those of the fund t rowe price may occasionally make recommendations to other clients which result in their purchasing or selling securities simultaneously with the fund as a result the demand for securities being purchased or the supply of securities being sold may increase and this could have an adverse effect on the price of those securities it is t rowe prices policy not to favor one client over another in making recommendations or in placing orders t rowe price frequently follows the practice of grouping orders of various clients for execution which generally results in lower commission rates being attained in certain cases where the aggregate order is executed in a series of transactions at various prices on a given day each participating clients proportionate share of such order reflects the average price paid or received with respect to the total order t rowe price has established a general investment policy that it will ordinarily not make additional purchases of a common stock of a company for its clients including the t rowe price funds if as a result of such purchases  or more of the outstanding common stock of such company would be held by its clients in the aggregate to the extent possible t rowe price intends to recapture solicitation fees paid in connection with tender offers through t rowe price investment services inc the funds distributor at the present time t rowe price does not recapture commissions or underwriting discounts or selling group concessions in connection with taxable securities acquired in underwritten offerings t rowe price does however attempt to negotiate elimination of all or a

independent pricing service which considers yield or price of bonds of comparable quality coupon maturity and type as well as prices quoted by dealers who make markets in such securities except with respect to certain securities held by the money fund securities with remaining maturities less than one year are stated at fair value which is determined by using a matrix system that establishes a value for each security based on bidside money market yields securities originally purchased by page  the money fund with remaining maturities of  days or less are valued at amortized cost in addition securities purchased by the money fund with maturities in excess of  days but which currently have maturities of  days or less are valued at their amortized cost for the  days prior to maturitysuch amortization being based on the fair value of the securities on the st day prior to maturity there are a number of pricing services available and the directors of the funds on the basis of ongoing evaluation of these services may use or may discontinue the use of any pricing service in whole or in part securities or other assets for which the above valuation procedures are inappropriate or are
