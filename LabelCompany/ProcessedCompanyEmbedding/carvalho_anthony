about contact me music things to check out after the get downthe second season of the get down is now on netflix for  things to check out after the get down adminapril   the second season of the get down is now on netflix for your binge watching pleasure i’m definitely going to burn through those episodes watching the get down made me nostalgic for a couple of movies from my past so i figured i’d share some of those as well as some other things you may be into there is no particular order to the list just  dope things to help get you through until the next season of the get down  the breaks  there’s more than one show about coming up in the hip hop and no i’m not talking about power or empire i’m talking about vh’s the breaks if the early ’s thing is a bit too dated the breaks may be the update you’re looking for set in new york in  three friends nikki afton williamson david david call and deevee mack wilds work to make their mark in the music industry the series started as a  min movie on vh but has since been picked up for a full season in  the movie features appearance by method man as deevee’s father wood harris in a pdiddyrussell simmons type roll and best of all the music was written by phonte and scored by dj premier  rubble kings  if you dig the era the get down is set it this will give you an inside look at the state of new york city in the late ’s particularly how early gang culture developed and evolved into early hip hop the early hip hop movement if you’ve ever seen the warriors this is a much watch because it is basically the true story that the warriors is based on  style wars  style wars was an early look at graffiti in new york city and is a unique time capsule of how the scene used to be the documentary debuted on pbs in the early ’s and was middle america’s introduction to the phenomenon for the most part this movie is particularly worth watching to introduce you to former nyc mayor ed koch who is hilariously portrayed by frank wood in the get down  beat street  some people find beat street a little hokey but it’s always been a classic to me and you can definitely tell that this movie along with style wars and the warriors served as points of reference for the get down beat street follows a group a friends including an upcoming dj and mc a bboy who dances with beat street breakers the new york city breakers and a graffitti artist named ramo the film features dj kool herc the trecherous three doug e fresh melle mel crazy legs and other early hip hop legends  hip hop family tree while not a tv show or movie ed piskor’s comic book take on hip hop history is a personal favorite of mine and was rumored to be used on set as inspiration it’s no surprise that early hip hop’s larger than life personas lend themselves naturally to a comic book this is a mustread if you your into graphic novels top  albums of  adminjanuary   i love a good top  but i’m usually terrible at remembering everything that came out in a year for example i didn’t realize untitled unmastered came out this year until i started doing research for this piece so when the eleven team asked me to compile my top  i hesitated a bit but because of how much great music there was i thought it would be fun to review this year  you can find eleven’s top albums songs and artists of  list herebut i thought i’d expand on my choices so you can find my list with links below with the pace with which hip hop moves these days a big factor in how i ranked my albums was how much i replayed an album in the era of streaming it’s much easier to move on to the next new album or compile a playlist of all your favorite parts so my choices emphasize some of the projects i continued to come back to and play from beginning to end  egg – alverstone if there’s one canadian rap project you listen to this year it should be egg’s debut solo project alverstone egg is garnering a strong buzz within hip hop scene in winnipeg as a member of the hip hop trio and local favourites peat egg wasted no time following peat ep released in september with his own solo project alverstone two months later from artwork bluntsport to production crabskull eggnmx steve fc coconut alverstone is an ode to winnipeg specifically its west end neighborhood the jazzy feel mixed with polysyllabic rhyme schemes and intricate lyrics is reminiscent of the golden era with out feeling dated imagine if nas was a filipino kid who grew up in the middle of canada with a penchant for melodies and that may help paint the picture of what to expect on alverstone stand outs still movin feel some way lost in the hold up  kaytranada –  this album made the list for a variety of reasons here’s quick glance at the pros section of my super analytical breakdown for this list • as a former radio host i have an affinity for canadian artists aka cancon • i am probably the biggest advocate of craig david you’ll ever meet • this was a way of including badbadnotgood river tiber anderson paak  phonte on my list • the unique sound of this project • he won the polaris prize • karriem riggins • i love robots the “soulection” sound captivated me this year and i think a shining example of that sound is kaytranada and this album it’s different it’s dancy and most importantly it’s dope  skepta – konnichiwa this year was a breakout year for the grime scene in an era where “mumble rap” dominates the airwaves grime is the counter point with intricate flows and an emphasis on its lyrical content lyricism is not dead it just has an english accent artists like giggs stormzy dave and more have made huge impact that reaches far beyond the uk but the tipping point came when skepta came through to shut down last year skepta followed up one of the biggest singles of the year exactly how you’re supposed to with classic album what a lot of people don’t realize is that this is actually skepta’s th studio album and that he produced  of the  tracks on konnichiwa in my opinion there is not a skippable track on this record i even listen to skits everytime i play it through powers bruv a top  is way too short and i feel like i left way too many amazing projects off the list so my honourable mentions include atcr isaiah rashad badbadnotgood childish gambino joe budden de la soul flygod… needless to say it was a good year what happend to rhythm  adminjuly   comments today rhythm  switched over to now country  and judging by the amount this question popped into my inbox i have a little explaining to do let me start by saying in case we haven’t spoken recently i quit my job at rhythm  back in may quitting was a very tough decision and i consider it hardest one i’ve had to make thus far i told myself i wouldn’t post anything until i could take the emotion out of it when that moment came i was over the whole ordeal and thought no one cared to read what i had to say about it if you’re this far i was wrong i began at rhythm as an intern back when it was streetz and they were plotting the rebrand to rhythm i noticed some frustrating elements even then but when i was presented with the opportunity to work there fulltime as my first job out of school i jumped at it i am a hip hop nerd at heart and i thought that i could help shape the station into something special because of my love for the culture in my time with rhythm i wrestled back and forth with whether or not our city can really sustain an urban station when i see the success of club nights like grippin grain i feel like maybe we could then a great show like nas comes to winnipeg for the first time and we can’t fill an arena factor in the fact that radio is a dying format with an archaic rating system and i really do wonder for those of you who aren’t familiar with the radio rating system a few thousand random members of our city’s population are sent an envelope with a “diary” and a  bill and they have to write in this diary when and what station they listen to and send it back the  is their payment for participating they then extrapolate those few responses for the rest of our city there is no way of telling how many people tune into your station in a day they do not track internet streams and the system has been the same for years like i said archaic no offense but even if our fans were selected to do the diary i doubt it would get completed i mean lets be honest would you do it in a conversation i had before i left i said “rhythm is the only urban radio station in canada and i know what you may say well if it’s the only station then maybe this format doesn’t work in canada to that i say flava  failed because they didn’t follow through on their requirements as a “teaching station” flow in toronto flipped over after being hit with a fine rap music is pop music right now and its biggest star is canadian so if an urban station can’t succeed in canada it’s not because there’s not a market for it it’s because of poor planning and management” mj and i had a lot of freedom with that station and i think we were able to create something that could’ve been a successful station in any market but without a clear direction and the support from our city in the ratings this was not meant to be i saw the writing on the wall and i was tired of giving a  when there were people in the building who did not so i quit with a growing family to take care of i quit my fulltime job with no other job in place i stress that because to me that paints the level of frustration perfectly and if you know me you know that i don’t give up on something i believe in very easily i honestly have no ill will towards any of the staff there and i would never blame any one person it was an amazing lesson in growth and the twoyears i spent there doing any and everything i could is an education worth far more than money could buy i was blessed to have worked with some amazing staff along the way i never planned to be onair and kind of took the role reluctantly but with the guidance and tips of paul raubliaskis miss melissa rick baverstock brian cook and most importantly mj i grew to love that portion of my day i liked the idea of making someone laugh or sharing a little tidbit of knowledge and for that rhythm is something i will always cherish we had something great in this city and i think we only realize it now that it is gone it’s one less outlet for our local artists to push their craft but it’s not the only outlet if you’re a local artist or even just a fan that is looking for a fix of great music on the radio please check out and support the local community radio stations like ckuw and umfm both stations have great urban programming and they’re always looking for new shows it’s where i got my start and who knows maybe it’s where i’ll return one
