homes offices furniture and common areas in the south florida for over  years known throughout the industry as “the designer’s designer” i have had the privilege of designing pieces and space plans for the area’s top designers as well as my own exclusive clientele design for me is a passion stemming from the heart interpreting the needs and wants of my clients and then translating it through renderings into their dream their reality nothing gives me more pleasure to draw an area floor plan or piece of furniture and after presenting it not a single line changes the comment is always “that’s exactly what i meant” is my goal each and every time as a designer i don’t try to impose my will on the client it’s their home their dream not mine i do however strongly suggest when i feel
