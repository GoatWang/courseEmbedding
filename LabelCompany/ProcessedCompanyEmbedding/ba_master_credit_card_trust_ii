credit card seems to launch with travel and cashback cards taking the lead similar in many ways travel cards can be thought of as the “adult” card because the miles or points can be quite valuable and there’s a little more thought to making them work in part because there can be an annual fee to leverage more on that later travel cards offer a twofold bonus first you can use them to maximize the returns on your travel spending saving you hundreds of dollars a year second some offer special access to travel rewards such as free nights in swanky hotels access to exclusive airport lounges and more not only can travel cards benefit those who work around the world or who often travel for pleasure they can reap great rewards for the occasional traveler just think – earn statement credits for a weekend getaway or a quick trip out of town here’s what you need to know to find the best one general rewards rate travel rewards cards offer rewards as a points system where the points have a certain cash value applicable toward travel spending often these cards refer to points as miles they are pretty much the same thing although the values can vary going above  and below  for every point or mile earned when earning you can get up to  for every dollar spent for a specific category such as restaurants or worldwide travel others will offer a flat  milesperdollar ratio on all purchases take stock of how much you spend on average for categories like restaurants gas and yes even airfare to decide which kind of travel card works best for you certain chase cards will increase the rewards rate if you redeem them through their travel purchase portal you can also often redeem for clothing electronics and other goods with many cards’ miles although you may not get as good of a rate of exchange signup bonus besides the general rewards plan you should closely examine the signup bonus when deciding on a travel rewards card you will have to meet a minimum spend requirement in the first few months so know your budget going in to ensure you can meet the goal make sure you have the money to pay it back in full and on time so you don’t incur interest fees otherwise you have defeated the purpose of getting a bonus airlinespecific perks airlinespecific cards can offer unique perks such as free checked bags priority boarding or lounge access if you have a loyalty to a certain airline the right rewards rate combined with these perks may make them a superior deal compared to more general travel cards transfer partnerships some travel cards have partnerships with specific hotel and airline rewards programs sometimes with a  ratio so even if you have a cobranded card you might be able to use your miles on other brands fine print and fees certain offers come with blackout dates in which you can’t apply your miles to reservations for certain flights or nights in a hotel they’re usually reserved for heavily trafficked times such as holidays or days near major events again having a plan comes in handy do you require fussfree redemptions or do you travel enough during offpeak times that blackout dates won’t bother you also pay attention to expiration dates your miles can expire if you don’t use them by a certain deadline others allow you to keep your miles as long as your account is active some cards may require you to book through an airline’s website in order to apply your points to the cost of your flight finally some travel cards will offer a certain reimbursement amount if your trip is delayed they can also have trip insurance lost luggage reimbursement and other benefits be mindful of annual fees you’ll want to make sure you will use the card enough to offset an annual fee also cards specific to a hotel or airline may offset the annual fee cost with certain perks like one free night’s stay or free flight every year you keep your account open many cards waive the fee for the first year want more information below are a

fees balance transfer fees and cash advance fees for example when you transfer a balance to your new card you are usually charged a  fee or  whichever is greater even if the card offers a  intro apr and you pay your balance by the time the offer ends the bank still gets a take card issuers as you probably know benefit from interest fees you pay when you carry a balance past a month these fees are hefty with the average apr running at about  if you make a  purchase and your apr is  a monthly minimum payment will mean that you pay for  months and pay  in interest great for the issuer not so amazing for you thats why its important not to carry a balance or youll wash away the earnings youve made with your travel card card issuers and networks earn a processing fee for each transaction that is typically paid by the merchant called interchange fees they are based on the volume and value of transactions usually the consumer is not impacted by this fee which can be a percentage of the transaction of say about  plus a flat fee of perhaps  per transaction that said you can be charged a “checkout fee” for using your card with all these fees floating around what do you do first off pay in full and on time each month that will keep you from paying late fees and interest fees also keep an emergency fund so you wont be tempted to take out a cash advance finally ask the merchant if you are being charged a checkout fee for using your visa or mastercard if so and its a big purchase you may want to think about shopping elsewhere what are the advantages of a travel credit card travel cards have a number of advantages including the ability to earn statement credits for travel and sometimes luxury benefits such as access to airport lounges if you are loyal to a specific hotel or airline brand you can earn double miles for spending on that brand and even earn stays and other loyalty benefits some cards such as the barclaycard arrival plus allows you to earn x miles on everything then you can earn a statement credit on travel purchases of your choosing this allows you to shop around for the best hotel airline limousine service condo rental car and so on add to that your miles don’t expire although there can be a deadline for redeeming a specific purchase what are the disadvantages of a travel credit card there are a few disavantages to travel cards but nothing that can’t be overcome as you know travel cards can have an annual fee but that doesn’t have to be a disadvantage simply make sure you will spend enough to cover the fee if for example you have a  annual fee and you get x miles on every purchase you’ll need to spend a minimum of  throughout the year to get  miles which is enough to cover the annual fee another challenge and this is true for all credit cards is that you can incur interest fees if you carry over a balance there’s an easy answer though just don’t charge anything you don’t already have the money to cover and pay in full and on time each month how do frequent flyer credit cards work frequent flyer credit cards reward you more for airlinerelated expenses including baggage checks tickets and food and drink the higher end cards might also gain you access to such benefits as brandspecific airport lounges the more you use the card on airline expenses the more you benefit with miles that can be redeemed for flights heads up that frequent flyer miles can expire so read the fine print also there can be blackout dates so before taking out a card make sure it’s a product you’ll use based on your current habits do you only travel for the holidays do you not really have an interest in airport lounges that will impact the card you apply for how do you use your airline miles cards vary widely when it comes to using your airline miles some cards offer a portal that allows you to redeem for qualified packages flights hotels and condos and more such as the barclaycard arrival plus the arrival plus allows you to redeem on any qualifying travel expense through a card portal that tracks how many points you need to redeem an item and how much more time you have to redeem for each item others limit how you use the miles to specific brands for example the american express delta cards’ miles can be specifically used for delta flights and other delta expenses what are bonus miles many travel cards offer a signup bonus in which you spend a certain amount on your card within a certain period of time usually  months or  days in exchange for a onetime bulk of miles or points some cards such as the chase sapphire preferred also give you points for behaviors such as signing up your first authorized user within a certain amount of time you typically have to be a new cardholder while the bonus miles are a great draw for the new cardholder there are a couple of things you want to make sure about before signing up first do you have the cash on hand to pay back the purchases you make to qualify for the bonus you’ll want to be able to pay it back by the due date of that month or you’ll incur interest charges which basically would defeat the purpose of the bonus miles remember a credit card is not designed to be a longterm loan second are you going to use the card enough to make the annual fee worth your while calculate how many miles you need to make up for the fee even if the fee is waived the first year because you want to consider a card to be a financial product for the long haul why because the longer you keep a card and treat it well the better it is for your credit how many miles does it take to get a free flight miles redemptions for a flight vary widely and it depends on the type of ticket you want ie first class and when and where you travel but for example on an oct   delta flight from lax to jfk main cabin it would have run you  miles miles can also be used to upgrade your seat purchase a companion’s ticket or buy refreshments miles often don’t expire read the fine print so it can be worth your while to save up for a big trip just double down on paying for things you would buy anyway to earn those miles sometimes you can pay rent car insurance and utilities with your credit card just make sure there are no fees for those charges how do you use a travel credit card to save money using a travel card to save money only works if you use your card for purchases you plan to make anyway and if you pay your card bill in full and on time each month that way you avoid late fees and interest charges you also want to make sure that your planned spending will put your miles or points above the annual fee so if you have an annual fee of  and the redemption is at  for every mile you want to make sure you plan to earn at least  miles or points in a year ideally you want to focus on your best travel or rewards card and put as many purchases as possible on it so that you earn maximum miles what do you need to consider before getting an airline credit card  things to consider before getting an airline credit card are you going to earn more points or miles than the value of the annual fee this can be a dealbreaker because there is no point is taking out a card that you won’t be using to the fullest extent will you be able to pay off the balance each month and on time again you don’t want to be in a situation where you are paying interest charges each month only put charges on your card that you can pay off by the deadline will you have an opportunity to use the miles or points you don’t have to be a big traveler to take advantage of many cards but you want to make sure this is a card that you will benefit from if it’s a loyalty card will you realistically use it for that brand without cramping your style if you aren’t dedicated to a particular brand of hotel or airline there are a number of great cards that allow you the freedom to use all manner of travel brands how do you strategically use an airline credit card  strategies to maximize airline rewards research thoroughly before choosing your card read the fine print do miles expire and when are there blackout dates can you live with the limitations make it your goto card see if you can pay your rent or utilities with it buy your groceries with it don’t spend just to earn miles only use it to buy what you were going to buy anyway if you can’t pay it off in full each month there’s no point in acquiring it the interest fees will overshadow any miles or points you’ve earned never go over the limit or pay late these are wasted dollars letting points expire are a waste keep track of when points are due to expire and plan ahead to use them so you aren’t wasting them on expensive travel dates also with some programs earning just one point can reset the expiration date stay flexible and try a variety of travel dates when redeeming for example international flights are sometimes cheaper midweek and flying on christmas day can be cheaper than flying on christmas eve sign up for loyalty programs use shopping portals and use travel portals that might earn you additional points such as the chase ultimate rewards portal frequently check for deals make a goal to use points for a trip then do it what do you look for in a travel rewards credit card here are  things to look for in a travel rewards credit card is it flexible enough for your needs there’s no point in taking out a card if you’ll never redeem the miles will you earn more points than the cost of the annual fee this is a deal breaker will you use it without overspending never carry over a charge from month to month are the benefits such as complimentary auto rental insurance or airport lounges items you will use if not there may be a good card for you with a lower annual fee do you want a card with a shopping portal this is a great way to save some money although heads up that the rate of exchange can be lower will you use the loyalty program if there is one for example hotel brands might offer one free night after a certain number are purchased are blackout dates or points expiration rules a deal breaker as always read the fine print how much is a frequent flyer mile worth while a frequent flyer mile is often worth  it can be more or less depending on the program for example according to our valuation system the discover it miles valuation is  for every mile while the chase ultimate rewards portal with the chase sapphire preferred is valued at  that means if you have accumulated  miles with your discover it miles card those miles are worth  if you have the chase sapphire preferred and you want to redeem them in the ultimate rewards portal you will get the equivalent to  when you redeem creditcardscom’s valuation system a reward value is determined by calculating the cost per reward unit point or mile for obtaining a good or service how do you redeem airline miles when redeeming airline miles sometimes it’s as simple as going into a portal after the purchase and clicking a button in other cases such as the american express delta cards you log into your delta account to purchase your tickets before choosing a card make sure you are clear about the steps and decide if you can live with those steps in the same way that you need to make sure that you’ll take full advantage of the card’s benefits and that you’ll maximize the savings you want to ensure that the way that you redeem suits your lifestyle some cards are very easy to use allowing you to redeem for pretty much anything that is travelrelated including limousine service others allow you to maximize your miles with a travel portal that gives you a bonus for redemptions do frequent flyer miles expire frequent flyer miles often expire some such as delta don’t others require your account to remain active although that can be as simple as earning a single mile before the expiration date make sure you read the fine print so you aren’t scrambling to use your milesthe key is to stay organized plan a specific trip for your miles and budget how many miles you need to earn to reach your goal never ever go over what you can afford and mark on your calendar when the miles would expire can you transfer airline miles to hotel points usually you can’t transfer airline miles to hotel points but there are exceptions the question is really should you do it the answer to that is typically no because the transfer ratios are rarely favorable it’s best to choose your card carefully and make sure you will use it well before applying for a card look at your past history do you love and use the brand that the card cobrands with have you used that brand in the past and will you use it in the future how often will you use it if you can see yourself earning enough points or miles to make the card worthwhile go for it can you transfer miles to another person you might be able to transfer miles to another person but it may not be to your advantage financially because you may be charged a fee for the transfer instead book an award seat for someone else by entering their name instead of yours in the portal just keep in mind that in the case of international flights some airlines require to see the card that was used sometimes even the cardholder has to be present at flight time or the ticket isn’t honored can you transfer miles from one airline to another typically you can’t transfer miles directly between airline loyalty programs although you may be able to earn and redeem miles for flights on partner airlines in fact in some cases partnerships offer a  ratio research which airlines your card’s cobrand has partnerships with taking special care to look for airlines that fly out of your city or to destinations you often travel to also research the transfer ratio before applying for a card research several cards because the best deal may not be your favorite brand you may in fact find that a more general card will give you more generous miles earned or that a card includes partnerships with your favorite brand is a travel credit card right for me there are a few factors that will help you decide if a travel card is right for you first do you have strong credit travel cards typically require good or excellent credit so there is no point in applying unless you have at least a  fico score the dominant scoring model that lenders use it has a range of  with  as the best do you have a good handle on your finances to maximize a travel card you need to be able to juggle a couple of balls it’s not difficult but if you are not sure how much money is coming in how much you spend each month and what you are spending it on you may want to hold off on getting a travel card why because to use the travel card successfully you will want to use the card as much as possible but never on something you don’t already have the money for a cashback card such as the chase freedom unlimited may be a better choice for you for now because it offers a straight  cash back and there’s no annual fee finally do you travel at least somewhat you don’t have to be a jetsetter but to take full advantage of the card you’ll want to at least be someone who travels a couple of times a year or on a few weekend trips a year the best way to assess this is to look at your travel habits in the past year study how much you spent and track which airlines and hotels you stayed at with a little effort on the front end a travel card can save you hundreds a year on travel expenses give you free nights or even flights or even grant you access to luxury airport lounges

not familiar with balance transfers our balance transfer card reviews will help you discover what the details of each card are and show you what rewards are worth what is the meaning of balance transfer a balance transfer means you transfer the balance from one credit card to a card typically with a lower interest rate lets say you have  on card a with a  apr that means if you pay the minimum amount it will take you  months and you will pay  in interest if you transfer that  to card b with an introductory  apr for  months that means you have  months to pay off the balance without paying interest fees thereby potentially avoiding the cost of  balance transfers are also an option if you want to streamline your payments simply transfer your balances to a single card and make one payment a month what is a balance transfer card a balance transfer card is a credit card that consumers typically use to avoid paying a higher interest fee the balance on card a is transferred to card b which may have a low or  introductory apr credit card companies will sometimes attract new customers with little to no interest for a set period sometimes as long as  months such as the citi simplicity balance transfer cards may also have a  introductory apr for purchases for example the simplicity has an introductory  apr of  months for purchases each credit card specifies which balances will be paid first typically starting with the lowest–rate balances some balance transfer card rules specify that only transferred balances qualify for the lower rate while new purchases collect interest at the regular higher apr what is a balance transfer fee a balance transfer fee is the charge for transferring a balance from one credit card to another the more you transfer the larger the fee a typical fee is – with a minimum of  or  for example if you transfer a  debt from another card you might pay a  fee right away while that expense may seem hefty assess whether you will actually save by transferring to a  introductory apr card to avoid interest fees because you can easily spend thousands on interest fees however make sure you will be able to pay off the debt by the time the introductory offer ends because the new card will likely revert to a go–to apr that can be  or more see if it makes sense for you by using our balance transfer calculator keep in mind that some balance transfer cards dont have balance transfer fees such as the barclaycard ring mastercard what is a balance transfer intro period a balance transfer introductory period refers to a low or  apr offer a credit card issuer provides for a limited period of time as an incentive to become a cardholder a cardholder can pay down debt transferred from another card while not paying interest for the debt for an introductory period of time a balance transfer intro period can last up to  months after the set period the interest rate can increase to a “go–to rate” of  or more you should make sure you evaluate the balance transfer interest rate during the promotional period the length of the promotional period and the balance transfer fee when deciding which balance transfer offer is best for you what is balance transfer intro apr an introductory apr period is the amount of time you have to pay off the amount youve transferred without paying interest a  apr period can last up to  months most balance transfer cards with a few exceptions charge you to move your balance generally this fee is a percent of the balance youre transferring ranging from  to  depending on the card or – whichever is greater since most cards default rate can be higher than the rate you had on your old card paying off your debt within the  period is crucial read the fine print as some cards will void the  deal if you miss a payment how does a balance transfer on a credit card work transferring the balance from one credit card to a card with a lower apr is referred to as a balance transfer it should be noted that transferring isnt the same as repaying when you use a balance transfer card you are transferring the debt from card a to card b then if card b has an introductory offer you can typically have a set amount of time up to  months to pay off the debt without paying any interest fees although there can be a balance transfer fee other reasons to transfer a balance can be to consolidate your debts however avoid closing a credit card account because having available credit helps your credit rating so if you transfer debt from card a now you have a card without any debt which increases your credit utilization ratio the ratio of your available credit to how much you owe the lower the ratio the better that means if you keep card a open your available credit is boosted and your ratio is lower also card as payment history can help your credit just be sure to keep card as account active by charging a small monthly amount and pay it on time and in full each month are credit card balance transfers a good idea transferring a credit card balance can be a good idea if youve incurred card debt and you are paying the minimum monthly amount that can translate to high monthly apr fees that can be avoided if you transfer your debt to a card with a  introductory apr however make sure you have a plan to pay off the debt before the introductory offer ends because balance transfer cards typically have a “go–to” rate that can be  or more once the offer ends another good reason for transferring a card balance is consolidation if you have debt on multiple cards and you want to avoid the hassle of multiple payments taking out a good balance transfer card can be wise however get to the root of the problem why do you have debt on multiple cards if you are using your credit cards to buy items not in your budget the problem may not be the cards it may be your spending habits also taking out a new credit card to transfer a balance can be a bad idea if you are planning to take out an installment loan a car loan or a mortgage in the coming months because lenders look for “hard pulls” or evidence of recent requests for credit if you plan to buy a car or house soon weigh whether any card debt you have could impact your application with whether lenders would be concerned about new cards when in doubt check with your lender before making any financial move do balance transfers help your credit a balance transfer can certainly improve your credit – in the long term a number of aspects of your credit score come into play when you transfer a balance to a new credit card notably your payment history which is your history of on–time payments and your credit utilization which is your available credit compared to your debt to a lesser extent the length of your old cards history and taking out a new card can also impact your credit heres how payment history the most important and most obvious factor in play during a balance transfer is the opportunity to establish a better payment history payment history makes up  of your fico score the scoring model most used by lenders transferring debt from a high interest account to one with a  apr into period can significantly lessen the burden of maintaining a monthly payment schedule you may have to pay a lump sum upfront in the form of a transfer fee but the money you will save on interest can more than make up for it over time if you pay more than the minimum amount and establish a plan to pay off the transferred balance before the introductory period expires you will be debt–free years before you would if you pay the minimum this will both save you money and improve your financial responsibility in the eyes of future creditors credit utilization along with an improved payment history balance transfers can boost your credit by lowering your credit utilization limit–to–balance ratio in fact the second most important part of your fico score is amount owed at  the credit utilization ratio is a measure of the debt you owe in comparison to the credit limit available to you if you keep the old paid–off card that automatically boosts your ratio because you have available credit with no debt however dont incur any additional debt once the new credit line has been established or youll defeat the purpose of building credit and get yourself back in your debt predicament length of credit history some  of your fico score is made up by the length of credit history and thats another great reason to keep your old card so that you continue building your time with an older product new credit some  of your fico score is made up by new credit in your file thats actually a reason to pause before taking out a balance transfer card – a new credit product can ding your rating albeit not by much just be deliberate about your card choice and make sure you dont have plans to take out an installment loan car loan or mortgage in the coming months because lenders will be looking for any new products when they review your file credit mix in use the remaining  of your fico score encourages a mix of credit products such as credit cards and installment loans for this reason dont take out a balance transfer card without a plan but a new balance transfer card can help your credit by allowing you to consolidate and to help you pay down your card debt are balance transfers bad for your credit used incorrectly balance transfers can be bad for your credit used right it can be great for your credit heres what you need to know when you apply for a balance transfer credit card – or any type of credit – it dings your credit as a result your credit score will drop by a few points but if you plan to use the card to get your debt under control that benefit can outweigh the disadvantage of those few lost points which will be recovered within a few short months of good payment habits planning to cut loose of that old card that has been weighing on your credit soul hold up because a paid–off card with good credit payment history is credit gold heres how first the fico scoring model likes it when you have a lot of available credit but not much debt so if you keep the old card youve increased your available credit when you take out the new card and your percentage of debt goes down because of that additional available credit second fico loves credit accounts with a history of on–time payments so its worth your while to hang on to that card youve made the right decision to keep your old card but you plan to lock it up in a sock drawer stop by not using your old card you run the risk of letting the account lapse and that payment history clock stops keep using the card each month but responsibly more on that later although you need to keep using your old card you dont want to incur additional debt because then your credit utilization ratio – remember the debt to available credit percentage – will be too high heres what to do put a small monthly charge you would have anyway such as your gym membership on auto debit but be sure to pay in full each month in some cases making a payment even a single day late can cause the issuer to cancel your  apr period and leave you immediately subject to the high interest rates you sought to escape in the first place also this will affect your payment history so be sure to pay on time or your credit will be surely affected things to consider before applying for a balance transfer card balance transfer credit cards are a great way to improve your credit used correctly used incorrectly these cards can wreak havoc on your credit there are  things to consider before applying for a balance transfer card can i withstand the credit score effects applying for a new card requires a hard inquiry which will temporarily drop your credit score this can be recovered rather quickly and is generally not cause for worry however if you plan to take out an installment loan in the next few months such as a car loan or a mortgage these slight dings impact the interest rates or even whether you can land the loan of your choice if your new card is the only credit you have on the horizon then the drop in points will be temporary and relatively harmless provided you continue to pay on time and keep your debt down what is the available credit limit the credit limit should be sufficient to cover the desired transfer amount without maxing out the new account this way you can take maximum advantage of the lower interest rates and improve your credit utilization ratio simultaneously this ratio looms large for the fico scoring model the model most used by lenders it is the amount of available credit you have compared to the amount of debt you have the lower the percentage of debt the better that means the higher the new cards limit the better because any credit you arent using counterbalances your debt how much is the transfer fee low interest or  intro apr transfer cards usually require a transfer fee that typically ranges between  and  of the balance or – whichever is greater in most cases this fee is minuscule in comparison to the interest charges you would otherwise pay and is therefore a good tradeoff however if the balance is low enough it may not be worth paying the transfer fee in the first place its also worth noting that some card issuers waive the balance transfer fee such as the barclaycard ring mastercard how long is the introductory apr period the appeal of a balance transfer card comes in the form of a low or  intro apr but these rates dont last forever these teaser rates can be for up to  months such as the citi simplicity look at all the cards benefits though because some cards have a shorter intro apr such as the blue cash everyday yet they offer an introductory cashback offer and cash back for such purchases as groceries and gas terms apply think about how youll use your card in the long haul that said make sure you only use such a card for purchases you can afford to pay off and after the balance transfer is paid so that you dont return to the cycle of debt youre trying to escape some cards such as the blue cash everyday have a  intro apr for purchases as well can i stay disciplined throughout the process be true to yourself if not you could only worsen your existing situation if you struggle with making monthly payments on time or dont trust your ability to cease acquiring debt having another card at your disposal is probably not the best option in fact you may have difficulty even getting a new card if you have a history of late payments conversely if you feel you are responsible enough to stick to the plan you have set for yourself a balance transfer can bring you budgetary glory if you think you can keep the old card active without incurring new debt and you can pay down your new card without buying new items a balance transfer card could be right for you how to select the right balance transfer card looking to land a balance transfer credit card heres how to select the right one for you required credit scoreeven rejected applications require a hard inquiry and will ding your credit make sure you are within range of the card issuers required credit for a card that requires good credit you need a fico score of about  on a scale of – the higher the score the more likely youll land the card although other factors also play in such as multiple inquiries and wages if you have your eye on a card that requires excellent credit plan to have a score of at least  possibly more sufficient credit limitthe available credit line should be substantial enough to cover the sum youre looking to transfer ideally you would like to have a credit limit that allows for a full transfer and some breathing room the higher your limit the better not because you can spend it but because you wont if you have air in your limit or available credit that isnt being used that can help boost your credit score balance transfer feemost balance transfer cards have a transfer fee of – or – whichever is greater but some such as the chase slate offer for an introductory period of no transfer fee lengthy introductory periodbalance transfer cards will offer low or  intro apr for up to  months use our handy–dandy payoff calculator to see how much time you need to pay each month and pay off the balance before the introductory offer ends you dont want to get into a situation where you still have a balance when the offer ends so choose wisely reasonable ongoing aprwhile you dont want to have a balance remaining when the introductory offer ends pay attention to the go–to apr rate which is the interest rate your account will revert to once the offer ends ultimately the go–to rate shouldnt matter because you are paying your card bill in full and on time each month right but its good to pay attention to the details just in case annual feeon the surface you want a card without an annual fee right but annual fees are sometimes waived the first year and the benefits of a card such as cash back on a blue cash preferred can make the annual fee worthwhile think in the long term about how you plan to use your new card if you solely want it for the introductory apr offer you dont want an annual fee if you plan to make it your go–to card once the balance is paid off expand your horizons and look at balance transfer cards with bonus signup points or cash back and other perks acceptable terms  conditionsthere are usually conditions that must be adhered to in order to take full advantage of the balance transfer for example an issuer will likely require a transfer to be completed within a specified amount of time to lock in the offered rates in other cases the introductory apr may be nullified if you are late on a single payment and the regular apr could kick in immediately always read the fine print how do you transfer a balance from one credit card to another transferring a balance from one credit card to another is pretty straightforward simply place a call to the new creditors customer service line communicate that you would like to transfer a balance onto your new card and a representative will guide you from there you may also accomplish this online though the exact procedure will vary depending on the bank heads up that you will likely have to pay a balance transfer fee although some cards do not charge one such as barclaycard ring mastercard also make sure you get terms with the new card that will allow you to pay the debt in full by the end of the introductory offer so if you owe  and the offer is  apr for  months that means you need to make sure you can pay  a month for a year that way you dont pay interest rates on the balance how long does it take to transfer a balance from one credit card to another generally a balance transfer can be expected to clear within  days of the request being placed however the exact amount of time it will take varies and is dependent on a number of issues many people report that their balance transfers have been accomplished in under  hours while others have complained of a transfer taking upwards of two weeks to complete unfortunately theres no clear–cut timeline in order to better gauge how long a transfer will take consider the following factors account ageif your account with the receiving creditor has been active prior to the transfer request it will likely complete more quickly than with a newly opened account transfer processif the money can be transferred electronically to the creditor it will often take less time than payment via physical check balance amountlarge balances may take longer to complete whereas balances of less than a specified amount could be fast–tracked in accordance with issuer policy issuercreditorsimply

quality control information relayed over the phone is subject to being misunderstood or incorrectly entered time of requestis it close to the weekend are there any major holidays coming up if so the process might be delayed until normal business resumes can you transfer a balance from one card to another from the same bank typically a bank does not allow a balance transfer between two cards it has issued thats because it doesnt make good business sense for the financial institution after all banks and card issuers operate to make money on the debt you owe and a balance transfer represents a means of saving the cardholder money on that debt that said the structure of a balance transfer exists as a win–win for all parties involved when the debt is being transferred from one creditor to another as it is almost always done this way both parties are satisfied for the following reasons the new creditor takes on an existing debt but more importantly gains a new customer the customer pays a relatively modest transfer fee typically  to  of the balance but saves money in the long run by taking advantage of the  intro apr period and lower interest rates how to properly use a balance transfer card here are tips to properly use a balance transfer card cease applying for new cardsonce you get a balance transfer card dont take out any more cards every time a card issuer checks your credit which is done when you apply for a card that dings your credit rating a cluster of inquiries may paint you as being financially unstable also additional cards only increase the temptation to spend keep existing accounts openthe average age of your accounts is taken into consideration when determining your creditworthiness therefore keeping older established lines of credit active following a transfer only helps your credit rating it will also help you obtain a more admirable credit utilization ratio which is the second most important factor taken into account by lenders the ratio compares the available credit to the amount owed the closer to  the better finally charge a small amount on your old card that you would spend anyway and pay in full and on time each month that keeps your account active and it will actually help build your credit in no time stick to your payment planby now you should have planned out a strategy that will allow you to pay off the full balance before the introductory period runs out this includes budgeting for any necessary fees determining how much you will need to pay each month and identifying all stipulations that must be observed as part of the balance transfer agreement stop incurring additional debtquit adding to the problem after all theres a reason you sought a balance transfer in the first place halting charges on both the old and new accounts will save you from paying on the interest rates you fled and will make it much easier to abide by your payment schedule if the remaining balance isnt in constant fluctuation also

of time up to  months this is handy when youve incurred debt and you cant get out from under the interest fees or you have a big purchase coming up there are basically two types of offers sometimes in a single card balance transfer — this  intro apr offer encourages you to transfer your balances from older cards to the card with the offer there is usually a balance transfer fee of – or – whichever is greater but it can still be worth your while if you have a larger balance thats because interest rates compound quickly with you owing hundreds of dollars in interest within a few months purchases — you can make a big purchase on your new card and pay interest–free for a set amount of time what does  intro apr mean the term “ intro apr” means that you can pay interest–free for a set amount of time on balance transfers andor purchases the offers length of time varies by card and can be as little as  months and as long as  months for example the discover it offers an intro  apr on purchases for  months and a  apr on balance transfers for  months while the citi diamond preferred offers a  intro apr on both purchases and balance transfers for  months heads up that there is usually a balance transfer fee and if you are late paying the card issuer might kick in the go–to apr but if you pay on time and map out paying the debt before the offer ends you can save hundreds of dollars how to choose a  apr offer when its time to choose a  apr offer a number of issues come into play including length of the offer and balance transfer fees heres what you need to know check the length of the offer check how long the introductory rate sometimes called the “intro rate” or “teaser rate” will last while you may think that the longer the introductory period the better its actually more important to plan how much you can afford to pay each month so that you dont owe money when the offer ends know your “go–to rate” thats the rate after the introductory period while this shouldnt be a dealbreaker because youre going to pay in full each month right its prudent to know all the aspects of the card including the go–to ask about balance transfer fees if you plan to transfer an existing credit card balance to the new card the fees generally run  to  of the balance transferred or  whichever is greater a few cards offer no balance transfer fee such as the chase slate watch your mail card issuers often run special offers when they lower or waive the fees weigh other benefits such as the  cash back offer of the discover it cashback match which also has a –month  intro apr on both purchases and balance transfers sometimes its actually better to have a shorter offer period because the card has benefits youll use after the offer ends what is a go–to apr a go–to apr is the rate that kicks in once the  intro apr offer ends so if the card youve chosen offers an –month  intro apr you have  months to pay for the balance then the go–to rate kicks in your credit rating and your history of payments help decide what your rate will be the better your payment history and the higher your credit rating the lower the go–to rate what is the average interest rate on a credit card the average interest rate on credit cards varies based in part on the federal reserves monthly decision on interest rates currently the national average for credit cards is about  but that can vary based on type of card low interest cards of course have the lowest average at under  business and student cards are also low both under  the highest are instant approval at just over  and bad credit at over  that said you should not be too concerned about a cards interest rate because its best to pay your card bill in full each month its better for your credit because fico the dominant credit scoring model tracks your credit utilization ratio which is the amount of available credit you have compared to the balance that you owe the lower the balance the lower your ratio which fico loves what is a good interest rate on a credit card rather than choose a credit card because it has a “good” interest rate look at the cards features because credit cards are not meant to be long–term loans the national average for credit card interest rates is about  depending on the type of card the interest rate will vary with low interest cards at the bottom and bad credit cards at the top but that shouldnt concern you too much instead look at the  intro rate for balance transfers and purchases when choosing a card then make sure you can pay off the debt before the go–to rate kicks in if you know youre going to go past the intro rate period then make sure you pay on time to improve your credit rating because your credit rating and your on–time payments are two factors for what your go–to rate will be what determines the apr on a credit card the apr on a credit card is determined by a number of factors including the federal reserves current rate your credit rating the type of card you choose and whether you have been paying on time the national average go–to interest rate for credit cards is about  — thats higher or lower depending on the type of card with low interest and student cards at the bottom and bad credit cards at the top when the federal reserve increases its benchmark for rates youll typically see credit cards rates inch up your credit rating and whether you pay on time also factor into your rate credit cards can have a range from which they assign your go–to rate watch out because you can drive your apr up by paying late or going over the limit that can also land you with fines and even loss of the card how do you calculate interest on a credit card the easiest way to calculate interest on a credit card is with our handy–dandy calculators you can figure out how much interest youll owe if you pay the minimum look at how much you need to pay on a balance transfer each month to avoid interest rates or see how long it will take you to pay off your debt that said it helps to understand how credit card issuers calculate interest according to discover just divide your apr say its  by  days or  so if you have a balance of  the daily interest rate is  which accrues each day at the end of the month you owe  that may not seem like much but it can add up quickly if you pay the minimum on  each month  apr it will take you  months and you will pay  in interest better to just pay in full each month and not put anything on your card you cant afford to buy with cash how do you avoid paying interest on a credit card its easy to avoid paying interest on a credit card – just pay in full each month before the due date remember credit cards arent meant to be long–term lenders they should be for building credit and convenience you dont want to use a card for an emergency when you dont have the cash nearby because the interest fees can overwhelm you instead build an emergency fund that you can tap when the unexpected occurs such as a broken–down car or a medical bill in fact it can actually be a good idea to pay more than once a month just to be safe if you pay in full several times a month you can potentially improve your credit even more because you dont know when issuers report to credit bureaus – pay several times a month and increase the chance of having a low balance when issuers report fico the dominant credit scoring model bases your rating on what the credit bureaus gather about your finances heres how it works fico compares how much available credit you have to how much of a balance you have the lower the ratio the better so if you have  available credit and you owe  your credit utilization ratio is only  owe  the ratio jumps to  if you pay several times a month you increase the chance of lowering your ratio which is a critical part of your score how do you use a  apr credit card there are myriad ways to use a  apr credit card from making a big purchase such as an appliance or grill to using it to pay down an existing balance  apr cards can simplify your life there are some things you need to know though the best way to use a  introductory period offer is to calculate how much you can pay each month for how long so if you make a  purchase and can pay  a month a –month offer is enough for you if you plan to use the card for a balance transfer keep in mind that you will probably have a balance transfer fee of – that means you will owe – right out of the gate but that can be worth your while if the interest you would pay otherwise is higher than the fees is using a  apr card a good way to build credit any credit card including a  apr card that is used wisely is a good way to build credit with a new card you are increasing your available credit which can be helpful for your fico rating also each month that you pay on time your credit rating gets a little kick and if you are diligent about paying down your debt that will also improve your credit as the balance goes down provided you dont incur additional debt that said taking out a credit card is only good for your credit if you are responsible with it it is the fastest way to build credit no matter the type of card but it can be a disaster if you let charges pile up or if you dont pay on time each month before committing to a new card make sure you will use it correctly can you use a  apr credit card to help pay off student loans paying off student loans with a  apr credit card can be tricky first you might owe more than you can pay off in the maximum offer of  months which means you would probably be strapped with higher interest rates than you were paying on the student loan also you will probably have a charge of – on the total which is another expense you may not have expected finally it is actually worth your while to hang on to the student loan because its an installment loan fico the dominant scoring model likes a mix of credit types and if you have a credit card and an installment loan that can give your credit score a little boost provided youre paying on time should i cancel my  interest card once i pay off the balance its rare when you should cancel your  interest card once you pay off the balance thats because keeping it on hand is a great way build your credit heres why lets say you paid off  within the  months your  intro interest offer lasted awesome right now youre so sick of credit cards you want to cancel the card and go all cash but not so fast heres the deal the fastest way to build credit is to have a credit card and to pay in full and on time each month fico the dominant scoring model loves it when you do that and you will be rewarded within months of your good habits still hate credit cards and want to pay in cash theres a way to have the best of both worlds keep your card account active by putting a charge on it each month that you would make any way such as your gym membership then pay it off before the due date then use cash envelopes or whatever system you prefer to stay within budget whatever you do dont put the card in your sock drawer because its only a matter of time before the issuer cancels the card because its inactive join the

right cashback card for you there are few credit cards as versatile as the cashback card no matter your purchase habits theres likely a cashback card for you you can earn cash without having to think about it you can max out rewards by pairing this kind of card with a travel rewards card such as a chase freedom or freedom unlimited card and a chase sapphire preferred with a few cashback cards you can even build your credit when its not at its best while earning cash back many have no annual fee there is also the option of rotating categories or flat cashback percentages well explain all that in easytounderstand language heres what you need to know what is a cashback credit card a cashback credit card is a card that allows you to earn cash for making purchases most require good or excellent credit which means you need at least a fico score of  before you even think about applying fico the credit scoring model most used by lenders rates on a scale of  with  as the best cashback cards are an excellent gateway card into travel cards which can be more complicated to maneuver and typically have an annual fee because cashback cards often don’t have annual fees you don’t have to worry about a minimum spend to make the card worth your while once you’ve built your credit pick out a cashback card and practice good moneymanagement habits with it that means keep a budget plan what you’ll use your card for only spend what you have the money to repay and pay in full and on time each month after you’ve successfully managed your cashback card for about a year then it’s time to look at possibly upgrading to a travel or rewards card for more intense benefits why use cashback credit cards you may be wondering why you should use a cashback credit card if you can pay your balance in full and on time each month you can earn cash back in the hundreds each year say you have a card that pays  back on everything and there is no annual fee if you spend  a month for a year you will get  back at the end of that year also by paying in full and on time each month you will improve your credit because fico the dominant scoring model loves it when you dont carry a balance on your credit cards and it really loves when you pay on time how do i get a cashback credit card when you apply for a cashback credit card the card issuer will gather some information including social security number name and address and income fill out the form honestly because you can have the card revoked if you’re caught in a lie income can be money you have access to rather than just your salary so if you and your spouse are employed you can combine the incomes this is helpful if you are an athome parent and the family has just one income many cards will approve or decline you within minutes if you are approved you may be able to shop online with your new account your card will arrive within a few days in the mail how do cashback credit cards work cashback credit cards work in a variety of ways usually offering a percentage back for your purchases say you have a wells fargo cash wise card which gives  back on everything that means if you spend  a month on groceries gas and other expenses at year end youll earn  back and because many cashback cards dont have annual fees youre not having to clear that “fee hurdle” some cashback cards are a little more complicated they might pay for quarterly categories for example such as the discover it cashback match categories can have reward limits  for example the cashback match gives you  back for up to  a quarter categories can include wholesale clubs restaurants gas and more the advantage with a card that has quarterly categories is that you get a higher reward however there are usually signups limits and you have to keep track of which categories qualify depending on the card cash back can be in the form of credit statements bank deposit checks even merchandise through shopping portals for example discover deals allows you to get cashback bonuses or money off your purchases through these shopping portals you can shop for clothing gifts health and beauty aids travel and more some cards such as the wells fargo propel allow you to redeem for gift cards what are signup bonuses on cashback cards many cashback cards offer a signup bonus typically between  and  with a required spend within a certain amount of time usually  days or  months the required spend is usually below that of a travel card typically  or less this makes it easier to meet the requirements and earn the cash bonus for example the chase freedom unlimited offers  after a  spend within your first  months of card membership make sure you have the cash to pay back the required spend because if you carry the charge over monthtomonth you basically undo the benefit of the bonus by paying interest fees how do you use a cashback credit card to save money using a cashback card to save money only works if you use your card for purchases you plan to make anyway and if you pay your card bill in full and on time each month that way you avoid late fees and interest charges you also want to make sure that your planned spending will put your cash back above any annual fee so if you have an annual fee of  and the redemption is at  on every dollar spent you want to make sure you plan to spend at least  in a year ideally you want to focus on your best cashback travel or rewards card and put as many purchases as possible on it so that you earn maximum miles how do you strategically use a cashback credit card  strategies to maximize cashback rewards research thoroughly before choosing your card read the fine print when choosing a card assess what kind of card it is whether it has a flat cashback rate or rotating categories if you like the opportunity to earn as much as  back on select categories your first year then a rotating card might be a good choice just make sure you are willing to do the quarterly signups and keep track of the categories if not a flat rate card may be best this way you can earn up to  back on everything make it your goto card see if you can pay your rent insurance and utilities with it but make sure there are no additional charges buy your groceries with it don’t spend just to earn cash back only use it to buy what you were going to purchase anyway if you can’t pay it off in full each month there’s no point in acquiring it the interest fees will overshadow any cash back you’ve earned never go over the limit or pay late these are wasted dollars use shopping portals frequently check for deals what do you look for in a cashback credit card here are  things to look for in a cashback credit card is it flexible enough for your needs there’s no point in taking out a card if you’ll never use it is there an annual fee will you earn more cash back than the cost of the annual fee this is a deal breaker will you use it without overspending never carry over a charge from month to month if you aren’t sure it might be best to choose a creditbuilder card and put a small charge on it each month paying in full before the due date do you want a card with a shopping portal this is a great way to save some money why do creditors offer cashback cards on the surface it doesnt make sense why creditors or credit card issuers offer cashback credit cards used correctly you can get hundreds of dollars back each year but it makes sense once you understand the issuer business model heres how it works card issuers charge fees such as late payment fees annual fees balance transfer fees and cash advance fees for example when you transfer a balance to your new card you are usually charged a  fee or  whichever is greater even if the card offers a  intro apr and you pay your balance by the time the offer ends the bank still gets a take card issuers as you probably know benefit from interest fees you pay when you carry a balance past a month these fees are hefty with the average apr running at about  if you make a  purchase and your apr is  a monthly minimum payment will mean that you pay for  months and pay  in interest great for the issuer not so amazing for you thats why its important not to carry a balance or youll wash away the earnings youve made with your cashback card card issuers and networks earn a processing fee for each transaction that is typically paid by the merchant called interchange fees they are based on the volume and value of transactions usually the consumer is not impacted by this fee which can be a percentage of the transaction of say about  plus a flat fee of perhaps  per transaction although there can be what is called a checkout fee that the consumer pays with all these fees floating around what do you do first off pay in full and on time each month that will keep you from paying late fees and interest fees also keep an emergency fund so you wont be tempted to take out a cash advance finally ask the merchant if you are being charged a checkout fee for using your visa or mastercard if so and its a big purchase you may want to think about shopping elsewhere what are typical cashback rates there is no typical cashback rate cards can pay out a flat  or  or they can give a higher rate for specific types of purchases for example the blue cash everyday offers  back on purchases made at us supermarkets for up to  a year its  after that that comes to  back terms apply some cards such as the chase freedom pay out for categories that you sign up for each quarter the freedom for example offers  back on quarterly categories for up to  spend or  back each quarter how to compare cashback credit cards heres how to compare cashback credit cards track your spending for  months youll want to see how much you spend on items such as groceries and gas also look at how much you spend at specific stores such as sams club or amazoncom study a mix of cashback cards including discover it cashback match blue cash preferred and chase freedom unlimited each has a specific type of model the cashback match offers quarterly categories as does the chase freedom blue cash preferred offers yearlong rewards for specific categories and the chase freedom unlimited as well as the wells fargo cash wise offers a percentage for all purchases if amazon is a goto for you the cashback match may be a good choice for you if you have a family and spend a lot on groceries the blue cash preferred can be a good option and if you dont want to be pinned down by what you use your card for the cash wise might be the one to choose what are rotating categories cards with rotating categories usually give you a higher percentage back than other cards but only for a quarter categories can be restaurants groceries gas and more in the last year amazoncom and warehouse clubs have increased in popularity you usually have to sign up each quarter but if you dont mind tracking which categories youll use each month you can get as much as  back at the end of your first year one thing there is usually a limit to how much you can spend toward the quarter typically  a quarter after that its  an alternative is the flat rate which gives you the same amount back regardless of the purchase the amount is usually  back so if you get  back on everything it doesnt matter what you are using your card for — groceries clothes shopping whatever if you spend  a month with your card you get  back at the end of your year and there is no maximum spend what are common cashback categories there’s no guarantee and categories change from year to year but here are common cashback categories restaurants the cashback match is generous with this category as is the chase freedom this is a good category for the millennial to target if your evenings center around trying out new restaurants or during the workweek checking out the latest lunch spot amazoncom do a lot of shopping online the cashback match has featured this category giving you  back on amazon shopping for up to  in the selected quarter up to  back   back at the end of your first year wholesale clubs this is an increasingly popular category for cashback cards sometimes as a quarterly category and sometimes in a limited time offer grocery stores groceries are a favorite category for cashback cards in addition during the quarter when grocery stores were featured chase freedom included drugstores if you shop for a family this can be a good category — with the discover it cashback match for example you can spend  a month on groceries and max out the spend giving you back  for that quarter and dont forget the additional  back at the end of your first year transportation some cards give a higher percent for gas such as the blue cash preferred others such as the chase freedom also give  back during specific quarters on parking tolls and amtrak purchases this category is a good choice for the daily commuter or if you do a whole lot of shuttling the kids and the soccer team advantages for cashback credit cards cashback credit cards have a number of advantages including a cashback card gives you well cash back sometimes hundreds of dollars a year if you use it strategically as your card of choice you can enjoy not only statement credits but shopping deals as well depending on the card by using the card for everything from grocery shopping to furniture purchases the cash back can add up just don’t make purchases you don’t have the money to pay back – remember a credit card isn’t designed to be a longterm loan another lesserknown advantage is that cashback cards can be great practice for a travel or rewards card these cards typically have an annual fee which you have to factor in when calculating how much money you need to spend in a year to make the card worth your while also travel cards can require some maneuvering to make it worth your while such as the chase sapphire preferred’s chase ultimate rewards portal the portal is an excellent way to maximize your points but it’s a bit more complicated than just spending and getting your periodic statement credit cashback cards also offer variety in structure if you want something simple and straightforward you can get a flatrate card such as the wells fargo cash wise want to maximize cash back the discover it cashback match is a great choice there are also cards that are a mix of the two – such as the blue cash preferred and the blue cash everyday these cards give you extra cash back for specific categories yearround plus a minimum cash back for everything else disadvantages to cashback credit cards from incurring additional debt to impacted credit there can be disadvantages to cashback credit cards none of which are insurmountable on the plus side you can earn cash back for using your cashback card on the downside you can end up owing more than you can pay off or even harming your credit here are possible disadvantages to cashback cards and what you can do about them annual fee a few cashback cards carry an annual fee while that isnt necessarily a drawback you want to plan out the use of your new card to make sure you will benefit in the long run if it has an annual fee say your card has an annual fee of  and you get  back on groceries for up to  spend a year that means you want to make sure you will spend at least  for the year on your card for groceries assuming you dont buy anything else if you spend  a month on groceries or  for the year that means youll get back  or  after you pay the annual fee bottom line make sure you know if you will earn more cash back than needed to pay the annual fee carrying a balance carrying a balance can be a detriment to cashback cards heres why say you have a  balance on your card but you can only pay the minimum that means if the cards apr is  it will take you  months and you will pay  in interest fees if you spend  a year on your card even if you are paying it off as you go but still are paying the minimum on that  your cash back will be little more than the expense of fees because of that annual fee of  in  years you can earn  back on groceries but the annual fee comes to  so you have spent  on interest fees and  in annual fees meaning that youve spent most of your cash back on fees bottom line dont incur a balance on your cashback card only use the card for expenses you can pay back at the end of the month late payments it can be tempting to use your cashback card with wild abandon because of the benefits earned but never spend more than you can afford and pay in full and on time each month why because if you are late on your account that is reported to the credit bureaus and ultimately it is reflected on your credit score in fact history of ontime payments is the most important aspect of your fico credit rating making up  of your score fico is the scoring model most used by lenders bottom line pay in full and on time each month to maximize your cash back and to build your credit how do you redeem cash rewards you can redeem cash rewards a number of ways depending on the card in most cases you get a statement credit but some issuers allow you to spend your cash back on shopping or gift cards in some cases you can deposit the cash back in a bank account or get a check cut issuers might give a better deal for the statement credit though so check some bank of america cards give you  back when you deposit your credit in a bank of america checking or savings account if you have a preferred account your cash back for deposits increases to  and even up to  what is a statement credit most cashback credit cards give you your cash in whats called a statement credit that means that on your monthly statement youll see a positive balance that you can use toward your monthly bill some issuers also allow you to deposit your cash back into a bank account or even get a check cut however there can be financial incentives to opt for a statement credit some issuers such as bank of america give you incentives to deposit your cash back into a checking or saving account held with that bank others give you the option of using your cash back toward an online shopping portal are there limitations on where i can spend my cashback rewards there can be limitations on where you can spend your cashback rewards because issuers have different rules for how you can get your cash back you usually get your cash through statement credits but some issuers offer you the option to park your cash in a savings or checking account you can get a  bonus when you do this with your bankamericard cash rewards provided its a bank of america account while other issuers allow you to redeem with gift cards such as the barclaycard cashforward some issuers such as discover also have portals where you can shop with your cash back while getting discounts on goods and gift cards are cashback rewards taxable as income cashback rewards are usually not taxable as income they are typically considered a discount by the irs the same is true of rewards points and miles “however there may be times when you need to reduce the amount of a business deduction to reflect the discount that a cash back reward provides you with” says turbotax turbotax gives the example of when you are selfemployed and you purchase a cellphone that you only use for business although your phone is deductible on your taxes turbotax points out that you can only deduct your actual cost so if you get a  rebate for your  phone you really only paid  for the phone and thats how much you can deduct how can i maximize my cashback rewards there are a number of ways you can maximize your cashback rewards it starts with choosing your card make a list of your spending habits for a month write everything then categorize by type of store — grocery stores gas stations wholesale clubs amazoncom restaurants do you see a pattern if you are spending a lot on groceries you might want the blue cash preferred if you spend a fair amount on a mix such as wholesale clubs and amazoncom the cashback match may be a good choice and if your shopping is truly eclectic or you dont want to get strapped to categories youll want to look at a fixedrate card such as the cash wise look at ways to put charges on the card that you make anyway check if you can charge your rent insurance and utilities for example figure out how much you will be spending on your card if this is your goto card just make sure you have it in your budget to pay off the card in full and on time each month dont apply for multiple cards at once that can sabotage your credit pick a card looking at the annual fee and any other benefits such as balance transfer offers also make sure you will earn more than the annual fee some cards such as the freedom cards can be paired with other cards to maximize rewards for example you can pair the freedom products with the chase sapphire preferred allowing you to fully maximize the chase ultimate rewards portal for travel is a cashback card right for me if you’re wondering whether a cashback card is right for you ask yourself these  questions what is your fico score if it is below  on a scale of  don’t bother to apply except in a few cases in some cases a score higher than  is required so do your research check your credit at myficocom if it’s below  take out one of your free credit reports at annualcreditreportcom and check it for accuracy get the credit bureau to correct any inaccuracies and consider getting a creditbuilder card to build your credit within months you’ll see a difference do you have a budget this is a must to ensure you don’t go over on your spending you’ll want to only spend on your card what you already have in the bank credit cards are for credit building convenience and in this case cash back not to be used as a longterm loan do you pay your bills on time if you have any trouble paying your bills on time having a credit card can be problematic that’s because you can face late fees and hurt your credit instead of a card with rewards or cash back which takes a little organization see if you can get a creditbuilder card to practice on are you intrigued by travel and rewards cards but not sure if you have the organizational skills to manage them a cashback cards might be a good choice if you choose a simple flatrate cashback card you can use it and forget it it gives you the opportunity to earn money back while focusing on spending and paying the monthly bill if you want something that gives you a little more in rewards and practice tracking your spending choose one with quarterly categories or category spending limits think a cashback card is right for you our cash back credit card reviews can help take a look and

all posts andor questions are answered  credit cards  interest free credit cards low interest rate or  credit cards can save you hundreds of dollars on balance transfers and on routine purchases carried over as credit card balances or you may simply want to be rewarded with a preferential interest rate as acknowledgement for good credit history and responsible debt management whatever your goals or motivation zero percent or low interest credit cards can help you maintain the lowest rates available to individuals with excellent to good credit you can find out more about credit score here keep in mind that there are two main categories of low rate credit cards namely those that offer a variable apr and those that give you a fixed apr  just like with variable versus fixed rate mortgages a fixed rate apr will remain relatively stable through the course of the loan if your card company decides to raise it – which is somewhat rare – they will first notify you of that change according to federal law requirements with a variable rate your apr is tied to a prevailing rate such as the prime interest rate if the prime rate increases then your apr will most likely follow in a similar fashion generally speaking credit card companies and banks will extend either  or  month offers – within the  to  annual interest rate range that can generate a considerable discount when normal aprs are averaging around  or higher once the introductory promotional period expires the apr on a low interest credit card or interest free credit card may revert to the regular interest rate of course the ideal balance is a credit card that offers a great near term rate followed by an attractive competitively priced low interest rate for the long term the interest rate charged on your credit card is widely regarded as the single most important component of your card that’s because it determines the major cost for you to borrow or roll over balances and pay them off over time instead of all at once or within the same month that you make purchases that’s why getting a zero percent or low interest credit card can be huge financial boon no matter what your credit card usage patterns or money management strategies may be categories top card offers low interest balance transfer cash back rewards travel business no annual fee reviews   comparecards says issuers are

cash back on every purchase welcome to the world of travel cards every day a new credit card seems to launch with travel and cashback cards taking the lead similar in many ways travel cards can be thought of as the “adult” card because the miles or points can be quite valuable and there’s a little more thought to making them work in part because there can be an annual fee to leverage more on that later travel cards offer a twofold bonus first you can use them to maximize the returns on your travel spending saving you hundreds of dollars a year second some offer special access to travel rewards such as free nights in swanky hotels access to exclusive airport lounges and more not only can travel cards benefit those who work around the world or who often travel for pleasure they can reap great rewards for the occasional traveler just think – earn statement credits for a weekend getaway or a quick trip out of town here’s what you need to know to find the best one general rewards rate travel rewards cards offer rewards as a points system where the points have a certain cash value applicable toward travel spending often these cards refer to points as miles they are pretty much the same thing although the values can vary going above  and below  for every point or mile earned when earning you can get up to  for every dollar spent for a specific category such as restaurants or worldwide travel others will offer a flat  milesperdollar ratio on all purchases take stock of how much you spend on average for categories like restaurants gas and yes even airfare to decide which kind of travel card works best for you certain chase cards will increase the rewards rate if you redeem them through their travel purchase portal you can also often redeem for clothing electronics and other goods with many cards’ miles although you may not get as good of a rate of exchange signup bonus besides the general rewards plan you should closely examine the signup bonus when deciding on a travel rewards card you will have to meet a minimum spend requirement in the first few months so know your budget going in to ensure you can meet the goal make sure you have the money to pay it back in full and on time so you don’t incur interest fees otherwise you have defeated the purpose of getting a bonus airlinespecific perks airlinespecific cards can offer unique perks such as free checked bags priority boarding or lounge access if you have a loyalty to a certain airline the right rewards rate combined with these perks may make them a superior deal compared to more general travel cards transfer partnerships some travel cards have partnerships with specific hotel and airline rewards programs sometimes with a  ratio so even if you have a cobranded card you might be able to use your miles on other brands fine print and fees certain offers come with blackout dates in which you can’t apply your miles to reservations for certain flights or nights in a hotel they’re usually reserved for heavily trafficked times such as holidays or days near major events again having a plan comes in handy do you require fussfree redemptions or do you travel enough during offpeak times that blackout dates won’t bother you also pay attention to expiration dates your miles can expire if you don’t use them by a certain deadline others allow you to keep your miles as long as your account is active some cards may require you to book through an airline’s website in order to apply your points to the cost of your flight finally some travel cards will offer a certain reimbursement amount if your trip is delayed they can also have trip insurance lost luggage reimbursement and other benefits be mindful of annual fees you’ll want to make sure you will use the card enough to offset an annual fee also cards specific to a hotel or airline may offset the annual fee cost with certain perks like one free night’s stay or free flight every year you keep your account open many cards waive the fee for the first year want more information below are a variety of frequently asked questions and answers regarding travel rewards and programs you can also read our detailed reviews of travel credit cards once you have narrowed your choices down to a few cards the reviews can help you confirm which offer fits your needs if you’re homing in on a card for a specific airline or hotel we have reviews for those too what is a travel credit card a travel credit card can reward you for travel behavior such as eating at restaurants or staying at hotels some are loyalty cards in which you benefit from using specific hotel or airline brands others such as the barclaycard arrival plus have an openended reward and redemption system that allows you to redeem for all manner of travel expenses travel cards are an excellent way to get reimbursed for vacations make purchases on shopping portals gain access to airport lounges get free baggage checks and more today there is a huge selection of travel cards so it’s important to shop around and pick the one that’s best for your lifestyle what are airline miles airline miles were originally designed for airline loyalty programs in which you got credit in the way of “miles” for your spending on a card today miles cards sometimes are not attached to a specific airline such as discover it miles or a card may have partnerships with a variety of airlines such as the chase sapphire preferred there are also hotel travel cards which will typically refer to the benefits as “points” whether called points or miles these benefits can earn you savings in the hundreds each year by putting miles toward flights or points toward hotel stays you can get a statement credit for vacation expenses and more how do i get a travel credit card when you apply for a travel credit card the card issuer will gather some information including social security number name and address and income fill out the form honestly because you can have the card revoked if you’re caught in a lie income can be money you have access to rather than just your salary so if you and your spouse are employed you can combine the incomes this is helpful if you are an athome parent and the family has just one income many cards will approve or decline you within minutes if you are approved you may be able to shop online with your new account your card will arrive within a few days in the mail how to compare travel credit cards heres how to compare travel credit cards track your spending for  months youll want to see how much you spend on items such as groceries and gas study a mix of travel cards including chase sapphire preferred delta gold from american express and barclaycard arrival plus each has a specific type of model the sapphire preferred offers a vast variety of partnerships with airlines and hotels the delta gold rewards you for spending at a specific brand and the arrival plus is a good choice for general travel compare the signup bonuses and decide if you can afford the required spend also look at the annual fees and compare to the benefits your receive such as free baggage checks miles earned and rental car insurance why do creditors offer travel cards on the surface it doesnt make sense why creditors or credit card issuers offer travel credit cards but it makes sense once you understand the issuer business model heres how it works card issuers charge fees such as late payment fees annual fees balance transfer fees and cash advance fees for example when you transfer a balance to your new card you are usually charged a  fee or  whichever is greater even if the card offers a  intro apr and you pay your balance by the time the offer ends the bank still gets a take card issuers as you probably know benefit from interest fees you pay when you carry a balance past a month these fees are hefty with the average apr running at about  if you make a  purchase and your apr is  a monthly minimum payment will mean that you pay for  months and pay  in interest great for the issuer not so amazing for you thats why its important not to carry a balance or youll wash away the earnings youve made with your travel card card issuers and networks earn a processing fee for each transaction that is typically paid by the merchant called interchange fees they are based on the volume and value of transactions usually the consumer is not impacted by this fee which can be a percentage of the transaction of say about  plus a flat fee of perhaps  per transaction that said you can be charged a “checkout fee” for using your card with all these fees floating around what do you do first off pay in full and on time each month that will keep you from paying late fees and interest fees also keep an emergency fund so you wont be tempted to take out a cash advance finally ask the merchant if you are being charged a checkout fee for using your visa or mastercard if so and its a big purchase you may want to think about shopping elsewhere what are the advantages of a travel credit card travel cards have a number of advantages including the ability to earn statement credits for travel and sometimes luxury benefits such as access to airport lounges if you are loyal to a specific hotel or airline brand you can earn double miles for spending on that brand and even earn stays and other loyalty benefits some cards such as the barclaycard arrival plus allows you to earn x miles on everything then you can earn a statement credit on travel purchases of your choosing this allows you to shop around for the best hotel airline limousine service condo rental car and so on add to that your miles don’t expire although there can be a deadline for redeeming a specific purchase what are the disadvantages of a travel credit card there are a few disavantages to travel cards but nothing that can’t be overcome as you know travel cards can have an annual fee but that doesn’t have to be a disadvantage simply make sure you will spend enough to cover the fee if for example you have a  annual fee and you get x miles on every purchase you’ll need to spend a minimum of  throughout the year to get  miles which is enough to cover the annual fee another challenge and this is true for all credit cards is that you can incur interest fees if you carry over a balance there’s an easy answer though just don’t charge anything you don’t already have the money to cover and pay in full and on time each month how do frequent flyer credit cards work frequent flyer credit cards reward you more for airlinerelated expenses including baggage checks tickets and food and drink the higher end cards might also gain you access to such benefits as brandspecific airport lounges the more you use the card on airline expenses the more you benefit with miles that can be redeemed for flights heads up that frequent flyer miles can expire so read the fine print also there can be blackout dates so before taking out a card make sure it’s a product you’ll use based on your current habits do you only travel for the holidays do you not really have an interest in airport lounges that will impact the card you apply for how do you use your airline miles cards vary widely when it comes to using your airline miles some cards offer a portal that allows you to redeem for qualified packages flights hotels and condos and more such as the barclaycard arrival plus the arrival plus allows you to redeem on any qualifying travel expense through a card portal that tracks how many points you need to redeem an item and how much more time you have to redeem for each item others limit how you use the miles to specific brands for example the american express delta cards’ miles can be specifically used for delta flights and other delta expenses what are bonus miles many travel cards offer a signup bonus in which you spend a certain amount on your card within a certain period of time usually  months or  days in exchange for a onetime bulk of miles or points some cards such as the chase sapphire preferred also give you points for behaviors such as signing up your first authorized user within a certain amount of time you typically have to be a new cardholder while the bonus miles are a great draw for the new cardholder there are a couple of things you want to make sure about before signing up first do you have the cash on hand to pay back the purchases you make to qualify for the bonus you’ll want to be able to pay it back by the due date of that month or you’ll incur interest charges which basically would defeat the purpose of the bonus miles remember a credit card is not designed to be a longterm loan second are you going to use the card enough to make the annual fee worth your while calculate how many miles you need to make up for the fee even if the fee is waived the first year because you want to consider a card to be a financial product for the long haul why because the longer you keep a card and treat it well the better it is for your credit how many miles does it take to get a free flight miles redemptions for a flight vary widely and it depends on the type of ticket you want ie first class and when and where you travel but for example on an oct   delta flight from lax to jfk main cabin it would have run you  miles miles can also be used to upgrade your seat purchase a companion’s ticket or buy refreshments miles often don’t expire read the fine print so it can be worth your while to save up for a big trip just double down on paying for things you would buy anyway to earn those miles sometimes you can pay rent car insurance and utilities with your credit card just make sure there are no fees for those charges how do you use a travel credit card to save money using a travel card to save money only works if you use your card for purchases you plan to make anyway and if you pay your card bill in full and on time each month that way you avoid late fees and interest charges you also want to make sure that your planned spending will put your miles or points above the annual fee so if you have an annual fee of  and the redemption is at  for every mile you want to make sure you plan to earn at least  miles or points in a year ideally you want to focus on your best travel or rewards card and put as many purchases as possible on it so that you earn maximum miles what do you need to consider before getting an airline credit card  things to consider before getting an airline credit card are you going to earn more points or miles than the value of the annual fee this can be a dealbreaker because there is no point is taking out a card that you won’t be using to the fullest extent will you be able to pay off the balance each month and on time again you don’t want to be in a situation where you are paying interest charges each month only put charges on your card that you can pay off by the deadline will you have an opportunity to use the miles or points you don’t have to be a big traveler to take advantage of many cards but you want to make sure this is a card that you will benefit from if it’s a loyalty card will you realistically use it for that brand without cramping your style if you aren’t dedicated to a particular brand of hotel or airline there are a number of great cards that allow you the freedom to use all manner of travel brands how do you strategically use an airline credit card  strategies to maximize airline rewards research thoroughly before choosing your card read the fine print do miles expire and when are there blackout dates can you live with the limitations make it your goto card see if you can pay your rent or utilities with it buy your groceries with it don’t spend just to earn miles only use it to buy what you were going to buy anyway if you can’t pay it off in full each month there’s no point in acquiring it the interest fees will overshadow any miles or points you’ve earned never go over the limit or pay late these are wasted dollars letting points expire are a waste keep track of when points are due to expire and plan ahead to use them so you aren’t wasting them on expensive travel dates also with some programs earning just one point can reset the expiration date stay flexible and try a variety of travel dates when redeeming for example international flights are sometimes cheaper midweek and flying on christmas day can be cheaper than flying on christmas eve sign up for loyalty programs use shopping portals and use travel portals that might earn you additional points such as the chase ultimate rewards portal frequently check for deals make a goal to use points for a trip then do it what do you look for in a travel rewards credit card here are  things to look for in a travel rewards credit card is it flexible enough for your needs there’s no point in taking out a card if you’ll never redeem the miles will you earn more points than the cost of the annual fee this is a deal breaker will you use it without overspending never carry over a charge from month to month are the benefits such as complimentary auto rental insurance or airport lounges items you will use if not there may be a good card for you with a lower annual fee do you want a card with a shopping portal this is a great way to save some money although heads up that the rate of exchange can be lower will you use the loyalty program if there is one for example hotel brands might offer one free night after a certain number are purchased are blackout dates or points expiration rules a deal breaker as always read the fine print how much is a frequent flyer mile worth while a frequent flyer mile is often worth  it can be more or less depending on the program for example according to our valuation system the discover it miles valuation is  for every mile while the chase ultimate rewards portal with the chase sapphire preferred is valued at  that means if you have accumulated  miles with your discover it miles card those miles are worth  if you have the chase sapphire preferred and you want to redeem them in the ultimate rewards portal you will get the equivalent to  when you redeem creditcardscom’s valuation system a reward value is determined by calculating the cost per reward unit point or mile for obtaining a good or service how do you redeem airline miles when redeeming airline miles sometimes it’s as simple as going into a portal after the purchase and clicking a button in other cases such as the american express delta cards you log into your delta account to purchase your tickets before choosing a card make sure you are clear about the steps and decide if you can live with those steps in the same way that you need to make sure that you’ll take full advantage of the card’s benefits and that you’ll maximize the savings you want to ensure that the way that you redeem suits your lifestyle some cards are very easy to use allowing you to redeem for pretty much anything that is travelrelated including limousine service others allow you to maximize your miles with a travel portal that gives you a bonus for redemptions do frequent flyer miles expire frequent flyer miles often expire some such as delta don’t others require your account to remain active although that can be as simple as earning a single mile before the expiration date make sure you read the fine print so you aren’t scrambling to use your milesthe key is to stay organized plan a specific trip for your miles and budget how many miles you need to earn to reach your goal never ever go over what you can afford and mark on your calendar when the miles would expire can you transfer airline miles to hotel points usually you can’t transfer airline miles to hotel points but there are exceptions the question is really should you do it the answer to that is typically no because the transfer ratios are rarely favorable it’s best to choose your card carefully and make sure you will use it well before applying for a card look at your past history do you love and use the brand that the card cobrands with have you used that brand in the past and will you use it in the future how often will you use it if you can see yourself earning enough points or miles to make the card worthwhile go for it can you transfer miles to another person you might be able to transfer miles to another person but it may not be to your advantage financially because you may be charged a fee for the transfer instead book an award seat for someone else by entering their name instead of yours in the portal just keep in mind that in the case of international flights some airlines require to see the card that was used sometimes even the cardholder has to be present at flight time or the ticket isn’t honored can you transfer miles from one airline to another typically you can’t transfer miles directly between airline loyalty programs although you may be able to earn and redeem miles for flights on partner airlines in fact in some cases partnerships offer a  ratio research which airlines your card’s cobrand has partnerships with taking special care to look for airlines that fly out of your city or to destinations you often travel to also research the transfer ratio before applying for a card research several cards because the best deal may not be your favorite brand you may in fact find that a more general card will give you more generous miles earned or that a card includes partnerships with your favorite brand is a travel credit card right for me there are a few factors that will help you decide if a travel card is right for you first do you have strong credit travel cards typically require good or excellent credit so there is no point in applying unless you have at least a  fico score the dominant scoring model that lenders use it has a range of  with  as the best do you have a good handle on your finances to maximize a travel card you need to be able to juggle a couple of balls it’s not difficult but if you are not sure how much money is coming in how much you spend each month and what you are spending it on you may want to hold off on getting a travel card why because to use the travel card successfully you will want to use the card as much as possible but never on something you don’t already have the money for a cashback card such as the chase freedom unlimited may be a better choice for you for now because it offers a straight  cash back and there’s no annual fee finally do you travel at least somewhat you don’t have to be a jetsetter but to take full advantage of the card you’ll want to at least be someone who travels a couple of times a year or on a few weekend trips a year the best way to assess this is to look at your travel habits in the past year study how much you spent and track which airlines and hotels you stayed at with a little effort on the front end a travel card can save you hundreds a year on travel expenses give you free nights or even flights or even grant you access to luxury airport lounges find the right card for you join the discussion we encourage an active and insightful conversation among our users please help

crushing debt they can be a great way to get deeper into a hole as well with a  offer you can pay off debt interestfree for up to  months depending on the card saving you hundreds of dollars in interest fees but its important to have a plan for how youre going to pay off the charges how much can you pay down each month will you be able to pay off the charges before the offer ends otherwise youll just pay interest fees on the charges once the offer ends the trick is to understand the rules of the game before committing to this kind of card from balance transfer fees to goto rates well tell you how to choose a  intro interest card pitfalls to avoid and how to use it going forward what are  apr credit cards some credit cards have  introductory apr offers what does that mean simply that you pay no interest on a card balance for a set amount of time up to  months this is handy when youve incurred debt and you cant get out from under the interest fees or you have a big purchase coming up there are basically two types of offers sometimes in a single card balance transfer — this  intro apr offer encourages you to transfer your balances from older cards to the card with the offer there is usually a balance transfer fee of – or – whichever is greater but it can still be worth your while if you have a larger balance thats because interest rates compound quickly with you owing hundreds of dollars in interest within a few months purchases — you can make a big purchase on your new card and pay interest–free for a set amount of time what does  intro apr mean the term “ intro apr” means that you can pay interest–free for a set amount of time on balance transfers andor purchases the offers length of time varies by card and can be as little as  months and as long as  months for example the discover it offers an intro  apr on purchases for  months and a  apr on balance transfers for  months while the citi diamond preferred offers a  intro apr on both purchases and balance transfers for  months heads up that there is usually a balance transfer fee and if you are late paying the card issuer might kick in the go–to apr but if you pay on time and map out paying the debt before the offer ends you can save hundreds of dollars how to choose a  apr offer when its time to choose a  apr offer a number of issues come into play including length of the offer and balance transfer fees heres what you need to know check the length of the offer check how long the introductory rate sometimes called the “intro rate” or “teaser rate” will last while you may think that the longer the introductory period the better its actually more important to plan how much you can afford to pay each month so that you dont owe money when the offer ends know your “go–to rate” thats the rate after the introductory period while this shouldnt be a dealbreaker because youre going to pay in full each month right its prudent to know all the aspects of the card including the go–to ask about balance transfer fees if you plan to transfer an existing credit card balance to the new card the fees generally run  to  of the balance transferred or  whichever is greater a few cards offer no balance transfer fee such as the chase slate watch your mail card issuers often run special offers when they lower or waive the fees weigh other benefits such as the  cash back offer of the discover it cashback match which also has a –month  intro apr on both purchases and balance transfers sometimes its actually better to have a shorter offer period because the card has benefits youll use after the offer ends what is a go–to apr a go–to apr is the rate that kicks in once the  intro apr offer ends so if the card youve chosen offers an –month  intro apr you have  months to pay for the balance then the go–to rate kicks in your credit rating and your history of payments help decide what your rate will be the better your payment history and the higher your credit rating the lower the go–to rate what is the average interest rate on a credit card the average interest rate on credit cards varies based in part on the federal reserves monthly decision on interest rates currently the national average for credit cards is about  but that can vary based on type of card low interest cards of course have the lowest average at under  business and student cards are also low both under  the highest are instant approval at just over  and bad credit at over  that said you should not be too concerned about a cards interest rate because its best to pay your card bill in full each month its better for your credit because fico the dominant credit scoring model tracks your credit utilization ratio which is the amount of available credit you have compared to the balance that you owe the lower the balance the lower your ratio which fico loves what is a good interest rate on a credit card rather than choose a credit card because it has a “good” interest rate look at the cards features because credit cards are not meant to be long–term loans the national average for credit card interest rates is about  depending on the type of card the interest rate will vary with low interest cards at the bottom and bad credit cards at the top but that shouldnt concern you too much instead look at the  intro rate for balance transfers and purchases when choosing a card then make sure you can pay off the debt before the go–to rate kicks in if you know youre going to go past the intro rate period then make sure you pay on time to improve your credit rating because your credit rating and your on–time payments are two factors for what your go–to rate will be what determines the apr on a credit card the apr on a credit card is determined by a number of factors including the federal reserves current rate your credit rating the type of card you choose and whether you have been paying on time the national average go–to interest rate for credit cards is about  — thats higher or lower depending on the type of card with low interest and student cards at the bottom and bad credit cards at the top when the federal reserve increases its benchmark for rates youll typically see credit cards rates inch up your credit rating and whether you pay on time also factor into your rate credit cards can have a range from which they assign your go–to rate watch out because you can drive your apr up by paying late or going over the limit that can also land you with fines and even loss of the card how do you calculate interest on a credit card the easiest way to calculate interest on a credit card is with our handy–dandy calculators you can figure out how much interest youll owe if you pay the minimum look at how much you need to pay on a balance transfer each month to avoid interest rates or see how long it will take you to pay off your debt that said it helps to understand how credit card issuers calculate interest according to discover just divide your apr say its  by  days or  so if you have a balance of  the daily interest rate is  which accrues each day at the end of the month you owe  that may not seem like much but it can add up quickly if you pay the minimum on  each month  apr it will take you  months and you will pay  in interest better to just pay in full each month and not put anything on your card you cant afford to buy with cash how do you avoid paying interest on a credit card its easy to avoid paying interest on a credit card – just pay in full each month before the due date remember credit cards arent meant to be long–term lenders they should be for building credit and convenience you dont want to use a card for an emergency when you dont have the cash nearby because the interest fees can overwhelm you instead build an emergency fund that you can tap when the unexpected occurs such as a broken–down car or a medical bill in fact it can actually be a good idea to pay more than once a month just to be safe if you pay in full several times a month you can potentially improve your credit even more because you dont know when issuers report to credit bureaus – pay several times a month and increase the chance of having a low balance when issuers report fico the dominant credit scoring model bases your rating on what the credit bureaus gather about your finances heres how it works fico compares how much available credit you have to how much of a balance you have the lower the ratio the better so if you have  available credit and you owe  your credit utilization ratio is only  owe  the ratio jumps to  if you pay several times a month you increase the chance of lowering your ratio which is a critical part of your score how do you use a  apr credit card there are myriad ways to use a  apr credit card from making a big purchase such as an appliance or grill to using it to pay down an existing balance  apr cards can simplify your life there are some things you need to know though the best way to use a  introductory period offer is to calculate how much you can pay each month for how long so if you make a  purchase and can pay  a month a –month offer is enough for you if you plan to use the card for a balance transfer keep in mind that you will probably have a balance transfer fee of – that means you will owe – right out of the gate but that can be worth your while if the interest you would pay otherwise is higher than the fees is using a  apr card a good way to build credit any credit card including a  apr card that is used wisely is a good way to build credit with a new card you are increasing your available credit which can be helpful for your fico rating also each month that you pay on time your credit rating gets a little kick and if you are diligent about paying down your debt that will also improve your credit as the balance goes down provided you dont incur additional debt that said taking out a credit card is only good for your credit if you are responsible with it it is the fastest way to build credit no matter the type of card but it can be a disaster if you let charges pile up or if you dont pay on time each month before committing to a new card make sure you will use it correctly can you use a  apr credit card to help pay off student loans paying off student loans with a  apr credit card can be tricky first you might owe more than you can pay off in the maximum offer of  months which means you would probably be strapped with higher interest rates than you were paying on the student loan also you will probably have a charge of – on the total which is another expense you may not have expected finally it is actually worth your while to hang on to the student loan because its an installment loan fico the dominant scoring model likes a mix of credit types and if you have a credit card and an installment loan that can give your credit score a little boost provided youre paying on time should i cancel my  interest card once i pay off the balance its rare when you should cancel your  interest card once you pay off the balance thats because keeping it on hand is a great way build your credit heres why lets say you paid off  within the  months your  intro interest offer lasted awesome right now youre so sick of credit cards you want to cancel the card and go all cash but not so fast heres the deal the fastest way to build credit is to have a credit card and to pay in full and on time each month fico the dominant scoring model loves it when you do that and you will be rewarded within months of your good habits still hate credit cards and want to pay in cash theres a way to have the best of both worlds keep your card account active by putting a charge on it each month that you would make any way such as your gym membership then pay it off before the due date then use cash envelopes or whatever system you prefer to stay within budget whatever you do dont put the card in your sock drawer because its only a matter of time before the issuer cancels the card because its inactive join the discussion we encourage an active and insightful conversation among our users please help us keep our community civil and respectful for your

youre carrying a balance with the right card you can even reap rewards and benefits after you pay off the transferred balance if you know how these offers work and you know what other perks to look for you can find the best balance transfer card to minimize your interest and maximize your rewards if youre not familiar with balance transfers our balance transfer card reviews will help you discover what the details of each card are and show you what rewards are worth what is the meaning of balance transfer a balance transfer means you transfer the balance from one credit card to a card typically with a lower interest rate lets say you have  on card a with a  apr that means if you pay the minimum amount it will take you  months and you will pay  in interest if you transfer that  to card b with an introductory  apr for  months that means you have  months to pay off the balance without paying interest fees thereby potentially avoiding the cost of  balance transfers are also an option if you want to streamline your payments simply transfer your balances to a single card and make one payment a month what is a balance transfer card a balance transfer card is a credit card that consumers typically use to avoid paying a higher interest fee the balance on card a is transferred to card b which may have a low or  introductory apr credit card companies will sometimes attract new customers with little to no interest for a set period sometimes as long as  months such as the citi simplicity balance transfer cards may also have a  introductory apr for purchases for example the simplicity has an introductory  apr of  months for purchases each credit card specifies which balances will be paid first typically starting with the lowest–rate balances some balance transfer card rules specify that only transferred balances qualify for the lower rate while new purchases collect interest at the regular higher apr what is a balance transfer fee a balance transfer fee is the charge for transferring a balance from one credit card to another the more you transfer the larger the fee a typical fee is – with a minimum of  or  for example if you transfer a  debt from another card you might pay a  fee right away while that expense may seem hefty assess whether you will actually save by transferring to a  introductory apr card to avoid interest fees because you can easily spend thousands on interest fees however make sure you will be able to pay off the debt by the time the introductory offer ends because the new card will likely revert to a go–to apr that can be  or more see if it makes sense for you by using our balance transfer calculator keep in mind that some balance transfer cards dont have balance transfer fees such as the barclaycard ring mastercard what is a balance transfer intro period a balance transfer introductory period refers to a low or  apr offer a credit card issuer provides for a limited period of time as an incentive to become a cardholder a cardholder can pay down debt transferred from another card while not paying interest for the debt for an introductory period of time a balance transfer intro period can last up to  months after the set period the interest rate can increase to a “go–to rate” of  or more you should make sure you evaluate the balance transfer interest rate during the promotional period the length of the promotional period and the balance transfer fee when deciding which balance transfer offer is best for you what is balance transfer intro apr an introductory apr period is the amount of time you have to pay off the amount youve transferred without paying interest a  apr period can last up to  months most balance transfer cards with a few exceptions charge you to move your balance generally this fee is a percent of the balance youre transferring ranging from  to  depending on the card or – whichever is greater since most cards default rate can be higher than the rate you had on your old card paying off your debt within the  period is crucial read the fine print as some cards will void the  deal if you miss a payment how does a balance transfer on a credit card work transferring the balance from one credit card to a card with a lower apr is referred to as a balance transfer it should be noted that transferring isnt the same as repaying when you use a balance transfer card you are transferring the debt from card a to card b then if card b has an introductory offer you can typically have a set amount of time up to  months to pay off the debt without paying any interest fees although there can be a balance transfer fee other reasons to transfer a balance can be to consolidate your debts however avoid closing a credit card account because having available credit helps your credit rating so if you transfer debt from card a now you have a card without any debt which increases your credit utilization ratio the ratio of your available credit to how much you owe the lower the ratio the better that means if you keep card a open your available credit is boosted and your ratio is lower also card as payment history can help your credit just be sure to keep card as account active by charging a small monthly amount and pay it on time and in full each month are credit card balance transfers a good idea transferring a credit card balance can be a good idea if youve incurred card debt and you are paying the minimum monthly amount that can translate to high monthly apr fees that can be avoided if you transfer your debt to a card with a  introductory apr however make sure you have a plan to pay off the debt before the introductory offer ends because balance transfer cards typically have a “go–to” rate that can be  or more once the offer ends another good reason for transferring a card balance is consolidation if you have debt on multiple cards and you want to avoid the hassle of multiple payments taking out a good balance transfer card can be wise however get to the root of the problem why do you have debt on multiple cards if you are using your credit cards to buy items not in your budget the problem may not be the cards it may be your spending habits also taking out a new credit card to transfer a balance can be a bad idea if you are planning to take out an installment loan a car loan or a mortgage in the coming months because lenders look for “hard pulls” or evidence of recent requests for credit if you plan to buy a car or house soon weigh whether any card debt you have could impact your application with whether lenders would be concerned about new cards when in doubt check with your lender before making any financial move do balance transfers help your credit a balance transfer can certainly improve your credit – in the long term a number of aspects of your credit score come into play when you transfer a balance to a new credit card notably your payment history which is your history of on–time payments and your credit utilization which is your available credit compared to your debt to a lesser extent the length of your old cards history and taking out a new card can also impact your credit heres how payment history the most important and most obvious factor in play during a balance transfer is the opportunity to establish a better payment history payment history makes up  of your fico score the scoring model most used by lenders transferring debt from a high interest account to one with a  apr into period can significantly lessen the burden of maintaining a monthly payment schedule you may have to pay a lump sum upfront in the form of a transfer fee but the money you will save on interest can more than make up for it over time if you pay more than the minimum amount and establish a plan to pay off the transferred balance before the introductory period expires you will be debt–free years before you would if you pay the minimum this will both save you money and improve your financial responsibility in the eyes of future creditors credit utilization along with an improved payment history balance transfers can boost your credit by lowering your credit utilization limit–to–balance ratio in fact the second most important part of your fico score is amount owed at  the credit utilization ratio is a measure of the debt you owe in comparison to the credit limit available to you if you keep the old paid–off card that automatically boosts your ratio because you have available credit with no debt however dont incur any additional debt once the new credit line has been established or youll defeat the purpose of building credit and get yourself back in your debt predicament length of credit history some  of your fico score is made up by the length of credit history and thats another great reason to keep your old card so that you continue building your time with an older product new credit some  of your fico score is made up by new credit in your file thats actually a reason to pause before taking out a balance transfer card – a new credit product can ding your rating albeit not by much just be deliberate about your card choice and make sure you dont have plans to take out an installment loan car loan or mortgage in the coming months because lenders will be looking for any new products when they review your file credit mix in use the remaining  of your fico score encourages a mix of credit products such as credit cards and installment loans for this reason dont take out a balance transfer card without a plan but a new balance transfer card can help your credit by allowing you to consolidate and to help you pay down your card debt are balance transfers bad for your credit used incorrectly balance transfers can be bad for your credit used right it can be great for your credit heres what you need to know when you apply for a balance transfer credit card – or any type of credit – it dings your credit as a result your credit score will drop by a few points but if you plan to use the card to get your debt under control that benefit can outweigh the disadvantage of those few lost points which will be recovered within a few short months of good payment habits planning to cut loose of that old card that has been weighing on your credit soul hold up because a paid–off card with good credit payment history is credit gold heres how first the fico scoring model likes it when you have a lot of available credit but not much debt so if you keep the old card youve increased your available credit when you take out the new card and your percentage of debt goes down because of that additional available credit second fico loves credit accounts with a history of on–time payments so its worth your while to hang on to that card youve made the right decision to keep your old card but you plan to lock it up in a sock drawer stop by not using your old card you run the risk of letting the account lapse and that payment history clock stops keep using the card each month but responsibly more on that later although you need to keep using your old card you dont want to incur additional debt because then your credit utilization ratio – remember the debt to available credit percentage – will be too high heres what to do put a small monthly charge you would have anyway such as your gym membership on auto debit but be sure to pay in full each month in some cases making a payment even a single day late can cause the issuer to cancel your  apr period and leave you immediately subject to the high interest rates you sought to escape in the first place also this will affect your payment history so be sure to pay on time or your credit will be surely affected things to consider before applying for a balance transfer card balance transfer credit cards are a great way to improve your credit used correctly used incorrectly these cards can wreak havoc on your credit there are  things to consider before applying for a balance transfer card can i withstand the credit score effects applying for a new card requires a hard inquiry which will temporarily drop your credit score this can be recovered rather quickly and is generally not cause for worry however if you plan to take out an installment loan in the next few months such as a car loan or a mortgage these slight dings impact the interest rates or even whether you can land the loan of your choice if your new card is the only credit you have on the horizon then the drop in points will be temporary and relatively harmless provided you continue to pay on time and keep your debt down what is the available credit limit the credit limit should be sufficient to cover the desired transfer amount without maxing out the new account this way you can take maximum advantage of the lower interest rates and improve your credit utilization ratio simultaneously this ratio looms large for the fico scoring model the model most used by lenders it is the amount of available credit you have compared to the amount of debt you have the lower the percentage of debt the better that means the higher the new cards limit the better because any credit you arent using counterbalances your debt how much is the transfer fee low interest or  intro apr transfer cards usually require a transfer fee that typically ranges between  and  of the balance or – whichever is greater in most cases this fee is minuscule in comparison to the interest charges you would otherwise pay and is therefore a good tradeoff however if the balance is low enough it may not be worth paying the transfer fee in the first place its also worth noting that some card issuers waive the balance transfer fee such as the barclaycard ring mastercard how long is the introductory apr period the appeal of a balance transfer card comes in the form of a low or  intro apr but these rates dont last forever these teaser rates can be for up to  months such as the citi simplicity look at all the cards benefits though because some cards have a shorter intro apr such as the blue cash everyday yet they offer an introductory cashback offer and cash back for such purchases as groceries and gas terms apply think about how youll use your card in the long haul that said make sure you only use such a card for purchases you can afford to pay off and after the balance transfer is paid so that you dont return to the cycle of debt youre trying to escape some cards such as the blue cash everyday have a  intro apr for purchases as well can i stay disciplined throughout the process be true to yourself if not you could only worsen your existing situation if you struggle with making monthly payments on time or dont trust your ability to cease acquiring debt having another card at your disposal is probably not the best option in fact you may have difficulty even getting a new card if you have a history of late payments conversely if you feel you are responsible enough to stick to the plan you have set for yourself a balance transfer can bring you budgetary glory if you think you can keep the old card active without incurring new debt and you can pay down your new card without buying new items a balance transfer card could be right for you how to select the right balance transfer card looking to land a balance transfer credit card heres how to select the right one for you required credit scoreeven rejected applications require a hard inquiry and will ding your credit make sure you are within range of the card issuers required credit for a card that requires good credit you need a fico score of about  on a scale of – the higher the score the more likely youll land the card although other factors also play in such as multiple inquiries and wages if you have your eye on a card that requires excellent credit plan to have a score of at least  possibly more sufficient credit limitthe available credit line should be substantial enough to cover the sum youre looking to transfer ideally you would like to have a credit limit that allows for a full transfer and some breathing room the higher your limit the better not because you can spend it but because you wont if you have air in your limit or available credit that isnt being used that can help boost your credit score balance transfer feemost balance transfer cards have a transfer fee of – or – whichever is greater but some such as the chase slate offer for an introductory period of no transfer fee lengthy introductory periodbalance transfer cards will offer low or  intro apr for up to  months use our handy–dandy payoff calculator to see how much time you need to pay each month and pay off the balance before the introductory offer ends you dont want to get into a situation where you still have a balance when the offer ends so choose wisely reasonable ongoing aprwhile you dont want to have a balance remaining when the introductory offer ends pay attention to the go–to apr rate which is the interest rate your account will revert to once the offer ends ultimately the go–to rate shouldnt matter because you are paying your card bill in full and on time each month right but its good to pay attention to the details just in case annual feeon the surface you want a card without an annual fee right but annual fees are sometimes waived the first year and the benefits of a card such as cash back on a blue cash preferred can make the annual fee worthwhile think in the long term about how you plan to use your new card if you solely want it for the introductory apr offer you dont want an annual fee if you plan to make it your go–to card once the balance is paid off expand your horizons and look at balance transfer cards with bonus signup points or cash back and other perks acceptable terms  conditionsthere are usually conditions that must be adhered to in order to take full advantage of the balance transfer for example an issuer will likely require a transfer to be completed within a specified amount of time to lock in the offered rates in other cases the introductory apr may be nullified if you are late on a single payment and the regular apr could kick in immediately always read the fine print how do you transfer a balance from one credit card to another transferring a balance from one credit card to another is pretty straightforward simply place a call to the new creditors customer service line communicate that you would like to transfer a balance onto your new card and a representative will guide you from there you may also accomplish this online though the exact procedure will vary depending on the bank heads up that you will likely have to pay a balance transfer fee although some cards do not charge one such as barclaycard ring mastercard also make sure you get terms with the new card that will allow you to pay the debt in full by the end of the introductory offer so if you owe  and the offer is  apr for  months that means you need to make sure you can pay  a month for a year that way you dont pay interest rates on the balance how long does it take to transfer a balance from one credit card to another generally a balance transfer can be expected to clear within  days of the request being placed however the exact amount of time it will take varies and is dependent on a number of issues many people report that their balance transfers have been accomplished in under  hours while others have complained of a transfer taking upwards of two weeks to complete unfortunately theres no clear–cut timeline in order to better gauge how long a transfer will take consider the following factors account ageif your account with the receiving creditor has been active prior to the transfer request it will likely complete more quickly than with a newly opened account transfer processif the money can be transferred electronically to the creditor it will often take less time than payment via physical check balance amountlarge balances may take longer to complete whereas balances of less than a specified amount could be fast–tracked in accordance with issuer policy issuercreditorsimply some banks just have a better reputation when it comes to completing balance transfers chase and citi are two that come to mind application methodif possible submit your application online to ensure quality control information relayed over the phone is subject to being misunderstood or incorrectly entered time of requestis it close to the weekend are there any major holidays coming up if so the process might be delayed until normal business resumes can you transfer a balance from one card to another from the same bank typically a bank does not allow a balance transfer between two cards it has issued thats because it doesnt make good business sense for the financial institution after all banks and card issuers operate to make money on the debt you owe and a balance transfer represents a means of saving the cardholder money on that debt that said the structure of a balance transfer exists as a win–win for all parties involved when the debt is being transferred from one creditor to another as it is almost always done this way both parties are satisfied for the following reasons the new creditor takes on an existing debt but more importantly gains a new customer the customer pays a relatively modest transfer fee typically  to  of the balance but saves money in the long run by taking advantage of the  intro apr period and lower interest rates how to properly use a balance transfer card here are tips to properly use a balance transfer card cease applying for new cardsonce you get a balance transfer card dont take out any more cards every time a card issuer checks your credit which is done when you apply for a card that dings your credit rating a cluster of inquiries may paint you as being financially unstable also additional cards only increase the temptation to spend keep existing accounts openthe average age of your accounts is taken into consideration when determining your creditworthiness therefore keeping older established lines of credit active following a transfer only helps your credit rating it will also help you obtain a more admirable credit utilization ratio which is the second most important factor taken into account by lenders the ratio compares the available credit to the amount owed the closer to  the better finally charge a small amount on your old card that you would spend anyway and pay in full and on time each month that keeps your account active and it will actually help build your credit in no time stick to your payment planby now you should have planned out a strategy that will allow you to pay off the full balance before the introductory period runs out this includes budgeting for any necessary fees determining how much you will need to pay each month and identifying all stipulations that must be observed as part of the balance transfer agreement stop incurring additional debtquit adding to the problem after all theres a reason you sought a balance transfer in the first place halting charges on both the old and new accounts will save you from paying on the interest rates you fled and will make it much easier to abide by your payment schedule if the remaining balance isnt in constant fluctuation also when you make new purchases you run the risk of incurring interest fees even while you are trying to pay off your old debt join the discussion we encourage an active and insightful conversation among our users please help us keep our community
