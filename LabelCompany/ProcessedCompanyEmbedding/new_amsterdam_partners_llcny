integrative process want to know more theres an abundance of information on our faq page and you can always reach out via email or by telephone investment philosophy  quantitative analysis  new amsterdam partners investment philosophy  quantitative analysis do the numbers tell a strong story the first step in our process is to quantifywith certain critical modificationsthe research that traditional analysts perform by hand we use our own model to rank a universe of over  stocks according to expected investment return the top ranked stocks are large mid and smallcap companies with betterthanaverage profitability and longterm growth prospects selling at market or belowmarket multiples our model does not consist of one simple screen or a combination of vendorsupplied screens it is a truly proprietary approach to measuring expected investment returns the model is the mathematical definition of expected return rewritten in standard accounting variables it takes into account the relationship between forecast growth and profitability as measured by return on equity on the one hand and valuation ratios on the other the inputs to this model are forecasts developed algorithmically based on our proprietary research this research adjusts consensus numbers to take into account wall street analysts’ overestimation bias and anomalous accounting items such as the frequency and magnitude of one time charges and unusual tax rates the programs that perform these computations were originally written by managing partner  chief investment officer michelle clayman cfa after the model ranks securities from highest to lowest in terms of expected return we use a series of tools to allow us to better focus on the best opportunities these metrics include new amsterdam partners’ estimates eps growth  consensus we have determined through our backtesting that companies where our estimates on forecast growth are higher than the consensus tend to have positive earnings surprises and therefore stock price outperformance favorable zacks scores earnings estimates the zacks indicator measures earnings surprise and upward revision has proved valuable to us in our backtesting high corporate innovation score measures the increase in gross margins that are not attributable to increases in capital or headcount we calculate a score for each company that emerges from the model our backtests indicates that those companies with higher relative scores tend to outperform short interest analysis we make sure that we consider the counterarguement against any name we are considering debt analysis we have always focused on company debt we also make sure we understand the terms and nature of debt   investment process  quantitative analysis  fundamental research
