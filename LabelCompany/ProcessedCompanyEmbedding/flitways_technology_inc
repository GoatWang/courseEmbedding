dollar amounts refer to us dollars unless otherwise indicated corporate background flitways technology inc was founded in  with a mission to provide both corporate enterprises and their employees and global travel resellers and their customers with a complete offering of fully integrated ground transportation solutions for any budget or need we have created a sophisticated software platform to give customers enterprise suite and appbased booking billing expense management and realtime monitoring for a simple to use ground transportation offering we combined that with our proprietary global network of private car limousine taxi and ride sharing service providers this allows our clients to have a solution that mimics the simplicity of workflow for airline and hotel travel removing the manual complex and time consuming nature of traditional ground transportation our offering not only helps our customers but provides car service owners and drivers better utilization of their equity we give travelers an array of classes of cars pickup options and payment options all fully integrated to corporate expense and travel management systems flitways objective is to take an antiquated market and bring it into line with the advanced and seamless methodology of the other key components of the travel experience merger transaction             on october   closing date flitways completed a reverse recapitalization of cataca resources inc cataca a nevada corporation at the time of the reverse recapitalization cataca was considered a shell corporation with no revenues or significant assets in connection with the merger transaction cataca issued  shares of its common stock in exchange for  of the issued and outstanding shares of flitways             for financial reporting purposes flitways has been treated as the acquirer in the reverse recapitalization completed on the closing date accordingly the assets and liabilities of flitways are reported at their historical cost and the assets and liabilities of cataca were recorded at their historical cost basis the consolidated financial statements reported herein have been retroactively restated for all periods presented to report the historical financial position results of operations and cash flows of flitways the  shares of common stock retained by the cataca shareholders were reported as issued on the closing date our business flitways offers feeforservice prebooking of ground transportation  we immediately confirm car services at the time of travel planning on a similar basis to flight and hotel arrangements  the current market for ground travel is booked billed and expensed outside the integrated corporate platforms used for the other two key legs of travel costs  corporate ground travel in the us is a multibillion dollar  market and typically requires separate booking via phone or in some cases online but has necessitated manual expense review without automatic adherence to  corporate standards and restrictions  this subsequently creates a need for timeconsuming and costly administrative resources to match ground transportation with otherwise systemintegrated air and lodging   reporting  flitways’ proprietary software services supply chain and customer relationship management solution can provide clients with cost savings workflow improvements superior traveler experiences and corporate compliant permitted uses we are differentiated from taxi and ride sharing services in many ways  our software backend solution and unique network of providers has been designed to offer a suite of enterprise level technology accounting payment reporting and management tools that are not available in the market  flitways has spent more than four years developing these interfaces for clients to completely integrate travel and expense management tools with ground transportation we consider flitways a onestop shop for all enterprise  ground transportation needs  as we expand our fully vetted and reviewed supply of car services and drivers both in the us and globally we can support our client relationships both because of the stability and flexibility of our software platform and the financial and operating leverage we provide from our simple appbased booking and planning service with over  vehicles to choose from and with service in over  cities the possibilities are endless and our customers can create a seamless travel experience our contact address is  corporate pointe suite  culver city california  our telephone number is  our website is wwwflitwayscom unless otherwise indicated all references in this annual report to dollars or  refer to us dollars corporate solutionscompetitive advantage flitways intends to fill a void in the scheduling and management of global ground transportation services  we built our client interface with corporate travel needs in mind  businesses that allow employees to use consumer facing services like uber lyft and independent taxi and limousine companies are potentially sacrificing the per user cost and administrative savings that flitways provides today our corporate clientele includes major brands like carlson wagonlit amazon pokemon paypal and cartrawler travel management  travel agencies flitways empowers travel management companies and agencies to combine their bookings with a contemporaneous ground transportation offering on the same ticket for their clients  just as in our enterprise service we provide prearranged rides scheduled while flight or lodging confirmations are made  we have developed an applicationbased handoff to allow these travel resellers to electronically book directly on our network  this is an attractive market for flitways as we incur no marketing expenses to add this large customer segment  in exchange we offer a  discount from our published fares to our travel reseller partners booking rides with flitways booking rides airport shuttles andor executive cars with our websiteapplication requires the customer to be a registered user when booking with flitways the customer is able to select a choice of vehicle and preferred gratuity based on their personal preference the estimate travel fare provided is built on the most resourceful travel route and on decent traffic situations the ultimate fare may differ due to traffic situations the route taken wait time parking and return trip once the customers booking has been completed and confirmed the company that owns the vehicle chosen is automatically notified that the vehicle is booked the notification of the booking confirmation is also sent to the customer via sms and email confirmation message together with the details of the customers journey customers can view their past bookings in their flitways account which can be easily used for business travel expense reports payment we accept corporate invoices and credit card payments for ride booking from our customers our platform allows our customers to pay securely and also eliminate the hassle of negotiating fare price with the ride driver all payment information processed on our site is encrypted and secured with stateoftheart ssl before they are transferred customer accounts currently flitways charges no fee for its services and records revenues on the profit margin of billed fares versus cost of fares  customers establish accounts prior to booking either based on invoice or credit card payments  we require an account in order to collect basic information ie name mobile phone number and email and to process all bookings marketing strategy most of our customers have been acquired through various partnerships with travel vendors which give us the opportunity to minimize marketing costs and to focus on establishing new partnerships daily in the future we intend to promote flitways using businesstobusiness marketing concepts to increase and expand brand awareness and general corporate exposure

acquisitions drive the level of capital required and the level of our financial obligations             if we are unable to generate cash flow from operations and successfully raise sufficient

on the closing date basis of presentation             the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared assuming that the company will continue as a going concern the company has experienced recurring losses since its inception the company incurred a net loss of approximately  for the year ended december   and had an accumulated deficit of approximately  as of december   since inception the company has financed its activities principally through loans from its majority shareholder and equity financing management expects to incur additional losses and cash outflows in the foreseeable future in connection with development of its operating activities f             these conditions raise substantial doubt about the companys ability to continue as a going concern the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which contemplate continuation of the company as a going concern the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classification of liabilities that could result from the outcome of this uncertainty the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the company be unable to continue as a going concern             the company is subject to a number of risks similar to those of other similar stage companies including dependence on key individuals successful development marketing and branding of products uncertainty of technology development and generation of revenues dependence on outside sources of financing risks associated with research development dependence on thirdparty contractors for ride services protection of intellectual property and competition with larger bettercapitalized companies ultimately the attainment of profitable operations is dependent on future events including obtaining adequate financing to fulfil its development activities and generating a level of revenues adequate to support the companys cost structure to support the companys financial performance the companys majority shareholder has executed a line of credit to provide funding to the company of not more than              there can be no assurance however that such financing will be available in sufficient amounts when and if needed on acceptable terms or at all if results of operations for  do not meet managements expectations or additional capital is not available management believes it has the ability to reduce certain expenditures the precise amount and timing of the funding needs cannot be determined accurately at this time and will depend on a number of factors including the market demand for the companys services the quality of technology development efforts management of working capital and continuation of normal payment terms and conditions for purchase of services the company is uncertain whether its cash balances and cash flow from operations will be sufficient to fund its operations for the next twelve months if the company is unable to substantially increase revenues reduce expenditures or otherwise generate cash flows for operations then the company will need to raise additional funding to continue as a going concern through its major shareholders or through other avenues reclassification              certain amounts presented in the december   consolidated balance consolidated statement of operations and consolidated cash flows have been reclassified to correspond to the presentation in the  financial statements financial statement presentation             the preparation of the consolidated financial statements in conformity with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts and related disclosures use of estimates              the preparation of the accompanying financial statements in conformity with gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amount of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates f cash and cash equivalents               the company considers all unrestricted cash shortterm deposits and other investments with original maturities of no more than ninety days when acquired to be cash and cash equivalents for the purposes of the statement of cash flows as of december   and  the company did not have any cash equivalents concentration of credit risk               financial instruments that potentially subject the company to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and accounts receivable the company maintains cash balances at financial institutions within the united states which are insured by the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic up to limits of approximately  the company has not experienced any losses with regard to its bank accounts and believes it is not exposed to any risk of loss on its cash bank accounts accounts receivable               accounts receivable are comprised of credit card settlements and receivables from travel partners and are stated at cost less an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts the allowance is calculated based upon the level of past due accounts and the relationship with and financial status of the companys customers account balances are written off against the allowance when it is determined that it is probable that the receivable will not be recovered as of december   and  no allowance for bad debt was considered necessary property and equipment               property and equipment are carried at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization and includes expenditures that substantially increase the useful lives of existing property and equipment maintenance repairs and minor renovations are expensed as incurred upon sale or retirement of property and equipment the cost and related accumulated depreciation are eliminated from the respective accounts and the resulting gain or loss is included in the results of operations the company provides for depreciation of property and equipment using the straightline method over the estimated useful lives or the term of the lease as appropriate software and computer equipment are depreciated over a period of three years commitments and contingencies              in the normal course of business the company is subject to loss contingencies such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business that cover a wide range of matters including among others government investigations environment liability and tax matters an accrual for a loss contingency is recognized when it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated fair value measurements               the accounting standards regarding fair value of financial instruments and related fair value measurements define fair value establish a threelevel valuation hierarchy for disclosures of fair value measurement and enhance disclosure requirements for fair value measures             asc topic  establishes a valuation hierarchy for disclosure of the inputs to valuation used to measure fair value this hierarchy prioritizes the inputs into three broad levels as follows             level   inputs are quoted prices unadjusted in active markets for identical assets or liabilities f             level   inputs are quoted prices for similar assets and liabilities in active markets or inputs that are observable for the asset or liability either directly or indirectly through market corroboration for substantially the full term of the financial instrument             level   inputs are unobservable inputs based on our own assumptions used to measure assets and liabilities at fair value              on a recurring basis               a financial asset or liabilitys classification within the hierarchy is determined based on the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement the companys assessment of the significance of a particular input to the fair value measurement in its entirety requires management to make judgments and consider factors specific to the asset or liability             as of december   and  the company had no financial assets and liabilities carried at fair value             due to their shortterm nature the carrying values of cash and equivalents accounts receivable accounts payable and accrued expenses approximate fair value based on borrowing rates currently available to the company for loans with similar terms the carrying value of the notes payable approximates fair value accounting for stockbased compensation               sharebased compensation cost is measured at grant date based on the fair value of the award and is recognized as expense over the employees service period the company recognizes compensation expense on a straightline basis over the requisite service period of the award             equity instruments issued to nonemployees are recorded at their fair value on the measurement date and are subject to periodic adjustment as the underlying equity instruments vest             we determined that the blackscholes option pricing model is the most appropriate method for determining the estimated fair value for stock options or warrants the blackscholes model requires the use of highly subjective and complex assumptions that determine the fair value of sharebased awards including the equity instruments expected term and the price volatility of the underlying stock segment information               operating segments are defined as components of an enterprise about which separate financial information is available that is evaluated regularly by the chief operating decision maker or decisionmaking group in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance the companys chief operating decision maker is its senior management team the company has one operating segment that is dedicated to the on demand transportation business providing businesses and private travelers access to book and schedule ground transportation online or by mobile device revenue recognition               revenues are generally recognized when an agreement exists and price is determinable the service has been rendered net of discounts returns and allowance and collectability is reasonably assured these conditions are typically met when the trip has been completed the company utilizes third parties as transportation providers for customers the company acting as principal as the company is the primary obligor in the arrangement with its customers has latitude in establishing pricing the company customizes the services required to the particular customer needs has discretion in selection of transportation providers and assumes all credit risk in its transactions f cost of sales               cost of sales includes cost of the various transportation providers and merchant fees related to each transaction income taxes               the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach of accounting for income taxes under this approach deferred taxes represent the future tax consequences expected to occur when the reported amounts of assets and liabilities are recovered or paid the provision for income taxes represents income taxes paid or payable for the current year plus the change in deferred taxes during the year deferred taxes result from differences between the financial and tax basis of the companys assets and liabilities and are adjusted for changes in tax rates and tax laws when changes are enacted a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized             we must assess the likelihood that the companys deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent the company believes that recovery is not likely we establish a valuation allowance management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets we recorded a full valuation allowance as of december   and  based on the available evidence the company believes it is more likely than not that it will not be able to utilize its deferred tax assets in the future we intend to maintain valuation allowances until sufficient evidence exists to support the reversal of such valuation allowances we make estimates and judgments about its future taxable income that are based on assumptions that are consistent with our plans should the actual amounts differ from our estimates the carrying value of our deferred tax assets could be materially impacted             we recognize in the financial statements the impact of a tax position if that position is more likely than not of being sustained on audit based on the technical merits of the position the companys policy is to recognize interest and penalties accrued on any unrecognized tax benefits as a component of operating expense we do not believe there are any tax positions for which it is reasonably possible that the total amounts of unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or decrease within twelve months of the reporting date there were no penalties or interest liabilities accrued as of fiscal year end december   or  nor were any penalties or interest costs included in expense for the years ended december   and              the years under which we conducted our evaluation coincided with the tax years currently still subject to examination by major federal and state tax jurisdictions those being  through  for federal purposes and  through  for state purposes advertising costs               the company expenses advertising costs when incurred advertising costs incurred amounted to  and  for the years ended december   and  respectively comprehensive income loss               comprehensive income loss represents the change in shareholders equity deficit of an enterprise other than those resulting from shareholder transactions accordingly comprehensive income loss may include certain changes in shareholders equity deficit that are excluded from net income loss for the years ended december   and  the companys comprehensive loss is the same as its net loss f basic and diluted net loss per common share               basic net loss per common share is computed by dividing net loss by the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the period diluted net loss per common share is determined using the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding during the period adjusted for the dilutive effect of common stock equivalents in periods when losses are reported the weightedaverage number of common shares outstanding excludes common stock equivalents because their inclusion would be antidilutive significant recent accounting pronouncements             in january  the fasb issued accounting standards update no  clarifying the

to management including the chief executive officer covered by this report we carried out an evaluation under the supervision and with the participation of our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the effectiveness of the design and operation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of december   the evaluation date based upon the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures as of the evaluation date the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that our disclosure controls and procedures were not effective because of the identification of a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting which is identified below which we view as an integral part of our disclosure controls and procedures managements report on internal control over financial reporting our management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal control over financial reporting as such term is defined in exchange rule af our internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance to our management and board of directors regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of the financial statements for external purposes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america our internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that i pertain to the maintenance of records that in reasonable detail accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of our assets ii provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and our receipts and expenditures of are being made only in accordance with authorizations of our management and directors and iii provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition use or disposition of our assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements because of its inherent limitations internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements all internal control systems no matter how well designed have inherent limitations including the possibility of human error and the circumvention of overriding controls accordingly even effective internal control over financial reporting can provide only reasonable assurance with respect to financial statement preparation also projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate our management assessed the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   in making this assessment it used the criteria set forth by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission coso in internal controlintegrated framework based on its evaluation our management concluded that there are material weaknesses in our internal control over financial reporting and management has concluded that the companys internal controls over financial reporting are not effective as of december   a material weakness is a deficiency or a combination of control deficiencies in internal control over financial reporting such that there is a reasonable possibility that a material misstatement of our annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected on a timely basis the material weaknesses relate to inadequate internal controls over financial reporting and the lack of segregation of duties in our financial reporting process we do not have a separately designated audit committee these weaknesses are due to our lack of excess working capital required to hire additional resources to remedy these material weaknesses we intend to engage an internal accountant to assist with financial reporting as soon as our finances will allow rose snyder  jacobs llp our registered independent public accounting firm was not required to and has not issued a report concerning the effectiveness of our internal control over financial reporting as of december   changes in internal control over financial reporting there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting during the fourth quarter of our fiscal year ended december   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting limitations on the effectiveness of controls our management including our chief executive officer and chief financial officer does not expect that our disclosure controls and internal controls will prevent all errors and all fraud a control system no matter how well conceived and operated can provide only reasonable not absolute assurance that the objectives of the control system are met further the design of a control system must reflect the fact that there are resource constraints and the benefits of controls must be considered relative to their costs because of the inherent limitations in all control systems no evaluation of controls can provide absolute assurance that all control issues and instances of fraud if any within the company have been detected these inherent limitations include the realities that judgments in decisionmaking can be faulty and that breakdowns can occur because of a simple error or mistake additionally controls can be circumvented by the individual acts of some persons by collusion of two or more people or by management or board override of the control the design of any system of controls also is based in part upon certain assumptions about the likelihood of future events and there can be no assurance that any design will succeed in achieving its stated goals under all potential future conditions over time controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate because of the inherent limitations in a costeffective control system misstatements due to error or fraud may occur and not be detected item b other information none part iii item
