enviropack technologies inc changed its name to enviromart industries inc sale of operating business on february   the rushcap group inc rushcap an affiliate of mark shefts then a significant shareholder notified us that effective march   it was discontinuing its funding of our wholly owned subsidiary under the inventory financing agreement dated june   rushcap reserved the right to discontinue the funding prior to march   if it so determined the discontinuation of funding was expected to have a material adverse effect on our business financial condition and results of operation as we did not believe that we would be able to timely secure funding to replace the discontinued inventory financing in light of the discontinuation of funding our board of directors spent approximately one month assessing the operating companys current business and funding prospects including whether to transfer the operating subsidiary to michael r rosa our founder and a significant shareholder in accordance with that certain agreement between the company mr rosa and mr shefts dated july   breakup agreement the breakup agreement was disclosed in the companys current report on form k filed july   which is incorporated herein by this reference our board of directors concluded that the discontinuation of funding would have a material adverse effect on our business financial

sale of our sole operating subsidiary enviromart industries inc to michael r rosa our founder and a significant shareholder as contemplated by that certain agreement between us mr rosa and mark shefts dated july   breakup agreement the breakup agreement was originally disclosed in our current report on form k filed july   which is incorporated herein by this reference on march   we entered into a

all of the companys liabilities existing as the closing date of which there were expected to be none as all of the companys operations have been conducted through enviromart industries inc its sole operating subsidiary the above described purchase and sale transaction closed on july   effective april   and was approved by a majority of the companys shareholders by written consent on may   upon consummation of the purchase and sale transaction the companys operating business has been discontinued and it will focus on seeking to acquire a profitable operating business with strong growth potential upon the closing of the purchase and sale transaction mr george adyns resigned from our board of directors and all offices held by him all of the disclosures in this quarterly report on form q must be viewed in light of the disposition of our sole operating subsidiary as our operating business has been discontinued and the value of our company is now dependent upon our ability to locate and consummate the acquisition of a profitable operating business with strong growth potential results of operations for the six months ended june   we had a net income of  as compared to a net loss of  for the six months ended june   the decrease in loss was due primarily to the  gain on discontinued operations this gain will not recur in subsequent periods unless and until the company completes the acquisition of an operating business the companys expenses are expected to consist of the legal accounting and administrative costs of maintaining a public company recent developments none critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates the securities and exchange commission sec issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of managements most difficult subjective or complex judgments often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods our significant accounting policies are described below we anticipate that the following accounting policies will require the application of our most difficult subjective or complex judgments accounts receivable in the normal course of business the company extends credit to customers that satisfy defined credit criteria accounts receivable is recorded at carrying value which approximates fair value and is presented in the companys unaudited consolidated balance sheets net of any allowance for doubtful accounts as of june   and december   an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively has been recorded inventory the companys inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value with cost primarily determined on a weightedaverage cost basis on the firstin firstout fifo method the company continuously evaluates the composition of its inventory assessing slowturning product estimated realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of our individual products the impact of market trends and economic conditions and a forecast of future demand giving consideration to the value of current orders inhouse relating to the future sales of inventory estimates may differ from actual results due to quantity quality and mix of products in inventory customer demand and market conditions the companys historical estimates of these costs and any provisions have not differed materially from actual results any reserves for inventory shrinkage representing the risk of physical loss of inventory are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts as of june   and december   an inventory reserve of  and  respectively has been recorded concentration of risk financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash our cash balances are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located in the united states the company occasionally maintains amounts on deposit with a financial institution that are in excess of the federally insured limits the risk is managed by maintaining all deposits in high quality financial institutions machinery and equipment equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is calculated using the straightline method based upon the estimated useful life of depreciable assets which is three years for machinery and equipment longlived assets machinery and equipment along with other longlived assets are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be recoverable or are less than their fair value in evaluating longlived assets for recoverability the company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value considering external market participant assumptions assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell income taxes income taxes are provided in accordance with fasb asc  accounting for income taxes a deferred tax asset or liability is recorded for all temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and net operating loss carry forwards deferred tax expense benefit results from the net change during the year of deferred tax assets and liabilities deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management it is more likely than not that some portion of all of the deferred tax assets will be realized deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted for the effects of changes in tax laws and rates on the date of enactment as of june   all deferred tax assets continue to be fully reserved revenue recognition revenue is recognized across all segments of the business when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred price has been fixed or is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenue is recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers sales reserves and uncollectible accounts a significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and net income is estimating sales reserves which represent that portion of gross revenues not expected to be realized in particular wholesale revenue is reduced by estimates of returns discounts markdowns and operational chargebacks in determining estimates of returns discounts markdowns and operational chargebacks management analyzes current economic and market conditions we review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis as of june   a sales reserve had not been deemed necessary and therefore not recorded liquidity and capital resources currently we have no cash as discussed elsewhere in this report we have issued stock in exchange for office space and all other services needed to maintain public company with respect to calendar year  as disclosed elsewhere in the report on march   we entered into a stock purchase and sale agreement with michael r rosa and enviromart industries inc our sole operating subsidiary pursuant to which we transferred to mr rosa all the issued and outstanding capital stock of enviromart industries inc in consideration for the transfer of the operating subsidiary to mr rosa he surrendered to us all  shares of the

as a result of the closing of the purchase and sale transaction the companys operating business has been discontinued and is focusing on seeking to acquire a profitable operating business with strong growth potential the value of our company is now dependent upon our ability to locate and consummate the acquisition of a profitable operating business with strong growth potential as of the date of filing of this report we have no cash however prior to completing an acquisition our expenses will consist primarily of compliance costs associated with being a public company and we expect these compliance costs to be substantially less than they have been historically at least until we complete an acquisition transaction also as noted above we have issued stock in exchange for office space and all other services needed to maintain public company with respect to calendar year  if we need to raise additional funds we intend to do so through equity andor debt financing offbalance sheet

inc notes to consolidated financial statements   note  organization and description of business   the enviromart companies inc and subsidiary the “company” formerly known as environmental science and technologies inc was incorporated under the laws of the state of delaware on june   on june   the company completed an acquisition of intangible assets comprised of intellectual property and trademarks from its former chief executive officer in conjunction with the acquisition of the intangible assets the company commenced operations   as of january   the company’s business was operated through its whollyowned subsidiary enviropack technologies inc effective on or about january   the company changed its name to the enviromart companies and the company’s whollyowned subsidiary enviropack technologies inc changed its name to enviromart industries inc the company’s other wholly owned subsidiaries are currently inactive   on february   the rushcap group inc “rushcap” an affiliate of mark shefts then a significant shareholder notified us that effective march   it was discontinuing its funding of our wholly owned subsidiary under the inventory financing agreement dated june     on march   the company entered into a stock purchase and sale agreement with michael r rosa founder and a significant shareholder and enviromart industries inc its sole operating subsidiary pursuant to which the company agreed to transfer to mr rosa all the issued and outstanding capital stock of enviromart industries inc   in consideration for the transfer of the operating subsidiary to mr rosa he surrendered to us all  shares of the company’s common stock then owned by him which shares were returned to the status of authorized and unissued shares in addition mr rosa and enviromart industries inc agreed to assume and discharge any and all of the company’s liabilities existing as the closing date of which there was none as all of the company’s operations have been conducted through enviromart industries inc its sole operating subsidiary   the above described purchase and sale transaction closed on july   effective april   and was approved by a majority of the company’s shareholders by written consent on may   as a result of the completion of the purchase and sale transaction the company’s operating business has been discontinued and it is focusing on seeking to acquire an operating business with strong growth potential   accordingly the company now has only minimal assets and liabilities its operations are focused on seeking to acquire an operating business with strong growth potential from and after the sale unless and until the company completes an acquisition its expenses are expected to consist solely of legal accounting and compliance costs including those related to complying with reporting obligations under the securities and exchange act of    note  basis of presentation   basis of presentation   the accompanying unaudited consolidated financial statements of the company have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america “us gaap” and the rules of the securities and exchange commission “sec” in the opinion of management all adjustments consisting of normal recurring adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of financial position and the results of operations for the interim periods presented have been reflected herein the results of operations for interim periods are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the full year   these financial statements should be read in conjunction with the december   audited financial statements filed with the sec on april            note  going concern   during the nine months ended september   although the company has generated a gain from the sale of its discontinued operations thus far it has been unable to generate cash flows sufficient to support its operations and has been dependent on debt and equity financing in addition to negative cash flow from operations the company has experienced recurring net losses and has an accumulated deficit of  as of september   these factors raise substantial doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary if the company is unable to continue as a going concern   in order to ameliorate this liquidity deficiency on july   the company transferred to michael r rosa all the issued and outstanding capital stock of enviromart industries inc its sole operating subsidiary see note  organization and description of business   note  summary of significant accounting policies   use of estimates and assumptions   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the unaudited consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   principles of consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the company and its whollyowned subsidiary enviromart industries inc fka enviropack technologies inc which was consolidated through march   and the results of its operations are shown as discontinued operations all intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation   cash and cash equivalents   the company considers all highly liquid debt instruments with original maturities of three months or less when acquired to be cash equivalents   accounts receivable   in the normal course of business the company extended credit to customers that satisfy defined credit criteria accounts receivable is recorded at carrying value which approximates fair value and is presented in the companys unaudited consolidated balance sheets net of any allowance for doubtful accounts as of september   and december   an allowance for doubtful accounts of  and  respectively had been recorded   inventory   the company’s inventory is stated at the lower of cost or estimated realizable value with cost primarily determined on a weightedaverage cost basis on the firstin firstout “fifo” method the company continuously evaluates the composition of its inventory assessing slowturning product estimated realizable value of inventory is determined based on an analysis of historical sales trends of our individual products the impact of market trends and economic conditions and a forecast of future demand giving consideration to the value of current orders inhouse relating to the future sales of inventory estimates may differ from actual results due to quantity quality and mix of products in inventory customer demand and market conditions the company’s historical estimates of these costs and any provisions have not differed materially from actual results any reserves for inventory shrinkage representing the risk of physical loss of inventory are adjusted based upon physical inventory counts as of september   and december   an inventory reserve of  and  respectively had been recorded   concentration of risk   financial instruments which potentially subject us to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of cash our cash balances are maintained in accounts held by major banks and financial institutions located in the united states the company has in the past occasionally maintained amounts on deposit with a financial institution that are in excess of the federally insured limits the risk is managed by maintaining all deposits in high quality financial institutions        for the nine months ended september   there were no individually significant customers   machinery and equipment   equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation depreciation is calculated using the straightline method based upon the estimated useful life of depreciable assets which is three years for machinery and equipment   longlived assets   machinery and equipment along with other longlived assets are evaluated for impairment periodically whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their related carrying values may not be recoverable or are less than their fair value in evaluating longlived assets for recoverability the company uses its best estimate of future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition to the extent that estimated future undiscounted net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the carrying value an impairment loss is recognized equal to the difference between the carrying value of such asset and its fair value considering external market participant assumptions assets to be disposed of and for which there is a committed plan of disposal are reported at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell   income taxes   deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amounts expected to be realized as of september   all deferred tax assets continue to be fully reserved   basic earnings loss per share   basic earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding and dilutive common stock equivalents basic earnings per share is computed by dividing net incomeloss available to common stockholders numerator by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding denominator during the period weighted average number of shares used to calculate basic and diluted loss per share is considered the same as the effect of dilutive shares is antidilutive for all periods presented as of september   and  there were  common stock equivalents not included in dilutive earnings per share as their effect is antidilutive   revenue recognition   revenue is recognized across all segments of the business when there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement delivery has occurred price has been fixed or is determinable and collectability is reasonably assured revenue is recognized at the time title passes and risk of loss is transferred to customers   sales reserves and uncollectible accounts   a significant area of judgment affecting reported revenue and net income is estimating sales reserves which represent that portion of gross revenues not expected to be realized in particular revenue is reduced by estimates of returns discounts markdowns and operational chargebacks in determining estimates of returns discounts markdowns and operational chargebacks management analyzes current economic and market conditions we review and refine these estimates on a quarterly basis as of september   a sales reserve had not been deemed necessary and therefore not recorded   cost of goods sold and selling expenses   cost of goods sold includes the expenses incurred to acquire and produce inventory for sale including product costs freightin and any import costs as well as changes in reserves for shrinkage and inventory realizability any costs of selling merchandise including those associated with preparing the merchandise for sale such as picking packing warehousing and order charges “handling costs” are included in general and administrative fees        stockbased compensation   the company expenses all stockbased payments to employees and nonemployee directors based on the grant date fair value of the awards over the requisite service period adjusted for estimated forfeitures   convertible notes   the company records a discount to convertible notes for the intrinsic value of conversion options embedded in debt instruments as appropriate debt discounts under these arrangements are amortized to noncash interest expense using the effective interest rate method over the term of the related debt to their date of maturity   if a security or instrument becomes convertible only upon the occurrence of a future event outside the control of the company or is convertible from inception but contains conversion terms that change upon the occurrence of a future event then any contingent beneficial conversion feature is measured and recognized when the triggering event occurs and contingency has been resolved   recently issued financial accounting standards   management believes the impact of recently issued standards and updates which are not yet effective will not have a material impact on the company’s financial position results of operations or cash flows upon adoption   note  related party transactions   the company’s whollyowned subsidiary rented its facility on a month to month basis from michael r rosa who was then a significant shareholder of the company the facility consisted of
