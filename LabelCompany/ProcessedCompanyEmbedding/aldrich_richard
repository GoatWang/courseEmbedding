abstraction drawn or printed text collage sculptural effects and humorous figuration the work of richard aldrich born  constitutes an index of possibilities in painting aldrich frequently integrates objects such as canvas scraps or book pages in his works citing rather than deploying the idea of a picture plane and also loads his works with literary and personal references for his first solo museum exhibition at the contemporary art museum st louis aldrich presents  largescale works alongside paintings by edouard vuillard pierre bonnard and the irish portraitist sir william orpen selected from the museums permanent collection these three nineteenthcentury artists have very little in common with aldrich and yet are ideally counterpointed against his paintings refocusing the works of all

century are fascinating  the general belgrano where sigint had picked up a command for it to proceed to task force and sink british ships and its zig zag course meant that it was true when the argentinians said it was outside exclusion zone and sailing away from falkland islands at the time it was hit there was no other real decision for the british commanders to takeas someone who lives in

the british secret service government communication headquarters gchq gchq is the successor to the famous bletchley park wartime codebreaking organisation and is the largest and most secretive intelligence organisation in the country during the war it commanded more staff than mi and mi combined and has produced a number of intelligence triumphs as well as some notable failures since the end of the cold war it has played a pivotal role in shaping britain s secret state still we know almost nothing about it in this groundbreaking new book richard aldrich traces gchq s evolvement from a wartime codebreaking operation based in the bedfordshire countryside staffed by eccentric crossword puzzlers to one of the world leading espionage organisationsit is packed full of dramatic spy stories that shed fresh light on britain s role in the cold war  from the secret tunnels dug beneath vienna and berlin to tap soviet phone lines and daring submarine missions to gather intelligence from the soviet fleet to the notorious case of geoffrey pine one of the most damaging moles ever recruited by the soviets inside british intelligence the book reveals for the first time how gchq operators based in cheltenham affected the outcome of military confrontations in farflung locations such as indonesia and malaya and exposes the shocking case of three gchq workers who were killed in an infamous shootout with terrorists while working undercover in turkey today s gchq struggles with some of the most difficult issues of our time a leading force of the state s security efforts against militant terrorist organisations like alqaeda they are also involved in fundamental issues that will mould the future of british society compelling and revelatory aldrich s book is the crucial
