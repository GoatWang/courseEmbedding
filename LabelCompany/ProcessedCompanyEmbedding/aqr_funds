fact sheet investment objective seeks total return performance nav change daily return nav change daily return    as of    investment approach risk parity is all about diversification whereas traditional portfolios focus on dollarbased allocation risk parity portfolios focus on riskbased allocation aqrs risk parity fund invests globally across stocks bonds currencies and commodities allocating smaller amounts of capital to assets that are risky and larger amounts to assets that are less risky in building the portfolio we seek assets that we believe are liquid and provide either a positive expected return or some portfolio diversification benefit over the long term we target balanced risk allocation across the four asset classes but we have the ability to exploit tactical opportunities by making modest adjustments or “tilts” toward assets that we believe are relatively attractive and away from ones we believe are less attractive we believe that by spreading risks in a more balanced manner and adapting to market conditions the fund can generate more stable returns over time than traditional approaches aqr risk parity fund foreign investing involves special risks such as currency fluctuations and political uncertainty the use of derivatives forward and futures contracts and commodities exposes the fund to additional risks including increased volatility lack of liquidity and possible losses greater than the fund’s initial investment as well as increased transaction costs this fund enters into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed if the market price of a security increases after the fund borrows the security the fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the higher price short sales also involve transaction and other costs that will reduce potential fund gains and increase potential fund losses when investing in bonds yield and share price will vary with changes in interest rates and market conditions investors should note that if interest rates rise significantly from current levels bond total returns will decline and may even turn negative in the short term there is also a chance that

fact sheet investment objective seeks to generate positive longterm absolute returns performance nav change daily return nav change daily return    as of    investment approach we invest in over  liquid futures and forwards contracts both long and short across global equities fixed income currencies and commodities trades are executed based on trendfollowing signals that aim to go long rising markets and short falling markets  by establishing “long” positions in assets that we believe will rise in price and “short” positions for assets that are expected to decline in price this fund seeks to benefit from both up and down price movements  what distinguishes aqr’s approach to managedfutures investing is our emphasis on diversification across several themes  signal types — combines shortterm longterm and overextended signals to follow trends and anticipate reversals investments — trades over  liquid contracts across four major asset classes risk — position sizes based on risk allocating more capital to lessrisky instruments   aqrs proprietary trading algorithms and direct market access enable us to minimize transaction costs — another key differentiator for investors aqr managed futures strategy fund the use of derivatives forward and futures contracts and commodities exposes the fund to additional risks including increased volatility lack of liquidity and possible losses greater than the funds initial investment as well as increased transaction costs concentration generally will lead to greater price volatility this fund enters into a short sale by selling a security it has borrowed if the market price of a security increases after the fund borrows the security the fund will suffer a potentially unlimited loss when it replaces the borrowed security at the
