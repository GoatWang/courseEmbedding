been asking and some that people havent asked us yet but we wish they had if youve got a question we havent answered yet let us know about atom what is atom atom’s an app based bank we don’t have any branches and we don’t act like the banks of old we’re transparent innovative lowcost and put customers at the heart of everything we do we use biometric security face and voice recognition to login to our app everyone who joins atom is given their own unique personalised brand put simply they get to name their own bank have their own logo  finished off with their own colour palette for the app our low cost model allows our customers to reap the benefits with better rates and overall value just one look at our app and you’ll see why we’re the future of banking how are you different everything we do is different well offer an appbased experience like no other using leading technology the digital world is constantly changing and atom will be changing banking too oh and we dont have branches where are you based were everywhere in your hand your pocket down the back of the sofa  wherever your phone is  physically were based in durham its lovely here were getting to know our neighbours and hope to be part of the community for years to come who owns atom atom is a privately owned company with a broad shareholder base including bbva woodford investment management and toscafund asset management without the support of our investors we would not be able to bring you atom what career opportunities do you have we’re looking for interesting and passionate people with an entrepreneurial spirit to help us turn our vision into a reality if youre interested in joining us find out more here fundamentals are you for real yes were building something that people have been wanting for years its about time banking changed do you plan to incentivise people to switch no we want to do things differently to the rest of the banking industry and we don’t want to get into a bidding war with other providers in addition these incentives are typically clawed back somehow  they’re another cost that ultimately has to be paid for by customers we believe the value for money and great experience our customers will get will make it worthwhile for them to switch will you introduce touch id  fingerprint recognition yes for sure at atom we love to give you a chance to personalise your bank especially when it makes your journey easier because of this we’ll be introducing fingerprint recognition in the near future once we’ve done that you’ll have three types of biometric id to choose from but you’ll only need to register for two of them we’ll always ask you to create a sixdigit passcode though why should i change banks well offer an entirely new experience that makes banking speedy and convenient wherever you are and whenever you want well be bringing banking to you and well be looking out for your best interests sound unfamiliar why do we use biometrics essentially it’s to keep your account really safe  we’ve done away with passwords cyphers and those little bits of plastic that are so easily lost and taken your security to the next level but that doesn’t mean it’s complicated in fact it’s quite the opposite our biometric security uses your voice and face to access your account and we’ve added a passcode into the mix too just to be doubly safe this multitiered approach allows us to keep your account very secure but at the same time incredibly easy to access for you in certain circumstances you may need to use multiple login options to access certain functions but our biometric approach really speeds this up after all it’s much easier to take a selfie or read a phrase aloud than try to remember a complicated number sequence or the name of your mum’s best friend’s pet python who is an average atom customer anyone and everyone as long as you’re a uk resident in fact if you have a smartphone or tablet you’re in our aim is to make banking easy and enjoyable for all wheres my nearest branch on your nearest tree  we dont have high street branches because theyre unnecessary no one wants to visit them and no one likes queuing you can do all of your banking on your phone wherever you like  hours a day  days a week will your products be listed on comparison sites yes they are now we’ve opened our fixed saver product to everyone and you’ll be seeing us on comparison sites how will i know when youre open for business the doors are now wide open to anyone interested in savings accounts and small business loans for everything else sign up to our emails and we’ll make sure you’re the first to know how it works will you support all mobile platforms you can use our app on most apple and android smartphones and tablets for a full list of supported devices click here can i access my account on multiple devices you can now access your accounts on more than one device simply download the app on your other devices and tap already registered verify your identity and youre in simple can i open an account if i don’t live in the uk our products and services are available to you if youve downloaded the uk version of the app from either the apple app store or google play store you may still be able to use our app if you’re temporarily overseas but you could have difficulties installing updates however there are some countries where the atom app won’t work at all how do i log out there are two places in your app where you can log out and the first is in the portal simply tap the small black circle in the bottom right corner of your screen then press the log out button you’ll find the second option behind your personal atom ‘a’ logo to access simply tap your ‘a’ then press the log out button couldn’t be easier how old do i have to be to open an account you need to be at least  years old and have downloaded the uk version of the app once you’ve downloaded our app received your invitation code provided your biometric data and been verified by our electronic verification eidv process you can go ahead and open an account within the app can i open an account by post or through the website we’re an appbased bank and because of this you’ll be unable to open an account without our app this isn’t to say that we won’t release a computerbased app in the future however it does mean that right now you’ll require a smartphone to open an account with us where can i find my account number and sort code you’ll find all the info you need about your bank account such as account number sort code and recent transactions on the account page of your app simply tap on the account you want to learn more about and the page will expand then tap again to reveal even more info on the specific account why do you need my bank details at atom we only ever ask for info we need and the reason we request your bank details is so we can carry out an id check not to check your credit however before completing this step it’s a good idea to check that your bank is happy to share your account info as this’ll help prevent you from being unexpectedly declined why have i been declined as we run a series of different checks there could be a few reasons why you’re unable to open an account for example the length of time at your current address if you’re on the electoral register or whether your data has been matched at credit agencies please ensure that the details you provide us with are correct and up to date and that the bank details you’ve given us are from a uk current account in your name why do you need access to my camera and microphone we use biometric security including voice and face recognition to keep your account safe and secure but we can’t do that unless we access your camera and microphone we don’t store any snaps of you or recordings of your beautiful voice so please don’t worry about that either how do i open an account simply download the app from the apple app store or google play store and you could open an account in a matter of minutes all from the comfort of your own sofa head to the app home page where you’ll find a smarti in the bottom right of the screen tap this and you’ll be transported to a screen offering different types of accounts after selecting the type that you want to open you’ll be shown some important info on the nature and specific details of the account once you’ve read over these you can progress to the tcs as you’ll see our tcs don’t load in their entirety to begin with however by tapping the expand button you can read the full version of them after accepting these you’ll be sent to a page that looks very similar this page contains the fscs guarantee and is similar to our own however we recommend you read these properly as they’re importantwe’ll then need you to give us a few bits of info so that we can carry out an id check why cant you verify my address it could be to do with the format of your address to double check that
