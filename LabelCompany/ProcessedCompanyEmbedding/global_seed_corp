almost half  of duponts seed revenue came from products that carried a biotech trait uk consultancy firm cropnosis puts the global value of gm crops in  at  billion gene giant’s tech cartel crossenabling agreements antitrust regulators anyone out there in brussels and washington take note the gene giants are forging unprecedented alliances that render competitive markets a thing of the past by agreeing to crosslicense proprietary germplasm and technologies consolidate rd efforts and terminate costly ip litigation the worlds largest agrochemical and seed firms are reinforcing toptier market power for mutual benefit the trend isnt new but the tech cartel deals are getting bigger and bolder in march  the worlds largest seed company monsanto and the worlds largest chemical corporation basf announced a  billion rd collaboration to increase yields and drought tolerance in maize cotton canola and soybeans etc group refers to this kind of partnership as a “nonmerger merger” – all the benefits of consolidation and oligopoly markets without the antitrust constraints industry analysts expect the agreements to have “lasting repercussions throughout the seed biotech and crop protection industries” biotechs most lucrative technical achievement is the engineering of crops to withstand a shower of chemical weed killers today over  of the worldwide area devoted to genetically engineered crops carries at least one genetic trait for herbicide tolerance sample tech cartel agreements monsanto the worlds largest seed company and basf the worlds  agrochemical firm announce colossal  billion rd collaboration involving  profitsharing respectively “this is a great step forward in bringing to farmers higher yielding crops” – basf  monsanto joint news release march  monsanto  dow agrochemicals join forces to develop the firstever genetically engineered maize loaded with eight genetic traits for release in  “farmers will have more product choices to optimize performance and protection” – dow news release sept  monsanto and syngenta agree to call a truce on outstanding litigation related to global maize and soybean interests and forge new crosslicensing agreements

agreement that will broaden each companys pesticide product portfolios these products which are highly complementary to our portfolio and pipeline will provide additional options for growers” – dupont  syngenta joint news release june  from industrys point of view two or three biotech traits are a lot better than one because double and triple stacked traits generate nearly twice the profitability monsanto introduced its first doublestack trait variety in  and its first triplestack trait hit the market in  a monsanto spokesman told progressive farmer that  of the maize seed it sells in the us in  will be triplestack varieties at a july  meeting monsanto officials announced plans to raise the average price of some of the companys triplestack maize varieties a whopping  percent fred stokes of the usbased organization for competitive markets ocm describes the implications for farmers a  price increase is a tremendous drain on rural america lets say a farmer in iowa who farms  acres plants one of these expensive corn varieties next year the gross increased cost is more than  yet theres no scientific basis to justify this price hike how can we let companies get away with this the us government is currently subsidizing sales of monsantos triplestack maize seed by offering lower crop insurance premiums to farmers who plant it on nonirrigated land – because the biotech maize reportedly provides lower risk of reduced yields when compared to conventional hybrids the pilot project is especially specious because the us government relied on data from monsanto to substantiate the claim “the lack of competition and innovation in the marketplace has reduced farmers’ choices and enabled monsanto to raise prices unencumbered” – keith mudd organization for competitive markets following monsantos decision to raise some ge maize seed prices by  july  theme ge crops as the cureall technology that will increase production and feed the world this time ge crops are touted as the solution to the current food crisis and climate change and peak oil the biotechnology industry organizations current slogan is “heal fuel feed the world the gene giants aim to convince governments farmers and reluctant consumers that genetic engineering is the essential adaptation strategy to insure agricultural productivity in the midst of climate change according to monsanto “everyone recognizes that the old traditional ways just arent able to address these new challenges” – so the only hope is climate ready” gm crops bottom line patented gene technologies will not help small farmers survive climate change but they will concentrate corporate power drive up costs inhibit public sector research and further undermine the rights of farmers to save and exchange seeds menu home
