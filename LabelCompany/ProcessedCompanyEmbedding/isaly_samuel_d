markets the fund tends to focus on pharmaceutical and medical device companies as opposed to hospitals and insurers products one might say as opposed to services sam isaly’s orbimed advisors is a large health care fund investing in companies at various stages from venture capital to the public markets the fund tends to focus on pharmaceutical and medical device companies as opposed to hospitals and insurers products one might say as opposed to servicesthe nature of healthcare investments requires orbimed advisors to take on significant regulatory risks and make sure they are up to date on major announcements and other events which can have an enormous impact on an individual stock’s price of course the fund also has to ensure that its analysts understand the regulatory environment as well as the science behind a company’s product line samuel isaly himself has been covering healthcare for over  years roughly half of which has come as an investment manager and half of which came as an analyst for companies such as chase manhattan  merrill lynch and legg masonorbimed advisors’ grand strategy is to run a portfolio that is more or less balanced between large healthcare companies and smallercap companies where the investment team believes that future growth is not being reflected in the current price when we look at its most recent portfolio we see a fairly small number of positions worth over  million and then a fairly broad range of healthcare stocks in addition while there were some large increases or decreases many of orbimed’s top picks remained the same and we’d assume that most of them are still close to the top of the portfolio show more fund profile filing period                            fund name orbimed advisors manager

wikipedia the free encyclopedia jump to navigation search isalys industry food processing founded mansfield ohio founders william isaly headquarters pittsburgh pennsylvania united states products deli  dairy website website isaly advertising art in the mids featured the swiss lad a skyscraper cone and the tag line peak of quality as an allusion to the family operated companys swiss heritage isalys was a chain of familyowned dairies and restaurants started in mansfield richland county ohio with locations throughout the american midwest from the early th century until the s it is known today for its iconic chipped chopped ham and for creating the famous klondike bar ice cream treat popularized by the slogan what would you do for a klondike bar the company was founded by william isaly grandson of swiss immigrants who settled in monroe county ohio in the th century by the early s the company boasted retail outlets that stretched from pennsylvania to iowa isalys early success was attributed to its loose company structure which allowed for easy expansion without corporate overhead william isalys first dairy was established in mansfield ohio where he acquired the mansfield pure milk company isaly expanded the core business from processing milk for sale to other grocers to operating his own retail stores with milk ice cream bread and lunch counter service isaly also pioneered the idea of the modern convenience store by opening at least one outlet that also sold gasoline to motorists the first expansion of the business took the company to marion ohio after acquiring the marion pure milk company in  operated by charles isaly the marion operation was quickly modernized and business grew accordingly from marion the company expanded to youngstown ohio and by  had a dairy and new headquarters on mahoning ave the youngstown area was the largest isalys market boasting at one time almost  stores in  they expanded to pittsburgh pennsylvania on the blvd of the allies expansion continued through the s and s with additional dairies built from columbus ohio at north high street and arcadia avenue west to iowa and  stores pittsburgh residents so highly regarded isalys that the company was and still is mistakenly considered a pittsburgh original in its advertising the dairies used the mnemonic phrase i shall always love you sweetheart to help with the spelling of the isaly’s name in marion ohio isalys fielded an amateur basketball team that played against the marion ohiobased jim thorpe and his worldfamous indians and the buffalo silents  a team composed of deafmute players in the s isalys began a commercial building program that employed high style art deco  art moderne designed production facilities and retail outlets most of which were designed by architect vincent shooey schoeneman the youngstown dairy facility represented the apex of this project with the streamline building with exterior by architect charles f owsley dominated by a fivestory glass block tower in addition to the klondike bar the dairies were also known for their unique skyscraper cones created in youngstown by plant supervisor sam jennings which eschewed round ice cream scoops instead using a patented design that resulted in a long inverse cone shaped dip the company also had great success in selling chipped chopped ham sliced shaved razor thin for sandwiches the sandwich was featured on the pbs special sandwiches that you will like the company also marketed immunized milk for infants supplied by special isolated herds of cattle shifting consumer demands declining sales for homedelivered milk as well as corporate consolidation led to the closing of isaly facilities beginning in the s according to brian butko author of klondikes chipped ham  skyscraper cones the story of isalys it was the loose company structure – in an era of growing corporate homogeneity  that left isalys unable to compete on the wholesale and retail levels leading to the closure of its dairies beginning in the mids several members of the isaly family attempted to continue to operate foodservice operations in pittsburgh isaly outlets were converted to the sweet william brand in ohio restaurants operated under the isaly shoppe name until the mids when the final outlet closed in marion ohio since  the isalys name has enjoyed a comeback of sorts but one not overseen by members of the isaly family delicatessen distributing incorporated of evans city pennsylvania purchased the isaly trademark name and markets the original quality luncheon meats cheeses and sauces under the isaly name in western pennsylvania and eastern ohio the concern also distributes isaly brand ice cream except klondikes to stores in western pennsylvania the klondike bar product line is now owned by unilever there are at least three isalys still in operation in southwestern pennsylvania in the areas of west view turtle creek and east allegheny city neighborhood of pittsburgh all retaining most of the classic interior in june  ownership of the west view isalys changed hands the new owners have kept everything in the store intact but slightly changed the name to i shall always love you sweetie reflecting on isalys acronym to punctuate this periods have been added after each letter in the classic isalys storefront a former isalys franchise in new brighton pennsylvania which operated under the name brickers restaurant after its isalys contract ended and continued to serve much of the isalys menu closed in  referencesedit  cole ron march   isaly devotees celebrated skyscraper cones
