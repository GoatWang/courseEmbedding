kycaml data governance and operational transparency are consistent themes across these regulations all driven by a motivation to bolster risk management capabilities manual workarounds and siloed systems that inhibit data sharing are rightly called out as areas of concern a few changes on the margin to monolithic legacy systems will not be sufficient general consensus is that a more fundamental rethink is needed ideally banks need a single platform that can be automated for data accumulation and aggregation and since data governance has taken on additional importance with the volcker rule the platform needs to be robust enough to provide an audit trail for risk managers auditors and regulators many of the largest banks with over  billion in assets are building their own inhouse systems however it is questionable how well those systems are integrated with existing systems at the firms even more questionable is how smaller firms will cope with the cost and complexity of new technology demands it departments face the confounding challenge of responding to these regulations while remaining responsive to business users seeking to experiment with the latest cloudbased research and trading offerings incapture technologies was founded by architects and developers with decades of experience delivering technology solutions for global asset managers the challenges faced in those environments drove the development of rapture an open architecture framework by virtue of being built on rapture our products and solutions are flexible and adaptable while also offering a high degree of operational governance and controls some specific benefits that accrue to users include an automatically generated audit log of all system events a robust entitlements framework that governs activity at the document level operational resiliency and scalability promotion of code through distinct research testing and production environments in service of a healthy sdlc transparency to underlying operations which makes troubleshooting easier open and modular architecture which promotes integration with legacy systems and adoption of new offerings a robust sdk that supports continued enhancements these underlying benefits are crucial a recent survey of global banks found that of the  risk data principles outlined by the basel committee data architecture and it infrastructure and adaptability part of data aggregation had the lowest compliance adding new features and tools to existing applications will not help firms respond to these asks rather a platform driven approach is required incapture technologies delivers products and solutions that enable clients to leverage and benefit from foundational aspects of the rapture platform one product offering particularly suited to addressing the regulatory requirements detailed earlier is the data lifecycle manager which covers the full lifecycle of enterprise data capture automate the collection validation transformation and storage of inbound data whether through batch processing or realtime event streams curate empower searching locating and retrieval of data by creating a data catalog of associated data descriptions search federated access to data through consistent references which abstract away underlying operational concerns distribute expose data and services to various consumers including commercial and open source data visualization and analysis tools having implemented rapture as the underlying fabric for data management firms can easily build extensions to address specific needs for example build and execute fully audited workflows that automate extraction of structured data from a variety of sources to meet client onboarding requirements or integrate risk management models and reporting tools to deliver a flexible and transparent regulatory reporting engine in all cases clients are prepared for the future by virtue of a robust underlying architecture that delivers flexibility and operational resiliency the data lifecycle manager built on rapture offers it departments a unique path forward from their present challenges we welcome questions and inquiries as to how incapture can support your business needs at salesincapturetechnologiescom rapture taking advantage of the present while looking forward to the future incapture’s rapture platform was born out of a desire to not repeat the past to take advantage of the present and to look forward to the future the past while working for a number of capital market banks and asset managers i had the opportunity to design build and deploy a large number of different applications although the end functionality could often be vastly different some of the core components of the application stack were the same — in fact it was often deja vu in that i ended up rewriting or recreating the same functionality again and again the enlightened among you would argue that this is a classic case of a need for a common platform or framework – something on which these applications could be built but in these organizations at this time the pressure was to deliver at any cost time was of the essence not to deliver a perfect and forward looking solution this behavior repeated over and over again is often the source of the large legacy software infrastructure at these type of organizations and the challenge they now face to look forward the present the last two to three years have seen a fundamental shift in architectures for software applications — the advent of cloud computing distributed systems big data environments and the like have been instrumental in this change these technologies were available before this time it’s just that the market has matured to the point where such things are now commodity instead of esoteric the future in designing a platform to solve or help transition the problems of the past and to take advantage of the present we needed to ensure that the platform we design today does not become obsolete as new technologies and approaches emerge we ensured that the platform has a pluggable model by default – it should be easy to replace one implementation with another we also ensured that the api to our platform could be called by any language the transport is open with little effort we cannot predict the new languages that will be created but we certainly should ensure that our platform can leverage those new languages with ease where we are in release version  of rapture we successfully captured these desires in a platform that can be used with new architectures around distributed processing and common access to data while still providing a legacy migration path for existing applications the pluggable architecture and options around customizing and enhancing the core platform makes it easy for rd party developers to integrate their services and technology with our common platform finally and most importantly we have taken the core platform and extended it with key functionality in the financial services space – recreating nearly all of that common functionality that so frustrated me in my early career if i had rapture then i could have spent all of my time building key application functionality risk analysis pricing trade capture instead of most of my time on managing data processing scheduling entitlements audit trails i could have also delivered my applications via many different means – spreadsheet front ends web front ends thick clients – all calling the same common layer that delivers the business logic subscribe for updates

demonstrate exposing rapture kernel calls through a rest style interface specifically to perform crud operations on the various rapture data types document blob and series this approach can be used when modeling and implementing your own rapture client’s domain resources and interactions we wanted to use a simple and straightforward rest framework so we choose httpsparkjavacom this allows you to get started quickly and provides everything needed to build an api lets focus on rapture ‘documents’ one of the prime uses of rapture is to manage access to data rapture has the concept of a repository for managing access to data various repositories configurations and implementations are provided ‘out of the box’ for the purposes of this post we will be considering a versioned document repository hosted on mongodb document data repositories manage data as keyvalue pairs and are addressable through uris in fact all data in a rapture system is uniquely addressable via a uri and is a key concept in using the platform for example consider the following document with uri documentordersord and data  we won’t go through the subsequent get and delete calls as the postman collection and github code are available to review links restserver github repository setting up local docker environment postman collection if you’d like more information about incapture or rapture please email me
