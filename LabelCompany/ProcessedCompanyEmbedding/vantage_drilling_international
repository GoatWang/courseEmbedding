situations contrarian longshort equity valuesummaryvantage drilling international is the new name for vantage drilling after emerging from bankruptcy on february  vtgdf sold all its assets to vantage drilling international and got a  million promissory note  k shares of the new shares i do not recommend to invest in vtgdf or even trade the stock at all the stock will have a very remote value when all is said and done image the tungsten explorer from offshoreenergytoday vantage drilling otcpkvtgdf introduction i am certain i am not the only one here who has been frustrated with this entire melodramatic saga that started with the early termination of the platinum explorer by petrobras who refused to compensate the company for nearly  billion in contract backlog loss the platinum explorer was implicated in a bribery case called the car wash corruption scandal petrobras decision was a death sentence for vantage on december   offshore group investment limited a cayman islands exempted company ogil a whollyowned subsidiary of vantage drilling company the company and certain subsidiaries of ogil together with ogil the vantage debtors filed voluntary petitions bankruptcypetitions in the united states bankruptcy court for the district of delaware the bankruptcy court seeking relief under the provisions of chapter  of title  of the united states code the bankruptcy code to pursue a prepackaged chapter  plan of reorganization the plan what is important for vtgdf shareholders is the following the company will have sold to ogil its equity interests in vantage international management company pte ltd vimco singapore and vantage energy services inc vesi and collectively with vimco singapore the vantage parent assets in exchange for a promissorynote which sale was effected pursuant to the terms of a share purchase agreement dated as of december   by and among the company ogil vimco singapore and vesi on january   the court confirmed the plan of reorganization which became effective on february   vantage filed a joint prepackaged chapter  plan of reorganization on december   and emerged from those proceedings on february   in connection with the reorganization vantage recognized charges totaling approximately  million consisting primarily of the writeoff of deferred financing costs and unamortized original issued debt discounts and professional feesvantage a cayman islands exempted company is an offshore drilling contractor with an owned fleet of three ultradeepwater drillships the platinum explorer the titanium explorer and the tungsten explorer and four baker marine pacific class  ultrapremium jackup drilling rigs this reorganization was partial in essence whereas vantage drilling co is still in liquidation in the cayman islands kpmg in the cayman islands is the auditing firm handling the liquidation vtgdf owns a promissory note that has been estimated to be worth  million due december  section  purchase price in consideration for the purchase and sale of the purchased shares and the contribution of the seller vesi receivable to the capital of vesi buyer shall pay to seller  the purchase price which shall be paid in the form of that certain secured promissory note issued by buyer to seller dated as of the date hereof in the amount of the purchase price and attached hereto as exhibit a the note which note along with the obligations of buyer thereunder is secured pursuant to the terms of that certain security agreement dated as of the date hereof entered into by buyer and seller and attached hereto as exhibit b the security agreement final note on the relationship between vantage drilling international and vtgdf vantage drilling international formerly known as offshore group investment limited ogil is a private company who owns the vantage fleet and vtgdf is only a shell company currently in liquidation which owns a promissory note worth  million that should be repaid before december  note in the last conference call vantage drilling international said it has issued k new shares representing  of the outstanding shares of the new company to vantage drilling co   million  in exchange of the promissory note i was not able to confirm it because i could not access the last k filing in my opinion vtgdf is not worth much after deducting all liabilities i do not see what can be left to shareholders the question remains about the platinum explorer and the arbitration against petrobras it is hard to imagine petrobras  which is a national oil company noc  to be forced to pay an early termination fee however we cannot totally eliminate a possible favorable decision against petrobras however any proceeds will go to vantage drilling international fleet status of vantage drilling

         aquamarine driller          topaz driller                      a quick look at the vantage drilling international balance sheet on  shows that the promissory note was classified as a liability note payable to parent but will be exchanged with k shares or  of the total outstanding of vantage drilling international the future outlook is quite negative for vantage drilling international with a very limited contract backlog in  the company could be an excellent candidate for a takeover at a distress price due to the quality of the fleet vtgdf chart conclusion on february   vantage drilling international announced my article the following vantage drilling international signed an agreement for a twoyear extension of the tungsten explorer contract the ultradeepwater drillship will now work until october  the company said feb  quickly after the news vtgdf jumped from  to  and it was evident that the rally was directly correlated to the news of the tungsten
