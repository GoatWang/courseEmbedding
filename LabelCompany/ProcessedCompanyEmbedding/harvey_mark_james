trustpilot paperback book detailsreleased september   originally released  publisher ronin pub authors author mark james estren product description in the land that time forgot s and s america amerika to some there once were some bold forthright thoroughly unashamed social commentators who said things that “couldnt be said” and showed things that “couldnt be shown” they were outrageous — hunted pursued hounded arrested busted and looked down on by just about everyone in the mass media who deigned to notice them at allthey were cartoonists — underground cartoonists and they were some of the cleverest most interesting social commentators of their time as well as some of the very best artists whose work has influenced the visual arts right up until todaya history of underground comics is their story — told in their own art in their own words with connecting commentary and analysis by one of the very few media people who took them seriously from the start and detailed their worries concerns and attitudes in broadcast media and in this book in printauthor mark james estren knew the artists lived with and among them analyzed their work talked extensively with them received numerous letters and original drawings from them — and its all in a history of underground comics what robert crumb really thinks of himself and his neuroses…how gilbert shelton feels about wonder warthog and the fabulous furry freak brothers…how bill griffith handled the early development of zippy the pinhead…where art spiegelmans ideas for his pulitzerprizewinning maus had their origins…and much much morewho influenced these holdnothingsacred cartoonists those earlier artists are here too harvey kurtzman — famed mad editor and an extensive contributor to a history of underground comics will eisner of the spirit — in his own words and drawngs from the bizarre productions of longago nearly forgotten comicstrip artists such as gustave verbeek who created panel strips in six panels you read them one way then turned them upside down and read them that way to modern but conventional masters of cartooning theyre all here — all talking to the author and the reader — and all drawing drawing drawingthe underground cartoonists drew everything from overthetop sex a whole chapter here to political commentary far beyond anything in doonesbury that is here too to analyses of womens issues and a host of societal concerns from the gorgeously detailed to the primitive and childlike these artists redefined comics and cartooning not only for their generation but also for later cartoonists in a history of underground comics you read and see it all just as it happened through the words and drawings of the people who made it happenand what “it” did they make happen they raised consciousness sure but they also reflected a raised consciousness — and got slapped down more than once as a result the notorious obscenity trial of zap  is told here in words testimony and illustrations including the exact drawings judged obscene by the court community standards may have been offended then — quite intentionally readers can judge whether they would be offended nowand with all their serious concerns their pointed social comment the undergrounds were fun in a way that hidebound conventional comics had not been for decades demons and bikers funny “aminals” and walt disney parodies characters whose anatomy could never be and ones who are utterly recognizable all come together in strange peculiar bizarre and sometimes unexpectedly affecting and even beautiful art that has never since been duplicated — despite its tremendous influence on later cartoonists its all here in a history of underground comics told by an expert observer who weaves together the art and words of the cartoonists themselves into a portrait of a time that seems to belong to the past but that is really as uptodate as todays headlines classics illustrated  a cultural history nd ed book
