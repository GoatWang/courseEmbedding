platform the cmhas platform is based on hyaluronic acid ha a naturally occurring polymer that is important in many physiological processes including development wound healing tissue homeostasis and joint lubrication to create hydrogels the ha is modified to create thiolated carboxymethyl ha cmhas that is then crosslinked together through the thiol groups some products are disulfide crosslinked while others utilize a crosslinker the crosslinking slows degradation of the ha backbone and provides a matrix for incorporating therapeutic agents variations in the number of thiols per molecule the molecular weight of the polymer the concentration of the polymer type of crosslinking and incorporation of other molecules provides a highly versatile platform that can be tailored to a specific application products can be formatted as gels films sponges or powders and crosslinking can be done in situ repeating molecular units of thiolated crosslinked hyaluronic acid glenn prestwich phd university of utah eyegate’s first product from the cmhas platform is an eye drop formulation the eyegate ocular bandage gel that is applied topically it provides a thin coating to the surface of the eye serving as a protectant to facilitate and accelerate corneal reepithelization it is intended for the management of corneal epithelial defects and for the acceleration of reepithelization of the ocular surface following surgery injection traumatic and nontraumatic conditions additionally crosslinking allows the product’s viscosity to be modified to meet optimum ocular needs the increased viscosity and noncovalent mucoadhesive interfacial forces improve residence time in the tear film thus providing a coating that aids and promotes reepithelization of the ocular surface via physical protection the eyegate ocular bandage provides significant mechanical improvement over noncrosslinked hyaluronic acid products and other hydrogels by forming a degradationresistant coating  pilot preclinical studies suggest that this chemical modification will prolong dwell time on the ocular surface thus providing a smooth continuous clear barrier without blur minimizing mechanical lid friction and reducing repeat injury which can mechanically protect the ocular surface and accelerate corneal reepithelization burdick and prestwich  the ocular bandage is presently available commercially as a veterinary device manufactured by sentrx animal care and sold in the us by bayer animal health as remend® corneal repair indicated for use in the management of superficial corneal

seeking surgical correction of refractive errors who are not suitable candidates for laser in situ keratomileusis lasik due to inadequate corneal thickness larger pupil size history of keratoconjunctivitis sicca kcs or anterior basement membrane disease prk involves controlled mechanical removal of corneal epithelium with subsequent excimer laser photoablation of the underlying bowman’s layer and anterior stroma including the subepithelial nerve plexus the military prefers prk as a refractive surgery due to the stability of the prk incision and the absence of risk for flap dislocation during military active duty although this procedure yields desirable visual acuity results common complications of the procedure include postoperative pain secondary to the epithelial defects risk of corneal infection prior to reepithelization of the large epithelial defect corneal haze formation decreased contrast sensitivity and slower visual recovery alio et al  bensira et al  lohmann et al  loewenstein et al  corneal wounds created while performing prk are an excellent model for other epithelial defects as these patients undergo the creation of large  to  mm epithelial defects following a standardized protocol to perform refractive laser surgery the corneal wounds are expected based on historical data to heal within  days although in some cases these defects can take longer pain is a significant side effect as is a risk of infection while the defects have not healed thus creating a need for a device that can accelerate time to wound closure furthermore given the pain and risk of corneal haze from delayed healing a product that can help accelerate corneal reepithelization could also improve time to best visual acuity outcomes in preclinical models using a prk wound created in healthy rabbits these large epithelial defects were observed to have accelerated corneal wound closure by at least one day after treatment with cmhas applied qid versus pbs yang
