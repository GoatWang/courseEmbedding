creative officer  senior vp games apps and creative experiences according to past versions of its website the startup evolved from a company named magic leap studios which around  was working on a graphic novel and a feature film series and in  became a corporation releasing an augmented reality app at comiccon that year a november  analysis by gizmodo based on job listings trademark registrations and patent applications from magic leap concluded that the company appears to aim at building a google glass on steroids that can seamlessly blend computergenerated graphics with the real world it has also been compared to microsoft hololens before magic leap a headmounted display using light fields was already demonstrated by nvidia in  and the mit media lab has also constructed a d display using compressed light fields however magic leap asserts that it achieves better resolution with a new proprietary technique that projects an image directly onto the users retina according to a researcher who has studied the companys patents magic leap is likely to use stacked silicon waveguides on march   magic leap released a demo video titled just another day in the office at magic leap the video includes augmented reality gaming and productivity applications but it was unclear if the video was actual footage using their technology or a simulated experience on october   magic leap released actual footage of their product while still not showing any hardware the footage claims that it was filmed through a magic leap technology without the use of special effects or compositing the video suggests that virtual d objects can be occluded by real objects which may be predefined geometry in the scene but lead to the speculation of d spatial mapping being used it also shows virtual light reflecting from a real table which seem to be not correctly placed in space and therefore may suggest that the reflections are part of the virtual scene without interacting with the real world as simple faked shadows in early video games the video showcases only quite bright objects superimposed over dark areas of the real world this suggests that the hardware can only add new light without blocking incoming light from the real world this would allow to render only fully transparent objects which emit or reflect light and may not allow virtual objects to occlude real objects this would work well for bright virtual objects in front of dark real backgrounds as in the video but not work for darker virtual objects in front of brighter real backgrounds on december
