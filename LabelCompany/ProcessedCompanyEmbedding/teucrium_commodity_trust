relationship between the near month futures contract to expire and the benchmark component futures contracts will vary and may impact both the total return of each fund over time and the degree to which such total return tracks the total return of the price indices related to the commodity of each fund in cases in which the near month contracts price is lower than laterexpiring contracts prices a situation known as contango in the futures markets then absent the impact of the overall movement in commodity prices the value of the benchmark component futures contracts would tend to decline as they approach expiration in cases in which the near month contracts price is higher than laterexpiring contracts prices a situation known as backwardation in the futures markets then absent the impact of the overall movement in a funds prices the value of the benchmark component futures contracts would tend to rise as they approach expiration all other things being equal the total portfolio

daily and includes as applicable the name and value of each futures contract other commodity interest and the amount of cash and cash equivalents held in the funds portfolio the specific types of other commodity interests in addition to futures contracts options on futures contracts and derivative contracts that are tied to various commodities are entered into outside of public exchanges these overthecounter contracts are entered into between two parties in private contracts or on a recently formed swap execution facility sef for standardized swaps for example unlike futures contracts which are guaranteed by a clearing organization each party to an overthecounter derivative contract bears the credit risk of the other party unless such overthecounter swap is cleared through a derivatives clearing organization dco ie the risk that the other party will not be able to perform its obligations under its contract and characteristics of such other commodity interests consistent with achieving a funds investment objective of closely tracking the benchmark the sponsor may for certain reasons cause the fund to enter into or hold futures contracts other than the benchmark component futures contracts andor other commodity interests other commodity interests that do not have standardized terms and are not exchangetraded referred to as overthecounter corn interests can generally be structured as the parties to the corn interest contract desire therefore each fund might enter into multiple andor overthecounter interests intended to replicate the performance of each of the benchmark component futures contracts for the fund or a single overthecounter interest designed to replicate the performance of the benchmark as a whole assuming that there is no default by a counterparty to an overthecounter interest the performance of the interest will necessarily correlate with the performance of the benchmark or the applicable benchmark component futures contract each fund might also enter into or hold interests other than benchmark component futures contracts to facilitate effective trading consistent with the discussion of the funds roll strategy in addition each fund might enter into or hold interests that would be expected to alleviate overall deviation between the funds performance and that of the benchmark that may result from certain market and trading inefficiencies or other reasons by utilizing certain or all of the investments described above the sponsor will endeavor to cause the funds performance to closely track that of the benchmark of the fund an exchange for related position efrp can be used by the fund as a technique to facilitate the exchanging of a futures hedge position against a creation or redemption order and thus the fund may use an efrp transaction in connection with the creation and redemption of shares the market specialistmarket maker that is the ultimate purchaser or seller of shares in connection with the creation or redemption basket respectively agrees to sell or purchase a corresponding offsetting futures position which is then settled on the same business day as a cleared futures transaction by the fcms the fund will become subject to the credit risk of the market specialistmarket maker until the efrp is settled within the business day which is typically  hours or less the fund reports all activity related to efrp transactions under the procedures and guidelines of the cftc and the exchanges on which the futures are traded the funds earn interest income from the treasury securities andor cash equivalents that it purchases and on the cash it holds through the custodian or other financial institution the sponsor anticipates that the earned interest income will increase the nav of each fund the funds apply the earned interest income to the acquisition of additional investments or uses it to pay its expenses if the fund reinvests the earned interest income it makes investments that are consistent with its investment objectives any treasury security and cash equivalent invested by a fund will have original maturity dates of three months or less at inception any cash equivalents invested by a fund will be rated in the highest shortterm rating category by a nationally recognized statistical rating organization or will be deemed by the sponsor to be of comparable quality at the end of the quarter available cash balances in each of the funds were invested in either the fidelity institutional money market funds  government portfolio or in demand deposits at rabobank na in managing the assets of the funds the sponsor does not use a technical trading system that automatically issues buy and sell orders instead the sponsor will purchase or sell the specific underlying commodity interests with an aggregate market value that approximates the amount of cash received or paid upon the purchase or redemption of shares the sponsor does not anticipate letting the commodity futures contracts of any fund expire thus taking delivery of the underlying commodity instead the sponsor will close out existing positions for instance in response to ongoing changes in the benchmark or if it otherwise determines it would be appropriate to do so and reinvest the proceeds in new commodity interests positions may also be closed out to meet redemption orders in which case the proceeds from closing the positions will not be reinvested the sponsor employs a neutral investment strategy intended to track the changes in the benchmark of each fund regardless of whether the benchmark goes up or goes down the funds neutral investment strategy is designed to permit investors generally to purchase and sell the funds shares for the purpose of investing indirectly in the commodityspecific market in a costeffective manner such investors may include participants in the specific industry and other industries seeking to hedge the risk of losses in their commodityspecificrelated transactions as well as investors seeking exposure to that commodity market accordingly depending on the investment objective of an individual investor the risks generally associated with investing in the commodityspecific market andor the risks involved in hedging may exist in addition an investment in a fund involves the risks that the changes in the price of the funds shares will not accurately track the changes in the benchmark and that changes in the benchmark will not closely correlate with changes in the price of the commodity on the spot market the sponsor does not intend to operate each fund in a fashion such that its per share nav equals in dollar terms the spot price of the commodity or the price of any particular commodityspecific futures contract the sponsor teucrium trading llc is the sponsor of the trust and each of the series of the trust the sponsor is a delaware limited liability company formed on july   the principal office is

item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the notes thereto of the teucrium commodity trust and all of the funds which are series of the trust included elsewhere in the annual report on form k this annual report on form k including this managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forwardlooking statements by terminology such as may will should expect plan anticipate believe estimate predict potential or the negative of these terms or other comparable terminology all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this filing that address activities events or developments that will or may occur in the future including such matters as movements in the commodities markets and indexes that track such movements operations of the funds the sponsors plans and references to the future success of a fund or the funds and other similar matters are forwardlooking statements these statements are only predictions actual events or results may differ materially these statements are based upon certain assumptions and analyses the sponsor has made based on its perception of historical trends current conditions and expected future developments as well as other factors appropriate in the circumstances whether or not actual results and developments will conform to the sponsors expectations and predictions however is subject to a number of risks and uncertainties including the special considerations discussed in this prospectus general economic market and business conditions changes in laws or regulations including those concerning taxes made by governmental authorities or regulatory bodies and other world economic and political developments consequently all the forwardlooking statements made in this filing are qualified by these cautionary statements and there can be no assurance that actual results or developments the sponsor anticipates will be realized or even if substantially realized that they will result in the expected consequences to or have the expected effects on the operations of the funds or the value of the shares of the funds trust overview the business and operations of the trust and each fund are described above under part i item i entitled business critical accounting policies the trusts critical accounting policies for all the funds are as follows  preparation of the financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with us generallyaccepted accounting principles gaap requires the application of appropriate accounting rules and guidance as well as the use of estimates and requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities revenue and expense and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities during the reporting period of the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes the trusts application of these policies involves judgments and actual results may differ from the estimates used  the sponsor has determined that the valuation of commodity interests that are not traded on a us or internationally recognized futures exchange such as swaps and other overthecounter contracts involves a critical accounting policy the values which are used by the funds for futures contracts will be provided by the commodity broker who will use market prices when available while overthecounter contracts will be valued based on the present value of estimated future cash flows that would be received from or paid to a third party in settlement of these derivative contracts prior to their delivery date values will be determined on a daily basis  commodity futures contracts held by the funds are recorded on the trade date all such transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis and marked to market daily unrealized appreciation or depreciation on commodity futures contracts are reflected in the statement of operations as the difference between the original contract amount and the fair market value as of the last business day of the year or as of the last date of the financial statements changes in the appreciation or depreciation between periods are reflected in the statement of operations interest on cash equivalents and deposits with the futures commission merchant are recognized on the accrual basis the funds earn interest on its assets denominated in us dollars on deposit with the futures commission merchant at a rate equal to  of the overnight of federal funds rate in addition the funds earn interest on funds held at the custodian or other financial institution at prevailing market rates for such investments  cash equivalents are highlyliquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less at inception the funds reported cash equivalents in the statements of assets and liabilities at market value or at carrying amounts that approximate fair value because of their highlyliquid nature and shortterm maturities the funds have a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with banks assets deposited with the bank may at times exceed federally insured limits  the use of fair value to measure financial instruments with related unrealized gains or losses recognized in earnings in each period is fundamental to the trusts financial statements in accordance with gaap fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie the exit price in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date in determining fair value the trust uses various valuation approaches in accordance with gaap a fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the trust unobservable inputs reflect the trusts assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances the fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels a level   valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the trust has the ability to access valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to level  securities since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market valuation of these securities does not entail a significant degree of judgment b level   valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly and c level   valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement see the notes within the financial statements for further information the funds and the trust record their derivative activities at fair value gains and losses from derivative contracts are included in the statement of operations derivative contracts include futures contracts related to commodity prices futures which are listed on a national securities exchange such as the cbot or the new york mercantile exchange nymex or reported on another national market are generally categorized in level  of the fair value hierarchy otc derivatives contracts such as forward and swap contracts which may be valued using models depending on whether significant inputs are observable or unobservable are categorized in levels  or  of the fair value hierarchy  brokerage commissions on all open commodity futures contracts are accrued on a fullturn basis  margin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the traders broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts a margin deposit acts to assure the traders performance of the futures contracts purchased or sold futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract because of such low margin requirements price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that in relation to the amount invested are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation as discussed below adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin in addition the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract brokerage firms such as the funds clearing brokers carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts generally require higher amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves overthecounter trading generally involves the extension of credit between counterparties so the counterparties may agree to require the posting of collateral by one or both parties to address credit exposure when a trader purchases an option there is no margin requirement however the option premium must be paid in full when a trader sells an option on the other hand he or she is required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and in addition an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option the margin requirements imposed on the selling of options although adjusted to reflect the probability that outofthemoney options will not be exercised can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest ongoing or maintenance margin requirements are computed each day by a traders clearing broker when the market value of a particular open futures contract changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements a margin call is made by the broker if the margin call is not met within a reasonable time the broker may close out the traders position with respect to the funds trading the funds and not its shareholders personally are subject to margin calls finally many major us exchanges have passed certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would in the case of some accounts be aggregated and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis measuring the total risk of the combined positions  due fromto broker for investments in securities are securities transactions pending settlement the trust and tags are subject to credit risk to the extent any broker with whom it conducts business is unable to fulfill contractual obligations on its behalf the management of the trust and the funds monitors the financial condition of such brokers and does not anticipate any losses from these counterparties since the inception of the fund the principal broker through which the trust and tags clear securities transactions for tags is the bank of new york mellon capital markets  the investment objective of tags is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the net asset value nav of its common units shares reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average the underlying fund average of the navs per share of four other commodity pools that are series of the trust and are sponsored by the sponsor the teucrium corn fund the teucrium wheat fund the teucrium soybean fund and the teucrium sugar fund collectively the underlying funds the underlying fund average will have a weighting of  to each underlying fund and the funds assets will be rebalanced generally on a daily basis to maintain the approximate  allocation to each underlying fund as such tags will buy sell and hold as part of its normal operations shares of the four underlying funds the trust excludes the shares of the other series of the trust owned by the teucrium agricultural fund from its statements of assets and liabilities the trust excludes the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on securities owned by the teucrium agricultural fund from its statements of operations upon the sale of the underlying funds by the teucrium agricultural fund the trust includes any realized gain or loss in its statements of changes in net assets  for tax purposes the funds will be treated as partnerships therefore the funds do not record a provision for income taxes because the partners report their share of a funds income or loss on their income tax returns the financial statements reflect the funds transactions without adjustment if any required for income tax purposes results of operations the following includes a section for each fund of the trust for the periods in which each fund was in operation the discussion below addresses the material changes in the results of operations for the year ended december   compared to the years ended december   and  in addition the discussion addresses the three months ended december   compared to the three month periods for  and  as appropriate corn nags crud soyb weat and cane operated for the entirety of  and  corn operated for all of  nags and crud operated for eleven months of  soyb cane and weat did not commence operations until midseptember  and tags did not commence operations until march   for the period january   to december   the funds in total recorded a decrease in expenses over what had been recorded in  there was a decrease in expenses of approximately  or  in  compared to  because of this with the exception of corn all funds experienced lower total expense ratios than they had incurred in  these lower total expense ratios were the result of the several factors including  sponsor efforts to reduce the overall costs of operating the funds  a voluntary capping of expenses and management fees at  of total net assets for crud and cane and  for tags and  higher average total net assets for soyb and weat as compared to the previous year the total expense ratio for nags was  in  as it had been in  consistent with the k that was filed on july   which voluntarily capped the total expenses at  of total net assets the increase in the total expense

stage entity as planned principal operations related to the funds have commenced   principles of consolidation   the consolidated financial statements include the company and the trust all material intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in the consolidation  the consolidated financial statements of the company also include the noncontrolling interests of the unit holders in the funds   noncontrolling interests   the consolidated financial statements of the company include the noncontrolling interests of the unit holders in the funds  net income and loss is allocated between the company and the noncontrolling interests based on their respective relative ownership interest in the funds      reclassifications   certain amounts in prior periods have been reclassified to conform to current period presentation   revenue recognition   commodity futures contracts are recorded on the trade date all such transactions are recorded on the identified cost basis and marked to market daily unrealized appreciation or depreciation on commodity futures contracts are reflected in the statements of operations as the difference between the original contract amount and the fair market value as of the last business day of the year or as of the last date of the financial statements changes in the appreciation or depreciation between periods are reflected in the statements of operations interest on cash equivalents and deposits with the futures commission merchant are recognized on the accrual basis the funds earn interest on its assets denominated in us dollars on deposit

soyb  shares representing  baskets cane  shares representing  baskets weat  shares representing  baskets tags  shares representing  baskets at minimum level as of december     use of estimates   the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ from those estimates   income taxes   in accordance with financial accounting standards board “fasb” accounting standards codification “asc” topic  “accounting for uncertainty in income taxes” the company is required to determine whether a tax position is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes based on the technical merits of the position  the company files income tax returns in the us federal jurisdiction and may file income tax returns in various us states and foreign jurisdictions  the company is subject to income tax examinations by major taxing authorities for all tax years since inception the tax benefit recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that has a greater than fifty percent likelihood of being realized upon ultimate settlement  derecognition of a tax benefit previously recognized    results in the funds recording a tax liability that reduces net assets   based on their analysis the company has determined that they have not incurred any liability for unrecognized tax benefits as of december   and december    however the company’s conclusions regarding this policy may be subject to review and adjustment at a later date based on factors including but not limited to ongoing analysis of and changes to tax laws regulations and interpretations thereof     the company recognizes interest accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income tax fees payable if assessed  no interest expense or penalties have been recognized as of and for the years ended december   and december     the company may be subject to potential examination by us federal us state or foreign jurisdictional authorities in the area of income taxes these potential examinations may include questioning the timing and amount of deductions the nexus of income among various tax jurisdictions and compliance with us federal us state and foreign tax laws  the company’s management does not expect that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will materially change over the next twelve months   offering costs   the company expenses all initial offering costs associated with the registration of the funds costs include but are not limited to legal fees pertaining to the funds’ units offered for sale sec and state registration fees initial fees paid to be listed on an exchange underwriting and other similar costs the initial offering and organization costs incurred to start the funds will be borne by the company and not be charged to the funds  approximately  of accrued legal expenses related to the funds’ initial offerings costs were included in the accrued expenses on the consolidated statements of financial condition as of december   there were no accrued legal expenses related to the initial offering costs on the consolidated statements of financial condition as of december     cash equivalents   cash equivalents are highlyliquid investments with original maturity dates of three months or less at inception  the company reports its cash equivalents in the statements of assets and liabilities at market value or at carrying amounts that approximate fair value because of their highlyliquid nature and shortterm maturities the company has a substantial portion of its assets on deposit with banks assets deposited with the bank may at times exceed federally insured limits  the company had a balance of  and  in money market funds at december   and december   respectively these balances are included in cash and cash equivalents on the statements of assets and liabilities  the company also had investments in united states treasury bills with a maturity of three months or less with a fair value of  and  respectively on both december   and december     collateral due fromto broker   margin is the minimum amount of funds that must be deposited by a commodity interest trader with the trader’s broker to initiate and maintain an open position in futures contracts a margin deposit acts to assure the trader’s performance of the futures contracts purchased or sold futures contracts are customarily bought and sold on initial margin that represents a very small percentage of the aggregate purchase or sales price of the contract because of such low margin requirements price fluctuations occurring in the futures markets may create profits and losses that in relation to the amount invested are greater than are customary in other forms of investment or speculation as discussed below adverse price changes in the futures contract may result in margin requirements that greatly exceed the initial margin in addition the amount of margin required in connection with a particular futures contract is set from time to time by the exchange on which the contract is traded and may be modified from time to time by the exchange during the term of the contract brokerage firms such as the funds’ clearing brokers carrying accounts for traders in commodity interest contracts generally require higher amounts of margin as a matter of policy to further protect themselves overthecounter trading generally involves the extension of credit between counterparties so the counterparties may agree to require the posting of collateral by one or both parties to address credit exposure   when a trader purchases an option there is no margin requirement however the option premium must be paid in full when a trader sells an option on the other hand he or she is required to deposit margin in an amount determined by the margin requirements established for the underlying interest and in addition an amount substantially equal to the current premium for the option the margin requirements imposed on the selling of options although adjusted to reflect the probability that outofthemoney options will not be exercised can in fact be higher than those imposed in dealing in the futures markets directly complicated margin requirements apply to spreads and conversions which are complex trading strategies in which a trader acquires a mixture of options positions and positions in the underlying interest   ongoing or “maintenance” margin requirements are computed each day by a trader’s clearing broker when the market value of a particular open futures contract changes to a point where the margin on deposit does not satisfy maintenance margin requirements a margin call is made by the broker if the margin call is not met within a reasonable time the broker may close out the trader’s position with respect to the funds’ trading the funds and not its shareholders personally are subject to margin calls      finally many major us exchanges have passed certain cross margining arrangements involving procedures pursuant to which the futures and options positions held in an account would in the case of some accounts be aggregated and margin requirements would be assessed on a portfolio basis measuring the total risk of the combined positions   due fromto broker for securities transactions   due fromto broker for investments in securities are securities transactions pending settlement the company the trust and tags are subject to credit risk to the extent any broker with whom it conducts business is unable to fulfill contractual obligations on its behalf the management of the company the trust and the funds monitors the financial condition of such brokers and does not anticipate any losses from these counterparties since the inception of tags the principal broker through which the company the trust and tags clear securities transactions for tags is the bank of new york mellon capital markets   shares of the underlying funds held by the teucrium agricultural fund tags   the investment objective of tags is to have the daily changes in percentage terms of the net asset value “nav” of its common units “shares” reflect the daily changes in percentage terms of a weighted average the “underlying fund average” of the navs per share of four other commodity pools that are series of the trust and are sponsored by the sponsor the teucrium corn fund the teucrium wheat fund the teucrium soybean fund and the teucrium sugar fund collectively the “underlying funds” the underlying fund average will have a weighting of  to each underlying fund and the fund’s assets will be rebalanced generally on a daily basis to maintain the approximate  allocation to each underlying fund   as such tags will buy sell and hold as part of its normal operations shares of the four underlying funds the company and the trust exclude the shares of the other series of the trust owned by the teucrium agricultural fund from its statements of assets and liabilities the company and the trust exclude the net change in unrealized appreciation or depreciation on securities owned by the teucrium agricultural fund from its statements of operations upon the sale of the underlying funds by the teucrium agricultural fund the company and the trust include any realized gain or loss in its statements of changes in net assets     fair value  definition and hierarchy   in accordance with us gaap fair value is defined as the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability ie the “exit price” in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date   in determining fair value the company uses various valuation approaches  in accordance with us gaap a fair value hierarchy for inputs is used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available  observable inputs are those that market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company  unobservable inputs reflect the company’s assumptions about the inputs market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability developed based on the best information available in the circumstances  the fair value hierarchy is categorized into three levels based on the inputs as follows   level   valuations based on unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the company has the ability to access  valuation adjustments and block discounts are not applied to level  securities  since valuations are based on quoted prices that are readily and regularly available in an active market valuation of these securities does not entail a significant degree of judgment   level   valuations based on quoted prices in markets that are not active or for which all significant inputs are observable either directly or indirectly   level   valuations based on inputs that are unobservable and significant to the overall fair value measurement   the availability of valuation techniques and observable inputs can vary from security to security and is affected by a wide variety of factors including the type of security whether the security is new and not yet established in the marketplace and other characteristics particular to the transaction  to the extent that valuation is based on models or inputs that are less observable or unobservable in the market the determination of fair value requires more judgment those estimated values do not necessarily represent the amounts that may be ultimately realized due to the occurrence of future circumstances that cannot be reasonably determined  because of the inherent uncertainty of valuation those estimated values may be materially higher or lower than the values that would have been used had a ready market for the securities existed accordingly the degree of judgment exercised by the fund in determining fair value is greatest for securities categorized in level  in certain cases the inputs used to measure fair value may fall into different levels of the fair value hierarchy in such cases for disclosure purposes the level in the fair value hierarchy within which the fair value measurement in its entirety falls is determined based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair value measurement   fair value is a marketbased measure considered from the perspective of a market participant rather than an entityspecific measure  therefore even when market assumptions are not readily available the company’s own assumptions are set to reflect those that    market participants would use in pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date  the company uses prices and inputs that are current as of the measurement date including periods of market dislocation  in periods of market dislocation the observability of prices and inputs may be reduced for many securities  this condition could cause a security to be reclassified to a lower level within the fair value hierarchy for instance when corn futures contracts on the chicago board of trade “cbot” are not actively trading due to a “limitup” or ‘limitdown” condition meaning that the change in the corn futures contracts has exceeded the limits established the company and the fund will revert to alternative verifiable sources of valuation of its assets  when such a situation exists on a quarter close the sponsor will calculate the nav on a particular day using the level  valuation but will later recalculate the nav for the impacted fund based upon the valuation inputs from these alternative verifiable sources level  or level  and will report such nav in its applicable financial statements and reports   on december   and december   in the opinion of the company the reported value at the close of the market for each commodity contract fairly reflected the value of the futures and no alternative valuations were required   the funds the trust and the company record their derivative activities at fair value gains and losses from derivative contracts are included in the statements of operations  derivative contracts include futures contracts related to commodity prices futures which are listed on a national securities exchange such as the cbot or the new york mercantile exchange “nymex” or reported on another national market are generally categorized in level  of the fair value hierarchy  otc derivatives contracts such as forward and swap contracts which may be valued using models depending on whether significant inputs are observable or unobservable are categorized in levels  or  of the fair value hierarchy   investments in the securities of the underlying funds are freely tradable and listed on the nyse arca these investments are valued at the nav of the underlying fund as of the valuation date as calculated by the administrator based on the exchangequoted prices of the commodity futures contracts held by the underlying fund   new accounting pronouncements   in december  the fasb issued asu no  “balance sheet topic  amendments of the fasb accounting standards codification and disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities in us gaap and ifrs” asu no  clarifies existing requirements for balance sheet offsetting and for disclosures about the offsetting and related arrangements to enable users of its financial statements to understand the effect of those arrangements on its financial position in converged guidance of the fasb and the international accounting standards board the amendments are to be applied retrospectively for all comparative periods presented for public entities the amendments are effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after january   we anticipate that the adoption will not have a significant impact on the financial statement disclosures for the company the trust or the funds   liquidity   at december   the company has cash and cash equivalents of  exclusive of those of the trust and a receivable for the december  management fee from the trust which was received in january  the company also has  of short term debt which matures on august   management of the company believes that its cash resources at december   in addition to the anticipated cash to be provided by the current operations and management of the trust will be sufficient to meet its current obligations and fund its operations to at least january   the company is in full compliance with the terms of its short term debt agreement up to and including the year ended december   see note    note  – fair value measurements   the company’s assets and liabilities recorded at fair value have been categorized based upon a fair value hierarchy as

investment  the funds’ derivative activities and exposure to derivative contracts are classified by the following primary underlying risks interest rate credit commodity price and equity price risks  in addition to its primary underlying risks the funds are also subject to additional counterparty risk due to inability of  its counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts  for the years ended december   and  and from the commencement of operations june   through december   the funds invested in commodity futures contracts and cleared swaps cleared swaps have standardized terms similar to and are priced by reference to a corresponding benchmark component futures contract  additionally other commodity interests that do not have standardized terms and are not exchangetraded referred to as “overthecounter” interests can generally be structured as the parties to the commodity interest contract desire  therefore each fund might enter into multiple cleared swaps andor overthecounter interests intended to exactly replicate the performance of each of the benchmark component futures contracts for the fund or a single overthecounter interest designed to replicate the performance of the benchmark as a whole assuming that there is no default by a counterparty to an overthecounter interest the performance of the interest will necessarily correlate exactly with the performance of the benchmark or the applicable benchmark component futures contract     futures contracts               the funds are subject to commodity price risk in the normal course of pursuing their investment objectives a futures contract represents a commitment for the future purchase or sale of an asset at a specified price on a specified date   the purchase and sale of futures contracts requires margin deposits with a futures commission merchant “fcm”  subsequent payments variation margin are made or received by each fund each day depending on the daily fluctuations in the value of the contract and are recorded as unrealized gains or losses by each fund  futures contracts may reduce the funds’ exposure to counterparty risk since futures contracts are exchangetraded and the exchange’s clearinghouse as the counterparty to all exchangetraded futures guarantees the futures against default   the commodity exchange act requires an fcm to segregate all customer transactions and assets from the fcm’s proprietary activities  a customer’s cash and other equity deposited with an fcm are considered commingled with all other customer funds subject to the fcm’s segregation requirements  in the event of an fcm’s insolvency recovery may be limited to each fund’s pro rata share of segregated customer funds available  it is possible that the recovery amount could be less than the total of cash and other equity deposited   the following tables identify the fair value amounts of derivative instruments included in the statements of assets and liabilities as derivative contracts
