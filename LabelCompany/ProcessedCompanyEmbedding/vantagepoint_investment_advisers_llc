investment advisers llc via has announced investment strategy changes to the vantagepoint milestone funds by nevin e adams jd editorsstrategicicom  march   according to a press release beginning in  each dated milestone fund extended its “glide path” ie the path the fund’s asset allocation follows over time for  years past the year in the fund’s name for example milestone  now reaches its “landing point” ie the point at which its asset allocation becomes constant in  as a result of this change the funds’ portfolios have been reallocated and the asset allocations will now age more slowly over time according to the announcement      when a milestone fund reaches its landing point –  years after the date in its name – it has a lower percentage of its assets in underlying equity and fixed income funds and a higher percentage in a multistrategy fund than would have been the case prior to these changes the milestone retirement income fund revised its portfolio allocation in january  and does not change its portfolio over time according to the firmthe milestone funds are targetdate funds that invest in underlying vantagepoint funds as “funds of funds” and the dated funds are offered in fiveyear intervals beginning with the milestone  fund     all vantagepoint funds invested through icmarc  or  plans are held through vantagetrust“most retirees need to protect themselves against inflation as well as preserve their capital through long retirement periods” said wayne wicker senior vice president and chief investment officer of icmarc “the glide path of the dated milestone funds was developed not only to retirement but into retirement for an additional  years and may help protect against inflation as well as preserve capital” icmarc is an independent
