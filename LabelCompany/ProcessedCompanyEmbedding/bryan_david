permanent link  july   enough to buy back the product david henderson print email clear highlights share is russias government hostile murder a socratic dialogue home  econlog  archives  permanent link and comments i was on an email discussion this morning with some freemarket economists and some economically literate fans of free markets one of them surprised me with this statement i always tell my students the henry ford  a day story in  a great example of management looking out for labor and a win win formula for success it stopped marxisms two big arguments that capitalists exploit workers and that capitalism alienates workers forcing them to produce products they cant afford themselves but when ford overnight raised workers pay to  a day it was the first big example of sharing the profits  and ford workers could buy model ts for the first time thus destroying the marxist argument of alienation theres nothing necessarily incorrect in his actual statement above but there is something misleading it may well be the case that ford workers could buy model ts for the first time because of the increased wages but he makes it sound as if that was henry fords motive thats unlikely to have been fords motive because the number of ford workers was probably well under  of the number of potential buyers would it really make sense to pay more than necessary to get workers so that your number of potential buyers can increase slightly especially when the downside is that with the higher wages come higher costs and your larger potential market is likely to shrink i think it was a fortunate accident that fords workers were able to buy fords the reason ive read for fords success is that ford was plagued with high turnover and high absenteeism and paying above market reduced turnover and absenteeism substantially one can imagine this being particularly important in a relatively new industry and certainly an industry with a relatively new production methodthe assembly linebecause there was probably a bigger gain than normal from keeping people on the job who gradually got very good at it if you still think the pay them more so they can buy the product argument makes sense then consider what henry hazlitt wrote on this issue in his  classic economics in one lesson some sponsors of the theory seem to imply that the workers in each industry should receive enough to buy back the particular product they make but they surely cannot mean that the makers of cheap dresses should get enough to buy back cheap dresses and the makers of mink coats enough to buy back mink coats or that the men in the ford plant should receive enough to buy fords and the men in the cadillac plant enough to buy cadillacs so a question for the person i quoted above based on hazlitts quote is this were cadillac workers more alienated than ford workers a few years ago i used hazlitt as a supplement to my main text and we covered this chapter remember that my students are largely military officers and disproportionately naval officers one us navy student had a great example to make hazlitts point he pointed out its not a good idea to pay workers making aircraft carriers high enough wages that each of them could buy an aircraft carrier heres an earlier discussion of the issue comments and sharing categories business economics  labor market email comments  to date latest comment michael makovi writes also the buy back the product argument is literally incoherent wages enough to buy the product over what time period should a person who makes a car be paid enough to buy a new car every year every day every century in fact everyone is paid enough to buy the product if you just assume a sufficiently long time horizon every worker who contributes to building an aircraft carrier is paid enough to buy an aircraft carrier if he just works long enough which may be a thousand years but whos counting not the socialists they literally dont consider this issue as far as i know posted july    pm garrett writes boeing workers should make enough to buy airliners posted july    pm fralupo writes michael makovi i think youre not considering consumer behavior consumers have their own preferences and these change with income a person earning half your wage isnt going to match your consumption habits just at half the speed even if they were your clone intuitively someone living paychecktopaycheck may not be willing to wipe out their savings in exchange for a machine that adds costs to their lives and has a declining resale value in terms used in economics a people earning low wages usually have higher discount rates than people earning high wages and so purchases of expensive durable goods will seem more attractive to people as their wages rise b going back to first year economics a consumers indifference curve for automobiles may intersect with their budget constraint at q and this is less likely the more income someone has posted july    pm hunter writes the ford example is one that drives me crazy as dr henderson noted the wage increase was to retain experienced workers this helped keep the prices low enough that the workers who didnt work for ford were able to buy the product posted july    pm michael makovi writes fralupo i think adding consumer preferences just makes socialism even worse for example some socialists will advocate worker control of the firm the problem is many workers dont want to control the firm theyd prefer to make certain guaranteed wages rather than uncertain varying profits and losses whether the firm makes a profit or a loss this firm theyd rather just receive their salary and as many professors can attest having to serve on a governing committee can be awfully bothersome many workers would probably prefer to avoid the burden of having to help run the company so i think theres a general problem with socialism viz that many consumers dont want what socialists think they ought to want posted july    pm john hare writes fralupo a people earning low wages usually have higher discount rates than people earning high wages and so purchases of expensive durable goods will seem more attractive to people as their wages rise i would argue that low wage people should do as you say an unfortunate number of them live paycheck to paycheck due to poor choices rent to own big screen tv instead of cash for a smaller or used unit for example in my case i bought a silverado back when making  an hour stupid and still embarrassing if i think about it  posted july    pm mr econotarian writes we should keep in mind that the ford assembly line was very different from traditional handcrafted carriage manufacture he needed workers who were very ontheball because a small screwup could stop the line and it is likely that assembly line work though more efficient was probably very boring to do one small task hundreds of times per day compared with doing a wider range of handcrafting at a more relaxed pace ford also had a kind of secret service who investigated the moral character of his employees he paid a lot but he expected a lot as well i believe ford did sell is  day as some kind of benificence to his employees but it was only the improved productivity of the assembly line that could allow it and the stringent requirements of the assembly line also demanded it to bring in the best workers posted july    pm paul zrimsek writes my favorite argument against the pay them more so they can buy the product version is even in the bestcase scenario where every penny of the wage increase goes towards a model t all ford has done is find an indirect method of giving away cars posted july    pm matt writes tim worstall had a bit of fun with this a few years back car production in the year before the pay rise was  in the year of it  as we can see above the total labour establishment was only  anyway even if all of his workers bought a car every year it wasnt going to make any but a marginal difference to the sales of the firm we can go further too as weve seen the rise in the daily wage was from  to  including the bonuses etc say  working days in the year and  workers and we get a rise in the pay bill of   million over the year a model t cost between  and  depends on which year were talking about  cars sold at that price gives us   million to   million in income to the company it should be obvious that paying the workforce an extra  million so that they can then buy  millions worth of company production just isnt a way to increase your profits its a great way to increase your losses though posted july    pm jon murphy writes if the goal is to pay workers enough to buy back the product and many minimum wage workers work in fast food or other food service jobs where the products are often  or just a little more wouldnt that necessarily imply reducing the minimum wage posted july    pm khodge writes itd be cool to own my own aircraft carrier and it would flesh out the resume quite nicely but i was unable to run a flower shop so i think ill pass posted july    am pkn writes uneducated as he was henry ford understood production with a turnover rate approaching  in his work force the slowdown on the assembly line as they trained new workers was very costly hence the  wage it ended turnover and production increased accordingly and profits increased posted july    am michael writes might it have had a psychological impact cars unlike airliners were a new product that ford workers could surely see a use for in their own lives getting paid enough to actually being able to afford to buy one might improve workers job satisfaction posted july    am hasdrubal writes jon murphy if the goal is to pay workers enough to buy back the product and many minimum wage workers work in fast food or other food service jobs where the products are often  or just a little more wouldnt that necessarily imply reducing the minimum wage the funny thing is  minimum wage proponents suddenly remember the actual reason why ford raised wages when talking about low wage jobs and assume it was the wage not the worker the wage was attracting that led to the improvements its one of those great stories it can mean anything you want it to depending on how you tell it posted july    am jon murphy writes hasdrubal agreed although there is an aspect of the argument minimum wage proponents who try to tout the minimum wage as an efficiency wage miss the efficiency wage increases productivity by increasing unemployment an efficiency wage is not much more than a selfimposed price floor whose job is to limit workers shirking on the job the idea is if a firm pays abovemarket wages then a worker will work harder for fear of losing his job and being forced to take less pay somewhere else if all firms pay this efficiency wage a worker will work harder because there is now unemployment in the labor market there are others who are willing and able to take his job so when minimum wage proponents make the efficiency wage argument they are implicitly allowing indeed calling for unemployment to increase posted july    am mike davis writes nothing like hijacking one of david’s posts for a short rant… the “pay them enough to buy what they make” is an obviously silly argument but our econ  answer “pay them their marginal revenue product” isnt helpfulit doesnt do much to explain fords wages and leaves students vulnerable to bogus stories like this as an opening sentence in a long novel on labor markets “wmrp” is only slightly better than “it was a dark and stormy night” maybe it’s true maybe it’s not but it’s boring and misses all the color passion and drama that are part of the story of real labor markets things like efficiency wages various types of human capital signaling and the non pecuniary aspects of work matter much more than the first derivative of a profit function with labor as an independent variable there’s nothing wrong with teaching simple optimization these are useful life skills that every freshman or mba student should have but when teaching labor don’t leave out the sex and violence parts of the novel just because it’s hard to think up good multiple choice questions …rant concluded btw not accusing david of ignoring this stuff in his teaching and writing posted july    pm post a comment read
