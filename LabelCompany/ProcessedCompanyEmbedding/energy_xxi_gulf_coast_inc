note regarding hydrocarbon quantities   this press release includes nsaiprepared estimates for proved and probable reserves and aggregated proved and probable reserves as of march   with each category of reserves estimated in accordance with sec guidelines and definitions the sec permits the optional disclosure of probable reserves the sec defines “probable” reserves as “those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which together with proved reserves are as likely as not to be recovered” egc has included the nsai estimate of proved probable and aggregated proved and probable reserves in this release because management believes it is useful information that is widely used by the investment community in the valuation comparison and analysis of companies  however the company notes that the sec prohibits companies from aggregating proved and probable reserves in filings with the sec due to the different levels of certainty associated with each reserve category   actual quantities that may be ultimately recovered from egc’s interests may differ substantially from the nsai estimates included in this press release factors affecting ultimate recovery include the scope of egc’s ongoing drilling program which will be directly affected by commodity prices the availability of capital regulatory approvals drilling and production costs availability of drilling services and equipment drilling results lease expirations transportation constraints and other factors actual drilling results including geological and mechanical factors affecting recovery rates and budgets based upon our future evaluation of risk returns and the availability of capital with respect to commodity prices there can be no assurance that actual oil and gas

deductions future net revenue is after deductions for energy xxis share of production taxes capital costs abandonment costs and operating expenses but before consideration of any income taxes the future net revenue has been discounted at an annual rate of  percent to determine its present worth which is shown to indicate the effect of time on the value of money future net revenue presented in this report whether discounted or undiscounted should not be construed as being the fair market value of the properties   prices used in this report are based on the month unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month in the period april  through march  for oil and ngl volumes the average west texas intermediate posted price of  per barrel is adjusted by field for quality transportation fees and market differentials for gas volumes the average henry hub spot price of  per mmbtu is adjusted by field for energy content transportation fees and market differentials all prices are held constant throughout the lives of the properties for the proved reserves the average adjusted product prices weighted by production over the remaining lives of the properties are  per barrel of oil  per barrel of ngl and  per mcf of gas   operating costs used in this report are based on operating expense records of energy xxi for the nonoperated properties these costs include the perwell overhead expenses allowed under joint operating agreements along with estimates of costs to be incurred at and below the district and field levels as requested operating costs for the operated properties include only direct lease and fieldlevel costs operating costs have been divided into fieldlevel costs perwell costs and perunitofproduction costs for all properties headquarters general and administrative overhead expenses of energy xxi are not included operating costs are not escalated for inflation   capital costs used in this report were provided by energy xxi and are based on authorizations for expenditure and actual costs from recent activity capital costs are included as required for workovers new development wells and production equipment based on our understanding of future development plans a review of the records provided to us and our knowledge of similar properties we regard these estimated capital costs to be reasonable abandonment costs used in this report are energy xxis estimates of the costs to abandon the wells platforms and production facilities net of any salvage value capital costs and abandonment costs are not escalated for inflation   for the purposes of this report we did not perform any field inspection of the properties nor did we examine the mechanical operation or condition of the wells and facilities we have not investigated possible environmental liability related to the properties therefore our estimates do not include any costs due to such possible liability   we have made no investigation of potential volume and value imbalances resulting from overdelivery or underdelivery to the energy xxi interest therefore our estimates of reserves and future revenue do not include adjustments for the settlement of any such imbalances our projections are based on energy xxi receiving its net revenue interest share of estimated future gross production additionally we have made no investigation of any firm transportation contracts that may be in place for these properties no adjustments have been made to our estimates of future revenue to account for such contracts   the reserves shown in this report are estimates only and should not be construed as exact quantities proved reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of engineering and geoscience data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible probable and possible reserves are those additional reserves which are sequentially less certain to be recovered than proved reserves estimates of reserves may increase or decrease as a result of market conditions future operations changes in regulations or actual reservoir performance in addition to the primary economic assumptions discussed herein our estimates are based on certain assumptions including but not limited to that the properties will be developed consistent with current development plans as provided to us by energy xxi that the properties will be operated in a prudent manner that no governmental regulations or controls will be put in place that would impact the ability of the interest owner to recover the reserves and that our projections of future production will prove consistent with actual performance if the reserves are recovered the revenues therefrom and the costs related thereto could be more or less than the estimated amounts because of governmental policies and uncertainties of supply and demand the sales rates prices received for the reserves and costs incurred in recovering such reserves may vary

disclosure interpretations    acquisition of properties costs incurred to purchase lease or otherwise acquire a property including costs of lease bonuses and options to purchase or lease properties the portion of costs applicable to minerals when land including mineral rights is purchased in fee brokers fees recording fees legal costs and other costs incurred in acquiring properties    analogous reservoir  analogous reservoirs as used in resources assessments have similar rock and fluid properties reservoir conditions depth temperature and pressure and drive mechanisms but are typically at a more advanced stage of development than the reservoir of interest and thus may provide concepts to assist in the interpretation of more limited data and estimation of recovery when used to support proved reserves an analogous reservoir refers to a reservoir that shares the following characteristics with the reservoir of interest   i same geological formation but not necessarily in pressure communication with the reservoir of interest ii same environment of deposition iii similar geological structure and iv same drive mechanism   instruction to paragraph a  reservoir properties must in the aggregate be no more favorable in the analog than in the reservoir of interest    bitumen  bitumen sometimes referred to as natural bitumen is petroleum in a solid or semisolid state in natural deposits with a viscosity greater than  centipoise measured at original temperature in the deposit and atmospheric pressure on a gas free basis in its natural state it usually contains sulfur metals and other nonhydrocarbons    condensate  condensate is a mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in the gaseous phase at original reservoir temperature and pressure but that when produced is in the liquid phase at surface pressure and temperature    deterministic estimate  the method of estimating reserves or resources is called deterministic when a single value for each parameter from the geoscience engineering or economic data in the reserves calculation is used in the reserves estimation procedure    developed oil and gas reserves  developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered   i through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and ii through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well   supplemental definitions from the  petroleum resources management system   developed producing reserves – developed producing reserves are expected to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the time of the estimate improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation   developed nonproducing reserves – developed nonproducing reserves include shutin and behindpipe reserves shutin reserves are expected to be recovered from  completion intervals which are open at the time of the estimate but which have not yet started producing  wells which were shutin for market conditions or pipeline connections or  wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons behindpipe reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells which will require additional completion work or future recompletion prior to start of production in all cases production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well     development costs costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide facilities for extracting treating gathering and storing the oil and gas more specifically development costs including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of development activities are costs incurred to         i gain access to and prepare well locations for drilling including surveying well locations for the purpose of determining specific development drilling sites clearing ground draining road building and relocating public roads gas lines and power lines to the extent necessary in developing the proved reserves ii drill and equip development wells developmenttype stratigraphic test wells and service wells including the costs of platforms and of well equipment such as casing tubing pumping equipment and the wellhead assembly iii acquire construct and install production facilities such as lease flow lines separators treaters heaters manifolds measuring devices and production storage tanks natural gas cycling and processing plants and central utility and waste disposal systems iv provide improved recovery systems    development project  a development project is the means by which petroleum resources are brought to the status of economically producible as examples the development of a single reservoir or field an incremental development in a producing field or the integrated development of a group of several fields and associated facilities with a common ownership may constitute a development project    development well  a well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive    economically producible  the term economically producible as it relates to a resource means a resource which generates revenue that exceeds or is reasonably expected to exceed the costs of the operation the value of the products that generate revenue shall be determined at the terminal point of oil and gas producing activities as defined in paragraph a of this section    estimated ultimate recovery eur  estimated ultimate recovery is the sum of reserves remaining as of a given date and cumulative production as of that date    exploration costs  costs incurred in identifying areas that may warrant examination and in examining specific areas that are considered to have prospects of containing oil and gas reserves including costs of drilling exploratory wells and exploratorytype stratigraphic test wells exploration costs may be incurred both before acquiring the related property sometimes referred to in part as prospecting costs and after acquiring the property principal types of exploration costs which include depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of exploration activities are   i costs of topographical geographical and geophysical studies rights of access to properties to conduct those studies and salaries and other expenses of geologists geophysical crews and others conducting those studies collectively these are sometimes referred to as geological and geophysical or gg costs ii costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties such as delay rentals ad valorem taxes on properties legal costs for title defense and the maintenance of land and lease records iii dry hole contributions and bottom hole contributions iv costs of drilling and equipping exploratory wells v costs of drilling exploratorytype stratigraphic test wells    exploratory well  an exploratory well is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir generally an exploratory well is any well that is not a development well an extension well a service well or a stratigraphic test well as those items are defined in this section    extension well  an extension well is a well drilled to extend the limits of a known reservoir    field  an area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature andor stratigraphic condition there may be two or more reservoirs in a field which are separated vertically by intervening impervious strata or laterally by local geologic barriers or by both reservoirs that are associated by being in overlapping or adjacent fields may be treated as a single or common operational field the geological terms structural feature and stratigraphic condition are intended to identify localized geological features as opposed to the broader terms of basins trends provinces plays areasofinterest etc          oil and gas producing activities   i oil and gas producing activities include   a the search for crude oil including condensate and natural gas liquids or natural gas oil and gas in their natural states and original locations b the acquisition of property rights or properties for the purpose of further exploration or for the purpose of removing the oil or gas from such properties c the construction drilling and production activities necessary to retrieve oil and gas from their natural reservoirs including the acquisition construction installation and maintenance of field gathering and storage systems such as  lifting the oil and gas to the surface and  gathering treating and field processing as in the case of processing gas to extract liquid hydrocarbons and d extraction of saleable hydrocarbons in the solid liquid or gaseous state from oil sands shale coalbeds or other nonrenewable natural resources which are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas and activities undertaken with a view to such extraction   instruction  to paragraph ai  the oil and gas production function shall be regarded as ending at a terminal point which is the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank if unusual physical or operational circumstances exist it may be appropriate to regard the terminal point for the production function as   a the first point at which oil gas or gas liquids natural or synthetic are delivered to a main pipeline a common carrier a refinery or a marine terminal and b in the case of natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas if those natural resources are delivered to a purchaser prior to upgrading the first point at which the natural resources are delivered to a main pipeline a common carrier a refinery a marine terminal or a facility which upgrades such natural resources into synthetic oil or gas   instruction  to paragraph ai for purposes of this paragraph a the term saleable hydrocarbons means hydrocarbons that are saleable in the state in which the hydrocarbons are delivered   ii oil and gas producing activities do not include   a transporting refining or marketing oil and gas b processing of produced oil gas or natural resources that can be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas by a registrant that does not have the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in such production c activities relating to the production of natural resources other than oil gas or natural resources from which synthetic oil and gas can be extracted or d production of geothermal steam    possible reserves possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves   i when deterministic methods are used the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves when probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a  probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates ii possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively less certain frequently this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project         iii possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves iv the proved plus probable and proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates must be based on reasonable alternative technical and commercial interpretations within the reservoir or subject project that are clearly documented including comparisons to results in successful similar projects v possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other geological discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication with the known proved reservoir possible reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir vi pursuant to paragraph aiii of this section where direct observation has defined a highest known oil hko elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap proved oil reserves should be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir above the hko only if the higher contact can be established with reasonable certainty through reliable technology portions of the reservoir that do not meet this reasonable certainty criterion may be assigned as probable and possible oil or gas based on reservoir fluid properties and pressure gradient interpretations    probable reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which together with proved reserves are as likely as not to be recovered   i when deterministic methods are used it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves when probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a  probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates ii probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir iii probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves iv see also guidelines in paragraphs aiv and avi of this section    probabilistic estimate the method of estimation of reserves or resources is called probabilistic when the full range of values that could reasonably occur for each unknown parameter from the geoscience and engineering data is used to generate a full range of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities of occurrence    production costs   i costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of operating and maintaining those wells and related equipment and facilities they become part of the cost of oil and gas produced examples of production costs sometimes called lifting costs are   a costs of labor to operate the wells and related equipment and facilities b repairs and maintenance c materials supplies and fuel consumed and supplies utilized in

identified above          proved area the part of a property to which proved reserves have been specifically attributed    proved oil and gas reserves proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time   i the area of the reservoir considered as proved includes   a the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts if any and b adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can with reasonable certainty be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data   ii in the absence of data on fluid contacts proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons lkh as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience engineering or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty iii where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil hko elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty iv reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques including but not limited to fluid injection are included in the proved classification when   a successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more

prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within such period unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements excluding escalations based upon future conditions    proved properties properties with proved reserves    reasonable certainty if deterministic methods are used reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered if probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a  probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate a high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely to be achieved than not and as changes due to increased availability of geoscience geological geophysical and geochemical engineering and economic data are made to estimated ultimate recovery eur with time reasonably certain eur is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease          reliable technology reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies including computational methods that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation    reserves reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and related substances anticipated to be economically producible as of a given date by application of development projects to known accumulations in addition there must exist or there must be a reasonable expectation that there will exist the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market and all permits and financing required to implement the project   note to paragraph a  reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major potentially sealing faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a nonproductive reservoir ie absence of reservoir

formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil andor gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs    resources resources are quantities of oil and gas estimated to exist in naturally occurring accumulations a portion of the resources may be estimated to be recoverable and another portion may be considered to be unrecoverable resources include both discovered and undiscovered accumulations          service well a well drilled or completed for the purpose of supporting production in an existing field specific purposes of service wells include gas injection water injection steam injection air injection saltwater disposal water supply for injection observation or injection for insitu combustion    stratigraphic test well a stratigraphic test well is a drilling effort geologically directed to obtain information pertaining to a specific geologic condition such wells customarily are drilled without the intent of being completed for hydrocarbon production the classification also includes tests identified as core tests and all types of expendable holes related to hydrocarbon exploration stratigraphic tests are classified as exploratory type if not drilled in a known area or development type if drilled in a known area    undeveloped oil and gas reserves undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion   i reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances ii undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time     from the secs compliance and disclosure interpretations october     although several types of projects — such as constructing offshore platforms and development in urban areas remote locations or environmentally sensitive locations — by their nature customarily take a longer time to develop and therefore often do justify longer time periods this determination must always take into consideration all of the facts and circumstances no particular type of project per se justifies a longer time period and any extension beyond five years should be the exception and not the rule   factors that a company should consider in determining whether or not circumstances justify recognizing reserves even though development may extend past five years include but are not limited to the following   ÿ the companys level of ongoing significant development activities in the area to be developed for example drilling only the minimum number of wells necessary to maintain the lease generally would not constitute significant development activities ÿ the companys historical record at completing development of comparable longterm projects ÿ the amount of time in which the company has maintained the leases or booked the reserves without significant development activities ÿ the extent to which the company has followed a previously adopted development plan for example if a company has changed its development plan several times without taking significant steps to implement any of those plans recognizing proved undeveloped reserves typically would not be appropriate and ÿ the extent to which delays in development are caused by external factors related to the physical operating environment for example restrictions on development on federal lands but not obtaining government permits rather than by internal factors for example shifting resources to develop properties with higher priority     iii under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir as defined in paragraph a of this section or by other

the portion of costs applicable to minerals when land including mineral rights is purchased in fee brokers fees recording fees legal costs and other costs incurred in acquiring properties    analogous reservoir  analogous reservoirs as used in resources assessments have similar rock and fluid properties reservoir conditions depth temperature and pressure and drive mechanisms but are typically at a more advanced stage of development than the reservoir of interest and thus may provide concepts to assist in the interpretation of more limited data and estimation of recovery when used to support proved reserves an analogous reservoir refers to a reservoir that shares the following characteristics with the reservoir of interest   i same geological formation but not necessarily in pressure communication with the reservoir of interest ii same environment of deposition iii similar geological structure and iv same drive mechanism   instruction to paragraph a  reservoir properties must in the aggregate be no more favorable in the analog than in the reservoir of interest    bitumen  bitumen sometimes referred to as natural bitumen is petroleum in a solid or semisolid state in natural deposits with a viscosity greater than  centipoise measured at original temperature in the deposit and atmospheric pressure on a gas free basis in its natural state it usually contains sulfur metals and other nonhydrocarbons    condensate  condensate is a mixture of hydrocarbons that exists in the gaseous phase at original reservoir temperature and pressure but that when produced is in the liquid phase at surface pressure and temperature    deterministic estimate  the method of estimating reserves or resources is called deterministic when a single value for each parameter from the geoscience engineering or economic data in the reserves calculation is used in the reserves estimation procedure    developed oil and gas reserves  developed oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that can be expected to be recovered   i through existing wells with existing equipment and operating methods or in which the cost of the required equipment is relatively minor compared to the cost of a new well and ii through installed extraction equipment and infrastructure operational at the time of the reserves estimate if the extraction is by means not involving a well   supplemental definitions from the  petroleum resources management system   developed producing reserves – developed producing reserves are expected to be recovered from completion intervals that are open and producing at the time of the estimate improved recovery reserves are considered producing only after the improved recovery project is in operation   developed nonproducing reserves – developed nonproducing reserves include shutin and behindpipe reserves shutin reserves are expected to be recovered from  completion intervals which are open at the time of the estimate but which have not yet started producing  wells which were shutin for market conditions or pipeline connections or  wells not capable of production for mechanical reasons behindpipe reserves are expected to be recovered from zones in existing wells which will require additional completion work or future recompletion prior to start of production in all cases production can be initiated or restored with relatively low expenditure compared to the cost of drilling a new well    development costs costs incurred to obtain access to proved reserves and to provide facilities for extracting treating gathering and storing the oil and gas more specifically development costs including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of development activities are costs incurred to         i gain access to and prepare well locations for drilling including surveying well locations for the purpose of determining specific development drilling sites clearing ground draining road building and relocating public roads gas lines and power lines to the extent necessary in developing the proved reserves ii drill and equip development wells developmenttype stratigraphic test wells and service wells including the costs of platforms and of well equipment such as casing tubing pumping equipment and the wellhead assembly iii acquire construct and install production facilities such as lease flow lines separators treaters heaters manifolds measuring devices and production storage tanks natural gas cycling and processing plants and central utility and waste disposal systems iv provide improved recovery systems    development project  a development project is the means by which petroleum resources are brought to the status of economically producible as examples the development of a single reservoir or field an incremental development in a producing field or the integrated development of a group of several fields and associated facilities with a common ownership may constitute a development project    development well  a well drilled within the proved area of an oil or gas reservoir to the depth of a stratigraphic horizon known to be productive    economically producible  the term economically producible as it relates to a resource means a resource which generates revenue that exceeds or is reasonably expected to exceed the costs of the operation the value of the products that generate revenue shall be determined at the terminal point of oil and gas producing activities as defined in paragraph a of this section    estimated ultimate recovery eur  estimated ultimate recovery is the sum of reserves remaining as of a given date and cumulative production as of that date    exploration costs  costs incurred in identifying areas that may warrant examination and in examining specific areas that are considered to have prospects of containing oil and gas reserves including costs of drilling exploratory wells and exploratorytype stratigraphic test wells exploration costs may be incurred both before acquiring the related property sometimes referred to in part as prospecting costs and after acquiring the property principal types of exploration costs which include depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of exploration activities are   i costs of topographical geographical and geophysical studies rights of access to properties to conduct those studies and salaries and other expenses of geologists geophysical crews and others conducting those studies collectively these are sometimes referred to as geological and geophysical or gg costs ii costs of carrying and retaining undeveloped properties such as delay rentals ad valorem taxes on properties legal costs for title defense and the maintenance of land and lease records iii dry hole contributions and bottom hole contributions iv costs of drilling and equipping exploratory wells v costs of drilling exploratorytype stratigraphic test wells    exploratory well  an exploratory well is a well drilled to find a new field or to find a new reservoir in a field previously found to be productive of oil or gas in another reservoir generally an exploratory well is any well that is not a development well an extension well a service well or a stratigraphic test well as those items are defined in this section    extension well  an extension well is a well drilled to extend the limits of a known reservoir    field  an area consisting of a single reservoir or multiple reservoirs all grouped on or related to the same individual geological structural feature andor stratigraphic condition there may be two or more reservoirs in a field which are separated vertically by intervening impervious strata or laterally by local geologic barriers or by both reservoirs that are associated by being in overlapping or adjacent fields may be treated as a single or common operational field the geological terms structural feature and stratigraphic condition are intended to identify localized geological features as opposed to the broader terms of basins trends provinces plays areasofinterest etc          oil and gas producing activities   i oil and gas producing activities include   a the search for crude oil including condensate and natural gas liquids or natural gas oil and gas in their natural states and original locations b the acquisition of property rights or properties for the purpose of further exploration or for the purpose of removing the oil or gas from such properties c the construction drilling and production activities necessary to retrieve oil and gas from their natural reservoirs including the acquisition construction installation and maintenance of field gathering and storage systems such as  lifting the oil and gas to the surface and  gathering treating and field processing as in the case of processing gas to extract liquid hydrocarbons and d extraction of saleable hydrocarbons in the solid liquid or gaseous state from oil sands shale coalbeds or other nonrenewable natural resources which are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas and activities undertaken with a view to such extraction   instruction  to paragraph ai  the oil and gas production function shall be regarded as ending at a terminal point which is the outlet valve on the lease or field storage tank if unusual physical or operational circumstances exist it may be appropriate to regard the terminal point for the production function as   a the first point at which oil gas or gas liquids natural or synthetic are delivered to a main pipeline a common carrier a refinery or a marine terminal and b in the case of natural resources that are intended to be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas if those natural resources are delivered to a purchaser prior to upgrading the first point at which the natural resources are delivered to a main pipeline a common carrier a refinery a marine terminal or a facility which upgrades such natural resources into synthetic oil or gas   instruction  to paragraph ai for purposes of this paragraph a the term saleable hydrocarbons means hydrocarbons that are saleable in the state in which the hydrocarbons are delivered   ii oil and gas producing activities do not include   a transporting refining or marketing oil and gas b processing of produced oil gas or natural resources that can be upgraded into synthetic oil or gas by a registrant that does not have the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in such production c activities relating to the production of natural resources other than oil gas or natural resources from which synthetic oil and gas can be extracted or d production of geothermal steam    possible reserves possible reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than probable reserves   i when deterministic methods are used the total quantities ultimately recovered from a project have a low probability of exceeding proved plus probable plus possible reserves when probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a  probability that the total quantities ultimately recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates ii possible reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to probable reserves where data control and interpretations of available data are progressively less certain frequently this will be in areas where geoscience and engineering data are unable to define clearly the area and vertical limits of commercial production from the reservoir by a defined project         iii possible reserves also include incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than the recovery quantities assumed for probable reserves iv the proved plus probable and proved plus probable plus possible reserves estimates must be based on reasonable alternative technical and commercial interpretations within the reservoir or subject project that are clearly documented including comparisons to results in successful similar projects v possible reserves may be assigned where geoscience and engineering data identify directly adjacent portions of a reservoir within the same accumulation that may be separated from proved areas by faults with displacement less than formation thickness or other geological discontinuities and that have not been penetrated by a wellbore and the registrant believes that such adjacent portions are in communication with the known proved reservoir possible reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher or lower than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir vi pursuant to paragraph aiii of this section where direct observation has defined a highest known oil hko elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap proved oil reserves should be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir above the hko only if the higher contact can be established with reasonable certainty through reliable technology portions of the reservoir that do not meet this reasonable certainty criterion may be assigned as probable and possible oil or gas based on reservoir fluid properties and pressure gradient interpretations    probable reserves probable reserves are those additional reserves that are less certain to be recovered than proved reserves but which together with proved reserves are as likely as not to be recovered   i when deterministic methods are used it is as likely as not that actual remaining quantities recovered will exceed the sum of estimated proved plus probable reserves when probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a  probability that the actual quantities recovered will equal or exceed the proved plus probable reserves estimates ii probable reserves may be assigned to areas of a reservoir adjacent to proved reserves where data control or interpretations of available data are less certain even if the interpreted reservoir continuity of structure or productivity does not meet the reasonable certainty criterion probable reserves may be assigned to areas that are structurally higher than the proved area if these areas are in communication with the proved reservoir iii probable reserves estimates also include potential incremental quantities associated with a greater percentage recovery of the hydrocarbons in place than assumed for proved reserves iv see also guidelines in paragraphs aiv and avi of this section    probabilistic estimate the method of estimation of reserves or resources is called probabilistic when the full range of values that could reasonably occur for each unknown parameter from the geoscience and engineering data is used to generate a full range of possible outcomes and their associated probabilities of occurrence    production costs   i costs incurred to operate and maintain wells and related equipment and facilities including depreciation and applicable operating costs of support equipment and facilities and other costs of operating and maintaining those wells and related equipment and facilities they become part of the cost of oil and gas produced examples of production costs sometimes called lifting costs are   a costs of labor to operate the wells and related equipment and facilities b repairs and maintenance c materials supplies and fuel consumed and supplies utilized in operating the wells and related equipment and facilities d property taxes and insurance applicable to proved properties and wells and related equipment and facilities e severance taxes   ii some support equipment or facilities may serve two or more oil and gas producing activities and may also serve transportation refining and marketing activities to the extent that the support equipment and facilities are used in oil and gas producing activities their depreciation and applicable operating costs become exploration development or production costs as appropriate depreciation depletion and amortization of capitalized acquisition exploration and development costs are not production costs but also become part of the cost of oil and gas produced along with production lifting costs identified above          proved area the part of a property to which proved reserves have been specifically attributed    proved oil and gas reserves proved oil and gas reserves are those quantities of oil and gas which by analysis of geoscience and engineering data can be estimated with reasonable certainty to be economically producible—from a given date forward from known reservoirs and under existing economic conditions operating methods and government regulations—prior to the time at which contracts providing the right to operate expire unless evidence indicates that renewal is reasonably certain regardless of whether deterministic or probabilistic methods are used for the estimation the project to extract the hydrocarbons must have commenced or the operator must be reasonably certain that it will commence the project within a reasonable time   i the area of the reservoir considered as proved includes   a the area identified by drilling and limited by fluid contacts if any and b adjacent undrilled portions of the reservoir that can with reasonable certainty be judged to be continuous with it and to contain economically producible oil or gas on the basis of available geoscience and engineering data   ii in the absence of data on fluid contacts proved quantities in a reservoir are limited by the lowest known hydrocarbons lkh as seen in a well penetration unless geoscience engineering or performance data and reliable technology establishes a lower contact with reasonable certainty iii where direct observation from well penetrations has defined a highest known oil hko elevation and the potential exists for an associated gas cap proved oil reserves may be assigned in the structurally higher portions of the reservoir only if geoscience engineering or performance data and reliable technology establish the higher contact with reasonable certainty iv reserves which can be produced economically through application of improved recovery techniques including but not limited to fluid injection are included in the proved classification when   a successful testing by a pilot project in an area of the reservoir with properties no more favorable than in the reservoir as a whole the operation of an installed program in the reservoir or an analogous reservoir or other evidence using reliable technology establishes the reasonable certainty of the engineering analysis on which the project or program was based and b the project has been approved for development by all necessary parties and entities including governmental entities   v existing economic conditions include prices and costs at which economic producibility from a reservoir is to be determined the price shall be the average price during the month period prior to the ending date of the period covered by the report determined as an unweighted arithmetic average of the firstdayofthemonth price for each month within such period unless prices are defined by contractual arrangements excluding escalations based upon future conditions    proved properties properties with proved reserves    reasonable certainty if deterministic methods are used reasonable certainty means a high degree of confidence that the quantities will be recovered if probabilistic methods are used there should be at least a  probability that the quantities actually recovered will equal or exceed the estimate a high degree of confidence exists if the quantity is much more likely to be achieved than not and as changes due to increased availability of geoscience geological geophysical and geochemical engineering and economic data are made to estimated ultimate recovery eur with time reasonably certain eur is much more likely to increase or remain constant than to decrease          reliable technology reliable technology is a grouping of one or more technologies including computational methods that has been field tested and has been demonstrated to provide reasonably certain results with consistency and repeatability in the formation being evaluated or in an analogous formation    reserves reserves are estimated remaining quantities of oil and gas and

expectation that there will exist the legal right to produce or a revenue interest in the production installed means of delivering oil and gas or related substances to market and all permits and financing required to implement the project   note to paragraph a  reserves should not be assigned to adjacent reservoirs isolated by major potentially sealing faults until those reservoirs are penetrated and evaluated as economically producible reserves should not be assigned to areas that are clearly separated from a known accumulation by a nonproductive reservoir ie absence of reservoir structurally low reservoir or negative test results such areas may contain prospective resources ie potentially recoverable resources from undiscovered accumulations     excerpted from the fasb accounting standards codification topic  extractive activities—oil and gas  a standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to an entitys interests in both of the following shall be disclosed as of the end of the year   a proved oil and gas reserves see paragraphs  through b b oil and gas subject to purchase under longterm supply purchase or similar agreements and contracts in which the entity participates in the operation of the properties on which the oil or gas is located or otherwise serves as the producer of those reserves see paragraph    the standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows relating to those two types of interests in reserves may be combined for reporting purposes  all of the following information shall be disclosed in the aggregate and for each geographic area for which reserve quantities are disclosed in accordance with paragraphs  through b   a future cash inflows these shall be computed by applying prices used in estimating the entitys proved oil and gas reserves to the yearend quantities of those reserves future price changes shall be considered only to the extent provided by contractual arrangements in existence at yearend b future development and production costs these costs shall be computed by estimating the expenditures to be incurred in developing and producing the proved oil and gas reserves at the end of the year based on yearend costs and assuming continuation of existing economic conditions if estimated development expenditures are significant they shall be presented separately from estimated production costs c future income tax expenses these expenses shall be computed by applying the appropriate yearend statutory tax rates with consideration of future tax rates already legislated to the future pretax net cash flows relating to the entitys proved oil and gas reserves less the tax basis of the properties involved the future income tax expenses shall give effect to tax deductions and tax credits and allowances relating to the entitys proved oil and gas reserves d future net cash flows these amounts are the result of subtracting future development and production costs and future income tax expenses from future cash inflows e discount this amount shall be derived from using a discount rate of  percent a year to reflect the timing of the future net cash flows relating to proved oil and gas reserves f standardized measure of discounted future net cash flows this amount is the future net cash flows less the computed discount      reservoir a porous and permeable underground formation containing a natural accumulation of producible oil andor gas that is confined by impermeable rock or water barriers and is individual and separate from other reservoirs    resources resources are quantities of oil and gas estimated to exist in naturally occurring accumulations a portion of the resources may be estimated to be recoverable and another portion may be considered to be unrecoverable resources include both discovered and undiscovered accumulations          service well a well drilled or completed for the purpose of supporting production in an existing field specific purposes of service wells include gas injection water injection steam injection air injection saltwater disposal water supply for injection observation or injection for insitu combustion    stratigraphic test well a stratigraphic test well is a drilling effort geologically directed to obtain information pertaining to a specific geologic condition such wells customarily are drilled without the intent of being completed for hydrocarbon production the classification also includes tests identified as core tests and all types of expendable holes related to hydrocarbon exploration stratigraphic tests are classified as exploratory type if not drilled in a known area or development type if drilled in a known area    undeveloped oil and gas reserves undeveloped oil and gas reserves are reserves of any category that are expected to be recovered from new wells on undrilled acreage or from existing wells where a relatively major expenditure is required for recompletion   i reserves on undrilled acreage shall be limited to those directly offsetting development spacing areas that are reasonably certain of production when drilled unless evidence using reliable technology exists that establishes reasonable certainty of economic producibility at greater distances ii undrilled locations can be classified as having undeveloped reserves only if a development plan has been adopted indicating that they are scheduled to be drilled within five years unless the specific circumstances justify a longer time     from the secs compliance and disclosure interpretations october     although several types of projects — such as constructing offshore platforms and development in urban areas remote locations or environmentally sensitive locations — by their nature customarily take a longer time to develop and therefore often do justify longer time periods this determination must always take into consideration all of the facts and circumstances no particular type of project per se justifies a longer time period and any extension beyond five years should be the exception and not the rule   factors that a company should consider in determining whether or not circumstances justify recognizing reserves even though development may extend past five years include but are not limited to the following   ÿ the companys level of ongoing significant development activities in the area to be developed for example drilling only the minimum number of wells necessary to maintain the lease generally would not constitute significant development activities ÿ the companys historical record at completing development of comparable longterm projects ÿ the amount of time in which the company has maintained the leases or booked the reserves without significant development activities ÿ the extent to which the company has followed a previously adopted development plan for example if a company has changed its development plan several times without taking significant steps to implement any of those plans recognizing proved undeveloped reserves typically would not be appropriate and ÿ the extent to which delays in development are caused by external factors related to the physical operating environment for example restrictions on development on federal lands but not obtaining government permits rather than by internal factors for example shifting resources to develop properties with higher priority     iii under no circumstances shall estimates for undeveloped reserves be attributable to any acreage for which an application of fluid injection or other improved recovery technique is contemplated unless such techniques have been proved effective by actual projects in the same reservoir or an analogous reservoir as defined in paragraph a of this section or by other evidence using reliable technology establishing reasonable certainty    unproved properties properties with no proved reserves     energyxxi services  downtown houston   tip foursquarelog insign
