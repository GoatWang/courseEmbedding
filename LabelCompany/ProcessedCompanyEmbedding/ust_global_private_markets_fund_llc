will be admitted to the company by the investment adviser and will become members of the company the members the company is seeking commitments from investors the minimum commitment in the company is  although the board reserves the right to accept commitments of lesser amounts in its discretion the company has not yet identified all of the potential investments that it will make with the commitments the investors full commitment will not be immediately invested the company will invest in portfolio funds as commitments are drawn the company may not draw on the full commitment any amounts drawn except for cash reserved to cover company expenses will be invested within six  months of the drawdown date such investments may take the form of a binding legal commitment investors understand that by agreeing to invest in the company each is making an irrevocable commitment to the company of the entire amount of the commitment which will be drawn down over time even though not all the money will be requested immediately if there is a capital call investors are committing to make funds available within the time designated investors should understand that if a capital call is received they will have to either immediately transfer additional funds to their account at bank of america corporation bank of america or immediately direct bank of america to liquidate investments in their account and to transfer them to the company   a to honor the commitment investors understand that if they close their account at bank of america the total amount of any outstanding commitments will be immediately due and payable investment objective the investment objective of the company is longterm capital appreciation neither the company nor the investment adviser guarantees any level of return or risk on investments and there can be no assurance that the investment objective will be achieved however it is the expectation that the company will generate a total return over the life of the company that will exceed the return of the global public equities market and compensate the investor for the additional risk taken by investing in portfolio funds investment philosophy the investment adviser is guided by a set of principles that it believes is essential to make successful private equity investments they are outlined as follows      developing a private equity allocation is a longterm process that requires an investor to continuously and selectively commit capital to private equity investments      building successful private equity portfolios requires skillful management of risks associated with portfolio cash flows manager selection and concentrations among strategies vintage years portfolio funds fund sponsors geographies and industries      attractive private equity returns are generated by investing in funds managed by professionals with demonstrated track record of success across multiple market industry technology and innovation cycles      investors are better served by investing in portfolio funds that exhibit a strong alignment of interest with their investors as expressed in the terms of the portfolio funds limited partnership agreement and the manner in which the fund sponsor manages its organization      given the longterm illiquid nature of private equity investing investors should have a strong appreciation for the potential risk presented by each portfolio fund investment      a value orientation should be maintained when allocating among private equity strategies and selecting portfolio funds investment strategy the company will seek to achieve its objective by pursuing a strategy of committing at least  of commitments in portfolio funds private equity funds may include portfolio funds pursuing investment strategies in buyouts venture capital and special situations distressed debt mezzanine secondaries natural resources opportunistic real estate royalties and other private equity strategies perceived to be attractive by the investment adviser such funds often have a focus on one or more industry country region or investmentrelated themes such funds seek to generate returns primarily through longterm capital appreciation however at times some portfolio funds may generate some current income and shortterm capital appreciation the company will seek to identify six to fifteen portfolio funds within eighteen months of the companys final closing the company will leverage the relationships established by the investment adviser among private equity fund sponsors to gain access to attractive portfolio funds the investment adviser will employ a proactive disciplined and diligent investment process by which prospective portfolio funds will be sourced reviewed and selected the company will seek to tactically overweight or underweight its allocation to the various private equity strategies perceived by the investment adviser to be more or less attractive from an expected risk and return perspective tactical allocations are influenced by a valueoriented perspective with regards to capital flows within a private equity strategy valuations for new investments to be made by portfolio funds risk within transaction structures expectations for change within a strategy over the nearterm and perceived attractiveness for a private equity strategy the exposures to specific private equity strategies will also be influenced by the investment   a advisers ability to gain access to toptier fund sponsors in a specific strategy although the investment adviser may target specific strategies regions or industries for investment the investment adviser will not compromise on the caliber of the fund sponsors pursued for investment in order to make an allocation to a targeted strategy the chart below presents the expected private equity strategy allocations for the company in the current market environment relative to the longterm capital flows in private equity   private equity strategy allocation strategy    long termmarket weight   fundtarget weight buyout        venture capital        special situations        anticipated geography allocation region    allocation     north america       europe       asia       other          there can be no assurance that the positions created by the portfolio funds selected for the company will create a portfolio with the allocations described above the investment adviser does not control and does not have influence on the investment activity of the fund sponsors investing the capital of the portfolio funds the investment advisers expected allocations to each portfolio fund will be guided by the historical investment activity and the expected investment activity as articulated by the fund sponsors in the offering memoranda and accompanying due diligence information for their respective portfolio funds investment policies and restrictions the company has adopted certain fundamental investment restrictions which cannot be changed without the vote of a majority of the companys outstanding voting securities as defined by the  act the companys fundamental investment restrictions are as follows      the company will not invest  or more of the value of its total assets in the securities other than us government securities of issuers engaged in any single industry this restriction does not apply to the companys investments in portfolio funds      the company will not issue senior securities representing stock except that to the extent permitted by the  act a the company may borrow money from banks brokers and other lenders to finance portfolio transactions and engage in other transactions involving the issuance by the company of senior securities representing indebtedness and b the company may borrow money from banks for temporary or emergency purposes   a    the company will not underwrite securities of other issuers except insofar as the company may be deemed an underwriter under the securities act in connection with the disposition of its portfolio securities      the company will not make loans of money or securities to other persons except through purchasing fixedincome securities lending portfolio securities or entering into repurchase agreements in a manner consistent with the companys investment policies      the company will not purchase or sell commodities or commodity contracts except that it may purchase and sell foreign currency options futures and forward contracts including those related to indexes and options on indices and may invest in commodity pools and other entities that purchase and sell commodities and commodity contracts      the company will not purchase hold or deal in real estate except that it may invest in securities that are secured by real estate or that are issued by companies that invest or deal in real estate the investment objective of the company is also fundamental and may not be changed without a vote of a majority of the companys outstanding voting securities under the  act the vote of a majority of the outstanding voting securities of an investment company such as the company means the vote at an annual or a special meeting of the security holders of the company duly called a of  or more of the voting securities present at the meeting if the holders of more than  of the outstanding voting securities of the company are present or represented by proxy or b of more than  of the outstanding voting securities of the company whichever is less with respect to these investment restrictions and other policies described in this registration statement the company will not look through the portfolio funds in addition if a percentage restriction is adhered to at the time of an investment or transaction a later change in percentage resulting from a change in the values of investments or the value of the companys total assets unless otherwise stated will not constitute a violation of such restriction or policy the company may engage in borrowing to cover company expenses to bridge capital contributions cover investor defaults or to make future capital contributions to portfolio funds the company may borrow from an affiliate subject to regulatory approvals or thirdparty pursuant to a credit facility the company may borrow in advance of a closing with investors to permit making initial capital contributions to a portfolio fund or a later date to fulfill ongoing commitments thus the company may be significantly leveraged prior to closing or thereafter drawdowns from investors or distributions from portfolio funds may be used to fulfill obligations including but not limited to the payment of any interest due under any credit facility in the event the company does not have sufficient commitments to pay its borrowings in full it is possible that it would default on its borrowing or its commitments to a portfolio fund or portfolio funds and unless another source of funds is obtained investors in the company could be adversely affected in addition private equity acquisitions by portfolio funds will generally include significant leverage at the portfolio company level such leverage can increase the return on an investment but it also creates additional risk because in the event that decreases in value cause the investment to be worth less than the amount borrowed the investment can be lost however there is no guarantee that the company will borrow or that a credit facility will be available for the company the  act requires a registered investment company to satisfy an asset coverage requirement of  if its indebtedness including amounts borrowed measured at the time the investment company incurs the indebtedness the asset coverage requirement this requirement means that the value of the investment companys total indebtedness may not exceed onethird the value of its total assets including the indebtedness in addition the investment adviser may at its discretion exclude a defaulting investor from future capital calls risk factors in considering participation in the company the prospective investors should be aware of certain risk factors which include the following      business and market risks the companys investment portfolio will consist of portfolio funds which will hold securities issued primarily by privately held companies and operating results for the portfolio companies in a specified period will be difficult to predict such investments involve a high degree of business and financial risk that can result in substantial losses   a buyout funds buyout transactions may result in new enterprises that are subject to extreme volatility require time for maturity and may require additional capital in addition they frequently rely on borrowing significant amounts of capital which can increase profit potential but at the same time increase the risk of loss leveraged companies may be subject to restrictive financial and operating covenants the leverage may impair the ability of these companies to finance their future operations and capital needs also their flexibility to respond to changing business and economic conditions and to business opportunities may be limited a leveraged companys income and net assets will tend to increase or decrease at a greater rate than if borrowed money was not used although these investments may offer the opportunity for significant gains such buyout investments involve a high degree of business and financial risk that can result in substantial losses which risks generally are greater than the risks of investing in public companies that may not be as leveraged venture funds venture capital funds primarily invest in private companies that have limited operating history are attempting to develop or commercialize unproven technologies or to implement novel business plans or are not otherwise developed sufficiently to be selfsustaining financially or to become public although these investments may offer the opportunity for significant gains such investments involve a high degree of business and financial risk that can result in substantial losses which risks generally are greater than the risks of investing in public companies that may be at a later stage of development      lack of operating history the company is a newly formed entity and has no operating history upon which prospective investors can evaluate its performance the investment program of the company should be evaluated on the basis that there can be no assurance that the investment advisers assessment of the shortterm or longterm prospects of investments will prove accurate or that the company will achieve its investment objectives past performance of the managers of the portfolio funds is no indication of future performance      dependence on the investment adviser the success of the company is significantly dependent upon the ability of the investment adviser to achieve the companys investment objectives the performance of the investment advisers prior investments is not necessarily indicative of the companys future results      investment in junior securities the securities in which each portfolio fund will invest may be among the most junior in a portfolio companys capital structure and thus subject to the greatest risk of loss generally there will be no collateral to protect an investment once made      leveraged investments a portfolio funds investments depending upon its strategy may be in companies whose capital structures are highly leveraged such investments involve a high degree of risk in that adverse fluctuations in the cash flow of such companies or increased interest rates may impair their ability to meet their obligations which may accelerate and magnify declines in the value of any such portfolio company investments in a down market      limited transferability of interests there will be no public market for the interests and none is expected to develop there are substantial restrictions upon the transferability of interests under the limited liability company agreement of the registrant the company agreement and applicable securities laws      diversification of investments the company is a nondiversified investment company thus there are no percentage limitations imposed by the  act on the percentage of the companys assets that may be invested in the securities of any one issuer however the company generally will not commit more than  of the value of its total commitments measured at the time of commitment in the securities of a single portfolio fund the investment adviser believes that this approach helps to reduce overall investment risk   a    concentration of portfolio fund investments each portfolio fund will participate in a limited number of investments and may seek to make several investments in one industry or one industry segment as a result each portfolio funds investment portfolio could become highly concentrated and the performance of a few holdings may substantially affect its aggregate return furthermore to the extent that the capital raised is less than the targeted amount a portfolio fund may invest in fewer portfolio companies and thus be less diversified      illiquidity lack of current distributions an investment in the company is illiquid in addition the company will acquire privately offered interests in portfolio funds transfers of interests and withdrawals within portfolio funds will be severely restricted it is uncertain as to when profits if any will be realized losses on unsuccessful investments may be realized before gains on successful investments are realized the return of capital and the realization of gains if any generally will occur only upon the partial or complete disposition of an underlying investment by a portfolio fund while an investment may be sold at any time it is not generally expected that this will occur for a number of years after the initial investment before such time there may be no current return on the investment due to the pattern of cash flows in private equity funds and the illiquid nature of their investments investors typically will see negative returns in the companys early stages in particular it can take several years for portfolio fund investments to be realized during which time management fees will be continued to be drawn from committed capital and certain underperforming investments may be written down or written off then as investments are able to realize liquidity events such as a sale or initial public offering positive returns will be realized if the portfolio fund is successful in achieving its investment strategy      absence of regulatory oversight the portfolio funds will not be registered as investment companies under the  act and the company as an investor in these portfolio funds will not have the benefit of the protection afforded by the  act to investors in registered investment companies which among other protections require investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors require securities held in custody at all times to be individually segregated from the securities of any other person and marked to clearly identify such securities as the property of such investment company and regulate the relationship between the adviser and the investment company      tax laws subject to change it is possible that the current federal state local or foreign income tax treatment accorded an investment in the company will be modified by legislative administrative or judicial action in the future the nature of additional changes in federal or nonus income tax law if any cannot be determined prior to enactment of any new tax legislation however such legislation could significantly alter the tax consequences and decrease the after tax rate of return of an investment in the company potential investors therefore should seek and must rely on the advice of their own tax advisers with respect to the possible impact on their investments of recent legislation as well as any future proposed tax legislation or administrative or judicial action      inkind distributions portfolio funds may make inkind distributions to the company and particularly in the event of a dissolution of a portfolio fund such distribution may contain securities which are not marketable while the general policy of the company will be to liquidate such investment and distribute proceeds to the members under certain circumstances when deemed appropriate by the board a member may receive inkind distributions from the company      projections projected operating results of a company in which a portfolio fund invests normally will be based primarily on financial projections prepared by each companys management in all cases projections are only estimates of future results that are based upon information received from the company and assumptions made at the time the projections are developed there can be no assurance that the results are set forth in the projections will be attained and actual results may be significantly different from the projections also general economic factors which are not predictable can have a material effect on the reliability of projections   a    carried interest the carried interest held by the special member or equivalent of a portfolio fund may create an incentive for the investment adviser to make high risk portfolio investments in hope of achieving a larger return for the holder of the carried interest      need for followon investments following its initial investment in a given portfolio company a portfolio fund may decide to provide additional funds to such portfolio company or may have the opportunity to increase its investment in a successful portfolio company there is no assurance that a portfolio fund will make followon investments or that a portfolio fund will have sufficient funds to make all or any of such investments any decision by a portfolio fund not to make followon investments or its inability to make such investments i may have a subsequent negative effect on a portfolio company in need of such an investment ii result in a lost opportunity for a portfolio fund to increase its participation in a successful operation or iii result in a loss of certain antidilution protection      nonus investments the company may invest in a portfolio fund that is organized outside of the united states or a portfolio fund may invest in portfolio companies that are organized or have substantial sales or operations outside of the united states such investments may be subject to certain additional risk due to among other things potentially unsettled points of applicable governing law the risks associated with fluctuating currency exchange rates capital repatriation regulations the application of complex us and foreign tax rules to crossborder investments and imposition of foreign taxes on the company andor the members      independent counsel no independent counsel has been retained to represent the interests of the members neither the memorandum nor the company agreement has been reviewed by any attorney on behalf of the members legal counsel to the company and investment adviser does not represent any member      increased regulatory scrutiny in the environment following the events of september   the company and the investment adviser expect increased scrutiny by government regulators investigators auditors and law enforcement officials regarding the identities and sources of funds of investors in private investment funds in that connection in the future the company may become subject to additional obligations such as reporting requirements regarding its investors including without limitation such requirements and restrictions as may apply under the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of  the patriot act each member will be required to provide to the company such information as may be required to enable the company to comply with all applicable legal or regulatory requirements including without limitation the requirements of the patriot act andor all rules and regulations related thereto and each member will be required to acknowledge and agree that the company may disclose such information to governmental andor regulatory or selfregulatory authorities to the extent required by applicable law or regulation and may file such reports with such authorities as may be required by applicable law or regulation if required by applicable law regulation or interpretation thereof the company may suspend all activity with respect to a members account with the company including suspending the members right to redeem funds or assets from the company pending the companys receipt of instructions regarding the members account from the appropriate governmental or regulatory authority      private offering exemption this offering has not been registered under the securities act in reliance on the exemptive provisions of section  of the securities act and regulation d promulgated thereunder section bd of the securities act added by the national securities markets improvement act of  preempts state registration of transactions in securities exempt pursuant to rules and regulations issued by the sec under section  of the securities act preemption therefore applies to transactions exempt under regulation d but not to transactions exempt under section  alone because of the lack of uniformity among the states securities laws and their general complicated nature the company has chosen not to incur the expense and burden of reviewing exemptions under each states laws but rather rely on the uniform exemption provided by regulation d no assurance can be given that the offering currently qualifies or will continue to qualify under the exemptive provisions of regulation d because of among other things the adequacy of disclosure and the manner of distribution the timeliness of filings the existence of similar offerings in the past or in the future or the retroactive change of any securities law or regulation if the regulation d exemption is lost the company may not be able to avail itself of other state exemptions and successful claims or suits for rescission may be brought and successfully concluded for failure to register these offerings or for acts or omissions constituting offenses under the exchange act or applicable state securities laws   a    manager liability in certain circumstances each portfolio fund is expected to receive the right to appoint a representative to the board of directors of the companies in which it invests serving on the board of directors of a portfolio company exposes the portfolio funds representatives and ultimately the portfolio fund to potential liability although portfolio companies often have insurance to protect directors and officers from such liability not all portfolio companies may obtain such insurance which may be insufficient if obtained      public company holdings a portfolio funds investment portfolio may contain securities issued by publicly held companies such investments may subject the portfolio fund to risks that differ in type or degree from those involved with investments in privately held companies such risks include without limitation greater volatility in the valuation of such companies increased obligations to disclose information regarding such companies limitations on the ability of the portfolio fund to dispose of such securities at certain times increased likelihood of shareholder litigation against such companies board members and increased costs associated with each of the aforementioned risks      delayed schedule ks the company will not be able to provide final schedule ks to members for any given fiscal year until after april  of the following year investors should be prepared for a substantial delay in receiving final schedule ks the final schedule ks will not be available until the company has received taxreporting information from its portfolio funds necessary to prepare final schedule ks members will likely be required to obtain extensions of the filing dates for their us federal state and local income tax returns members will be responsible for any and all costs and fees incurred by them in connection with obtaining the tax extensions each prospective investor should consult with its own adviser as to the advisability and tax consequences of an investment in the company portfolio funds and their portfolio companies may engage in business otherwise derive income from and in general be subject to taxing authority in numerous state local and foreign jurisdictions members by virtue of their participation in the company may be subject to tax payment and reporting obligations in such jurisdictions under their widely varying rules and regulations each investor should consult an independent adviser regarding how an investment in the company may affect his her or its state local and foreign tax payment and reporting obligations      risks of private equity investments generally the investments made by the portfolio funds will entail a high degree of risk and in most cases be highly illiquid and difficult to value unless and until those investments are sold or mature into marketable securities they will remain illiquid in addition to the extent a portfolio fund focuses on venture capital investments the companies in which the portfolio fund will invest may be in a conceptual or early stage of development may not have a proven operating history may offer services or products that are not yet developed or ready to be marketed or that have no established market may be operating at a loss or have significant fluctuations in operating results may be engaged in a rapidly changing business may require substantial additional capital to support their operations to finance expansion or to maintain their competitive position or otherwise may have a weak financial condition as a general matter companies in which the portfolio fund invests may face intense competition including competition from companies with far greater financial resources more extensive research development technological marketing and other capabilities and a larger number of qualified managerial and technical personnel the company will not obtain or seek to obtain any control over the management of any portfolio company in which any portfolio fund may invest the success of each investment made by a portfolio fund will largely depend on the ability and success of the management of the portfolio companies in addition to economic and market factors   a    capital contributions the company has not yet identified all of the potential investments that it will make with the commitments the investors full commitment will not be immediately invested the company will invest in portfolio funds as commitments are drawn within  months of any drawdown it may take a significant amount of time to fully draw down and invest the committed amounts approximately  years the companys performance will only include the commitments that have been drawndown thus an investors individual performance may be lower than the performance of the company      default the company will not always contribute the full amount of its commitment to a portfolio fund at the time of its admission to the portfolio fund instead the company will be required to make incremental contributions pursuant to capital calls issued from time to time by the portfolio fund if the company defaults on its commitment or fails to satisfy capital calls in a timely manner then generally it will be subject to significant penalties including the complete forfeiture of the companys investment in the portfolio fund any failure by the company to make timely capital contributions in respect of its commitments may i impair the ability of the company to pursue its investment program ii force the company to borrow iii cause the company and indirectly the investors to be subject to certain penalties from the portfolio funds including the complete forfeiture of the companys investment in a portfolio fund or iv otherwise impair the value of the companys investments including the complete devaluation of the company similarly investors will not contribute the full amount of their commitments to the company at the time of their admission investors will be required to make incremental contributions pursuant to capital calls issued from time to time by the company unlike the portfolio funds the company will have limited recourse in retrieving undrawn commitments in the instance that an investor defaults on a commitment an investor or investors that defaults on hisheritstheir commitment to the company may cause the company to inturn default on its commitment to a portfolio fund thus the company and especially the nondefaulting investors will bear the penalties of such default as outlined above including but not limited to the complete forfeiture of the companys investment in a portfolio fund and the complete devaluation of the company while the investment adviser has taken steps to mitigate this risk including seeking commitments from investors that exceed the commitments that are made to the portfolio funds there is no guarantee that such measures will be sufficient or successful      recall of distributions the company may be subject to terms of the portfolio funds which permit the recall of distributions to meet company obligations in the event funds are recalled for this purpose the company may in turn require members to return amounts previously distributed to them      limited investment opportunities in sourcing investment opportunities the company will leverage the relationships established by the investment adviser and its affiliates among private equity fund sponsors to gain access to attractive portfolio funds however as a registered investment company the company will be required to make certain public disclosures and regulatory filings regarding the companys operations financial status portfolio holdings etc while these filings are designed to enhance investor protections private equity fund sponsors may view such filings as contrary to their business interests and deny access to the company but may permit other nonregistered funds or accounts managed by the investment adviser or its affiliates to invest as a result the company may not be invested in certain private equity funds that are held by other unregistered funds or accounts managed by the investment adviser or its affiliates even though those private equity funds are consistent with the companys investment objective in addition certain provisions of the  act prohibit the company from engaging in transactions with the investment adviser however unregistered funds also managed by the investment adviser are not prohibited from the same transactions as a result the company due to its status as a registered investment company may be ineligible to participate in certain opportunities that will be available to unregistered investment companies advised by the investment adviser   a    competition for investment opportunities many institutional investors including other fund of funds entities may seek to invest in many of the same underlying funds in which the company may also seek to invest some of those underlying funds may limit the number of investors and the amount of capital they raise which may limit or eliminate the ability of the company to invest in those underlying funds in addition numerous investors will be competing with the portfolio funds for desirable investment opportunities because of this competition the portfolio funds might not be able to participate in attractive investments that would otherwise be available to them in addition competition for investments may also increase the premoney value of prospective portfolio companies which may adversely affect investment returns      economic conditions changes in economic conditions including for example interest rates inflation rates industry conditions competition technological developments trade relationships political and diplomatic events and trends tax laws and innumerable other factors can substantially and adversely affect the business and prospects of the portfolio funds and the company these conditions are not within the control of the investment adviser or the sponsors of the portfolio funds      portfolio company risks portfolio companies in which the portfolio funds invest will be subject to the risk that a proposed service or product cannot be developed successfully with the resources available to the enterprise there can be no assurance that the development efforts of any portfolio company will be successful or if successful will be completed within the budget or time originally estimated additional funds may be necessary to complete such development to achieve market acceptance to support expansion or to achieve or maintain competitive positions the portfolio companies may not be able to obtain such funds on favorable terms or at all many of the portfolio companies of a portfolio fund may operate at a loss or with highly erratic operating results such companies may face intense competition including competition from companies with much greater financial resources much more extensive development production marketing and service capabilities and a much larger number of qualified managerial and technical personnel the investment adviser anticipates that the company through the portfolio funds will be making significant investments in companies in a number of sectors some of which are rapidly changing and such companies may face increased risks of product or service obsolescence there can be no assurance that any particular portfolio company will succeed      currency risks the companys investments that are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar are subject to the risk that the value of the particular currency will change in relation to one or more other currencies as a result the company could realize a net loss on an investment even if there were a gain on the underlying investment before currency losses were taken into account among the factors that may affect currency values are trade balances the level of shortterm interest rates differences in relative values of similar assets in different currencies longterm opportunities for investment and capital appreciation and political developments the investment adviser may try to hedge these risks by investing in foreign currencies forward foreign currency exchange contracts or any combination thereof but there can be no assurance that such strategies will be effective   item  management item a board of managers all members of the companys board of managers the board or managers are independent managers as defined below the board

may arise should members of the portfolio management team have daytoday portfolio management responsibilities with respect to more than one fund portfolio management team members may manage other accounts with investment strategies similar to the company including other investment companies pooled investment vehicles and separately managed accounts fees earned by the investment adviser may vary among these accounts and portfolio management team members may personally invest in these accounts these factors could create conflicts of interest because the portfolio management team members may have incentives to favor certain accounts over others that could result in other accounts outperforming the company a conflict may also exist if a portfolio management team member identifies a limited investment opportunity that may be appropriate for more than one account but the company is not able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to the need to allocate that opportunity among multiple accounts in addition a portfolio management team member may execute transactions for another account that may adversely impact the value of securities held by the company however the investment adviser believes that these risks are mitigated by the fact that accounts with like investment strategies managed by the portfolio management team members are generally managed in a similar fashion and the investment adviser has a policy that seeks to allocate opportunities on a fair and equitable basis investment opportunities may be allocated to investment adviser affiliates affiliates of the investment adviser may be interested in some of the same investment opportunities as the investment adviser accordingly an affiliate of the investment adviser may make an investment that would otherwise be appropriate for the company as among the company and the investment advisers other fund of funds vehicles or other clients investment opportunities presented to the investment adviser will be allocated in a fair and equitable manner among the investment advisers existing clients opportunities that are suitable for more than one of the investment advisers fund of funds vehicles including the company or other clients and for which there is insufficient capacity to fulfill each fund of funds vehicles or other clients need will be allocated among such clients pro rata in proportion to its amount available to invest in such opportunity the company may invest in underlying funds in which the investment adviser andor its affiliates including to the extent permitted by applicable law other fund of funds products that have been or may be established by the investment adviser andor its affiliates has an investment and the investment adviser andor its affiliates may invest in portfolio funds in which the company has made an investment the board has adopted procedures governing the coinvestment in securities acquired in private placements with certain clients of the investment adviser the investment adviser may aggregate or bunch orders for its clients including the company and to aggregate such orders with those for clients of affiliates when it is determined that it is in the best interests of its clients however in order to avoid even the appearance that all participants in the aggregation are not treated fairly and equitably the investment adviser has adopted procedures governing the aggregation of orders and their subsequent allocation to participating accounts the investment adviser is not obligated however to invest for the company in any underlying fund that bank of america or its affiliates may acquire for its or their own accounts if the investment adviser concludes that it is not in the best interests of the company to acquire a position in such underlying fund the investors in the company will not benefit from investments made by bank of america and its other affiliates investment opportunities may be sourced to the company one source of potential investments for the company which may be made available to the company is through an arrangement the arrangement to which gwim is a party the arrangement itself will not since the company is not a party to it be a policy of the company and may be changed by the parties to it any changes would be monitored by the investment adviser and called to the attention of the board the participants in the arrangement are conversus asset management llc manageco bac and oak hill investment management lp ohim each of them has agreed to allocate investment opportunities in private equity funds sourced by them or among manageco bac on a proprietary basis and with respect to gwim andor ohims clients in a fair and equitable manner the fair and equitable manner initially will be based on the capital under management or with respect to bacs proprietary investments its internal balance sheet allocation to private equity funds as an asset class of manageco bac or of gwim and ohims applicable clients subject to investment limitations preexisting commitments legal tax and other similar factors and agreement by the fund manager for such purpose capital under management means net asset value excluding the cash assets and the unfunded commitments of the applicable party to underlying investments or original capital commitments including both funded and unfunded commitments made by investors to the applicable party if manageco bac gwim or the ohim clients fail to use all or any portion of an allocated opportunity the excess opportunity will be made available pro rata based on such parties original allocation to the parties that have not otherwise declined the opportunity provided that bac may give all or part of its proprietary allocation to gwim manageco bac and ohim may in the future determine to allocate investment opportunities in private equity funds sourced by them in a fair and equitable manner on any other reasonable basis as long as it is fair and equitable as described above the company has adopted its own policies for coinvestment and aggregation of orders those policies and procedures would govern the internal allocation within gwim of opportunities sourced under the arrangement since the company is not a party to the arrangement it would not become part of the companys own policies   b each member of the portfolio management team is a senior executive from business units within gwim as such the compensation packages for the members on the portfolio management team are composed of the same components used with all bank of america senior executives base salary annual incentive performance bonus and equity awards there is no direct link between any members specific compensation and the companys investment performance in determining the base salaries bank of america intends to be competitive in the marketplace and ensure salaries are commensurate with each members experience and ultimate responsibilities within each members respective business unit bank of america regularly evaluates base salary levels with external industry studies and analysis of industry trends each portfolio management team members annual bonus and equity awards are discretionary awards distributed after measuring each members contributions against quantitative and qualitative goals relative to their individual business responsibilities quantitative goals are relative to the individuals business unit and are not directly related to the performance of the company or any other portfolio relative to any benchmark or to the size of the company an example of a quantitative measure is associate turnover ratio qualitative measures may include staff management and development process management ex adherence to internal and external policies business management and strategic business input to the business platform as of the date of this registration statement no one owns interests   item  brokerage allocation and other practices each portfolio funds manager is directly responsible for placing orders for the execution of portfolio transactions for the portfolio fund that it manages and for the allocation of brokerage transactions on us stock exchanges and on some foreign stock exchanges involve the payment of negotiated brokerage commissions on many foreign stock exchanges commissions are fixed no stated commission is generally applicable to securities traded in overthecounter markets but the prices of those securities include undisclosed commissions or markups in selecting brokers and dealers to execute transactions on behalf of a portfolio fund it is expected that each portfolio fund manager will generally seek to obtain the best price and execution for the transactions taking into account factors such as price size of order difficulty of execution and operational facilities of a brokerage firm the scope and quality of brokerage services provided and the firms risk in positioning a block of securities although it is expected that each portfolio fund manager generally will seek reasonably competitive commission rates a portfolio fund manager will not necessarily pay the lowest commission available on each transaction the portfolio fund managers will typically have no obligation to deal with any broker or group of brokers in executing transactions in portfolio securities brokerage practices adopted by portfolio fund managers with respect to portfolio funds may vary and will be governed by each portfolio funds organizational documents consistent with the principle of seeking best price and execution a portfolio fund manager may place orders for a portfolio fund with brokers that provide the portfolio fund manager and its affiliates with supplemental research market and statistical information including advice as to the value of securities the advisability of investing in purchasing or selling securities and the availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of securities and furnishing analyses and reports concerning issuers industries securities economic factors and trends portfolio strategy and the performance of accounts the expenses of the portfolio fund managers are not necessarily reduced as a result of the receipt of this supplemental information which may be useful to the portfolio fund managers or their affiliates in providing services to clients other than the portfolio funds in addition not all of the supplemental information is necessarily used by a portfolio fund manager in connection with the portfolio fund it manages conversely the information provided to a portfolio fund manager by brokers and dealers through which other clients of the portfolio fund manager or its affiliates effect securities transactions may be useful to the portfolio fund manager in providing services to the portfolio fund based on representations in the portfolio funds offering documents the company generally believes that portfolio funds will follow practices similar to those described above the company has no control over portfolio fund brokerage arrangements or operations and there is a risk of portfolio fund misconduct   item  tax status the following is a summary of certain aspects of the income taxation of the company that should be considered by a prospective investor the company has not sought a ruling from the internal revenue service or any other federal state or local agency with respect to any of the tax issues affecting the company further the company has not obtained an opinion of counsel with respect to any federal tax issues other than the characterization of the company as a partnership for federal income tax purposes this discussion is based on the companys intended plan of operation applying the federal income tax laws as currently in effect as contained in the internal revenue code code treasury regulations and relevant judicial decisions and administrative guidance the federal tax laws are subject to change and any such change may materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the company neither the investment adviser nor its   b counsel has any continuing duty to advise the company or any member of any changes in the tax law that may affect any party or cause any part of this discussion to become inaccurate no rulings or opinions of counsel except as noted above with respect to the companys partnership status have been or will be requested with respect to any taxrelated matter discussed herein there can be no assurance that the positions the company takes on its tax returns will be accepted by the internal revenue service irs this discussion relates only to us federal income taxes and not to any local state or foreign taxes or us federal taxes other than income taxes because this discussion is a general summary it does not address all aspects of federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular investor in light of the investors particular circumstances nor does it address unless explicitly noted and only to the extent so noted certain types of investors subject to special treatment under the federal income tax laws including but not limited to taxexempt organizations insurance companies financial institutions brokerdealers dealers in securities or currencies traders in securities that elect to use the marktomarket method of accounting for their securities partners who are themselves partnerships or other passthrough entities for federal income tax purposes regulated

corporations or other business entities organized under the laws of the united states any state or the district of columbia estates with income subject to united states federal income tax or trusts subject to primary supervision by a united states court or for which united states persons control all substantial decisions portions of this discussion address the ability of investors to utilize items of loss or deduction allocated to them by the company potential investors are cautioned that the company will not be operated for the purpose of generating tax deductions losses credits or other benefits investors should not anticipate that an investment in the company will yield items of deduction loss or credit to offset items of income or gain from other sources potential investors should consult with their own tax advisers in order to understand the federal state local and foreign income tax consequences of an investment in the company the companys tax status the company intends to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and the companys legal counsel will provide an opinion to investors that the company will be so treated as a partnership the company will not be subject to federal income tax instead each member will be required annually to take into account its respective distributive share of the companys items of taxable income gain loss deduction and credit without regard to whether any distributions are made by the company generally ordinary income or loss earned or incurred by the company will be ordinary income or loss to the members and capital gain or loss earned or incurred by the company will be capital gain or loss to the members distributive shares of income gain loss deduction and credit are allocated in accordance with the company agreement the company expects that such allocations will be respected by the irs as either having substantial economic effect and complying with other regulatory safe harbor provisions or being determined in accordance with a partners interest in the partnership however the regulations regarding when allocations are respected for tax purposes are very complex and there can be no assurance that the allocations described in the company agreement will be respected by the irs generally distributions received by a member from the company as opposed to allocations of taxable income or loss will only be taxable to the extent a member receives money in excess of the members basis in its company interest the company expects to qualify as an investment partnership within the meaning of section cc of the code as long as the company does not actively and substantially participate in the management of any portfolio fund or hold  percent or more of the total capital and profits interests in any portfolio fund if the company does not so qualify a member receiving a distribution of marketable securities from the company may recognize taxable gain to the extent the fair market value of the distributed securities plus any distributed money exceeds the members basis in its units a member selling appreciated securities distributed to it taxfree by the company will generally recognize taxable gain based on the total appreciation in the value of the securities subject to certain adjustments and exceptions in the case of a distribution in liquidation of a members interest in the company including such appreciation that accrued while the securities were held by the company   b the company will file us federal partnership information returns reporting its operations for each fiscal year the company also will provide members with statements to assist members in determining and reporting on their federal income tax returns items of taxable income gain loss deduction and credit arising from their investment in the company because the company must receive taxreporting information from the portfolio funds and await the results of its annual audit before it can prepare such statements the company will not be able to provide taxreporting statements to the members until significantly after april  of each year members must be prepared to obtain extensions for filing their us federal state and local income tax returns each year investments in portfolio funds the company expects to invest in portfolio funds rather than directly engage in any business operations the company anticipates but can provide no assurance that the portfolio funds will be treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes and will in turn invest in the equity or debt securities of portfolio companies assuming for the remainder of this discussion that this is so the federal income tax consequences of the companys investment in a portfolio fund will depend heavily on the structure and other circumstances of the portfolio companies selected by portfolio funds beyond its ability to choose among portfolio funds in which to invest the company will have no control over the portfolio funds and their choice of investments therefore members must be prepared for allocations presenting a wide variety of federal income tax consequences to the extent portfolio funds invest in domestic portfolio companies taxed as corporations unlike those taxed as partnerships such companies are subject to federal income tax and will report separately their income gains losses deductions and credits on their own tax return interest or dividends earned from such portfolio companies will generally be ordinary income generally the federal income tax consequences of a portfolio funds disposition of investments in domestic portfolio companies will depend on whether the portfolio fund is treated as an investor or trader ie realizing capital gains or losses or a dealer ie realizing ordinary income or loss for tax purposes to the extent portfolio funds invest in domestic portfolio companies taxed as partnerships such portfolio companies like the company itself will not be subject to federal income tax the portfolio funds and indirectly the company and the members themselves must take into account for tax purposes a distributive share of such a portfolio companys items of taxable income gain loss deduction and credit without regard to whether the portfolio company ever makes distributions moreover the portfolio funds company and members will be deemed engaged in any trade or business carried on by a portfolio company taxed as a partnership as noted above the federal income tax consequences of a portfolio funds disposition of investments in domestic portfolio companies will depend on whether the portfolio fund is treated as an investor trader or a dealer for tax purposes in addition when disposing of a domestic portfolio company treated as a partnership gain or loss attributable to inventory or unrealized receivables defined broadly to include among others recapture items marketdiscount bonds shortterm obligations and stock in certain foreign corporations that might otherwise be capital gain will instead be ordinary income or loss to the extent the portfolio funds invest in foreign entities the tax consequences will vary widely depending on the jurisdiction and structure of the portfolio company foreign portfolio companies treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes may be classified as controlled foreign corporations or passive foreign investment companies under the code subject to a variety of unfavorable federal income tax consequences including but not limited to accelerating the timing of taxable income to the members or altering the character ie ordinary vs capital gain of a members income gains or losses from certain foreign currency transactions attributable to exchange rate fluctuations are treated as ordinary income or loss in addition to taxing the portfolio companys operations foreign jurisdictions may impose withholding taxes on dividends interest or other payments to the portfolio funds subject to numerous limitations members may be entitled to a credit or deduction for their share of such withholding taxes and certain other foreign taxes incurred by the portfolio funds or the company portfolio funds and their portfolio companies may engage in business in otherwise derive income from and in general be subject to taxing authority in numerous state local and foreign jurisdictions members by virtue of their participation in the company may be subject to tax payment and reporting obligations in such jurisdictions under their widely varying rules and regulations each investor should consult an independent adviser regarding how an investment in the company may affect his her or its state local and foreign tax payment and reporting obligations   b net asset valuation the company will compute its nav as of the last business day of each quarter and at such other times as deemed appropriate by the valuation committee of the board in determining its nav the company will value its investments as of such quarterend the nav of the company will equal the value of the total assets of the company less all of its liabilities including accrued fees and expenses the nav per unit of the company will equal the nav of the company divided by the number of outstanding units the board and the valuation committee have approved procedures pursuant to which the company will value its investments in portfolio funds at fair value in accordance with these procedures fair value as of each quarterend ordinarily will be the value determined as of such quarterend for each portfolio fund in accordance with the portfolio funds valuation policies and reported at the time of the companys valuation as a general matter the fair value of the companys interest in a portfolio fund will represent the amount that the company could reasonably expect to receive from a portfolio fund if the companys interest were redeemed at the time of valuation although it is not generally expected that the types of portfolio funds in which the company may invest will provide the company with redemption rights based on information reasonably available at the time the valuation is made and that the company believes to be reliable in the event that a portfolio fund does not report a quarterend value to the company on a timely basis the company would determine the fair value of such portfolio fund based on the most recent value reported by the portfolio fund as well as any other relevant information available at the time the company values its portfolio prior to investing in any portfolio fund the investment adviser will conduct a due diligence review of the valuation methodology utilized by the portfolio fund which as a general matter will utilize market values when available and otherwise utilize principles of fair value that the investment adviser reasonably believes to be consistent with those used by the company for valuing its own investments although the procedures approved by the board provide that the investment adviser and the valuation committee will review the valuations provided by the investment advisers to the portfolio funds neither the investment adviser nor the valuation committee will be able to confirm independently the accuracy of valuations provided by such investment advisers which are unaudited in addition through written and telephone communication and inperson meetings the investment adviser will maintain close relationships with the managers of the portfolio funds in order to protect the interests of the company and its members representatives of the investment adviser plan to regularly attend fund investor meetings to keep abreast of each portfolio funds activities the investment adviser will review their periodic reports as well as the reports of the underlying portfolio companies in which the portfolio funds invest to the extent which underlying company reports are made available the companys valuation procedures require the investment adviser and the valuation committee to consider all relevant information available at the time the company values its portfolio the investment adviser and the valuation committee will consider such information and may conclude in certain circumstances that the information provided by the investment adviser of a portfolio fund does not represent the fair value of the companys interests in the portfolio fund following procedures adopted by the board and the valuation committee in the absence of specific transaction activity in interests in a particular portfolio fund the company would consider whether it was appropriate in light of all relevant circumstances to value such a position at its nav as reported at the time of valuation or whether to adjust such value to reflect a premium or discount to nav generally the company would not anticipate applying a discount or a premium to the nav reported to it with respect to its portfolio fund investments because it is anticipated that the valuation methodologies used by the portfolio funds would already be reflective of the illiquid nature of the companys investment in such portfolio funds any such decision would be made in good faith and subject to the review and supervision of the valuation committee the valuations reported by the managers of the portfolio funds upon which the company calculates its quarter end nav and nav per unit may be subject to later adjustment based on information reasonably available at that time these valuations may be adjusted by the valuation committee in its sole discretion as it deems appropriate to reflect the fair market value of the portfolio funds and their interests in portfolio companies or other assets circumstances that would justify an adjustment of the valuations reported to the valuation committee by the investment advisers of the portfolio fund would include information available to the valuation committee that was not reflected in the valuations supplied by the portfolio funds including i changes in prices of publicly traded securities held by the portfolio funds ii the pricing obtained for new rounds of financing particularly financing obtained in significant amounts from new unrelated investors iii the discontinuation of operations or an important   b component of operations or the commencement of insolvency or reorganization proceedings of a portfolio company in the portfolio funds and iv any other factor or set of factors which when viewed in the totality of the circumstances would compel an investment professional to conclude that there had occurred an objectively verifiable change in the circumstances of the issuer or in the environment which is not likely to be reversed in any relevant time frame and which renders current valuation an obsolete misleading measure of current value for which there is a readily determined and more reliable measure as would clearly be the case for instance where there is a new round of financing from a new unrelated source or where insolvency proceedings have commenced other adjustments may occur from time to time prospective investors should be aware that there can be no assurance that the fair values of interests in portfolio funds as determined under the procedures described above will in all cases be accurate to the extent that the company and the valuation committee do not generally have access to all necessary financial and other information relating to the portfolio funds to determine independently the navs of the companys interests in those portfolio funds the results of the valuation committees valuation of securities whose market value is not readily ascertainable will be based upon the valuation committees assessment of the fair value of such securities and their issuers and therefore are the result of the committees interpretation to the extent the company purchases or holds securities other than interests in portfolio funds those securities will be valued in accordance with the companys valuation procedures the companys valuation procedures provide that domestic exchange traded equity securities other than options will be valued at their last sale prices as reported on the exchanges where those securities are traded if no sales of a security are reported on a particular day the security will be valued based on its bid price for a security held long or its ask price for a security held short as reported by those exchanges securities traded primarily on nasdaq will be valued at the nasdaq official closing price nocp if no nocp is available the security will generally be valued at the latest bid price as reported on nasdaq forward foreign currency contracts will generally be valued using market quotations from a widely used quotation system that reflects the current cost of covering or offsetting the contract exchangetraded options will generally be valued at the latest reported sale price on the exchange on which they trade if there is no reported sale for an option on the valuation date the option will generally be valued at the mean between the latest bid and asked prices overthecounter options will generally be valued using the mean between the latest bid and asked prices if market quotations are not readily available these instruments may be valued at fair value as determined in good faith by or in accordance with procedures adopted by the valuation committee debt securities will generally be valued by using a third party pricing system agent or dealer selected by the investment adviser which may include the use of valuations furnished by a pricing service that employs a matrix to determine valuations for normal institutional size trading units the board and the valuation committee will monitor periodically the reasonableness of valuations provided by any such pricing service debt securities with remaining maturities of  days or less absent unusual circumstances will be valued at amortized cost so long as such valuations are determined by the valuation committee to represent fair value prospective investors should be aware that situations involving uncertainties as to the value of portfolio positions could have an adverse effect on the companys nav if the judgments of this board the valuation committee the investment adviser or managers to the portfolio funds should prove incorrect limitations on certain deductions the company intends to engage in investment activities rather than in any active trade or business as a result noncapitalized expenses of the company eg fees paid to the investment adviser will represent miscellaneous itemized deductions for noncorporate taxpayers deductible only to the extent they exceed  percent of a taxpayers adjusted gross income overall itemized deductions for individual taxpayers are subject to further limitations moreover an investment in the company will not constitute a passive activity for purposes of the passive activity loss rules and a member will not be able to utilize losses and deductions from passive activities to offset the members share of the companys income and gain until the member disposes of its interest in the passive activity   b the code limits the ability of members to utilize other losses and deductions that may arise from the companys activities for instance allocations of loss or deduction from the company or the ability to utilize such allocations may be limited by a members adjusted capital account or its adjusted basis in its interest in the company additionally the use of capital losses is subject to significant limitations as is the use of deductions for investment interest should the company or portfolio funds use leverage in their investments individuals and certain closely held corporations are subject to the at risk rules that limit a members ability to utilize losses to the amount the taxpayer has at risk in the companys activities the companys organizational expenses may be amortizable only over a year period if at all certain expenses incurred by the company in offering and selling company interests will be nondeductible altogether disposition of interest in the company a members gain or loss upon a disposition of its interest in the company will typically be capital gain or loss longterm if the member holds the interest for more than one year except that gains or losses attributable to inventory or unrealized receivables defined broadly to include among others recapture items marketdiscount bonds shortterm obligations and stock in certain foreign corporations will be ordinary income or loss as described above the use of capital losses is subject to significant limitations taxexempt investors the discussion below addresses how certain investors such as taxexempt organizations qualified plans individual retirement accounts and annuities and state colleges and universities taxexempt investors may be subject to unrelated business income tax ubit due to the companys activities income from a trade or business regularly carried on that is unrelated to a taxexempt investors exempt purposes and income derived from debtfinanced property are subject to ubit if the portfolio funds invests in companies treated as partnerships for tax purposes a taxexempt investors distributive share of income earned by the company will be subject to ubit if such income would have been subject to ubit if earned directly by the taxexempt investor moreover certain income from foreign portfolio companies treated as corporations such as insurance income from controlled foreign corporations may be subject to ubit furthermore if a taxexempt investor debtfinances its investment in the company the company debtfinances its investment in a portfolio company or a portfolio fund uses leverage in its own investment activities some or all of the taxexempt investors distributive share of income from the company may be subject to ubit the company makes no assurance that taxexempt investors will not incur ubit as a result of their investment in the company each potential investor should consult an independent tax advisor regarding the ubit consequences of an investment in the company in light of the investors particular circumstances nonus investors the discussion below addresses the application of certain federal income tax laws to investors who are not united states citizens residents business entities estates or trusts nonus investors the application of the federal tax laws to nonus persons is complex and this summary does not address all aspects of those laws except to the extent of income effectively connected with a us trade or business in all cases to include the disposition of us real property or us real property holding corporations a nonus investors distributive share of the companys capital gains will not be subject to us tax and its distributive share of the companys dividends interest and certain other income will be subject only to a  percent withholding tax under certain circumstances the withholding tax may be reduced or eliminated if a nonus investor properly certifies to its entitlement to tax treaty benefits or the portfolio interest exception if the company a portfolio fund or a portfolio company treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes is deemed engaged in a us trade or business then a nonus investor will be deemed engaged in a us trade or business a nonus investor deemed engaged in a us trade or business is subject to federal income tax on any income effectively connected with that trade or business on similar terms and rates as a us person in those   b circumstances the company must withhold tax on the nonus investors distributive share of effectively connected income and the nonus investor must file a us tax return furthermore the nonus investor may be subject to us federal income tax on its gain from the disposition of its interest in company and if a corporation the nonus investor may be subject to an additional  percent branch profits tax on its earnings and profits effectively connected with the us trade or business the company makes no assurance that nonus investors will not be deemed engaged in a us trade or business as a result of their investment

erisa considerations persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an employee benefit plan ira keogh plan or other arrangement subject to the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa or the code an erisa plan should consider among other things the matters described below before determining whether to invest in the company erisa imposes certain general and specific responsibilities on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an erisa plan including prudence diversification prohibited transaction and other standards in determining whether a particular investment is appropriate for an erisa plan department of labor dol regulations provide that a fiduciary of an erisa plan must give appropriate consideration to among other things the role that the investment plays in the erisa plans portfolio taking into consideration whether the investment is designed reasonably to further the erisa plans purposes an examination of the risk and return factors the portfolios composition with regard to diversification the liquidity and current return of the total portfolio relative to the anticipated cash flow needs of the erisa plan the income tax consequences of the investment and the projected return of the total portfolio relative to the erisa plans funding objectives before investing the assets of an erisa plan in the company a fiduciary should determine whether such an investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities and the foregoing regulations for example a fiduciary should consider whether an investment in the company may be too illiquid or too speculative for a particular erisa plan and whether the assets of the erisa plan would be sufficiently diversified if a fiduciary with respect to any such erisa plan breaches his responsibilities with regard to selecting an investment or an investment course of action for such erisa plan the fiduciary may be held personally liable for losses incurred by the erisa plan as a result of such breach because the company will register as an investment company under the  act the underlying assets of the company should not be considered to be plan assets of the erisa plans investing in the company for purposes of erisas fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction rules thus the investment adviser will not be a fiduciary within the meaning of erisa the investment adviser will require an erisa plan proposing to invest in the company to represent that it and any fiduciaries responsible for the erisa plans investments are aware of and understand the companys investment objective policies and strategies that the decision to invest plan assets in the company was made with appropriate consideration of relevant investment factors with regard to the erisa plan and is consistent with the duties and responsibilities imposed upon fiduciaries with regard to their investment decisions under erisa certain prospective erisa plan investors may currently maintain relationships with the investment adviser or with other entities which are affiliated with the investment adviser each of such persons may be deemed to be a party in interest to andor a fiduciary of any erisa plan to which it provides investment management investment advisory or other services erisa prohibits erisa plan assets to be used for the benefit of a party in interest and also prohibits an erisa plan fiduciary from using its position to cause the erisa plan to make an investment from which it or certain third parties in which such fiduciary has an interest would receive a fee or other consideration erisa plan investors should consult with counsel to determine if participation in the company is a transaction which is prohibited by erisa or the code fiduciaries of erisa plan investors will be required to represent that the decision to invest in the company was made by them as fiduciaries independent of such affiliated persons and duly authorized to make such

investor meeting is generally called although determining whether or not to give consent may not be considered to be proxy voting such action is governed by this proxy voting policy it is also anticipated that frequently an underlying fund will request the ai group client either to vote in favor of measures that reduce the rights powers and authority andor increase the duties and obligations associated with the security in question adverse measures or to redeem its interests in the underlying fund it is expected that ai group portfolio management will ordinarily recommend voting a security in favor of an adverse measure only if        portfolio management believes that voting for the adverse measure is the only way to continue to hold such security and that their is a reasonable probability that the benefits that would be conferred on the affected ai group client by continuing to hold such security would outweigh the adverse affects of such adverse measure eg increased fees reduced liquidity and        adoption of such adverse measure would not result in such fund holding the related security in violation of its investment objectives policies or

daytoday portfolio management responsibilities with respect to more than one fund portfolio management team members may manage other accounts with investment strategies similar to the company including other investment companies pooled investment vehicles and separately managed accounts fees earned by the investment adviser may vary among these accounts and portfolio management team members may personally invest in these accounts these factors could create conflicts of interest because the portfolio management team members may have incentives to favor certain accounts over others that could result in other accounts outperforming the company a conflict may also exist if an portfolio management team member identifies a limited investment opportunity that may be appropriate for more than one account but the company is not able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to the need to allocate that opportunity among multiple accounts in addition a portfolio management team member may execute transactions for another account that may adversely impact the value of securities held by the company however the investment adviser believes that these risks are mitigated by the fact that accounts with like investment strategies managed by the portfolio management team members are generally managed in a similar fashion and the investment adviser has a policy that seeks to allocate opportunities on a fair and equitable basis a compensation structure of portfolio managers or management team members  as of march   each member of the portfolio management team is a senior

as defined in appendix b and “beneficial ownership” as defined in appendix a these terms are very broad for purposes of the code and may include transactions and securities that you intuitively would not expect to be included part i of this code sets forth certain general principals relating to the code part ii identifies certain prohibited transactions and activities part iii identifies your obligation to preclear your personal security transactions part iv    identifies your reporting obligations with respect to your personal securities transactions and holdings part v sets forth

capitalized have the meaning set forth in appendix b    part i – statement of general principles our relationship with our clients is fiduciary in nature a fiduciary has an affirmative duty of care loyalty honesty and good faith a number of specific obligations flow from the fiduciary duty we owe to our clients including to act solely in the best interests of clients and to make full and fair disclosure of all material facts particularly where the asset management business’ interest may conflict with those of its clients     •   to have a reasonable independent basis for our investment advice     •   to ensure that our investment advice is suitable to the client’s investment objectives needs and circumstances     •   to refrain from effecting personal securities transactions inconsistent with our clients’ interests     •   to obtain best execution for our clients’ securities transactions     •   to refrain from favoring the interest of a particular client over the interests of another client     •   to keep all information about clients including former clients confidential including the client’s identity client’s securities holdings information and other nonpublic information and     •   to exercise a high degree of care to ensure that adequate and accurate representations and other information is presented all covered persons are in a position of trust and that position of trust dictates that you act at all times with the utmost integrity avoid any actual or potential conflict of interest described below and not otherwise abuse that position of trust as a fiduciary you are required to put the interests of our clients before your personal interests all covered persons have a fiduciary duty with respect to each and all of our clients a conflict of interest is any situation that presents an incentive to act other than in the best interest of a client a conflict of interest may arise for example when a covered person engages in a transaction that potentially favors i bac’s interests over a client’s interest ii an associate’s interest over a client’s interest or iii one client’s interest over another client’s interest the asset management business has adopted various policies designed to prevent or otherwise manage conflicts of interest to effectively manage conflicts of interest all covered persons must seek to prevent conflicts of interest including the appearance of a conflict covered persons must be vigilant about circumstances that present a conflict of interest and immediately seek assistance from their manager or one of the other resources identified in part id of this code independence in the investment decisionmaking process is paramount all covered persons must avoid situations that might compromise or call into question their exercise of independent judgment in the interest of clients for example covered persons should not take personal advantage of unusual or limited investment opportunities appropriate for clients the general principles discussed in this section govern all conduct regardless of whether or not such conduct is also covered by more specific standards and procedures set forth in other sections of this code   a compliance with the spirit of the code sound responsible personal securities trading is an appropriate activity when it is not excessive in nature when it is conducted consistent with the code and when it does not cause any actual potential or apparent conflict of interest personal trading activity which is inconsistent with duties to our clients or which injures the reputation and professional standing of our organization will not be tolerated technical compliance with the specific requirements of this code will not insulate you from sanction should a review of your personal securities trades indicate breach of your duty of loyalty to a client or otherwise pose harm to our organization’s reputation the committee has the authority to grant written waivers of the provisions of this code it is expected that this authority will be exercised only in rare instances    b federal law prohibits fraudulent and deceptive acts all covered persons are required to comply with all federal securities laws including but not limited to rule a of the advisers act rule j of the investment company act and the antifraud provisions of both the advisers act and investment company act the advisers act makes it unlawful for any investment adviser directly or indirectly to employ any device scheme or artifice to defraud any client or prospective client or to engage in any transaction or practice that operates as a fraud or deceit on such persons the investment company act makes it unlawful for any director trustee officer or employee of an investment adviser of an investment company as well as certain other persons in connection with the purchase or sale directly or indirectly by such person of a security held or to be acquired by the investment company      to employ any device scheme or artifice to defraud the fund      to make to the fund any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state to the fund a material fact necessary in order to make the statements made in light of the circumstances under which they are made not misleading      to engage in any act practice or course of business which operates or would operate as a fraud or deceit upon the fund or      to engage in any manipulative practice with respect to the fund   c compliance with other bac policies compliance with this code is in addition to your obligation to comply with other bac policies that may be applicable to you including but not limited to those set forth on appendix c   d contacts for questions and reporting violations of this code each covered person must promptly report any conduct that he or she reasonably believes constitutes or may constitute a violation of the code covered persons must promptly report all relevant facts and circumstances relating to such potential violation of the code to either the cco currently linda wondrack at  or the ethics and compliance helpline at  domestic or  international if you wish to remain anonymous you may simply refer to yourself as a “bac associate” you will not be retaliated against for reporting information in good faith in accordance with this policy all questions comments or concerns may be directed to columbia management’s ombudsperson currently kevin v wasp at  in addition if you have any questions relating to a personal securities transaction you may call the associate

columbia management’s conflicts of interest officer directly currently lee faria at    e training and education training on this code will occur periodically all covered persons are required to attend all training sessions and read any applicable materials    part ii – prohibited transactions and activities part ii of the code focuses on personal securities trading and identifies certain prohibited transactions and activities in the event there is a stated exception to a prohibited transaction and you qualify for the exception you are not relieved of any other obligation you may have under this code including any requirement to preclear and report the transaction   a prohibited transactions in mutual funds    shortterm trading prohibition no covered person shall engage in a personal securities transaction that involves the purchase and subsequent sale or exchange of the same class of shares of a reportable fund within  calendar days of one another therefore if a covered person purchases shares of a reportable fund he or she will not be permitted to sell or exchange any shares of that fund including shares previously purchased for at least  calendar days the cco has the authority to grant exceptions to the requirements of this section however such exceptions will be granted in only rare cases of hardship or other unusual circumstances    late trading prohibition late trading of mutual funds is illegal no covered person shall engage in any transaction in any mutual fund shares where the order is placed after the fund is closed for the day and the transaction is priced using the closing price for that day in addition to being illegal late trading presents a conflict of interest and a violation of fiduciary duty    market timing prohibition no covered person shall engage in mutual fund market timing activities the committee believes that the interests of a mutual fund’s longterm shareholders and the ability of a mutual fund to manage its investments may be adversely affected when fund shares are repeatedly bought sold or exchanged by any individual or entity within short periods of time to take advantage of shortterm differentials in the net asset values of such funds this practice known as “market timing” can occur in direct purchases and sales of mutual fund shares through rapid reallocation of funds held in a k plan or similarly structured retirement plan or other accounts invested in mutual fund assets or through the rapid reallocation of funds held in variable annuity and variable life policies invested in mutual fund assets in addition to being prohibited by this code mutual fund market timing presents a conflict of interest and is a violation of fiduciary duty   b prohibited transactions in reportable securities    client conflict no covered person shall engage in a personal securities transaction that involves the purchase or sale of a reportable security seven days before or seven days after such security is purchased or sold by a client account when such covered person has advance knowledge that such security will be purchased or sold by a client account whether a covered person has “advance knowledge” will depend upon the facts and circumstances and such knowledge may be imputed where the facts and circumstance indicate that a prudent person would conclude that there is a reasonable probability that a client account may transact in the security certain types of covered persons such as portfolio managers traders and analysts will be subject to heightened scrutiny for compliance with this section no covered person shall engage in a personal securities transaction that involves the purchase or sale of any reportable security when at the time of such purchase or sale the covered person knew or should have known that the same class of security is the subject of an open buy or sell order for a client account or is being considered for purchase or sale by a client account these restrictions do not apply     •   to securities of an issuer that has a market capitalization of  billion or more at the time of the transactions or      •   when the personal trade matches with a client account which principally follows a passive investment strategy of attempting to replicate the performance of an index    ipos and limited offerings no covered person shall engage in a personal securities transaction that involves the purchase of a security in an ipo or limited offering except with the prior written approval of the cco covered persons registered with the nasd are prohibited from investing in ipos in approving such purchase the cco will consider whether the purchase conflicts with the code or its underlying policies whether the investment opportunity should be reserved for clients and whether the opportunity has been offered to the covered person because of the covered person’s relationship with a client the cco may approve acquisition under certain circumstances such as     •   an opportunity to acquire securities of an insurance company converting from a mutual ownership structure to a stockholder ownership structure if the covered person’s ownership of an insurance policy issued by the ipo company or an affiliate of the ipo company conveys the investment opportunity     •   an opportunity resulting from the covered person’s preexisting ownership of an interest in the ipo company or status of an investors in the ipo company or     •   an opportunity made available to the covered person’s spouse in circumstances permitting the cco reasonably to determine that the opportunity is being made available for reasons other than the covered person’s relationship with bac or its clients for example because of the spouse’s employment    shortterm trading  calendar days  no covered person shall engage in a personal securities transaction that results in a profit from any purchase and sale or any sale and purchase of the same class of reportable security within any period of  calendar days or less note regarding this restriction that     a the  calendar day restriction period commences the day after the purchase or sale of any reportable security     b the day restriction applies on a “last in first out basis” as a result any transaction that results in a profit from any purchase and sale or any sale and purchase of the same class of reportable security within any period of  calendar days or less is prohibited regardless of whether the specific shares involved were held longer than  days     c purchase and sale transactions in the same security within  days that result in a loss are not restricted     d the day restriction does not apply to the exercise of options to purchase shares of bac stock and the immediate sale of the same or identical shares including socalled “cashless exercise” transactions     e strategies involving options with expirations of less than  days may result in violations of the shortterm trading ban     f exceptions to the shortterm trading ban may be requested in writing addressed to the cco in advance of a trade and will generally be granted only in rare cases of hardship gifting of securities or other unusual circumstances where it is determined that no abuse is involved and the equities of the situation strongly support an exception to the ban circumstances that could provide the basis for an exception from shortterm trading restriction might include for example among others     •   an involuntary transaction that is the result of unforeseen corporate activity     •   the disclosure of a previously nonpublic material corporate economic or political event or activity that could cause a reasonable person in like circumstances to sell a security even if originally purchased as a longterm investment or      •   the covered person’s economic circumstances materially change in such a manner that enforcement of the shortterm trading ban would result in the covered person being subjected to an avoidable inequitable economic hardship     •   an irrevocable gift of securities provided no abuse is intended    bank of america closedend funds no covered person shall engage in a personal securities transaction that involves the purchase of shares of any closedend fund advised by bac except with the prior written approval of compliance    excessive trading covered

who purchase interests will be admitted to the company by the investment adviser and will become members of the company the “members” investment objective the investment objective of the company is longterm capital appreciation neither the company nor the investment adviser guarantees any level of return or risk on investments and there can be no assurance that the investment objective will be achieved however it is the expectation that the company will generate a total return over the life of the company that will exceed the return of the global public equities market and compensate the investor for the additional risk taken by investing in private equity funds formed by fund sponsors experienced in making private equity investments “portfolio funds” diversification benefits based on vintage years although possible are not an objective of the company   a investment philosophy the investment adviser is guided by a set of principles that it believes is essential to make successful private equity investments they are outlined as follows      developing a private equity allocation is a longterm process that requires an investor to continuously and selectively commit capital to private equity investments      building successful private equity portfolios requires skillful management of risks associated with portfolio cash flows manager selection and concentrations among strategies vintage years portfolio funds fund sponsors geographies and industries      attractive private equity returns are generated by investing in funds managed by professionals with demonstrated track record of success across multiple market industry technology and innovation cycles      investors are better served by investing in portfolio funds that exhibit a strong alignment of interest with their investors as expressed in the terms of the portfolio fund’s limited partnership agreement and the manner in which the fund sponsor manages its organization      given the longterm illiquid nature of private equity investing investors should have a strong appreciation for the potential risk presented by each portfolio fund investment      maintain a value orientation when allocating among private equity strategies and selecting portfolio funds investment strategy the company will seek to achieve its objective by pursuing a strategy of committing at least  of commitments in portfolio funds private equity funds may include portfolio funds pursuing investment strategies in buyouts venture capital and special situations distressed debt mezzanine secondaries natural resources opportunistic real estate royalties and other private equity strategies perceived to be attractive by the investment adviser such funds often have a focus on one or more industry country region or investmentrelated themes such funds seek to generate returns primarily through longterm capital appreciation however at times some portfolio funds may generate some current income and shortterm capital appreciation the company will seek to identify six to fifteen portfolio funds within eighteen months of the company’s final closing the company will leverage the relationships established by the investment adviser among private equity fund sponsors to gain access to attractive portfolio funds the investment adviser will employ a proactive disciplined and diligent investment process by which prospective portfolio funds will be sourced reviewed and selected   a the company will seek to tactically overweight or underweight its allocation to the various private equity strategies perceived by the investment adviser to be more or less attractive from an expected risk and return perspective tactical allocations are influenced by a valueoriented perspective with regards to capital flows within a private equity strategy valuations for new investments to be made by portfolio funds risk within transaction structures expectations for change within a strategy over the nearterm and perceived attractiveness for a private equity strategy the exposures to specific private equity strategies will also be influenced by the investment adviser’s ability to gain access to toptier fund sponsors in a specific strategy although the investment adviser may target specific strategies regions or industries for investment the investment adviser will not compromise on the caliber of the fund sponsors pursued for investment in order to make an allocation to a targeted strategy the chart below  presents the expected private equity strategy allocations for the company in

that the positions created by the portfolio funds selected for the company will create a portfolio with the allocations described above the investment adviser does not control and does not have influence on the investment activity of the fund sponsors investing the capital of the portfolio funds the investment adviser’s expected allocations to each portfolio fund will be guided by the historical investment activity and the expected investment activity as articulated by the fund sponsors in the offering memoranda and accompanying due diligence information for their respective portfolio funds investment policies and restrictions the company has adopted certain fundamental investment restrictions which cannot be changed without the vote of a majority of the company’s outstanding voting securities as defined by the  act the company’s fundamental investment restrictions are as follows      the company will not invest  or more of the value of its total assets in the securities other than us government securities of issuers engaged in any single industry this restriction does not apply to the company’s investments in portfolio funds   a    the company will not issue senior securities representing stock except that to the extent permitted by the  act a the company may borrow money from banks brokers and other lenders to finance portfolio transactions and engage in other transactions involving the issuance by the company of “senior securities” representing indebtedness and b the company may borrow money from banks for temporary or emergency purposes

through the portfolio funds in addition if a percentage restriction is adhered to at the time of an investment or transaction a later change in percentage resulting from a change in the values of investments or the value of the company’s total assets unless otherwise stated will not constitute a violation of such restriction or policy   a risk factors in considering participation in the company the prospective investors should be aware of certain risk factors which include the following      business and market risks the company’s investment portfolio will consist of portfolio funds which will hold securities issued primarily by privately held companies and operating results for the portfolio companies in a specified period will be difficult to predict such investments involve a high degree of business and financial risk that can result in substantial losses      lack of operating history the company is a newly formed entity and has no operating history upon which prospective investors can evaluate its performance the investment program of the company should be evaluated on the basis that there can be no assurance that the investment adviser’s assessment of the shortterm or longterm prospects of investments will prove accurate or that the company will achieve its investment objectives past performance of the managers of the portfolio funds is no indication of future performance      dependence on the investment adviser the success of the company is significantly dependent upon the ability of the investment adviser to achieve the company’s investment objectives the performance of the investment adviser’s prior investments is not necessarily indicative of the company’s future results      investment in junior securities the securities in which each portfolio fund will invest may be among the most junior in a portfolio company’s capital structure and thus subject to the greatest risk of loss generally there will be no collateral to protect an investment once made      leveraged investments a portfolio fund’s investments depending upon its strategy may be in companies whose capital structures are highly leveraged such investments involve a high degree of risk in that adverse fluctuations in the cash flow of such companies or increased interest rates may impair their ability to meet their obligations which may accelerate and magnify declines in the value of any such portfolio company investments in a down market      limited transferability of interests there will be no public market for the interests and none is expected to develop there are substantial restrictions upon the transferability of interests under the limited liability company agreement of the company the “company agreement” and applicable securities laws   a    diversificationconcentration of investments the company is a “nondiversified” investment company thus there are no percentage limitations imposed by the  act on the percentage of the company’s assets that may be invested in the securities of any one issuer however the company generally will not commit more than  of the value of its total commitments measured at the time of commitment in the securities of a single portfolio fund the investment adviser believes that this approach helps to reduce overall investment risk in addition each portfolio fund will participate in a limited number of investments and may seek to make several investments in one industry or one industry segment as a result each portfolio fund’s investment portfolio could become highly concentrated and the performance of a few holdings may substantially affect its aggregate return furthermore to the extent that the capital raised is less than the targeted amount a portfolio fund may invest in fewer portfolio companies and thus be less diversified      illiquidity lack of current distributions an investment in the company is illiquid it is uncertain as to when profits if any will be realized losses on unsuccessful investments may be realized before gains on successful investments are realized the return of capital and the realization of gains if any generally will occur only upon the partial or complete disposition of an underlying investment by a portfolio fund while an investment may be sold at any time it is not generally expected that this will occur for a number of years after the initial investment before such time there may be no current return on the investment due to the pattern of cash flows in private equity funds and the illiquid nature of their investments investors typically will see negative returns in the company’s early stages in particular it can take several years for portfolio fund investments to be realized during which time management fees will be continued to be drawn from committed capital and certain underperforming investments may be written down or written off then as investments are able to realize liquidity events such as a sale or initial public offering positive returns will be realized if the portfolio fund is successful in achieving its investment strategy      absence of regulatory oversight the portfolio funds will not be registered as investment companies under the  act and the company as an investor in these portfolio funds will not have the benefit of the protection afforded by the  act to investors in registered investment companies which among other protections require investment companies to have a majority of disinterested directors require securities held in custody at all times to be individually segregated from the securities of any other person and marked to clearly identify such securities as the property of such investment company and regulate the relationship between the adviser and the investment company      tax laws subject to change it is possible that the current federal state local or foreign income tax treatment accorded an investment in the company will be modified by legislative administrative or judicial action in the future the nature of additional changes in federal or nonus income tax law if any cannot be determined prior to enactment of any new tax legislation however such   a legislation could significantly alter the tax consequences and decrease the after tax rate of return of an investment in the company potential investors therefore should seek and must rely on the advice of their own tax advisers with respect to the possible impact on their investments of recent legislation as well as any future proposed tax legislation or administrative or judicial action      inkind distributions portfolio funds may make inkind distributions to the company and particularly in the event of a dissolution of a portfolio fund such distribution may contain securities which are not readily marketable while the general policy of the company will be to liquidate such investment and distribute proceeds to the members under certain circumstances when deemed appropriate by the board a member may receive inkind distributions from the company      projections projected operating results of a company in which a portfolio fund invests normally will be based primarily on financial projections prepared by each company’s management in all cases projections are only estimates of future results that are based upon information received from the company and assumptions made at the time the projections are developed there can be no assurance that the results are set forth in the projections will be attained and actual results may be significantly different from the projections also general economic factors which are not predictable can have a material effect on the reliability of projections      carried interest the carried interest held by the special member or equivalent of a portfolio fund may create an incentive for the investment adviser to make high risk portfolio investments in hope of achieving a larger return for the holder of the carried interest      need for followon investments following its initial investment in a given portfolio company a portfolio fund may decide to provide additional funds to such portfolio company or may have the opportunity to increase its investment in a successful portfolio company there is no assurance that a portfolio fund will make followon investments or that a portfolio fund will have sufficient funds to make all or any of such investments any decision by a portfolio fund not to make followon investments or its inability to make such investments i may have a subsequent negative effect on a portfolio company in need of such an investment ii result in a lost opportunity for a portfolio fund to increase its participation in a successful operation or iii result in a loss of certain antidilution protection      nonus investments the company may invest in a portfolio fund that is organized outside of the united states or a portfolio fund may invest in portfolio companies that are organized or have substantial sales or operations outside of the united states such investments may be subject to certain additional risk due to among other things potentially unsettled points of applicable   a governing law the risks associated with fluctuating currency exchange rates capital repatriation regulations the application of complex us and foreign tax rules to crossborder investments and imposition of foreign taxes on the company andor the members      independent counsel no independent counsel has been retained to represent the interests of the members neither the registration statement nor the company agreement has been reviewed by any attorney on behalf of the members legal counsel to the company and investment adviser does not represent any member      increased regulatory scrutiny in the environment following the events of september   the company and the investment adviser expect increased scrutiny by government regulators investigators auditors and law enforcement officials regarding the identities and sources of funds of investors in private investment funds in that connection in the future the company may become subject to additional obligations such as reporting requirements regarding its investors including without limitation such requirements and restrictions as may apply under the uniting and strengthening america by providing appropriate tools required to intercept and obstruct terrorism act of  the “patriot act” each member will be required to provide to the company such information as may be required to enable the company to comply with all applicable legal or regulatory requirements including without limitation the requirements of the patriot act andor all rules and regulations related thereto and each member will be required to acknowledge and agree that the company may disclose such information to governmental andor regulatory or selfregulatory authorities to the extent required by applicable law or regulation and may file such reports with such authorities as may be required by applicable law or regulation if required by applicable law regulation or interpretation thereof the company may suspend all activity with respect to a member’s account with the company including suspending the member’s right to redeem funds or assets from the company pending the company’s receipt of instructions regarding the member’s account from the appropriate governmental or regulatory authority      private offering exemption this offering has not been registered under the securities act in reliance on the exemptive provisions of section  of the securities act and regulation d promulgated thereunder section bd of the securities act added by the national securities markets improvement act of  preempts state registration of transactions in securities exempt pursuant to “rules and regulations issued by the sec under section  of the securities act” preemption therefore applies to transactions exempt under regulation d but not to transactions exempt under section  alone because of the lack of uniformity among the state’s securities laws and their general complicated nature the company has chosen not to incur the expense and burden of reviewing exemptions under each state’s laws but rather rely on the uniform exemption provided by regulation d   a no assurance can be given that the offering currently qualifies or will continue to qualify under the exemptive provisions of regulation d because of among other things the adequacy of disclosure and the manner of distribution the timeliness of filings the existence of similar offerings in the past or in the future or the retroactive change of any securities law or regulation if the regulation d exemption is lost the company may not be able to avail itself of other state exemptions and successful claims or suits for rescission may be brought and successfully concluded for failure to register these offerings or for acts or omissions constituting offenses under the exchange act or applicable state securities laws      manager liability in certain circumstances each portfolio fund is expected to receive the right to appoint a representative to the board of directors of the companies in which it invests serving on the board of directors of a portfolio company exposes the portfolio fund’s representatives and ultimately the portfolio fund to potential liability although portfolio companies often have insurance to protect directors and officers from such liability not all portfolio companies may obtain such insurance which may be insufficient if obtained      public company holdings a portfolio fund’s investment portfolio may contain securities issued by publicly held companies such investments may subject the portfolio fund to risks that differ in type or degree from those involved with investments in privately held companies such risks include without limitation greater volatility in the valuation of such companies increased obligations to disclose information regarding such companies limitations on the ability of the portfolio fund to dispose of such securities at certain times increased likelihood of shareholder litigation against such companies’ board members and increased costs associated with each of the aforementioned risks      delayed schedule ks the company will not be able to provide final schedule ks to members for any given fiscal year until after april  of the following year investors should be prepared for a substantial delay in receiving final schedule ks the final schedule ks will not be available until the company has received taxreporting information from its portfolio funds necessary to prepare final schedule ks members will likely be required to obtain extensions of the filing dates for their us federal state and local income tax returns members will be responsible for any and all costs and fees incurred by them in connection with obtaining the tax extensions each prospective investor should consult with its own adviser as to the advisability and tax consequences of an investment in the company portfolio funds and their portfolio companies may engage in business otherwise derive income from and in general be subject to taxing authority in numerous state local and foreign jurisdictions members by virtue of their participation in the company may be subject to tax payment and reporting obligations in such jurisdictions under their widely varying rules and regulations each investor should consult an independent adviser regarding how an investment in the company may affect his her or its state local and foreign tax payment and reporting obligations   a    risks of private equity investments generally the investments made by the portfolio funds will entail a high degree of risk and in most cases be highly illiquid and difficult to value unless and until those investments are sold or mature into marketable securities they will remain illiquid in addition to the extent a portfolio fund focuses on venture capital investments the companies in which the portfolio fund will invest may be in a conceptual or early stage of development may not have a proven operating history may offer services or products that are not yet developed or ready to be marketed or that have no established market may be operating at a loss or have significant fluctuations in operating results may be engaged in a rapidly changing business may require substantial additional capital to support their operations to finance expansion or to maintain their competitive position or otherwise may have a weak financial condition as a general matter companies in which the portfolio fund invests may face intense competition including competition from companies with far greater financial resources more extensive research development technological marketing and other capabilities and a larger number of qualified managerial and technical personnel      capital contributions the company has not yet identified all of the potential investments that it will make with the capital contributions only certain amounts of capital commitments will be drawndown and the investor’s full capital commitment will not be immediately invested it may take a significant amount of time to fully invest the committed amounts approximately  years the company’s performance will only include any commitments that have been drawndown thus an investor’s individual performance will be lower than the performance of the company      default the company will not always contribute the full amount of its commitment to a portfolio fund at the time of its admission to the portfolio fund instead the company will be required to make incremental contributions pursuant to capital calls issued from time to time by the portfolio fund if the company defaults on its commitment or fails to satisfy capital calls in a timely manner then generally it will be subject to significant penalties including the complete forfeiture of the company’s investment in the portfolio fund any failure by the company to make timely capital contributions in respect of its commitments may i impair the ability of the company to pursue its investment program ii force the company to borrow iii cause the company and indirectly the investors to be subject to certain penalties from the portfolio funds including the complete forfeiture of the company’s investment in a portfolio fund or iv otherwise impair the value of the company’s investments including the complete devaluation of the company similarly investors will not contribute the full amount of their commitments to the company at the time of their admission investors will be required to make incremental contributions pursuant to capital calls issued from time to time by the company unlike the portfolio funds the company will have limited recourse in retrieving undrawn commitments in the instance that an investor defaults on a commitment an investor or investors that defaults on hisheritstheir commitment to the company may cause the company to inturn default on   a its commitment to a portfolio fund thus the company and especially the nondefaulting investors will bear the penalties of such default as outlined above including but not limited to the complete forfeiture of the company’s investment in a portfolio fund and the complete devaluation of the company while the investment adviser has taken steps to mitigate this risk including seeking commitments from investors that exceed the commitments that are made to the portfolio funds there is no guarantee that such measures will be sufficient or successful      recall of distributions the company may be subject to terms of the portfolio funds which permit the recall of distributions to meet company obligations in the event funds are recalled for this purpose the company may in turn require members to return amounts previously distributed to them   item  management   item a board of managers the company’s board of managers the “board” or “managers” has overall

may arise should members of the investment committee have daytoday portfolio management responsibilities with respect to more than one fund committee members may manage other accounts with investment strategies similar to the company including other investment companies pooled investment vehicles and separately managed accounts fees earned by the investment adviser may vary among these accounts and investment committee members may personally invest in these accounts these factors could create conflicts of interest because the investment committee members may have incentives to favor certain accounts over others that could result in other accounts outperforming the company a conflict may also exist if investment committee members identifies a limited investment opportunity that may be appropriate for more than one account but the company is not able to take full advantage of that opportunity due to the need to allocate that opportunity among multiple accounts in addition a team member may execute transactions for another account that may adversely impact the value of securities held by the company however the investment adviser believes that these risks are mitigated by the fact that accounts with like investment strategies managed by the investment committee members are generally managed in a similar fashion and the investment advisor has a policy that seeks to allocate opportunities on a fair and equitable basis the investment committee’s compensation consists of a combination of a fixed salary and a discretionary bonus the discretionary bonus is not tied directly to the value of assets of the company or any other fund managed by the investment adviser the discretionary bonus is not tied directly to the performance of the company however the company’s performance is a factor in the amount of bonus paid to members of the investment committee additional factors include without limitation the financial performance of the investment adviser execution of managerial responsibilities client interactions support and general teamwork the investment   b committee currently is not allocated any portion of the carried interest however members of the investment committee may in the future be allocated a portion of the carried interest as of the date of this registration statement no one owns interests   item  brokerage allocation and other practices each portfolio fund’s manager is directly responsible for placing orders for the execution of portfolio transactions for the portfolio fund that it manages and for the allocation of brokerage transactions on us stock exchanges and on some foreign stock exchanges involve the payment of negotiated brokerage commissions on many foreign stock exchanges commissions are fixed no stated commission is generally applicable to securities traded in overthecounter markets but the prices of those securities include undisclosed commissions or markups in selecting brokers and dealers to execute transactions on behalf of a portfolio fund it is expected that each portfolio fund manager will generally seek to obtain the best price and execution for the transactions taking into account factors such as price size of order difficulty of execution and operational facilities of a brokerage firm the scope and quality of brokerage services provided and the firm’s risk in positioning a block of securities although it is expected that each portfolio fund manager generally will seek reasonably competitive commission rates a portfolio fund manager will not necessarily pay the lowest commission available on each transaction the portfolio fund managers will typically have no obligation to deal with any broker or group of brokers in executing transactions in portfolio securities brokerage practices adopted by portfolio fund managers with respect to portfolio funds may vary and will be governed by each portfolio fund’s organizational documents consistent with the principle of seeking best price and execution a portfolio fund manager may place orders for a portfolio fund with brokers that provide the portfolio fund manager and its affiliates with supplemental research market and statistical information including advice as to the value of securities the advisability of investing in purchasing or selling securities and the availability of securities or purchasers or sellers of securities and furnishing analyses and reports concerning issuers industries securities economic factors and trends portfolio strategy and the performance of accounts the expenses of the portfolio fund managers are not necessarily reduced as a result of the receipt of this supplemental information which may be useful to the portfolio fund managers or their affiliates in providing services to clients other than the portfolio funds in addition not all of the supplemental information is necessarily used by a portfolio fund manager in connection with the portfolio fund it manages conversely the information provided to a portfolio fund manager by brokers and dealers through which other clients of the portfolio fund manager or its affiliates effect securities transactions may be useful to the portfolio fund manager in providing services to the portfolio fund based on representations in the portfolio funds’ offering documents the company generally believes that portfolio funds will follow practices similar to those described above the company has no control over portfolio fund brokerage arrangements or operations and there is a risk of portfolio fund misconduct   b item  tax status the following is a summary of certain aspects of the income taxation of the company that should be considered by a prospective investor the company has not sought a ruling from the internal revenue service or any other federal state or local agency with respect to any of the tax issues affecting the company further the company has not obtained an opinion of counsel with respect to any federal tax issues other than the characterization of the company as a partnership for federal income tax purposes this discussion is based on the company’s intended plan of operation applying the federal income tax laws as currently in effect as contained in the internal revenue code “code” treasury regulations and relevant judicial decisions and administrative guidance the federal tax laws are subject to change and any such change may materially affect the tax consequences of an investment in the company neither the investment adviser nor its counsel has any continuing duty to advise the company or any member of any changes in the tax law that may affect any party or cause any part of this discussion to become inaccurate no rulings or opinions of counsel except as noted above with respect to the company’s partnership status have been or will be requested with respect to any taxrelated matter discussed herein there can be no assurance that the positions the company takes on its tax returns will be accepted by the internal revenue service “irs” this discussion relates only to us federal income taxes and not to any local state or foreign taxes or us federal taxes other than income taxes because this discussion is a general summary it does not address all aspects of federal income taxation that may be relevant to a particular investor in light of the investor’s particular circumstances nor does it address unless explicitly noted and only to the extent so noted certain types of investors subject to special treatment under the federal income tax laws including but not limited to taxexempt organizations insurance companies financial institutions brokerdealers dealers in securities or currencies traders in securities that elect to use the marktomarket method of accounting for their securities partners who are themselves partnerships or other passthrough entities for federal income tax purposes regulated investment companies real estate investment companies real estate mortgage investment conduits expatriates persons liable for alternative minimum tax persons whose “functional currency” is not the us dollar persons holding their investment as part of a hedging constructive sale or conversion straddle or other riskreducing transaction and persons acquiring their interests in the company in connection with the performance of services except as otherwise explicitly noted under “nonus investors” below this summary addresses only individual citizens or residents of the united states corporations or other business entities organized under the laws of the united states any state or the district of columbia estates with income subject to united states federal income tax or trusts subject to primary supervision by a united states court or for which united states persons control all substantial decisions portions of this discussion address the ability of investors to utilize items of loss or deduction allocated to them by the company potential investors are cautioned that the company will not be operated for the purpose of generating tax deductions losses credits or other benefits investors should not anticipate that an investment in the company will yield items of deduction loss or credit to offset items of income or gain from other sources   b potential investors should consult with their own tax advisers in order to understand the federal state local and foreign income tax consequences of an investment in the company the company’s tax status the company intends to be treated as a partnership for federal income tax purposes and the company’s legal counsel will provide an opinion to investors that the company will be so treated as a partnership the company will not be subject to federal income tax instead each member will be required annually to take into account its respective distributive share of the company’s items of taxable income gain loss deduction and credit without regard to whether any distributions are made by the company generally ordinary income or loss earned or incurred by the company will be ordinary income or loss to the members and capital gain or loss earned or incurred by the company will be capital gain or loss to the members distributive shares of income gain loss deduction and credit are allocated in accordance with the company agreement the company expects that such allocations will be respected by the irs as either having “substantial economic effect” and complying with other regulatory safe harbor provisions or being determined in accordance with a “partner’s interest in the partnership” however the regulations regarding when allocations are respected for tax purposes are very complex and there can be no assurance that the allocations described in the company agreement will be respected by the irs generally distributions received by a member from the company as opposed to allocations of taxable income or loss will only be taxable to the extent a member receives money in excess of the member’s basis in its company interest the company expects to qualify as an “investment partnership” within the meaning of section cc of the code as long as the company does not actively and substantially participate in the management of any portfolio fund or hold  percent or more of the total capital and profits interests in any portfolio fund if the company does not so qualify a member receiving a distribution of marketable securities from the company may recognize taxable gain to the extent the fair market value of the distributed securities plus any distributed money exceeds the member’s basis in its units a member selling appreciated securities distributed to it taxfree by the company will generally recognize taxable gain based on the total appreciation in the value of the securities subject to certain adjustments and exceptions in the case of a distribution in liquidation of a member’s interest in the company including such appreciation that accrued while the securities were held by the company the company will file us federal partnership information returns reporting its operations for each fiscal year the company also will provide members with statements to assist members in determining and reporting on their federal income tax returns items of taxable income gain loss deduction and credit arising from their investment in the company because the company must receive taxreporting information from the portfolio funds and await the results of its annual audit before it can prepare such statements the company will not be able to provide taxreporting statements to the members until significantly after april  of each year members must be prepared to obtain extensions for filing their us federal state and local income tax returns each year   b investments in portfolio funds the company expects to invest in portfolio funds rather than directly engage in any business operations the company anticipates but can provide no assurance that the portfolio funds will be treated as partnerships for federal income tax purposes and will in turn invest in the equity or debt securities of portfolio companies assuming for the remainder of this discussion that this is so the federal income tax consequences of the company’s investment in a portfolio fund will depend heavily on the structure and other circumstances of the portfolio companies selected by portfolio funds beyond its ability to choose among portfolio funds in which to invest the company will have no control over the portfolio funds and their choice of investments therefore members must be prepared for allocations presenting a wide variety of federal income tax consequences to the extent portfolio funds invest in domestic portfolio companies taxed as corporations unlike those taxed as partnerships such companies are subject to federal income tax and will report separately their income gains losses deductions and credits on their own tax return interest or dividends earned from such portfolio companies will generally be ordinary income generally the federal income tax consequences of a portfolio fund’s disposition of investments in domestic portfolio companies will depend on whether the portfolio fund is treated as an investor or trader ie realizing capital gains or losses or a dealer ie realizing ordinary income or loss for tax purposes to the extent portfolio funds invest in domestic portfolio companies taxed as partnerships such portfolio companies like the company itself will not be subject to federal income tax the portfolio funds and indirectly the company and the members themselves must take into account for tax purposes a distributive share of such a portfolio company’s items of taxable income gain loss deduction and credit without regard to whether the portfolio company ever makes distributions moreover the portfolio funds company and members will be deemed engaged in any trade or business carried on by a portfolio company taxed as a partnership as noted above the federal income tax consequences of a portfolio fund’s disposition of investments in domestic portfolio companies will depend on whether the portfolio fund is treated as an investor trader or a dealer for tax purposes in addition when disposing of a domestic portfolio company treated as a partnership gain or loss attributable to inventory or unrealized receivables defined broadly to include among others recapture items marketdiscount bonds shortterm obligations and stock in certain foreign corporations that might otherwise be capital gain will instead be ordinary income or loss to the extent the portfolio funds invest in foreign entities the tax consequences will vary widely depending on the jurisdiction and structure of the portfolio company foreign portfolio companies treated as corporations for us federal income tax purposes may be classified as “controlled foreign corporations” or “passive foreign investment companies” under the code subject to a variety of unfavorable federal income tax consequences including but not limited to accelerating the timing of taxable income to the members or altering the character ie ordinary vs capital gain of a member’s income gains or losses from certain foreign currency transactions attributable to exchange rate fluctuations are treated as ordinary income or loss in addition to taxing the portfolio company’s operations foreign jurisdictions may impose withholding taxes on dividends interest or other payments to the portfolio funds subject to numerous limitations members may be entitled to a credit or deduction for their share of such withholding taxes and certain other foreign taxes incurred by the portfolio funds or the company   b portfolio funds and their portfolio companies may engage in business in otherwise derive income from and in general be subject to taxing authority in numerous state local and foreign jurisdictions members by virtue of their participation in the company may be subject to tax payment and reporting obligations in such jurisdictions under their widely varying rules and regulations each investor should consult an independent adviser regarding how an investment in the company may affect his her or its state local and foreign tax payment and reporting obligations limitations on certain deductions the company intends to engage in investment activities rather than in any active trade or business as a result noncapitalized expenses of the company eg fees paid to the investment adviser will represent “miscellaneous itemized deductions” for noncorporate taxpayers deductible only to the extent they exceed  percent of a taxpayer’s adjusted gross income overall itemized deductions for individual taxpayers are subject to further limitations moreover an investment in the company will not constitute a “passive activity” for purposes of the passive activity loss rules and a member will not be able to utilize losses and deductions from passive activities to offset the member’s share of the company’s income and gain until the member disposes of its interest in the passive activity the code limits the ability of members to utilize other losses and deductions that may arise from the company’s activities for instance allocations of loss or deduction from the company or the ability to utilize such allocations may be limited by a member’s adjusted capital account or its adjusted basis in its interest in the company additionally the use of capital losses is subject to significant limitations as is the use of deductions for “investment interest” should the company or portfolio funds use leverage in their investments individuals and certain closely held corporations are subject to the “at risk” rules that limit a member’s ability to utilize losses to the amount the taxpayer has at risk in the company’s activities the company’s organizational expenses may be amortizable only over a year period if at all certain expenses incurred by the company in offering and selling company interests will be nondeductible altogether disposition of interest in the company a member’s gain or loss upon a disposition of its interest in the company will typically be capital gain or loss longterm if the member holds the interest for more than one year except that gains or losses attributable to inventory or unrealized receivables defined broadly to include among others recapture items marketdiscount bonds shortterm obligations and stock in certain foreign corporations will be ordinary income or loss as described above the use of capital losses is subject to significant limitations taxexempt investors the discussion below addresses how certain investors such as taxexempt organizations qualified plans individual retirement accounts and annuities and state colleges and universities “taxexempt investors” may be subject to unrelated business income tax “ubit” due to the company’s activities   b income from a trade or business regularly carried on that is unrelated to a taxexempt investor’s exempt purposes and income derived from debtfinanced property are subject to ubit if the portfolio funds invests in companies treated as partnerships for tax purposes a taxexempt investor’s distributive share of income earned by the company will be subject to ubit if such income would have been subject to ubit if earned directly by the taxexempt investor moreover certain income from foreign portfolio companies treated as corporations such as insurance income from controlled foreign corporations may be subject to ubit furthermore if a taxexempt investor debtfinances its investment in the company the company debtfinances its investment in a portfolio company or a portfolio fund uses leverage in its own investment activities some or all of the taxexempt investor’s distributive share of income from the company may be subject to ubit the company makes no assurance that taxexempt investors will not incur ubit as a result of their investment in the company each potential investor should consult an independent tax advisor regarding the ubit consequences of an investment in the company in light of the investor’s particular circumstances nonus investors the discussion below addresses the application of certain federal income tax laws to investors who are not united states citizens residents business entities estates or trusts “nonus investors” the application of the federal tax laws to nonus persons is complex and this summary does not address all aspects of those laws except to the extent of income “effectively connected” with a us trade or business in all cases to include the disposition of us real property or us real property holding corporations a nonus investor’s distributive share of the company’s capital gains will not be subject to us tax and its distributive share of the company’s dividends interest and certain other income will be subject only to a  percent withholding tax under certain circumstances the withholding tax may be reduced or eliminated if a nonus investor properly certifies to its entitlement to tax treaty benefits or the “portfolio interest” exception if the company a portfolio fund or a portfolio company treated as a partnership for federal tax purposes is deemed engaged in a us trade or business then a nonus investor will be deemed engaged in a us trade or business a nonus investor deemed engaged in a us trade or business is subject to federal income tax on any income “effectively connected” with that trade or business on similar terms and rates as a us person in those circumstances the company must withhold tax on the nonus investor’s distributive share of effectively connected income and the nonus investor must file a us tax return furthermore the nonus investor may be subject to us federal income tax on its gain from the disposition of its interest in company and if a corporation the nonus investor may be subject to an additional  percent branch profits tax on its earnings and profits effectively connected with the us trade or business   b the company makes no assurance that nonus investors will not be deemed engaged in a us trade or business as a result of their investment in the company each potential investor should consult an independent tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of an investment in the company in light of the investor’s particular circumstances erisa considerations persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an employee benefit plan ira keogh plan or other arrangement subject to the employee retirement income security act of  as amended “erisa” or the code an “erisa plan” should consider among other things the matters described below before determining whether to invest in the company erisa imposes certain general and specific responsibilities on persons who are fiduciaries with respect to an erisa plan including prudence diversification prohibited transaction and other standards in determining whether a particular investment is appropriate for an erisa plan department of labor “dol” regulations provide that a fiduciary of an erisa plan must give appropriate consideration to among other things the role that the investment plays in the erisa plan’s portfolio taking into consideration whether the investment is designed reasonably to further the erisa plan’s purposes an examination of the risk and return factors the portfolio’s composition with regard to diversification the liquidity and current return of the total portfolio relative to the anticipated cash flow needs of the erisa plan the income tax consequences of the investment and the projected return of the total portfolio relative to the erisa plan’s funding objectives before investing the assets of an erisa plan in the company a fiduciary should determine whether such an investment is consistent with its fiduciary responsibilities and the foregoing regulations for example a fiduciary should consider whether an investment in the company may be too illiquid or too speculative for a particular erisa plan and whether the assets of the erisa plan would be sufficiently diversified if a fiduciary with respect to any such erisa plan breaches his responsibilities with regard to selecting an investment or an investment course of action for such erisa plan the fiduciary may be held personally liable for losses incurred by the erisa plan as a result of such breach because the company will register as an investment company under the  act the underlying assets of the company should not be considered to be “plan assets” of the erisa plans investing in the company for purposes of erisa’s fiduciary responsibility and prohibited transaction rules thus the investment adviser will not be a fiduciary within the meaning of erisa the investment adviser will require an erisa plan proposing to invest in the company to represent that it and any fiduciaries responsible for the erisa plan’s investments are aware of and understand the company’s investment objective policies and strategies that the decision to invest plan assets in the company was made with appropriate consideration of relevant investment factors with regard to the erisa plan and is consistent with the duties and responsibilities imposed upon fiduciaries with regard to their investment decisions under erisa certain prospective erisa plan investors may currently maintain relationships with the investment adviser or with other entities which are affiliated   b with the investment adviser each of such persons may be deemed to be a party in interest to andor a fiduciary of any erisa plan to which it provides investment management investment advisory or other services erisa prohibits erisa plan assets to be used for the benefit of a party in interest and also prohibits an erisa plan fiduciary from using its position to cause the erisa plan to make an investment from which it or certain third parties in which such fiduciary has an interest would receive a fee or other consideration erisa plan investors should consult with counsel to determine if participation in the company is a transaction which is prohibited by erisa or the code fiduciaries of erisa plan investors will be required to represent that the decision to invest in the company was made by them as fiduciaries independent of such affiliated persons and duly authorized to make such investment decision and that they have not relied on any individualized advice or recommendation of such affiliated persons as a basis for the decision to invest in the company the provisions of erisa are subject to extensive and continuing administrative and judicial interpretation and review the discussion of erisa contained in this registration statement is of necessity general and may be affected by future publication of regulations and rulings potential investors should consult with their legal advisors regarding the consequences under erisa of the acquisition and ownership of interests   item  financial statements the company will issue a complete set of financial statements on an annual basis prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles appendix a to part b   b proxy voting policies and procedures overview us trust and its affiliates often have

the best longterm economic interest of our clients or in the case of erisa accounts in the interest of the plan’s participants and their beneficiaries set forth below are us trust’s policies and procedures with respect to any voting or consent rights of clients including mutual funds for which any us trust entity has voting authority recognizing that proxy voting is a rare event in the realm of fixed income investing and is typically limited to solicitation of consent to changes in features of debt securities these policies and procedures also apply to any voting rights andor consent rights of us trust on behalf of its clients with respect to debt securities including but not limited to plans of reorganization and waivers and consents under applicable indentures to the extent issues are not covered by us trust’s policies and procedures us trust will vote proxies in its discretion after taking into consideration the best longterm economic interest of its clients these policies and procedures may be revised from time to time appendix a and appendix b set forth the proxy committee’s current policies with respect to how us trust will vote with regard to specified matters that may arise from time to time special fiduciary services division these policies and procedures do not apply to the qualified or unqualified employee benefit plan accounts for which the special fiduciary services division of united states trust company na “sfs” acts as a plan fiduciary sfs has established its own proxy policies and procedures the sfs client accounts commonly hold large concentrations of employer securities due to the special nature of these accounts us trust and sfs may reach different voting decisions on a particular matter limitations relating to proxy voting while us trust uses its best efforts to vote proxies in certain circumstances it may be impractical or impossible for us trust to vote proxies such circumstances include when a client has loaned securities to a third party and is unable to recall the securities    us trust includes united states trust company national association us trust new york asset management division ust advisers inc and us trust company of delaware appendix a in sufficient time to vote the proxies by the required deadline or if an account would lose security lending income if the securities were recalled additionally us trust may not be able to vote proxies in connection with certain holdings of foreign securities if us trust does not receive the proxy statement in time to vote the proxies or is unable to meet the requirements necessary to vote the proxies eg share blocking limited value unjustifiable costs custodial processing delays or securities on loan in circumstances where a client held a security as of record date but the security is sold prior to the shareholder meeting us trust will abstain from voting that security proxy committee the proxy committee of united states trust company na is responsible for establishing and implementing these proxy voting policies and procedures the proxy committee may also consider special proxy issues that may arise from time to time including voting proxies for which the policies and procedures do not provide clear and definitive guidance andor where an exception to the established policies and procedures may be in the interest of us trust’s proxy voting clients the proxy committee is comprised of personnel of united states trust company na its director of equity research a senior representative from its equity research operations trust international investments equity income risk management and wealth management at least annually the proxy committee reviews the voting guidelines set forth in appendices a and b and the use of the third party proxy voting service the proxy committee may call upon research analysts and investment professionals for their opinion on a particular issue based upon their indepth knowledge of the issuer and the issues involved voting and use of proxy voting service us trust has engaged an independent proxy voting service institutional shareholder services inc “iss” a nationally recognized provider of proxy voting services to assist in the voting of proxies iss is responsible for voting on behalf of us trust in accordance with the guidelines stipulated in appendices a and b and for maintaining copies of voting records and proxy statements received by issuers iss will refer proxy questions to a member of the equity research operations group for instructions under circumstances where   the application of the proxy policies and procedures is unclear  a particular ballot item is not covered by the proxy policies and procedures or  the proxy policies and procedures call for input from us trust iss also may provide the proxy committee with recommendations regarding particular proxy matters proxy coordination a member of the equity research operations group is responsible for working with the proxy voting service soliciting feedback from the proxy committee as required and for communicating to iss the proxy policies and procedures iss produces monthly reports   appendix a of ballots cast on behalf of clients and the security operations group does a random sampling of the ballots cast by the proxy voting service against these policies and procedures to verify adherence by iss to these policies and procedures conflicts of interest from time to time us trust may experience material conflicts of interest with respect to proxy voting because these policies and procedures are predetermined and designed to be in the best interests of clients application of the policies and procedures to vote client proxies should in most cases adequately address any possible conflicts of interest us trust will follow the procedures set forth in appendix c in connection with voting shares issued by publicly traded companies affiliated with us trust and with voting shares of investment companies and alternative investment vehicles ie hedge funds private equity funds and other alternative investment pools advised by us trust or an affiliate reporting and recordkeeping except to the extent required by applicable law or otherwise approved by us trust us trust will not disclose to third parties how it voted a proxy on behalf of a client however upon request from an appropriately authorized individual us trust will disclose to a client or the entity delegating the voting authority to us trust for such client how us trust voted such client’s proxy the proxy voting record of investment companies advised by us trust are available on the sec’s website at httpwwwsecgov in addition clients for which any us trust entity has voting authority may obtain a copy or these policies and procedures upon request statement of proxy voting guidelines the proxy committee has established the following voting guidelines which provide a general indication as to how us trust will vote proxies on certain issues however these examples do not address all potential voting issues or the intricacies that may surround individual proxy votes and for that reason actual proxy votes may differ from the guidelines presented here in compelling circumstances the proxy committee may determine to “split” the us trust vote on a particular matter for different investment advisory clients for which it is exercising its authority to vote proxies any decision to “split” votes must be appropriate from the standpoint of the best longterm economic interests of each of its clients   appendix a appendix a – routine issues us trust will vote the following items as recommended by management of the issuer because us trust believes the recommendations by the issuer generally are in shareholders’ best longterm economic interests and therefore in the best longterm economic interests of us trust’s clients  ratification of auditors and compensation paid to auditors  corporate housekeeping matters – including proposals relating to the conduct of the annual meeting name changes nonsubstantive or corrective changes to charter or bylaws including increasing or decreasing the number of directors proposals as to the creation of corporate governance nominating or other committees and proposals concerning the composition of such committees and proposals relating to whether one individual may act as both chairman and ceo or otherwise hold simultaneous officer and director positions  routine capitalization matters – including matters relating to adjusting authorized common or preferred stock reverse splits or other business matters not related to antitakeover measures issuance of shares in connection with an acquisition or increase in capital stock for a shareholder rights plan  composition of the board – including removal of directors for cause establishing term limits for directors requiring two candidates for each board seat except that proposals relating to whether a majority of the board must be independent are not considered routine  general corporate matters – including formation of a holding company reincorporation into a different state or country issuance of special reports including reports on employment and recruiting practices in relation to gender race or other characteristics and reports on charitablepolitical contributions and activities adoption renewal or amendment of shareholder rights plan establishing or amending employee savings employee stock ownership plans or investment plans  routine procedural matters – including the opening of the shareholder meeting acknowledge proper convening of meeting that the meeting has been convened under local regulatory requirements the presence of quorum the agenda for the meeting the election of the chair of the meeting the appointment of shareholders to cosign the minutes of the meeting regulatory filings the designation of inspectors or shareholder representatives for the meeting the designation of two shareholders to approve and sign minutes of the meeting the allowance of questions the publication of minutes the closing of the meeting authorize the board to ratify and execute approved resolutions and prepare and approve the list of shareholders  remuneration report – in several nonus markets including the united kingdom sweden australia and the netherlands shareholders are given the opportunity to ratify the company’s equity based and cash compensation policies we generally vote for the routine approval of remuneration reports in nonus markets   appendix a  annual formal discharge of the board and management – in several nonus markets shareholders are asked to approve actions taken by the board and management during the year the annual formal discharge is a tacit vote of confidence in the company’s management we generally vote for discharge of the board and management unless there are serious questions about actions of the board or management for the year in question or legal action is being taken against the board by other shareholders in addition we typically vote against proposals to remove the annual discharge of board and management from the agenda   appendix a appendix b – nonroutine issues the proxy committee has adopted the following guidelines with respect to the following nonroutine issues  – proposals regarding director elections     i election of directors – we typically vote for on individual director nominees in an uncontested election of directors we evaluate a contested election of directors on a casebycase basis considering such factors as the longterm financial performance of the company relative to its industry management’s track record the qualifications of the nominees for both slates and an evaluation of what each side is offering shareholders     ii cumulative voting for the election of directors – cumulative voting permits a shareholder to amass cumulate all hisher votes for directors and apportion these votes among one or a few or all directors on a multicandidate slate we believe that cumulative voting favors special interest candidates who may not represent the interests of all shareholders we typically vote against proposals for cumulative voting and for proposals to eliminate cumulative voting     iii classified boards – we believe that electing directors is one of the most basic rights that an investor can exercise in stock ownership we believe that a nonclassified board requiring reelection of all directors annually increases the accountability of the board to shareholders we typically vote against proposals seeking classification of a board and for proposals seeking declassification     iv term limits for independent directors – we believe that term limits can result in arbitrarily discarding knowledgeable experienced directors we believe that qualified and diligent directors should be allowed to continue to serve the interests of a company’s shareholders and that term limits do not serve shareholder’s interests we typically vote against proposals to set term limits     v proposals concerning whether a majority of the board must be independent – we believe that it is beneficial for a majority of the board of directors of a company to be comprised of independent directors as such we typically vote for such proposals   appendix a   vi proposals requiring a majority vote for election of directors – we will typically vote for reasonably crafted shareholder proposals calling for directors to be elected with an affirmative majority of votes cast andor the elimination of the plurality standard for electing directors including binding resolutions requesting that the board amend the company’s bylaws provided the proposal includes a carveout for a plurality voting standard when there are more director nominees than board seats eg contested elections  – other directorrelated proposals     i proposals limiting liability or providing indemnification of directors – we believe that in order to attract qualified effective and experienced persons to serve as directors it is appropriate for a company to offer appropriate and competitive protection to directors from exposure to unreasonable personal liability potentially arising from serving as a director we typically vote for such proposals     ii proposals regarding director share ownership – similarly to employee stock ownership director stock ownership aligns the interests of directors and shareholders whether through outright purchase with the director’s cash compensation or through option grants we believe director share ownership is in the interests of shareholders we typically vote for such proposals  – antitakeover proposals and shareholder rights     i shareholder rights plans and poison pills – poison pills are used as a defense against takeover offers that are not welcomed by incumbent management such plans typically allow shareholders other than the shareholder making the takeover offer to purchase stock at significantly discounted prices such a plan may serve to entrench management and directors and may effectively prevent any takeover even at a substantial premium to shareholders we typically vote against poison pill plans and against proposals to eliminate a requirement that poison pill plans be submitted to shareholders for approval     ii defensive use of share issuances – we typically vote against management requests to issue shares in the event of a takeover offer or exchange bid for the company’s shares     iii other antitakeover provisions – we typically vote against other antitakeover provisions such as blank check preferred stock greenmail provisions shark repellants and increases in authorized shares for antitakeover purposes and typically vote for proposals such as fair price amendments   appendix a   iv limitations on shareholder rights – we typically vote against proposals which limit shareholders’ corporate rights including the right to act by written consent the right to remove directors to amend bylaws to call special meetings or nominate directors     v proposals regarding supermajority vote requirement – we support shareholders’ ability to approve or reject matters based on a simple majority we typically vote against proposals to institute a supermajority vote requirement     vi proposals regarding confidential voting – confidential voting allows shareholders to vote anonymously and we believe helps large institutional shareholders avoid undue influence that may be exerted by special interest groups prohibiting confidential voting may discourage some shareholders from exercising their voting rights which we believe is not in the best interests of a company’s shareholders we typically vote for the adoption of confidential voting proposals and against proposals to prohibit confidential voting     vii discretionary voting of unmarked proxies – such proposals often provide management with the discretion to vote unmarked proxies as management determines except for the discretion to vote unmarked proxies with respect to a proposal to adjourn a meeting and to set a new meeting date we believe it is not proper to provide management with the discretion to vote unmarked proxies we typically vote against such proposals   management compensation proposals     i equitybased compensation plans – we will assess the potential cost of equitybased compensation plans by using the proxy voting service’s quantitative approach to evaluating such plans the quantitative approach is designed to estimate the total cost of a proposed plan both in terms of voting dilution cost and transfer of shareholder value we will evaluate whether the estimated cost is reasonable by comparing the cost to an allowable cap the allowable cap is industryspecific market capbased and pegged to the average amount paid by companies performing in the top quartile of their peer groupings we typically vote for equitybased plans with costs within the allowable cap and against those with costs above the allowable cap in addition we generally vote against plans that provide a for repricing of underwater stock b excessive ceo compensation relative to company performance ie payforperformance disconnect or c excessive threeyear average burn rate we may also vote against an equitybased plan proposal if there are significant concerns about egregious compensation practices even if the costs of such plans are within the allowable cap   appendix a   ii shareholder proposals on compensation – disclosuresetting levels or types of compensation for executives and directors – we typically vote for shareholder proposals seeking additional disclosure of executive and director pay information provided the information requested is relevant to shareholders’ needs would not put the company at a competitive disadvantage relative to its industry and is not unduly burdensome to the company we typically vote against shareholder proposals seeking to set absolute levels on compensation or otherwise dictate the amount or form of compensation we typically vote against shareholder proposals requiring director fees be paid in stock only     iii performancebased awards – we typically vote for shareholder proposals advocating the use of performancebased awards like indexed premiumpriced and performancevested options or performancebased shares unless a the proposal is overly restrictive eg it mandates that awards to all employees must be performancebased or all awards to top executives must be a particular type such as indexed options and b the company demonstrates that it is using a substantial portion of performancebased awards for its top executives where substantial portion would constitute  percent of the shares awarded to those executives for that fiscal year     iv severance agreements for executivesgolden parachutes – we typically vote for shareholder proposals to require golden parachutes or executive severance agreements to be submitted for shareholder ratification unless the proposal requires shareholder approval prior to entering into employment contracts we typically vote for proposals to ratify or cancel golden parachutes if they include the following a the triggering mechanism is beyond the control of management b the amount does not exceed three times base salary defined as the average annual taxable w compensation during the five years prior to the year in which the change of control occurs and c changeincontrol payments include the following doubletriggers i after a change in control has taken place and ii termination of the executive as a result of the change in control a change in control is defined as a change in the company ownership structure     v supplemental executive retirement plans serps – we typically vote for shareholder proposals requesting to put extraordinary benefits contained in serp agreements to a shareholder vote unless the company’s executive pension plans do not contain excessive benefits beyond what is offered under employeewide plans   appendix a   vi retirement bonuses for directors and statutory auditors – we typically vote against payment of retirement benefits to nonexecutive directors and statutory auditors when one or more of the individuals to whom the grants are being proposed has not served in an executive capacity for the company for at least three years we oppose payment particularly as the size of these payments may be at the discretion of the board if any one individual does not meet our criteria we typically vote against the entire proposal all other shareholder proposals regarding executive and director pay will be voted on a casebycase basis taking into account company performance pay level versus peers pay level versus industry and long term corporate outlook   nonroutine general corporate matters     i proposals relating to asset sales mergers acquisitions reorganizations  restructurings – these proposals are typically brought by management for underlying business reasons we believe that management best understands the corporation’s business and is best situated to take appropriate courses of action thus we typically vote for such proposals     ii financial resultsdirector and auditor reports – we typically vote for approval of financial statements and director and auditor reports unless a there are concerns about the statements presented or audit procedures used or b the company is not responsive to shareholder questions about specific items that should be publicly disclosed     iii appointment of statutory auditors – we typically vote for the appointment or reelection of statutory auditors unless a there are serious concerns about the statutory reports presented or the audit procedures used b questions exist concerning any of the statutory auditors being appointed or c the auditors have previously served the company in an executive capacity or are otherwise considered affiliated with the company     iv allocation of income – we typically vote for approval of the allocation of income unless a the dividend payout ratio has been consistently below  percent without adequate explanation or b the payout is excessive given the company’s financial position     v stock scrip dividend alternative – we generally vote for most stock scrip dividend proposals however we typically vote against proposals that do not allow for a cash option unless management demonstrates that the cash option is harmful to shareholder value   appendix a   vi amendments to articles of incorporation or articles of association – we generally vote for proposals to amend articles of incorporation or articles of association if a shareholder rights are protected b there is negligible or positive impact on shareholder value c management provides adequate reasons for the amendments and d the company is required to do so by law if applicable we typically vote against proposals to amend articles if the amendment is deemed not to be in the longterm economic best interest of shareholders     vii change in company fiscal term – we typically vote for proposals to change a company’s fiscal term unless a company’s motivation for the change is to postpone its assembly general meeting     viii lower disclosure threshold for stock ownership – we typically vote against proposals to lower the stock ownership disclosure threshold below five percent unless specific reasons exist to implement a lower threshold     ix amend quorum requirements – we generally vote against proposals to lower the quorum requirement unless we believe the proposal is consistent with market norms the company’s reasons for the change are in line with shareholders’ interests and the company’s ownership structure would not hamper wider shareholder participation companies that have a substantial shareholder or shareholder group should set their quorum requirement well above the percentage of shares owned by such shareholder or shareholder group quorum requirements are intended to ensure that a broad range of shareholders is represented at meetings     x increase in borrowing powers – we generally vote for proposals to approve increases in a company’s borrowing powers after taking into account management’s stated need for the increase the size of the increase and the company’s current debttoequity ratio or gearing level large increases in borrowing powers can sometimes result in dangerously high debttoequity ratios that could harm shareholder value if an increase is excessive without sufficient justification and if a company already has an exceptionally high debttoequity ratio compared to its industry we typically vote against the proposal     xi share repurchase plans – we typically vote for share repurchase plans unless a clear evidence of past abuse of the authority is available or b the plan contains no safeguards against selective buybacks     xii reissuance of shares repurchased – we typically vote for proposals to reissue any repurchased shares unless there is clear evidence of abuse of this authority in the past   appendix a   xiii capitalization of reserves for bonus issuesincrease in par value – we typically vote for proposals to capitalize reserves for bonus issues of shares or to increase par value     xiv adjust par value of common stock – we typically vote for management proposals to reduce par value of common stock     xv issuances of shares with or without preemptive rights – general issuances we typically vote for proposals for the issuance of shares with preemptive rights to a maximum of  percent over currently issued capital we typically vote for proposals for the issuance of shares without preemptive rights to a maximum of  percent of currently issued capital we typically vote against proposals for the general issuance of shares with or without preemptive rights above and beyond the aforementioned thresholds specific issuances we typically vote on a casebycase basis     xvi   control and profit transfer agreements – we generally vote for management proposals to approve control and profit transfer agreements between a parent and its subsidiaries     xvii   mandatory takeover bid waivers – we generally vote against proposals to waive mandatory takeover bid requirements the requirement that a takeover bid should be launched when a substantial amount of shares have been acquired prevents the entrenchment of the controlling shareholder and protects minority owners however we are in favor of a waiver of mandatory takeover bid requirements when the event prompting the takeover bid is a repurchase by the company of its own shares when a company repurchases its own shares the relative stake of a large shareholder increases even though the number of shares held by the large shareholder has not changed in certain markets notably the united kingdom ireland and australia the mandatory bid rules require a large shareholder to make a takeover bid if its stake in the company is increased on a relative basis as a result of a share repurchase by the company companies in these markets may seek a waiver from the takeover bid requirement applicable to their large shareholder under such circumstances we generally vote for such a waiver if the share repurchase would not push the large shareholder’s stake in the company above  percent     xviii   expansion of business activities – we typically vote for the expansion of business activities unless the new business takes the company into risky areas   appendix a   xix   relatedparty transactions – we generally vote for relatedparty transactions unless the agreement requests a strategic move outside the company’s charter or contains unfavorable terms to shareholders     xx proposals for extinguishing shareholder preemptive rights – preemptive rights permit shareholders to share proportionately in any new issues of stock of the same class for companies having large activelytraded equity capitalizations individual shareholder’s proportionate ownership may easily be obtained by market purchases we believe that greater financing flexibility and reduced expenses afforded by not having preemptive rights are more beneficial to shareholders than the ability to maintain proportionate ownership through preemptive rights we typically vote for proposals to extinguish such rights and against proposals to create such rights     xxi   proposals requiring consideration of comparative fee information by independent auditors – the cost of an audit is determined mainly by the specific characteristics of each corporation which may not be comparable even for companies within the same industry thus the comparison of one auditor’s fees with those of another auditor for a different corporation is not meaningful we further believe that the cost of the audit should not be the overriding factor in the selection of auditors as such we typically vote against such proposals     xxii   proposals mandating diversity in hiring practices or board composition – we believe that management is best able to make hiring and firing decisions and should make those decisions consistent with the requirements of applicable law based on the best available talent for the position in question we believe that federal and state antidiscrimination laws should control to prevent discriminatory practices and that the vast majority of corporations make concerted efforts to comply with federal and state laws that prohibit employment discrimination we typically vote against such proposals     xxiii   proposals prohibiting dealings with certain countries – the decision to prohibit business dealings with any country is a policy issue that we believe is best reserved to the us government if the us government has not prohibited trade or business dealing with companies in a particular foreign country then we believe it is up to management to determine whether it would be appropriate for a company to do business in that country we typically vote against such proposals     xxiv    proposals to limit the number of other public corporation boards on which the ceo serves – we believe that service on multiple boards may enhance the ceo’s performance by broadening his or her experience and   appendix a   facilitating the development of a strong peer network we feel that management and the board are best suited to determine the impact of multiple board memberships on the performance of the ceo we typically vote against such proposals     xxv   proposals to limit consulting fees to an amount less than audit fees – we believe that access to the consulting services of professionals is a valuable resource of increasing importance in the modern world that should be at the disposal of management we believe that restricting management’s access to such resources is not in the interests of the corporation’s shareholders we typically vote against such proposals     xxvi   proposals to require the expensing of stock options – current accounting standards in the us require the expensing of stock options but not all foreign countries have adopted this standard we believe that the expensing of stock options is beneficial in reviewing the financial condition of an issuer we typically vote for such proposals     xxvii   proposals restricting business conduct for social and political reasons – we do not believe that social and political restrictions should be placed on a company’s business operations unless determined to be appropriate by management while from an investment perspective we may consider how a company’s social and political practices may affect present and prospective valuations and returns we believe that proposals that prohibit companies from lines of business for social or political reasons are often motivated by narrow interest groups and are not in the best interest of the broad base of shareholders of a company we believe that management is in the best position to determine these fundamental business questions we typically vote against such proposals     xxviii   proposals requiring companies’ divestiture from various businesses – proposals to require companies to divest from certain businesses like tobacco or from businesses that do not follow certain labor practices are often motivated by narrow special interest groups we believe that management is best suited to determine a company’s business strategy and to consider the interests of all shareholders with respect to such matters we typically vote against such proposals   distressed and defaulted securities     i waivers and consents – we may consider the following when determining whether to support a waiver or consent to changes in provisions of indentures governing debt securities which are held on behalf of clients a likelihood that the granting of such waiver or consent will potentially increase recovery to clients b potential for avoiding crossdefaults under   appendix a   other agreements and c likelihood that deferral of default will give the obligor an opportunity to improve its business operations we will generally vote such proposals on a casebycase basis     ii voting on chapter  plans of liquidation or reorganization – we may consider the following when determining whether to vote for or against a chapter  plan in a case pending with respect to an obligor under debt securities which are held on behalf of clients a other alternatives to the proposed plan b whether clients are treated appropriately and in accordance with applicable law with respect to their distributions c whether the vote is likely to increase or decrease recoveries to clients we will generally vote such proposals on a casebycase basis  – investment companies and alternative investment vehicles the voting rights of alternative investment vehicles ie hedge funds private equity funds and other alternative investment pools generally are rights of contract set forth in the limited liability company agreement the limited partnership agreement bylaws or memorandum and articles of association we will vote all proxies or consents for unaffiliated investment companies and alternative investment vehicles in accordance with these policies and procedures to the extent a proposal relates to one of the following matters we will vote such proposals on a casebycase basis i approval of investment advisory andor distribution agreements ii approval of distribution plans iii changes in fees or expenses iv conversion of the company from closedend to openend form v changes in the “fundamental policies” of the company vi change in side pocket limitations vii change in the state or form of organization of the company and viii dispositions of assets termination or liquidations of the fund for clients invested in an investment company or an alternative investment vehicle that is advised or subadvised by us trust or its affiliates the procedures set forth appendix c will be followed   other shareholder proposals – other shareholder proposals may arise from time to time that have not been previously considered by management these proposals often have a narrow parochial focus we typically vote with management with regard to such proposals   appendix a appendix c conflicts procedures conflicts related to voting of shares of investment companies and alternative investment vehicles advised or subadvised by us trust or an affiliate we may have voting authority for shares held by our clients in mutual funds or hedge funds managed by us trust or its affiliates in these circumstances we may have a conflict of interest in voting these shares on behalf of our clients particularly in matters relating to approval of the investment management agreement advisory or other fees or mergers and acquisitions in all cases it is our policy to instruct iss to vote these shares in accordance with its own recommendations or the recommendations of another independent thirdparty proxy voting firm conflicts associated with voting of shares issued by affiliated companies us trust is affiliated with charles schwab  co “schwab” which is a publicly registered company us trust may have voting authority for shares held by its clients in schwab we may have a conflict of interest in voting these shares on behalf of our clients as a result of this affiliation in all cases it is our policy to instruct iss to vote schwab securities in accordance with its own recommendations or the recommendations of another independent thirdparty proxy voting firm the proxy committee will periodically obtain representations and assurances from iss or any other agent selected by the committee for purposes of these conflicts procedures that the agent is not itself conflicted from making such a recommendation if the proxy committee determines that iss or such other agent also has a conflict it shall secure the services of another independent thirdparty proxy voting firm and vote the shares in accordance with the recommendations of that firm   appendix a part c other information part c of this registration statement
