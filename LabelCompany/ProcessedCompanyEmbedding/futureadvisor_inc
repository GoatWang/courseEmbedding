futureadvisor premium which is direct management of investments and carries a  management fee the diy investor who wants a second opinion will love futureadvisor for the company’s free personalized recommendations which can be used on any account held at any broker this platform analyzes your portfolio and gives you free trade recommendations based on modern portfolio theory the same investing methodology used by the bulk of roboadvisors you can then initiate trades through your online broker futureadvisor’s free service will also alert you of the need to rebalance it doesn’t provide taxloss harvesting opportunities to free customers as they can be complicated to execute however taxloss harvesting is included on all futureadvisor premium accounts use of popular online brokers for futureadvisor premium accounts must be held at td ameritrade or fidelity if your accounts are already at one of those brokers there is no need to move them you’ll simply give futureadvisor management rights and the company will be able to trade on your behalf that means you get all the perks of a roboadvisor at a trusted online broker and giving the service a try is virtually riskfree without the need to transfer funds if your accounts are elsewhere this is potentially a disadvantage as you’ll need to move them to one of those brokers however the company will help you do it and the need to move accounts is typical of roboadvisors and assets can be transferred in kind financial advisor support futureadvisor walks the line between a standard roboadvisor and a hybrid service the company gives clients access to a team of financial advisors via chat email and phone five days a week users can set up an appointment with one of the advisors and each trade within an account is also monitored by a real person in addition to the company’s investing algorithm where futureadvisor falls short account minimum in order to have your assets directly managed by the company — the futureadvisor premium service — you’ll need an account balance of at least  which is high compared with the bulk of the company’s roboadvisor competitors it’s worth noting however that this minimum is actually significantly lower than other services that offer access to financial advisors like personal capital and vanguard personal advisor services personal capital requires a minimum  and vanguard requires  management fee the cost here is high when compared with other roboadvisors futureadvisor premium carries an annual fee of  which is in addition to investment expenses the company notes that customers may also occasionally incur transaction fees though it prioritizes the use of commissionfree funds maximum age restriction this service will take you to retirement but you’ll have to get through it on your own the company doesn’t accept new premium clients over age  due to allocations that are focused on return rather than income generation is futureadvisor right for you futureadvisor is worth a test drive for its free offerings alone the account analysis with rebalance reminders can give you valuable insight into how to manage your own portfolio it’s also a good fit for clients who have accounts at fidelity or td ameritrade and who don’t want to transfer funds in order to take advantage of a roboadvisor outside of that other advisors may provide a similar level of service and account management for a lower management fee and a lower account minimum open a futureadvisor account   arielle o’shea is a staff writer at nerdwallet a personal finance website
