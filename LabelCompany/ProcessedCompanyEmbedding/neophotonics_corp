metropolitan and longhaul multiplexing systems for telecom networks and pics based on indium phosphide neophotonics integrated santurs complementary technology into its own products in an effort to tap new markets for optical networking gear driven by the growth of data centers  suppliers and buyers neophotonics  makes more than half of its sales in china  the companys top client is chinabased communications equipment maker huawei which accounts for nearly half of sales its other key customers include alcatellucent cisco systems ericsson fujitsu mitsubishi electric nec and zte neophotonics top  clients together account for nearly  of sales this percentage has crept up in recent years making the company increasingly reliant upon a limited number of clients to sustain its revenue growth  strategic partnerships neophotonics received more than  million in private equity funding from such investors as draper fisher jurvetson harris  harris group international finance corp institutional venture partners oak investment partners prior to its ipo in   in  neophotonics raised  million through a strategic investment from rusnano  rusnanos managing director sergey polikarpov has also been appointed to the neophotonics board of directors neophotonics is planning to build rd facilities in russia the company expects to use a portion of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes as well as to establish design and production capabilities in russia the expansion in russia is expected to be completed by july    innovation and technology neophotonics have developed extensive expertise in the design largescale fabrication highvolume module manufacturing and commercial deployment of our pic products and technologies the process of designing and manufacturing pics in high volume with predictable wellcharacterized performance and low manufacturing costs is complex and multifaceted in addition through precise fabrication and positioning of physical features neophotonics integrates pic devices fabricated on separate wafers out of different materials matching the material to the function to improve performance attributes and reduce production costs neophotonics’ hybrid integration allows it to integrate active devices such as lasers and photodiodes with highperformance passive devices such as switches routers and filters to provide the desired network functions on a single pic  neophotonics also sells its products as modules and subsystems which contain electronic hardware and firmware control that can be interfaced directly with customer systems neophotonics designs the electronic hardware and develops the firmware to integrate these with neophotonics’ optical products to meet customer specifications b neophotonics believes that their vertically integrated manufacturing strategy which extends from wafer fabrication through module and subsystem assembly and test provides a sustainable competitive advantage in their industry manufacturing of their modules and subsystems is highly complex utilizing extensive knowhow in multiple disciplines and accumulated knowledge of manufacturing processes and equipment neophotonics vertically integrated manufacturing operations reduce the time required to develop test and produce new products and configurations and enables higher performance consistency and reliability neophotonics has developed proprietary testing methodologies that also help decrease development times enabling neophotonics to introduce products to the market more quickly b products photonic integrated circuits pics
