settlement buy the dip or valeantlitejan  about mallinckrodt plc mnk doctorx special situations growth at reasonable price value microcapsummarymallinckrodt plc an oldline us company that transformed to a pharma rollup announced a settlement with the ftc and five states related to its acthar productthe settlement only cost  million or less than share the stock sold off more than that in market valuethe other settlement concession from mallinckrodt involved disposing of a potential competitor to acthar this is discussed in detail in the articlethe companys financial situation and other potential value drivers are also analyzedmy conclusion is that mallinckrodt stock looked at comprehensively is not cheap enough given the risks to its dominant acthar franchise or its general business modelintroduction over the past few years of covering biotech and specialty pharma stocks ive had nothing to say publicly about one of the more prominent and interesting ones mallinckrodt plc nysemnk this irish company was spun out of covidien now a subsidiary of medtronic plc nysemdt a number of people have emailed me privately about it and i always expressed caution about it mnk has now come to the fore after a highprofile settlement with the federal trade commission as well as five states in the complaint filed by the ftc and states the first point reads this way i nature of the case through its anticompetitive conduct questcor now part of mnk has extinguished a nascent competitive threat to its monopoly questcors hp acthar gel acthar is the only therapeutic adrenocorticotropic hormone acth product sold in the united states acth is the standard of care for infantile spasms is a rare but extremely serious disorder involving seizures within the first two years of life it is also used to treat nephrotic syndrome ns  a kidney disorder whose largest single cause is idiopathic membranous nephropathy imn  as well as other disorders so this is an antitrust allegation now settled for  mm and a remedy to be discussed below the inflammatory nature of the charges comprises the next two points by the plaintiffs  questcor acquired acthar from aventis pharmaceuticals inc in  for  plus modest royalties at that time the price of acthar was  per vial questcor has since raised acthars price to over  per vialan  increase  a course of acthar treatment for is requires multiple vials and can cost well over   questcors acthar price increases have persisted and proved very profitable acthars us revenues in  exceeded  billion both lay the predicate for why allegedly the defendant acted as it did and would be an appeal to emotion in a jury trial the complaint then gets to the alleged act of wrongdoing as well as providing important background to the future competitive threats to acthar  in europe canada and other parts of the world doctors treat patients suffering from these same conditions with synacthen depot synacthen a synthetic acth drug although acthar is a natural acth drug derived from the pituitary glands of pigs acthar and synacthen have very similar biological activities and pharmacological effects as the canadian product monograph for synacthen reads synacthen exhibits the same activity as natural acth with regard to all its biological activities questcor considers the drugs so similar that it submitted synacthen information to support its application to the us food and drug administration fda to expand the label indications for acthar and cited synacthen studies in its acthar marketing materials  until june  novartis ag novartis marketed and sold synacthen abroad  in  novartis decided to sell the rights to market synacthen in the united states for years questcor had viewed synacthen as a significant potential competitive threat to acthar in june  questcor outbid other companies to acquire the us rights to synacthen questcors participation in the bidding process was a defensive move designed to protect its monopoly over acth drugs in the united states by acquiring synacthen questcor harmed competition by preventing another bidder from trying to develop the drug and launch it in the united states to challenge questcors monopoly over acth drugs while martin shkrelis company at the time retrophin was outbid by over  mm by questcor and complained the deal by questcor which was public at the time raised a lot of eyebrows as the nyt headlined and reported contemporaneously questcor pays  million to acquire rights to a competitors drug a pharmaceutical company that has reaped huge profits by selling a yearold drug for  a vial has eliminated the most obvious threat of competition from a much cheaper drug by acquiring the rights to it the company questcor pharmaceuticals has acquired the rights to synacthen a drug from novartis that is sold in europe but not in the united states synacthen is similar to questcors drug which is called hp acthar gel and used to treat various immunerelated ailments questcors agreement to pay novartis at least  million trumped a bid from a startup company called retrophin that had hoped to sell synacthen in the united states for a few hundred dollars a vial sharply undercutting acthars price according to people briefed on retrophins negotiations questcors stock shot up  percent on tuesday the day its deal to acquire synacthen was announced we believe the acquisition removes a key overhang as a potential competitor to acthar is removed biren amin an analyst at jefferies  company wrote in a note one antitrust lawyer not involved in the negotiations predicted the deal would receive intense scrutiny by federal antitrust regulators now all that is the plaintiffs side of things the times has a certain point of view and so does the obama administration there are two points to make quickly about the facts of the case that may explain the wrist slap here only a dollar a share of mnk stock note that mnk acquired questcor for  b in a  deal one point is that going back to  in the complaint the price increases to nearly  per vial occurred in  long before the novartis nysenvs deal the second point comes from that times article providing some balance novartis can revoke the rights if questcor does not meet deadlines in terms of testing synacthen in clinical trials and seeking approval to market it in the united states according to a regulatory filing by questcor the deadlines are not being made public this would potentially be very important in a lawsuit and may explain why the ftc and states settled that times article went on late in the article to present the companys side of things mr cartt of questcor said the company would spend millions of dollars testing synacthen to see if it could help american patients that is the essence of discovery and competition not their elimination he said in an email in the past questcor executives have disparaged synacthen we believe it is unlikely to be a competitor to acthar david young questcors chief scientific officer said in a call with analysts last july he said it was not a protein produced by the body like acthar was and added synacthen contains benzyl alcohol which is toxic to children and can potentially cause gasping syndrome which can be fatal since probably over  of mallinckrodts profits come from acthar it makes sense to review the sales and prospects for it before doubling back to focus on mnks balance sheet and the rest of its product line and pipeline it now makes sense to mention the other important part of the settlement this is that within  days mnk will license synacthen in the us royaltyfree with no minimum price for the license to a company approved by the government so one of the key questions is whether synacthen will destroy or at least harm acthars business prospects how acthar became a blockbuster this is a strange story the times began covering it in a long  article in brief acthar hp highly purified is a porcine product that was developed around the time that oral steroids were also being developed its first version was developed by armour the meatpacker which was trying to find profit out of all parts of the pig it was able to extract the hormone that stimulates the adrenal cortex to make cortisone and other steroid hormones this stimulating hormone has the acth acronym thus accounting for the name over time as oral steroids such as prednisone prednisolone and others became widely available and then cheap generics acthar had few uses thats because the theory of acthars actions is that it is just a stimulant to adrenal gland production of other steroids largely glucocorticoids and prednisone and the others of its class do the job more simply and are given by mouth rather than by injection however acthar was felt to be effective along with sabril and highdose steroids for an ultraorphan condition infantile spasms it is also approved for treatment of an acute exacerbation of multiple sclerosis in adults and for numerous other autoimmune indications one of the points that is omitted from what might be called the antiacthar contingent and questcor was controversial attracting such shortsellers as andrew left and citron is that the fda did a review of acthar in the s and updated its label from the  k p  in the s the fda reviewed the safety and efficacy of acthar during its approval of acthar for the treatment of acute exacerbations in multiple sclerosis and evaluated all other previous indications on the label through the drug efficacy study implementation desi process in this process the medical and scientific merits of the label and each indication on the label were evaluated based on publications information from sponsors and the judgment of the fda the label obtained after the desi review and the addition of the multiple sclerosis indication is the acthar label that was used until the most recent changes in  thats something positive but its still s science however the k continues saying my emphasis added in  in connection with its review of a supplemental nda for use of acthar in treatment of infantile spasms the fda again reviewed evidence of safety and efficacy of acthar and added the is indication to the label of approved indications while maintaining approval of acthar for treatment of acute exacerbations in multiple sclerosis and  other indications in conjunction with its decision to retain these  indications on a modernized acthar label the fda eliminated approximately  other indications from the label the fda review included a medical and scientific review of acthar and each indication and an evaluation of available clinical and nonclinical literature as of the date of the review the fda did not require additional clinical trials for acthar even though the fda did not require additional clinical trials the company did begin some in lupus and nephrotic syndrome recently a formal trial in als was announced interested readers may wish to review the news item from this past november on the progress of the phase  program of acthar in lupus which contains a link to the results of the pilot study that has been completed anyway there is no generic and may well be no generic just as there is and may well never be a generic for premarin questcor and then mallinckrodt have basically taken advantage of immense pricing flexibility for an old drug that has had a new lease on life mnk has been marching through indications increasing promotion for various niche approved used of the drug despite all the allegations the k and latest q do not reflect legal peril from investigations of payoffs to doctors or anything like that so could acthar justify mnks share price lets look into the numbers and the true valuation of mnk acthar and mnk  heavy leverage but real economic profits mnk has transitioned and continues to transition from the highmargined business of fine chemicals and medical radiation products to the highermargined business of specialty pharma its done this without an internal discovery engine this growth by acquisition strategy can be done poorly as in valeant nysevrx or intelligently as with todays allergan nyseagn the balance sheet helps to tell the tale as do gaap results that account for the cost of the acquisitions generally via amortization charges the latest balance sheet from the earnings report as of the end of september has as some of its high points shareholder equity  b longterm debt  b deferred income taxes  b goodwill  b intangible assets net  b so there are      b   b of tangible assets thus the  b market cap of mnk at a closing price of  greatly understates the quantity of earnings mnk would need to have to a earn back its tangible asset deficit largely comprised of debt principal repayments and deferred income taxes and b earn back its market cap then shareholders need a return on top of that in the september quarter which was q at the time but starting this year the company will be on a calendar year acthar showed strong growth mallinckrodt plc select product line net sales unaudited in millions three months ended september   september   percentchange currencyimpact constantcurrencygrowth specialty brands acthar           inomax      ofirmev      therakos immunotherapy      hemostasis      other      specialty brands total       that  revenue gain is impressive the race is now on between costcutters at payors who are looking to minimize usage of acthar and additional promotion of acthar for a growing number of its numerous indications in addition mnk reported  mm of specialty generics revenues most of this comes from the highly profitable controlled substances space where mnk has some special supply advantages as far as the other specialty pharma products go inomax is a nitric acid drugdevice product for respiratory distress in infants ofirmev is the unique iv acetaminophen branded as tylenol this is growing in sales but is also a target of efforts to use oral acetaminophen not iv wherever possible the q september q goes into great detail about certain complex patent matters regarding inomax as well as ofirmev p  i cannot opine about these matters but they are material comments on eps and tax rates neither gaap nor nongaap is a perfect measure of profitability for example heres what mnk tells you in the earnings report before reporting the earnings numbers the last sentence is not very clear for nonfinancial types income tax benefit in the fourth quarter was  million versus  million resulting in gaap effective rates of negative  and  respectively the adjusted effective tax rate was  compared with  the variance between the gaap and nongaap effective tax rate relates to the tax effect on pretax nongaap adjustments and deferred tax benefits recognized upon pay down of intercompany installment notes created by internal sales of acquired intangible assets clearly gaap has some problems if effective tax rates are negative especially to a tripledigit extent here is the brief discussion of gaap versus nongaap numbers diluted gaap earnings per share from continuing operations for the quarter were  in the fourth quarter fiscal  compared with  per diluted share the increase principally reflects strong net sales and profit contribution in the specialty brands segment these factors were partially offset by declines in the specialty generics segment and by higher interest expense adjusted diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were  up  from  theres a sort of contradiction in the above numbers if gaap diluted eps was  but that was flattered significantly by a negative tax rate then real gaap earnings were lower than that yet the adjustment more than doubles them to  how much is that in the income statement earnings before taxes were  mm tax benefit was  mm if the  mm had a  tax rate applied for this irish company then eps would have been around  mm against  mm diluted shares that might annualize to only around ish per share for a  stock depending how it trades this week thats not too attractive the investor or potential investor in my case and perhaps yours then needs to ask whether the amortization charges are correct perhaps they are too onerous perhaps the inomax and ofirmev litigation and acthar product life will go well and the company will find ways to prolong their useful branded lives to be longer than expected in the amortization tables acthar has the look to me of a product that just might roll on for many years given the difficulty of developing an abrated generic so perhaps the truth lies between the gaap and nongaap numbers but as shown via balance sheet analysis acquisition of the specialty products has entailed many billions of dollars of cash expenditures and those have to hit the pl statement at some point as they hit the balance sheet promptly thus overall mnk is not really a cheap stock as some might think by looking at the pe only what are the prospects for synacthen and other threats to cut into acthars sales its difficult to opine about synacthen because we cannot be sure if the fda will grant it a broad label based on clinical trials on one or two indications my guess is that whatever company acquires the rights to this product from mnk will work out an optimal strategy with the fda that would give its product an optimal label perhaps showing noninferiority to acthar in a clinical trial or two will allow the fda to be generous to synacthen perhaps the showing of something like bioequivalence in the extent and duration of steroids from the adrenals  if possible  will impress the fda this may not be achievable though investors deal with this sort of uncertainty all the time my take would be to seriously haircut my growth prospects for acthar and make the company prove it can withstand what synacthen may bode for this mnk mainstay further the macro extent of acthars revenues begins to bring other competition one way is to encourage pediatric neurologists to look more seriously at higher doses of steroid such as prednisolone in place of acthar for seizures then there is sabril vigabatrin which appears to be in line to go generic this april whether any company has filed for this and may be ready to go is not known to me it is a small specialty product in addition one is led to wonder how difficult it would be to formulate a new brand that does what acthar and synacthen do so putting it all together i see the risks to acthar outweighing its benefits the rest of mnk is difficult to analyze the company presented the rest of its revenue drivers and a summary of its pipeline at the jp morgan nysejpm healthcare conference in san francisco in early january see archived pdf in addition to that the company has a major dispute with the fda about one of its generic products methylphenidate er the brand is ritalinritalin la my quick and dirty take after looking at the remaining products and pipeline is that this can be viewed as a series of products marketed and pipeline for which mnk probably achieved no great bargain on purchase since this is a puttogether agglomeration of products with some mild synergy in hospital marketing for some currently marketed products theres no special reason to look at this as other than likely to give a normal roic for the cost of the deals and maybe less than that if one believes as i do that deal prices remain elevated summary and concluding remarks as documented mnk is a member of a large class of pharmaceutical companies ranging in astuteness of execution from allergan on the high end to valeant on the low end and perhaps endo nasdaqendp and perrigo nasdaqprgo not all that far above vrx and deal savvy that have grown by debtfueled acquisition most of them likely mnk included have in my opinion expected something like the following metric pay x in interest cost for a brand then raise the price x or something like that thus making money then use marketing magic or whatever create some additive or even synergistic additional deals et voila a successful growing company then repeat unfortunately in the modern environment of deal prices this is very different from a typical industrial or service company rollup there a company buys a small momandpop enterprise for perhaps x earnings and instantly transmogrifies that by the magic of wall street into a x pe add quality management and the deal can make economic sense but you have to buy right for the whole system to work mnk therefore strikes me as a company that has done its best to make deals that could create value but deflationary forces have come more to the fore in this industry that may be frustrating its attempt to build real shareholder value despite its best and wellintentioned efforts note that the company has had an investor call today likely there will be some informed commentary from analysts in the next day or two i will update as necessary with an instablog based on my knowledge both of the industry and the specifics of mnks situation i do not view this stock as attractive for new money there are too many threats to acthar over the next few years from different directions including direct pressure on pricing from the trump administration and other powerful forces in addition to synacthen substitution of cheap steroids or generic sabril for acthar may slow its growth and i would worry if i became an mnk shareholder every day that some credible company would announce that it has developed a more modern version of actharsynacthen finally much of mnks generic business relates to narcotics thats another risk factor given the pressing need to deal with medical prescriptions for opioids with the company engaged in litigation for its two other major products i find more attractiveness in all the major biotechs and all the major big pharma companies all these companies have discovery engines and none are as dependent on one product as is mnk if i would want to own one rollup it would be agn but i remain neutral on that with respect though for the quality of top management thus to answer the question in the title i wouldnt buy the dip in mnk and in a sense it is valeantlite though solely because of the business model mnk is clearly a higherquality situation though with real economic profits and efforts to build a credible pipeline i think its worth watching and i wish management well in contributing positively to human health with its product development but overall i think the true valuation of mnk is a bit rich relative to its peers thanks for reading and sharing any views you may have submitted tuesday am with mnk at

constantcurrency basis adjusted effective tax rate and free cash flow which are considered nongaap financial measures under applicable sec rules and regulations adjusted net income adjusted gross profit and adjusted sga represent amounts prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us gaap and adjusted for certain items that management believes are not reflective of the operational performance of the business the adjustments for these items are on a pretax basis for adjusted gross profit and adjusted sga and on an aftertax basis for adjusted net income adjustments to gaap amounts include as applicable to each measure restructuring and related charges net amortization and impairment charges discontinued operations acquisitionrelated expenses changes in fair value of contingent consideration obligations inventory stepup expenses significant legal and environmental charges pension settlement charges recurrent cash tax payments to the irs associated with internal installment sales transactions and other items identified by the company adjusted diluted earnings per share represent adjusted net income divided by the number of diluted shares the

operating activities of  million less capital expenditures of  million each as prepared in accordance with gaap the company has provided these adjusted financial measures because they are used by management along with financial measures in accordance with gaap to evaluate the companys operating performance in addition the company believes that they will be used by certain investors to measure mallinckrodts operating results management believes that presenting these adjusted measures provides useful information about the companys performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis by excluding items that the company does not believe are indicative of its core operating performance these adjusted measures should be considered supplemental to and not a substitute for financial information prepared in accordance with gaap the companys definition of these adjusted measures may differ from similarly titled measures used by others because adjusted financial measures exclude the effect of items that will increase or decrease the companys reported results of operations management strongly encourages investors to review the companys consolidated financial statements and publicly filed reports in their entirety a reconciliation of certain of these historical adjusted financial measures to the most directly comparable gaap financial measures is included in the tables

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
