online gambling and wagering industry is increasingly competitive with relatively low barriers to entry new competitors are entering the esports wagering and video game tournament segments in both of these segments there currently exist several major competitors because many of these competitors focus on delivering one product as opposed to a full suite of esports and video gambling products and services that vgambling intends to offer the competitors may offer an equivalent or superior product to that of the company vgambling expects the number of companies offering products and services in each market segment to increase many of vgamblings current and potential competitors including but not limited to unikorn skilz bet william hill and pinnacle sports have far greater resources than

responsible gaming and is dedicated to an enjoyable and positive gaming experience for all of our players most players play for fun and entertainment but we recognize that a small percentage of players will attempt to play when they’re underage or allow gaming to control them and affect their lives the people of vgambling are committed to assisting and protecting those who should not be playing games at all or who wish to limit the amount that they play age verification any underage player who has provided dishonest or inaccurate information regarding their true age may have all winnings forfeited and could face criminal prosecution what we do every person signing up for a new account at vgambling must check a box that indicates that they are at least  years of age this notifies everybody that we don’t accept players under  when a player creates an account with vgambling we collect their name address and birth date to confirm that the player is at least  years old vgambling does not target underage players with our marketing and advertising it is neither good business nor consistent with our personal and corporate values to attract underage players what you can do be sure to protect your computer all windows computers can be set up to have password control so that you must enter a password to get to the desktop in general this is a good practice but it’s even more important when there are children or teenagers in your household also keep your vgambling screen name and password private you can elect to have the vgambling software not remember your password each time you log into vgambling if you have any concern that somebody else might attempt to access your vgambling account you should not allow the vgambling software to remember your password if you have children or teenagers in your household use protection software that allows you to limit the websites to which they have access prevent file sharing and generally give you detailed control over how your children use the internet here is a list of some of those programs safekids netnanny if you are aware of an underage person using vgambling software let us know simply send an email to supportvgamblingcom and we will get right on it our first step is to investigate and if warranted freeze the player’s account and request identification from that player we take these reports seriously be a responsible parent in many ways this is nothing more than keeping your eyes and ears open if you hear your children talking about gaming accounts deposits and withdrawals start asking questions if you see the vgambling client on your child’s computer uninstall it and ask more questions a responsible parent is the best start to preventing underage gaming selfexclusion if you
