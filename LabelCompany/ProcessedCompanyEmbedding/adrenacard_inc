bustle two students from the university of minnesota recently invented a walletsized epipen called the adrenacard while epipens are vital lifesaving devices many people do not have one on them when they need it the most this new device solves the issue of portability with a smaller and more portable design the adrenacard was created by tyler ebert and christopher kuehn as a way to ensure more people have an epipen on them when they need it the new device works the same way as a conventional epipen in that the user injects epinephrine directly into their leg however the adrenacard is only four inches long and two inches wide making it far more portable than comparable products in fact the device is so small that it can easily fit inside of a wallet with more than  million people at risk for anaphylaxis the new walletsized device could save countless lives  innovation keynote videos join  people getting better  faster w jeremy gutsches innovation keynotes ➤ related top

adenocard®  iv adenosine injection for rapid bolus intravenous use description adenosine is an endogenous nucleoside occurring in all cells of the body it is chemically aminoβdribofuranosylhpurine and has the following structural formula chno         slideshow looking ahead new drug approvals for  adenosine is a white crystalline powder it is soluble in water and practically insoluble in alcohol solubility increases by warming and lowering the ph adenosine is not chemically related to other antiarrhythmic drugs adenocard®  adenosine injection is a sterile nonpyrogenic solution for rapid bolus intravenous injection each ml contains  mg adenosine and  mg sodium chloride in water for injection the ph of the solution is between  and  the ansyr®  plastic syringe is molded from a specially formulated polypropylene water permeates from inside the container at an extremely slow rate which will have an insignificant effect on solution concentration over the expected shelf life solutions in contact with the plastic container may leach out certain chemical components from the plastic in very small amounts however biological testing was supportive of the safety of the syringe material clinical pharmacology mechanism of action adenocard adenosine injection slows conduction time through the av node can interrupt the reentry pathways through the av node and can restore normal sinus rhythm in patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia psvt including psvt associated with wolffparkinsonwhite syndrome adenocard is antagonized competitively by methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline and potentiated by blockers of nucleoside transport such as dipyridamole adenocard is not blocked by atropine hemodynamics the intravenous bolus dose of  or  mg adenocard adenosine injection usually has no systemic hemodynamic effects when larger doses are given by infusion adenosine decreases blood pressure by decreasing peripheral resistance pharmacokinetics intravenously administered adenosine is rapidly cleared from the circulation via cellular uptake primarily by erythrocytes and vascular endothelial cells this process involves a specific transmembrane nucleoside carrier system that is reversible nonconcentrative and bidirectionally symmetrical intracellular adenosine is rapidly metabolized either via phosphorylation to adenosine monophosphate by adenosine kinase or via deamination to inosine by adenosine deaminase in the cytosol since adenosine kinase has a lower km and vmax than adenosine deaminase deamination plays a significant role only when cytosolic adenosine saturates the phosphorylation pathway inosine formed by deamination of adenosine can leave the cell intact or can be degraded to hypoxanthine xanthine and ultimately uric acid adenosine monophosphate formed by phosphorylation of adenosine is incorporated into the highenergy phosphate pool while extracellular adenosine is primarily cleared by cellular uptake with a halflife of less than  seconds in whole blood excessive amounts may be deaminated by an ectoform of adenosine deaminase as adenocard requires no hepatic or renal function for its activation or inactivation hepatic and renal failure would not be expected to alter its effectiveness or tolerability clinical trial results in controlled studies in the united states bolus doses of    and  mg were studied a cumulative  of patients with paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia had converted to normal sinus rhythm within one minute after an intravenous bolus dose of  mg adenocard some converted on  mg and failures were given  mg and a cumulative  converted after a bolus dose of  mg seven to sixteen percent of patients converted after  placebo bolus injections similar responses were seen in a variety of patient subsets including those using or not using digoxin those with wolffparkinsonwhite syndrome males females blacks caucasians and hispanics adenosine is not effective in converting rhythms other than psvt such as atrial flutter atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia to normal sinus rhythm indications and usage intravenous adenocard adenosine injection is indicated for the following conversion to sinus rhythm of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia psvt including that associated with accessory bypass tracts wolffparkinsonwhite syndrome when clinically advisable appropriate vagal maneuvers eg valsalva maneuver should be attempted prior to adenocard administration it is important to be sure the adenocard solution actually reaches the systemic circulation see dosage and administration adenocard does not convert atrial flutter atrial fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia to normal sinus rhythm in the presence of atrial flutter or atrial fibrillation a transient modest slowing of ventricular response may occur immediately following adenocard administration contraindications intravenous adenocard adenosine injection is contraindicated in second or thirddegree av block except in patients with a functioning artificial pacemaker sinus node disease such as sick sinus syndrome or symptomatic bradycardia except in patients with a functioning artificial pacemaker known hypersensitivity to adenosine warnings heart block adenocard adenosine injection exerts its effect by decreasing conduction through the av node and may produce a short lasting first second or thirddegree heart block appropriate therapy should be instituted as needed patients who develop highlevel block on one dose of adenocard should not be given additional doses because of the very short halflife of adenosine these effects are generally selflimiting appropriate resuscitative measures should be available transient or prolonged episodes of asystole have been reported with fatal outcomes in some cases rarely ventricular fibrillation has been reported following adenocard administration including both resuscitated and fatal events in most instances these cases were associated with the concomitant use of digoxin and less frequently with digoxin and verapamil although no causal relationship or drugdrug interaction has been established adenocard should be used with caution in patients receiving digoxin or digoxin and verapamil in combination arrhythmias at time of conversion at the time of conversion to normal sinus rhythm a variety of new rhythms may appear on the electrocardiogram they generally last only a few seconds without intervention and may take the form of premature ventricular contractions atrial premature contractions atrial fibrillation sinus bradycardia sinus tachycardia skipped beats and varying degrees of av nodal block such findings were seen in  of patients bronchoconstriction adenocard adenosine injection is a respiratory stimulant probably through activation of carotid body chemoreceptors and intravenous administration in man has been shown to increase minute ventilation ve and reduce arterial pco causing respiratory alkalosis adenosine administered by inhalation has been reported to cause bronchoconstriction in asthmatic patients presumably due to mast cell degranulation and histamine release these effects have not been observed in normal subjects adenocard has been administered to a limited number of patients with asthma and mild to moderate exacerbation of their symptoms has been reported respiratory compromise has occurred during adenosine infusion in patients with obstructive pulmonary disease adenocard should be used with caution in patients with obstructive lung disease not associated with bronchoconstriction eg emphysema bronchitis etc and should be avoided in patients with bronchoconstriction or bronchospasm eg asthma adenocard should be discontinued in any patient who develops severe respiratory difficulties precautions drug interactions intravenous adenocard adenosine injection has been effectively administered in the presence of other cardioactive drugs such as quinidine betaadrenergic blocking agents calcium channel blocking agents and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors without any change in the adverse reaction profile digoxin and verapamil use may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation when combined with adenocard see warnings because of the potential for additive or synergistic depressant effects on the sa and av nodes however adenocard should be used with caution in the presence of these agents the use of adenocard in patients receiving digitalis may be rarely associated with ventricular fibrillation see warnings the effects of adenosine are antagonized by methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline in the presence of these methylxanthines larger doses of adenosine may be required or adenosine may not be effective adenosine effects are potentiated by dipyridamole thus smaller doses of adenosine may be effective in the presence of dipyridamole carbamazepine has been reported to increase the degree of heart block produced by other agents as the primary effect of adenosine is to decrease conduction through the av node higher degrees of heart block may be produced in the presence of carbamazepine carcinogenesis mutagenesis impairment of fertility studies in animals have not been performed to evaluate the carcinogenic potential of adenocard adenosine injection adenosine was negative for genotoxic potential in the salmonella ames test and mammalian microsome assay adenosine however like other nucleosides at millimolar concentrations present for several doubling times of cells in culture is known to produce a variety of chromosomal alterations fertility studies in animals have not been conducted with adenosine pregnancy category c animal reproduction studies have not been conducted with adenosine nor have studies been performed in pregnant women as adenosine is a naturally occurring material widely dispersed throughout the body no fetal effects would be anticipated however since it is not known whether adenocard can cause fetal harm when administered to pregnant women adenocard should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed pediatric use no controlled studies have been conducted in pediatric patients to establish the safety and efficacy of adenocard for the conversion of paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia psvt however intravenous adenosine has been used for the treatment of psvt in neonates infants children and adolescents see dosage and administration geriatric use clinical studies of adenocard did not include sufficient numbers of subjects aged  and over to determine whether they respond differently from younger subjects other reported clinical experience has not identified differences in responses between elderly and younger patients in general adenocard in geriatric patients should be used with caution since this population may have a diminished cardiac function nodal dysfunction concomitant diseases or drug therapy that may alter hemodynamic function and produce severe bradycardia or av block adverse reactions the following reactions were reported with intravenous adenocard adenosine injection used in controlled us clinical trials the placebo group had less than  rate of all of these reactions cardiovascular facial flushing  headache  sweating palpitations chest pain hypotension less than  respiratory shortness of breathdyspnea  chest pressure  hyperventilation head pressure less than  central nervous system lightheadedness  dizziness tingling in arms numbness  apprehension blurred vision burning sensation heaviness in arms neck and back pain less than  gastrointestinal nausea  metallic taste tightness in throat pressure in groin less than  post marketing experience see warnings the following adverse events have been reported from marketing experience with adenocard because these events are reported voluntarily from a population of uncertain size are associated with concomitant diseases and multiple drug therapies and surgical procedures it is not always possible to reliably estimate their frequency or establish a causal relationship to drug exposure decisions to include these events in labeling are typically based on one or more of the following factors  seriousness of the event  frequency of the reporting  strength of causal connection to the drug or a combination of these factors cardiovascular prolonged asystole ventricular tachycardia ventricular fibrillation transient increase in blood pressure bradycardia atrial fibrillation and torsade de pointes respiratory bronchospasm central nervous system seizure activity including tonic clonic grand mal seizures and loss of consciousness overdosage the halflife of adenocard adenosine injection is less than  seconds thus adverse effects are generally rapidly selflimiting treatment of any prolonged adverse effects should be individualized and be directed toward the specific effect methylxanthines such as caffeine and theophylline are competitive antagonists of adenosine dosage and administration for rapid bolus intravenous use only adenocard adenosine injection should be given as a rapid bolus by the peripheral intravenous route to be certain
