tours contact single malt our flagship spirit embodies the best aspects of the new school of american whiskey—strong traditional roots infused with innovation made entirely of american barley that is grown and malted in the pacific northwest this whiskey is distilled in copper and then aged in new charred american white oak casks that impart a complex nose of aromas that you might expect from bourbon the initial taste is a nice balance of malt with maple vanilla and a hint of apple culminating in a strong finish of toasted toffee and caramel it’s great sipped neat with a cube or two or in your favorite cocktail aged caribbean rum we love rum particularly aged rum from the caribbean the warm humid weather provides an ideal climate for the naturally sweet rum distillate to mature in used bourbon barrels something hard to emulate in north america we worked for more than a year with master rum blenders to develop a ‘whiskey drinker’s rum’ slightly drier and less sweet than typical caribbean rums but nicely mellow after  years in the used bourbon cask it’s full rich flavor has notes of vanilla and butterscotch which are wholly derived from the sugarcane and barrel easy to drink neat or on ice it works perfectly in your favorite rum or whiskey cocktail navy strength aged caribbean rum our navy strength aged caribbean rum is made from the same rum used in our standard aged caribbean rum but being a couple of former navy guys we wanted something with a little more horsepower at traditional ‘navy strength’  proof this rum has strong natural notes of vanilla and butterscotch with a much warmer finish it’s perfect over a large ice cube or in a cocktail enjoy single malt aged caribbean rum navy strength aged caribbean rum cocktails use old line’s american
