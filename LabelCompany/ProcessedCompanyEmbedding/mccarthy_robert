service  has been widely distributed within australia difficulty of computational methodsedit automatically selecting the attributes of a product in any category ie product promotion etc to maximize the number of customers preferring the resulting product is a computationally intractable problem given some customer profiles ie customers sharing some features such as eg gender age income etc the valuations they give to each potential product attribute eg females aged – give a  out of  valuation to it is green males aged – give  to it can be paid in installments etc the attributes of the products sold by the other producers and the attributes each producer can give to its products the problem of deciding the attributes of our product to maximize the number of customers who will prefer it is polyapxcomplete this implies that under the standard computational assumptions no efficient algorithm can guarantee that the ratio between the number of customers preferring the product returned by the algorithm and the number of customers that would prefer the actual optimal product will always reach some constant for any constant moreover the problem of finding a strategy such that for any strategy of the other producers our product will always reach some minimum average number of customers over some period of time is an exptimecomplete problem meaning that it cannot be efficiently solved however heuristic suboptimal solutions to these problems can be found by means of genetic algorithms particle swarm optimization methods or minimax algorithms referencesedit citationsedit  a b

marketing mix also known as the  ps is a foundation model in marketing the marketing mix has been defined as the set of marketing tools that the firm uses to pursue its marketing objectives in the target market thus the marketing mix refers to four broad levels of marketing decision namely product price promotion and place marketing practice has been occurring for millennia but marketing theory emerged in the early twentieth century the contemporary marketing mix or the  ps which has become the dominant framework for marketing management decisions was first published in  in services marketing an extended marketing mix is used typically comprising  ps made up of the original  ps extended by process people and physical evidence occasionally service marketers will refer to  ps comprising these  ps plus performance in the s the model of  cs was introduced as a more customerdriven replacement of the  ps there are two theories based on  cs lauterborns  cs consumer cost communication convenience and shimizus  cs commodity cost communication and channel given the valuation of customers towards potential product attributes in any category eg product promotion etc and

 references  citations  further reading  see also  external links emergence and growth of the marketing mixedit see also history of marketing e jerome mccarthy and neil h borden the origins of the  ps can be traced to the late s the first known mention of a mix has been attributed to a professor of marketing at harvard university prof james culliton in  culliton published an article entitled the management of marketing costs in which culliton describes marketers as mixers of ingredients some years later cullitons colleague professor neil borden published a retrospective article detailing the early history of the marketing mix in which he claims that he was inspired by cullitons idea of mixers and credits himself with popularising the concept of the marketing mix according to bordens account he used the term marketing mix consistently from the late s for instance he is known to have used the term marketing mix in his presidential address given to the american marketing association in  although the idea of marketers as mixers of ingredients caught on marketers could not reach any real consensus about what elements should be included in the mix until the s the  ps in its modern form was first proposed in  by e jerome mccarthy who presented them within a managerial approach that covered analysis consumer behavior market research market segmentation and planning phillip kotler popularised this approach and helped spread the  ps model mccarthys  ps have been widely adopted by both marketing academics and practitioners the prospect of extending the marketing mix first took hold at the inaugural ama conference dedicated to services marketing in the early s and built on earlier theoretical works pointing to many important limitations of the  ps model taken collectively the papers presented at that conference indicate that service marketers were thinking about a revision to the general marketing mix based on an understanding that services were fundamentally different to products and therefore required different tools and strategies in  booms and bitner proposed a model of  ps comprising the original  ps extended by process people and physical evidence as being more applicable for services marketing since then there have been a number of different proposals for a service marketing mix with various numbers of ps most notably the  ps comprising the  ps above extended by performance mccarthys  psedit see also marketing the original marketing mix or  ps as originally proposed by marketer and academic e jerome mccarthy provides a framework for marketing decisionmaking mccarthys marketing mix has since become one of the most enduring and widely accepted frameworks in marketing table  brief outline of  ps category definition explanation typical marketing decisions product a product refers to an item that satisfies the consumers needs or wants products may be tangible goods or intangible services ideas or experiences product design – features quality product assortment – product range product mix product lines branding packaging and labeling services complementary service aftersales service service level guarantees and warranties returns managing products through the lifecycle price price refers to the amount a customer pays for a product price may also refer to the sacrifice consumers are prepared to make to acquire a product eg time or effort price is the only variable that has implications for revenue price also includes considerations of customer perceived value price strategy price tactics pricesetting allowances – eg rebates for distributors discounts – for customers payment terms – credit payment methods place refers to providing customer access considers providing convenience for consumer strategies such as intensive distribution selective distribution exclusive distribution franchising market coverage channel member selection and channel member relationships assortment location decisions inventory transport warehousing and logistics promotion promotion refers to marketing communications may comprise elements such as advertising pr direct marketing and sales promotion promotional mix  appropriate balance of advertising pr direct marketing and sales promotion message strategy  what is to be communicated channel media strategy  how to reach the target audience message frequency  how often to communicate the ps have been the cornerstone of the managerial approach to marketing since the s product refers to what the business offers for sale and may include products or services product decisions include the quality features benefits style design branding packaging services warranties guarantees life cycles investments and returns price refers to decisions surrounding list pricing discount pricing special offer pricing credit payment or credit terms price refers to the total cost to customer to acquire the product and may involve both monetary and psychological costs such as the time and effort expended in acquisition place is defined as the direct or indirect channels to market geographical distribution territorial coverage retail outlet market location catalogues inventory logistics and order fulfilment place refers either to the physical location where a business carries out business or the distribution channels used to reach markets place may refer to a retail outlet but increasingly refers to virtual stores such as a mail order catalogue a telephone call centre or a website promotion refers to the marketing communication used to make the offer known to potential customers and persuade them to investigate it further promotion elements include advertising public relations direct selling and sales promotions modified and expanded marketing mix  psedit see also services marketing service blueprint and servicescape the  ps of services marketing by the s a number of theorists were calling for an expanded and modified framework that would be more useful to service marketers the prospect of expanding or modifying the marketing mix for services was a core discussion topic at the inaugural ama conference dedicated to services marketing in the early s and built on earlier theoretical works pointing to many important limitations of the  ps model taken collectively the papers presented at that conference indicate that service marketers were thinking about a revision to the general marketing mix based on an understanding that services were fundamentally different to products and therefore required different tools and strategies in  booms and bitner proposed a model of  ps comprising the original  ps plus process people and physical evidence as being more applicable for services marketing table  outline of the modified and expanded marketing mix category definition explanation typical marketing decisions physical evidence the environment in which service occurs the space where customers and service personnel interact tangible commodities eg equipment furniture that facilitate service performance artifacts that remind customers of a service performance facilities eg furniture equipment access spatial layout eg functionality efficiency signage eg directional signage symbols other signage interior design eg furniture color schemes ambient conditions eg noise air temperature design of livery eg stationery brochures menus etc artifacts eg souvenirs mementos etc people human actors who participate in service delivery service personnel who represent the companys values to customers interactions between customers interactions between employees and customers staff recruitment and training uniforms scripting queuing systems managing waits handling complaints service failures managing social interactions process the procedures mechanisms and flow of activities by which service is delivered process design blueprinting ie flowcharting service processes standardization vs customization decisions diagnosing failpoints critical incidents and system failures monitoring and tracking service performance analysis of resource requirements and allocation creation and measurement of key performance indicators kpis alignment with best practices preparation of operations manuals people are essential in the marketing of any product or service personnel stand for the service in the professional financial or hospitality service industry people are not producers but rather the products themselves when people are the product they impact public perception of an organization as much as any tangible consumer goods from a marketing management perspective it is important to ensure that employees represent the company in alignment with broader messaging strategies this is easier to ensure when people feel as though they have been treated fairly and earn wages sufficient to support their daily lives process refers a the set of activities that results in delivery of the product benefits a process could be a sequential order of tasks that an employee undertakes as a part of their job it can represent sequential steps taken by a number of various employees while attempting to complete a task some people are responsible for managing multiple processes at once for example a restaurant manager should monitor the performance of employees ensuring that processes are followed she is also expected to supervise while customers are promptly greeted seated fed and led out so that the next customer can begin this process physical evidence refers to the nonhuman elements of the service encounter including equipment furniture and facilities it may also refer to the more abstract components of the environment in which the service encounter occurs including interior design colour schemes and layout some aspects of physical evidence provide lasting proof that the service has occurred such as souvenirs mementos invoices and other livery of artifacts according to booms and bitners framework the physical evidence is the service delivered and any tangible goods that facilitate the performance and communication of the service physical evidence is important to customers because the tangible goods are evidence that the seller has or has not provided what the customer was expecting lauterborns  cs edit robert f lauterborn proposed a  cs classification in  his classification is a more consumerorientated version of the  ps that attempts to better fit the movement from mass marketing to niche marketing  ps  cs definition product consumer wants and needs a company will only sell what the consumer specifically wants to buy so marketers should study consumer wants and needs in order to attract them one by one with something heshe wants to purchase price cost price is only a part of the total cost to satisfy a want or a need the total cost will consider for example the cost of time in acquiring a good or a service a cost of conscience by consuming that or even a cost of guilt for not treating the kids it reflects the total cost of ownership many factors affect cost including but not limited to the customers cost to change or implement the new product or service and the customers cost for not selecting a competitors product or service promotion communication while promotion is manipulative and from the seller communication is cooperative and from the buyer with the aim to create a dialogue with the potential customers based on their needs and lifestyles it represents a broader focus communications can include advertising public relations personal selling viral advertising and any form of communication between the organization and the consumercitation needed place convenience in the era of internet catalogues credit cards and phones people neither need to go anywhere to satisfy a want or a need nor are limited to a few places to satisfy them marketers should know how the target market prefers to buy how to be there and be ubiquitous in order to guarantee convenience to buy with the rise of internet and hybrid models of purchasing place is becoming less relevant convenience takes into account the ease of buying the product finding the product finding
