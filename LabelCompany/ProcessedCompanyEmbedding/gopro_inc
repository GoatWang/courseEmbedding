editions black silver and white all three versions of the hero come in a new  smaller and  lighter package with wifi functionality built in the change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations hero and hero were physically identical means that some of the camera accessories for hd hero original and hero are not compatible with hero so gopro made new versions of those accessories specifically for hero and mostly for hero see below those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older hero camera generations however a lot of other accessories are compatible with all hd hero camera generations the hero silver and black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the hd hero original and hero for example in p resolution with  fps while hd hero original and hero have a stated battery runtime of  hours hero silver edition has a stated battery runtime of  hours and hero black edition has a stated battery runtime of  hours the black editions most economical setting is p fps so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime the black editionnot in citation given has a new  mp sensor that can capture k uhd digital video at  fps k video at  fps p at  fps p at  fps p at  fps p at  fps and wvga at  fps the black edition also includes the wifi remote the black edition cannot record at  fps in p and wvga resolutions it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions this is a deliberate firmware limitation as the manufacturer does not expect that this highend camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates the silver edition uses the same  mp sensor as the hero and the white edition uses the same  mp sensor as the hd hero original heroedit play

wide images in october  gopro released the hero available in black and silver editions replacing the hero generation the hero white edition remains as gopros lowend device the hero camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is  lighter and  smaller than the heros according to the gopro website the hero camera housing is  smaller than the hero the cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness close focus down to  vs about  ft on the hero at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharpclarification needed with hero and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction battery life is claimed to be  longer than for the hero model both through better efficiency and a highercapacity battery of the same dimensions the black edition has video modes of p p p and p as well as k and k and can shoot mp stills at up to  fps along with the increased resolution the hero black edition also offers an optional function in firmware called superview which increases the field of view it has additional functions including dynamic low light situation adjustment higherquality recording modes higher bitrates no white balance applied etc etc the black edition continues to include a wifi remote it does not have the ability to record  fps in p and wvga modes it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions this is an intentional firmware limitation as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate the battery runtime of hero black edition is significantly longer than hero black edition but – lower than the battery runtime of the older hero and hero the silver edition has video modes of p and p and can shoot mp stills at up to  fps in contrast to the black edition the silver edition can record at  fps or higher in all supported resolutions hero silver edition also has about  longer battery runtime during recording than hero black edition they both use the same batteries the difference in runtime depends on the resolutionfps combination and whether wifi and gopro mobile application are used during recording the difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras the battery runtime of hero silver edition is similar to the battery runtime of hero and hero the hero hd camera was awarded the  technology  engineering emmy award for its contribution to television heroedit gopro hero  silver edition in september  gopro announced the hero available

lowlight capability and records at up to  fps it was sold with three different accessory packages as the outdoor motorsports and surf editions heroedit in late  gopro announced the hero line of cameras these new cameras came in three editions black silver and white all three versions of the hero come in a new  smaller and  lighter package with wifi functionality built in the change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations hero and hero were physically identical means that some of the camera accessories for hd hero original and hero are not compatible with hero so gopro made new versions of those accessories specifically for hero and mostly for hero see below those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older hero camera generations however a lot of other accessories are compatible with all hd hero camera generations the hero silver and black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the hd hero original and hero for example in p resolution with  fps while hd hero original and hero have a stated battery runtime of  hours hero silver edition has a stated battery runtime of  hours and hero black edition has a stated battery runtime of  hours the black editions most economical setting is p fps so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime the black editionnot in citation given has a new  mp sensor that can capture k uhd digital video at  fps k video at  fps p at  fps p at  fps p at  fps p at  fps and wvga at  fps the black edition also includes the wifi remote the black edition cannot record at  fps in p and wvga resolutions it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions this is a deliberate firmware limitation as the manufacturer does not expect that this highend camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates the silver edition uses the same  mp sensor as the hero and the white edition uses the same  mp sensor as the hd hero original heroedit play media a timelapse recording one frame every  seconds with a gopro hero camera mounted on a bicycle helmet during a bike ride in chicago note how the wide angle lens allows for the rider to capture wide images in october  gopro released the hero available in black and silver editions replacing the hero generation the hero white edition remains as gopros lowend device the hero camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is  lighter and  smaller than the heros according to the gopro website the hero camera housing is  smaller than the hero the cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness close focus down to  vs about  ft on the hero at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharpclarification needed with hero and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction battery life is claimed to be  longer than for the hero model both through better efficiency and a highercapacity battery of the same dimensions the black edition has video modes of p p p and p as well as k and k and can shoot mp stills at up to  fps along with the increased resolution the hero black edition also offers an optional function in firmware called superview which increases the field of view it has additional functions including dynamic low light situation adjustment higherquality recording modes higher bitrates no white balance applied etc etc the black edition continues to include a wifi remote it does not have the ability to record  fps in p and wvga modes it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions this is an intentional firmware limitation as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate the battery runtime of hero black edition is significantly longer than hero black edition but – lower than the battery runtime of the older hero and hero the silver edition has video modes of p and p and can shoot mp stills at up to  fps in contrast to the black edition the silver edition can record at  fps or higher in all supported resolutions hero silver edition also has about  longer battery runtime during recording than hero black edition they both use the same batteries the difference in runtime depends on the resolutionfps combination and whether wifi and gopro mobile application are used during recording the difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras the battery runtime of hero silver edition is similar to the battery runtime of hero and hero the hero hd camera was awarded the  technology  engineering emmy award for its contribution to television heroedit gopro hero  silver edition in

claims the hero black edition battery life to be  minutes increasing to a maximum of h  at p the hero black battery is in a different form factor than its predecessors initial sidebyside comparisons

cameras these new cameras came in three editions black silver and white all three versions of the hero come in a new  smaller and  lighter package with wifi functionality built in the change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations hero and hero were physically identical means that some of the camera accessories for hd hero original and hero are not compatible with hero so gopro made new versions of those accessories specifically for hero and mostly for hero see below those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older hero camera generations however a lot of other accessories are compatible with all hd hero camera generations the hero silver and black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the hd hero original and hero for example in p resolution with  fps while hd hero original and hero have a stated battery runtime of  hours hero silver edition has a stated battery runtime of  hours and hero black edition has a stated battery runtime of  hours the black editions most economical setting is p fps so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime the black editionnot in citation given has a new  mp sensor that can capture k uhd digital video at  fps k video at  fps p at  fps p at  fps p at  fps p at  fps and wvga at  fps the black edition also includes the wifi remote the black edition cannot record at  fps in p and wvga resolutions it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions this is a deliberate firmware limitation as the manufacturer does not expect that this highend camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates the silver edition uses the same  mp sensor as the hero and the white edition uses the same  mp sensor as the hd hero original heroedit play media a timelapse recording one frame every  seconds with a gopro hero camera mounted on a bicycle helmet during a bike ride in chicago note how the wide angle lens allows for the rider to capture wide images in october  gopro released the hero available in black and silver editions replacing the hero generation the hero white edition remains as gopros lowend device the hero camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is  lighter and  smaller than the heros according to the gopro website the hero camera housing is  smaller than the hero the cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness close focus down to  vs about  ft on the hero at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharpclarification needed with hero and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction battery life is claimed to be  longer than for the hero model both through better efficiency and a highercapacity battery of the same dimensions the black edition has video modes of p p p and p as well as k and k and can shoot mp stills at up to  fps along with the increased resolution the hero black edition also offers an optional function in firmware called superview which increases the field of view it has additional functions including dynamic low light situation adjustment higherquality recording modes higher bitrates no white balance applied etc etc the black edition continues to include a wifi remote it does not have the ability to record  fps in p and wvga modes it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions this is an intentional firmware limitation as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate the battery runtime of hero black edition is significantly longer than hero black edition but – lower than the battery runtime of the older hero and hero the silver edition has video modes of p and p and can shoot mp stills at up to  fps in contrast to the black edition the silver edition can record at  fps or higher in all supported resolutions hero silver edition also has about  longer battery runtime during recording than hero black edition they both use the same batteries the difference in runtime depends on the resolutionfps combination and whether wifi and gopro mobile application are used during recording the difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras the battery runtime of hero silver edition is similar to the battery runtime of hero and hero the hero hd camera was awarded the  technology  engineering emmy award for its contribution to television heroedit gopro hero  silver edition in

directly from gzip file rather than extracting the data first and then processing the uncompressed data subject predicate object  note in freebase objects have mids that look like mrkqx in rdf those mids become mrkqx likewise freebase schema like commontopic are written as commontopic the subject is the id of a freebase object it can be a freebase mid ex mrkqx for topics and cvts or a humanreadable id ex commontopic for schema the predicate is always a humanreadable id for a freebase property or a property from a standard rdf vocabulary like rdfs freebase foreign key namespaces are also used as predicates to make it easier to look up keys by namespace the object field may contain a freebase mid for an object or a humanreadable id for schema from freebase or other rdf vocabularies it may also include literal values like strings booleans and numeric values topic descriptions often contain newlines in order to make each triple fit on one line we have escaped newlines with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed

accessory packages as the outdoor motorsports and surf editions heroedit in late  gopro announced the hero line of cameras these new cameras came in three editions black silver and white all three versions of the hero come in a new  smaller and  lighter package with wifi functionality built in the change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations hero and hero were physically identical means that some of the camera accessories for hd hero original and hero are not compatible with hero so gopro made new versions of those accessories specifically for hero and mostly for hero see below those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older hero camera generations however a lot of other accessories are compatible with all hd hero camera generations the hero silver and black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the hd hero original and hero for example in p resolution with  fps while hd hero original and hero have a stated battery runtime of  hours hero silver edition has a stated battery runtime of  hours and hero black edition has a stated battery runtime of  hours the black editions most economical setting is p fps so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime the black editionnot in citation given has a new  mp sensor that can capture k uhd digital video at  fps k video at  fps p at  fps p at  fps p at  fps p at  fps and wvga at  fps the black edition also includes the wifi remote the black edition cannot record at  fps in p and wvga resolutions it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions this is a deliberate firmware limitation as the manufacturer does not expect that this highend camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates the silver edition uses the same  mp sensor as the hero and the white edition uses the same  mp sensor as the hd hero original heroedit play media a timelapse recording one frame every  seconds with a gopro hero camera mounted on a bicycle helmet during a bike ride in chicago note how the wide angle lens allows for the rider to capture wide images in october  gopro released the hero available in black and silver editions replacing the hero generation the hero white edition remains as gopros lowend device the hero camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is  lighter and  smaller than the heros according to the gopro website the hero camera housing is  smaller than the hero the cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness close focus down to  vs about  ft on the hero at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharpclarification needed with hero and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction battery life is claimed to be  longer than for the hero model both through better efficiency and a highercapacity battery of the same dimensions the black edition has video modes of p p p and p as well as k and k and can shoot mp stills at up to  fps along with the increased resolution the hero black edition also offers an optional function in firmware called superview which increases the field of view it has additional functions including dynamic low light situation adjustment higherquality recording modes higher bitrates no white balance applied etc etc the black edition continues to include a wifi remote it does not have the ability to record  fps in p and wvga modes it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions this is an intentional firmware limitation as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate the battery runtime of hero black edition is significantly longer than hero black edition but – lower than the battery runtime of the older hero and hero the silver edition has video modes of p and p and can shoot mp stills at up to  fps in contrast to the black edition the silver edition can record at  fps or higher in all supported resolutions hero silver edition also has about  longer battery runtime during recording than hero black edition they both use the same batteries the difference in runtime depends on the resolutionfps combination and whether wifi and gopro mobile application are used during recording the difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras the battery runtime of hero silver edition is similar to the battery runtime of hero and hero the hero hd camera was awarded the  technology  engineering emmy award for its contribution to television heroedit gopro hero  silver edition in september  gopro announced the hero available in black edition and silver edition which replace their respective hero generation predecessors the hero session a budget camera was also announced the hero black edition still has a  mp cmos and a f fixed maximum aperture and focus

black edition still shoots stills at a maximum of mp with a maximum burst rate of  fps with wifi disabled at k gopro claims the hero black edition battery life to be  minutes increasing to a maximum of h  at p the hero black battery is in a different form factor than its predecessors initial sidebyside comparisons of hero and hero black edition video results suggest that the newer model has more detail at long range and similar performance at close range the hero silver edition is basically a hero black edition with the addition of a micro speaker builtin touch screen display protune for photo and highlight tag the first gopro with this a lower clocked cortexa and missing the black editions integrated analogtodigital converter which supports a wider variety of professional

interviewed by cnbc though it’s certainly old news by now it’s worth revisiting… not because it was compelling but because in retrospect it was alarming to current and wouldbe owners of gpro stock in short woodman is still trying to sell the premise to investors even though he’s no longer able to sell the company’s hardware to consumers source etcusc via flickr modified sure there will always be some sort of market for action cameras and if nothing else gopro is the most recognizable name in the business that’s just not enough though whether woodman wants to see it or not there’s just not much of a future for gopro no encore giving credit where it’s due nick woodman made a good point sort of that is he said investors should focus on the company’s fifteenyear history rather than the past year and a half of troubled results there’s a flipside to that coin though that is the company’s earliest nonipo investors who bought into the hype — anywhere between  — shortly after its  ipo are now down between  on their positions it’s a little tough to take solace in the company’s longterm existence when you’re that deep in the red after believing the preipo hype woodman had mustered we didn’t hear that same longterm sermon in the months leading up to the initial public offering for gpro stock to that end while woodman wants the market to focus on the bigger picture he may not realize that in some regard that’s exactly what it’s doing investors are looking for the next big growth engine from gopro but there simply doesn’t seem to be one the karma drone was supposed to be it but it wasn’t the vrfilming odyssey rig was ballyhooed but didn’t mean much in the way of revenue gopro spent hundreds of millions of dollars to become a media venue but it never panned out so why would investors expect the future to be any different than the past gopro was a onehit wonder plain and simple reality check it’s time to talk tough truths… woodman was passionate about the premise and investors fell in love with the idea of a highquality action camera they were so blinded by that love in fact that they didn’t ask any of the right questions the one glaring one they didn’t ask what’s the plausible sustainable market for action cameras regardless of where and how they’re mounted as it turns out while most everyone respects the fact that gopro makes great action cameras most everyone doesn’t actually want to buy one and even the photographers and videographers who buy one don’t necessarily want another one it’s just not a mass market product it never was the closesecond question most early owners of gpro stock didn’t ask what’s the plan to stave off the competition that would inevitably rise there wasn’t one nobody cares though traders were too enamored by the hype

articles  analysis  stock market news  will the new products help gopro stock  gopro inc nasdaqgpro will the new products help gopro stock  gopro inc nasdaqgpro posted by kumar abhishek on may    am est related ticker gpro gopro inc nasdaqgpro stock is facing strong resistance from the day moving average line flickr after reporting better than expected revenue growth in q action camera maker gopro inc nasdaqgpro is on track to achieve its q targets according to ceo nick woodman gopro is in the middle of a turnaround process which has not borne the desired results till now though there has been some progress the company has taken several steps including restructuring and product diversification however the company is not out of the woods yet gopros hero line of cameras still command strong customer loyalty hero cameras are one of the best in their class according to the npd groups retail tracking service hero cameras occupied top three spots in the digital image category in the united states but that has not helped the company or the stock much in the past two years gpro stock is down  in the last two years and almost flat ytd what is holding down gopro inc there are several reasons for gopros struggles while gopros cameras are of high quality it serves a very niche market there are now indications that the niche action camera market may be saturating and improving camera quality in mobile phones such as the iphone and galaxy note will make wider adoption of gopros hero line of cameras difficult apart from the niche market gopro is also facing strong competition from much cheaper action cameras while the competitors may not be able to match gopros quality they provide the same functionality at a much cheaper price then there is also the execution problem last holiday season gopro managed to botch the release of its muchawaited hero  line of cameras as well as the karma drone manufacturing issues led to delay in the delivery of hero  black camera during the allimportant holiday season more importantly gopro was forced to recall its muchhyped karma drones due to technical issues the recall was announced after gopro discovered that karma drones were prone to crashing midflight due to a sudden loss of power the recall did a great damage to gopros brand name and this was not the first big launch which gopro had flubbed even hero  launch didnt go as planned gopro was forced to slash its price within few months of the launch and take a hit of millions of dollars in inventory writedowns product diversification while action cameras remain gopros main revenue source the company has been diversifying into other product markets apart from the karma drone gopro has also launched subscription service for photo and video editing and sharing diversification will help to increase gopros total addressable market and reduce the business risk however both karma and the subscription service didnt have a perfect start the recall of karma during the allimportant holiday season was a big blow to the brand and the timing didnt help either given the negative brand image and strong competition from chinese drone manufacturer dji gopro will have to invest significant time and money in the drone to make it appeal to customers once again karma drone lacked several features such as collision avoidance and follow me which are now staple features in most of the drones further the action camera company announced the pilot launch of fusion k spherical camera fusion is a degree spherical camera thats supposed to allow you to reframe images in d shots and see fullfield of view in vr vr is a rapidly growing market which could be a big opportunity for gopro according to statistacom vr hardware market is expected to grow from  billion in  to  billion in  while karma was diversification into an industry in which gopro didnt have much experience fusion is a perfect example of product extension in gopros core business in which the company has considerable expertise gopro stock remains a risky bet gopros recent launches have failed to live up to their promise till now with the growth in action camera market slowing down gopro needs another product to drive its growth the companys decision to enter the vr market through fusion camera is a good move though it might be some time before it has any impact on gopros top line given the challenges gopro stock remains a risky longterm bet check out our daily stocks to buy for daily trading ideas looking for great tech stocks check out amigobulls top stocks to buy which have beaten the

down more than  in  it seems an understatement to say the actioncamera specialist has had a terrible year gopro has struggled over the past several months as new products like its hero session fell flat more specifically the tiny new camera suffered weak sellthrough from the time it launched in july prompting the company to effectively cut its price in half through two price reductions since then consequently the fallout of this failure was more than enough for me to name the hero session gopros single worst product in  however thats not to say everything went wrong for gopro this year in fact things appeared to be looking up for gopro up until the middle of august helped by a huge rally after it repeatedly crushed analysts estimates for both revenue and earnings in its first and second quarters to start the year all the while two products have stood out as the primary forces driving gopros business the hero black and hero silver cameras gopros hero black left and hero silver right have propped up overall sales since their late launch image source gopro the hero black and hero silver stand tall as gopros most expensive  and highestmargin  cameras at  and  respectively and unlike the hero session gopros black and silver models have successfully maintained those steep prices since launching over a year ago in september  gopro doesnt provide an exact breakdown of permodel sales so we cant accurately determine which model has had a greater influence on gopros overall results rather gopro management almost always refers to both products together in the same sentence and has confirmed the hero black and silver have collectively represented more than  of the companys total revenue and unit sales every quarter since their launch consequently gopros gross margin has consistently come in higher than expected thanks to black and silvers outsized contributions despite gopros struggles last quarter on the hero sessions weakness for example q gross margin came in at a solid  well above gopros guidance for  and even as sales are expected to decline  year over year in the current holiday quarter hero black and silver should continue to be the largest contributors to revenue in turn gopro says this should drive gross margin of roughly  in q well above the companys longterm goal of maintaining a range of  to  of course having these yearold products still driving the majority of sales isnt exactly ideal as you can bet gopro would rather have enjoyed complementary strength from its much newer hero session at its original higher price to be sure ive already voiced concerns that the hero sessions latest price decrease might signal trouble in the near term especially as the market grows more impatient waiting for new highend gopro cameras to hit the market and replicate black and silvers success but in the meantime  for better or worse  given their crucial role in propping up gopros business i think the hero black and silver have easily earned the joint

with three different accessory packages as the outdoor motorsports and surf editions heroedit in late  gopro announced the hero line of cameras these new cameras came in three editions black silver and white all three versions of the hero come in a new  smaller and  lighter package with wifi functionality built in the change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations hero and hero were physically identical means that some of the camera accessories for hd hero original and hero are not compatible with hero so gopro made new versions of those accessories specifically for hero and mostly for hero see below those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older hero camera generations however a lot of other accessories are compatible with all hd hero camera generations the hero silver and black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the hd hero original and hero for example in p resolution with  fps while hd hero original and hero have a stated battery runtime of  hours hero silver edition has a stated battery runtime of  hours and hero black edition has a stated battery runtime of  hours the black editions most economical setting is p fps so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime the black editionnot in citation given has a new  mp sensor that can capture k uhd digital video at  fps k video at  fps p at  fps p at  fps p at  fps p at  fps and wvga at  fps the black edition also includes the wifi remote the black edition cannot record at  fps in p and wvga resolutions it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions this is a deliberate firmware limitation as the manufacturer does not expect that this highend camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates the silver edition uses the same  mp sensor as the hero and the white edition uses the same  mp sensor as the hd hero original heroedit play media a timelapse recording one frame every  seconds with a gopro hero camera mounted on a bicycle helmet during a bike ride in chicago note how the wide angle lens allows for the rider to capture wide images in october  gopro released the hero available in black and silver editions replacing the hero generation the hero white edition remains as gopros lowend device the hero camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is  lighter and  smaller than the heros according to the gopro website the hero camera housing is  smaller than the hero the cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness close focus down to  vs about  ft on the hero at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharpclarification needed with hero and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction battery life is claimed to be  longer than for the hero model both through better efficiency and a highercapacity battery of the same dimensions the black edition has video modes of p p p and p as well as k and k and can shoot mp stills at up to  fps along with the increased resolution the hero black edition also offers an optional function in firmware called superview which increases the field of view it has additional functions including dynamic low light situation adjustment higherquality recording modes higher bitrates no white balance applied etc etc the black edition continues to include a wifi remote it does not have the ability to record  fps in p and wvga modes it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions this is an intentional firmware limitation as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate the battery runtime of hero black edition is significantly longer than hero black edition but – lower than the battery runtime of the older hero and hero the silver edition has video modes of p and p and can shoot mp stills at up to  fps in contrast to the black edition the silver edition can record at  fps or higher in all supported resolutions hero silver edition also has about  longer battery runtime during recording than hero black edition they both use the same batteries the difference in runtime depends on the resolutionfps combination and whether wifi and gopro mobile application are used during recording the difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras the battery runtime of hero silver edition is similar to the battery runtime of hero and hero the hero hd camera was awarded the  technology  engineering emmy award for its contribution to television heroedit gopro hero  silver edition in september  gopro announced the hero available in black edition and silver edition

lowlight capability and records at up to  fps it was sold with three different accessory packages as the outdoor motorsports and surf editions heroedit in late  gopro announced the hero line of cameras these new cameras came in three editions black silver and white all three versions of the hero come in a new  smaller and  lighter package with wifi functionality built in the change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations hero and hero were physically identical means that some of the camera accessories for hd hero original and hero are not compatible with hero so gopro made new versions of those accessories specifically for hero and mostly for hero see below those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older hero camera generations however a lot of other accessories are compatible with all hd hero camera generations the hero silver and black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the hd hero original and hero for example in p resolution with  fps while hd hero original and hero have a stated battery runtime of  hours hero silver edition has a stated battery runtime of  hours and hero black edition has a stated battery runtime of  hours the black editions most economical setting is p fps so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime the black editionnot in citation given has a new  mp sensor that can capture k uhd digital video at  fps k video at  fps p at  fps p at  fps p at  fps p at  fps and wvga at  fps the black edition also includes the wifi remote the black edition cannot record at  fps in p and wvga resolutions it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions this is a deliberate firmware limitation as the manufacturer does not expect that this highend camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates the silver edition uses the same  mp sensor as the hero and the white edition uses the same  mp sensor as the hd hero original heroedit play media a timelapse recording one frame every  seconds with a gopro hero camera mounted on a bicycle helmet during a bike ride in chicago note how the wide angle lens allows for the rider to capture wide images in october  gopro released the hero available in black and silver editions replacing the hero generation the hero white edition remains as gopros lowend device the hero camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is  lighter and  smaller than the heros according to the gopro website the hero camera housing is  smaller than the hero the cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness close focus down to  vs about  ft on the hero at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharpclarification needed with hero and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction battery life is claimed to be  longer than for the hero model both through better efficiency and a highercapacity battery of the same dimensions the black edition has video modes of p p p and p as well as k and k and can shoot mp stills at up to  fps along with the increased resolution the hero black edition also offers an optional function in firmware called superview which increases the field of view it has additional functions including dynamic low light situation adjustment higherquality recording modes higher bitrates no white balance applied etc etc the black edition continues to include a wifi remote it does not have the ability to record  fps in p and wvga modes it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions this is an intentional firmware limitation as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate the battery runtime of hero black edition is significantly longer than hero black edition but – lower than the battery runtime of the older hero and hero the silver edition has video modes of p and p and can shoot mp stills at up to  fps in contrast to the black edition the silver edition can record at  fps or higher in all supported resolutions hero silver edition also has about  longer battery runtime during recording than hero black edition they both use the same batteries the difference in runtime depends on the resolutionfps combination and whether wifi and gopro mobile application are used during recording the difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras the battery runtime of hero silver edition is similar to the battery runtime of hero and hero the hero hd camera was awarded the  technology  engineering emmy award for its contribution to television heroedit gopro hero  silver edition in

claims the hero black edition battery life to be  minutes increasing to a maximum of h  at p the hero black battery is in a different form factor than its predecessors initial sidebyside comparisons

accessory packages as the outdoor motorsports and surf editions heroedit in late  gopro announced the hero line of cameras these new cameras came in three editions black silver and white all three versions of the hero come in a new  smaller and  lighter package with wifi functionality built in the change of the physical dimensions of the cameras compared to the previous generations hero and hero were physically identical means that some of the camera accessories for hd hero original and hero are not compatible with hero so gopro made new versions of those accessories specifically for hero and mostly for hero see below those new versions of accessories are usually not compatible with older hero camera generations however a lot of other accessories are compatible with all hd hero camera generations the hero silver and black cameras have significantly less battery endurance than the hd hero original and hero for example in p resolution with  fps while hd hero original and hero have a stated battery runtime of  hours hero silver edition has a stated battery runtime of  hours and hero black edition has a stated battery runtime of  hours the black editions most economical setting is p fps so this also partially contributes to its poor battery runtime the black editionnot in citation given has a new  mp sensor that can capture k uhd digital video at  fps k video at  fps p at  fps p at  fps p at  fps p at  fps and wvga at  fps the black edition also includes the wifi remote the black edition cannot record at  fps in p and wvga resolutions it can only record at very fast frame rates in those resolutions this is a deliberate firmware limitation as the manufacturer does not expect that this highend camera model will be used at these lower resolutions and frame rates the silver edition uses the same  mp sensor as the hero and the white edition uses the same  mp sensor as the hd hero original heroedit play media a timelapse recording one frame every  seconds with a gopro hero camera mounted on a bicycle helmet during a bike ride in chicago note how the wide angle lens allows for the rider to capture wide images in october  gopro released the hero available in black and silver editions replacing the hero generation the hero white edition remains as gopros lowend device the hero camera models claim dramatically improved low light performance and have a waterproof enclosure which is  lighter and  smaller than the heros according to the gopro website the hero camera housing is  smaller than the hero the cameras are claimed to have improved image sharpness close focus down to  vs about  ft on the hero at the expense of distant focus which is slightly less sharpclarification needed with hero and better audio functionality with wind noise reduction battery life is claimed to be  longer than for the hero model both through better efficiency and a highercapacity battery of the same dimensions the black edition has video modes of p p p

the field of view it has additional functions including dynamic low light situation adjustment higherquality recording modes higher bitrates no white balance applied etc etc the black edition continues to include a wifi remote it does not have the ability to record  fps in p and wvga modes it can only record at very fast frame rates in those lower resolutions this is an intentional firmware limitation as the manufacturer does not expect a camera with its capabilities to be used at low resolution and frame rate the battery runtime of hero black edition is significantly longer than hero black edition but – lower than the battery runtime of the older hero and hero the silver edition has video modes of p and p and can shoot mp stills at up to  fps in contrast to the black edition the silver edition can record at  fps or higher in all supported resolutions hero silver edition also has about  longer battery runtime during recording than hero black edition they both use the same batteries the difference in runtime depends on the resolutionfps combination and whether wifi and gopro mobile application are used during recording the difference in runtime increases as the fps is lowered and the additional functions are deactivated on both cameras the battery runtime of hero silver edition is similar to the battery runtime of hero and hero the hero hd camera was awarded
