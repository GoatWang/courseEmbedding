cancer cell survival this includes immunosuppressive cell populations such as regulatory tcells myeloidderived suppressor cells m tumorassociated macrophages as well as tumorassociated fibroblasts and extracellular matrix proteins which can hamper the entry and therapeutic benefit of cytotoxic immune cells and anticancer drugs in addition to targeting the proliferative and survival signaling of cancer cells verastem’s product candidates including duvelisib and defactinib also target the tumor microenvironment as a mechanism of action to potentially improve a patient’s response to therapyabout duvelisibduvelisib is an investigational dual inhibitor of phosphoinositide kinase pikdelta and pikgamma two enzymes that are known to help support the growth and survival of malignant bcells and tcells pik signaling may lead to the proliferation of malignant bcells and is thought to play a role in the formation and maintenance of the supportive tumor microenvironment duvelisib is currently being evaluated in late and midstage clinical trials including duo™ a randomized phase  monotherapy study in patients with relapsed or refractory cll and dynamo™ a singlearm phase  monotherapy study in patients with refractory inhl that achieved its primary endpoint of orr upon topline analysis of efficacy data duvelisib is also being evaluated for the treatment of hematologic malignancies through investigatorsponsored studies including tcell lymphoma information about duvelisib clinical trials can be found on wwwclinicaltrialsgovabout defactinibdefactinib is an investigational inhibitor of fak a nonreceptor tyrosine kinase encoded by the ptk gene that mediates oncogenic signaling in response to cellular adhesion and growth factors based on the multifaceted roles of fak defactinib is used to treat cancer through modulation of the tumor microenvironment enhancement of antitumor immunity and reduction of cancer stem cells defactinib is currently being evaluated in three separate clinical collaborations in combination with immunotherapeutic agents for the treatment of several different cancer types including pancreatic cancer ovarian cancer nonsmall cell lung cancer and mesothelioma these studies are combination clinical trials with pembrolizumab and avelumab from merck  co and pfizermerck kgaa respectively information about these and additional
