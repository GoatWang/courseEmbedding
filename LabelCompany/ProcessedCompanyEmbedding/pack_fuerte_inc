in order to meet our reporting obligations we expect to have the following costs   with auditor ’ s fees for each review of our financial statements for  forms q ’ s totalling    for the fiscal year

intend to allocate proceeds from this offering to keep our reporting status with the sec current our officer and director has committed to the advancement of funds up to  for the next twelve months to cover expenses to maintain the reporting status current with the sec mr sriphanorm is willing to lend the full amount of these funds to the company as the expenses are incurred if necessary or if no other proceeds are available to the company regardless of the amount raised through this offering however there are no binding agreements regarding this commitment and there is no guarantee mr sriphanorm will lend the company any funds the funds expressed in the above verbal commitment would be in the form of a nonsecured loan and would have no interest and no fixed repayment date our company has yet to enter the market and has not developed its products thus far in order to enter into the market fuerte has to successfully implement its plan of operations which is dependent on the success of this offering we believe that our concept is innovative and we will have the advantage of being pioneers in this concept the company has no knowledge of any direct competitor at this time however these statements are solely based on our opinion and there is no data or research to support it our planned product would differ from the existing pieces of luggage with built in locks because it would be an independent safe connected inside the luggage with the option to have it locked even when the luggage is wide open because the locks for the luggage and for the safe would not be interconnected our product would give the option to use the same or a different code to unlock the safe and the luggage this feature is especially useful to give some privacy and security to the main user when sharing the luggage with another person the main innovative feature would be the opening system on the outside of the luggage that would allow valuables to be inserted but restricted from being taken out through the outside of the bags company description we are a developmentstage company that intends to develop a built in safe with a combination lock that can store personal and or valuable items inside of backpacks carryon luggage and suitcases we plan on generating revenues by licensing our intellectual property for pack fuerte products for luggage manufacturing companies after we successfully develop our prototypes as of the date of this prospectus the company has done some research and contacted some safes and lock boxes manufactures the company intends to have an initial prototype of the product within  days after we raise enough funds through this offering our final prototypes is are expected to be completed within  months the timeframes described herein are based on the president ’ s prediction only and it is not based on any third party professional opinion we plan on developing an initial prototype made of wood due to its affordable cost and availability easy to find in hardware stores our initial prototype would be created with available materials found in hardware stores and would serve to understand functionality after that point we would have better understand on how to proceed and how much and what types of materials would be needed we believe further research may be necessary and development of our product will be needed to implement our plan of operations we plan on conducting a wide research on prices and sources of materials and manufactures after we develop our prototypes our goal is to have a functional prototype in hand before we search for the best manufacturer for large scale as at that point we would understand what is needed to develop our initial prototype we intend to purchase the materials in hardware stores because we will not need a large amount of materials we plan on conducting the research via internet and phone calls and the president would be responsible for the research the company has begun communications with several companies that currently manufacture lock boxes and safes we have started initial contacts with  manufactures on june    mexgrand metal products factory china we have received replies from judy sales manager on june   and  they claim to be one of the leading safe manufactures in china  world safe thailand we have received a reply on june   from mr nattapon  security safe stop thailand we are still waiting for their reply based on this initial research done via email communication by our president and considering his personal knowledge and opinion we have concluded that there is no existing safe or safe box that would be ideal for our use currently in the market we will need to fully develop our product and for this reason our products when developed will be unique we plan on using plastic to produce our safes due to its resistance lower weight and durability however we need to consider factors like costs and availability of materials the best possible shape for the safe round or sharp corners for example security and safety we intend to develop our prototype and then quote prices in order to find the suitable manufacturer for mass production we believe that with funds available we can have an advantageous position and more confidence for negotiations with suppliers we can negotiate better prices for payment in advance set up lunch meetings and trips to negotiate in person and hire translators which could expand our possibilities for international negotiations for suppliers if necessary considering our initial research it appears that china is a cheaper option for manufacturing our safes however because other factors could significantly affect our final costs transportation materials etc more research could be necessary for the mass production we may use one of the companies listed above or try to find other options depending on negotiations and costs at this point without a physical prototype developed it is hard to estimate costs functionality and our actual needs it is also crucial to have at least one or a few different types of luggage in order to develop our prototypes therefore we believe at this point that further contact with these or other manufactures would be unproductive we have not conducted any other research other than the ones described above and we have not yet contacted any luggage manufacturing company to determine whether our product would be marketable to them the prediction of marketability and success of our products is based mainly on our president ’ s opinion and opinions of people that he spoke to a functional prototype is a fundamental factor for our development and in order to have a prototype we need funds to develop it if we are unable to find or afford a suitable third party developer our president could try to develop our prototype however the purchase of baggage back packs suitcases luggage etc is essential for measurements and to define the proper placement for our product currently the company doesn’t have enough funds to develop our prototypes for these reasons our main concern as of the date of this prospectus is to employ our efforts in this offering in an effort to raise the necessary capital through the sale of our common stock  our business office is located at  village no  khok kruad subdistrict mueang nakhon ratchasima district nakhon

operations this section of this report includes a number of forwardlooking statements that reflect our current views with respect to future events and financial performance forward looking statements are often identified by words like company history pack fuerte inc pack fuerte the company we us or our is a development stage company incorporated in the state of nevada on september   pack fuerte inc intends to develop a built in safe with a combination lock that can store personal and or valuable items inside of backpacks carryon luggage and suitcases this safe would be assessable from the outside of the luggage for inserting valuables and the inserted items would be only recoverable from the inside we plan on generate revenue licensing our tobedeveloped products to luggage manufacturing companies after our prototypes is fully developed we expect to start generating revenues only after we are able to successfully implement our plan of operation we have registered  of our common stock for sale to the public our registration statement became effective on october   and we are in the process of seeking equity financing to fund our operations over the next  months the company will fail if funds are not either raised in this offering or by loans either from the president or from other interested parties if we are unable to raise enough funds through this offering the company would have to seek additional capital through debt or equity as of the date of this report the current funds available to the company will not be sufficient to continue maintaining its reporting status the companys sole officer and director mr sriphanorm is committed to provide funds required to maintain the reporting status in the form of a nonsecured loan for the next twelve months as the expenses are incurred if no other proceeds are obtained by the company however there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement management believes if the company cannot maintain its reporting status with the sec it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the company as such any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety should the company fail to raise capital through this offering and mr sriphanorm is unwilling or unable to loan the company funds to proceed with its plans the company will have to cease all business activities until such time further funds are raised as the company does not currently have enough cash to fund its business plan and may not have enough to pay all of its liabilities if the company is unable to raise funds from this offering it may be able to issue restricted common shares to its creditors to satisfy their debts the company would only offer its creditors shares to settle debt if unable to raise equity financing the company would not settle any related party debt with this type of share offering the companys current debts are to its attorney and edgarizer there is no assurance that any of the companys creditors would accept restricted shares from the company in exchange for their debts results of operations as of august   we had no cash with liabilities of  as compared to november   where we had  in cash and liabilities of  we incurred operating expenses in the amount of  in the threemonth period ended august   as compared to  in the threemonth period ended august   during the ninemonth period ended august   operating expenses totalized  compared to  during the ninemonth period ended august   plan of operation over the next  months provided that we have raised enough funds our company expects to start generating revenue after completing the steps described below if we do not raise enough cash through this offering the following plan of operation below will take effect after we raise enough funds to do so the expenses referenced herein including the costs for the materials and equipment were estimated based on the presidents personal expectations and it is not based in any market research or third party professionals opinion for this reason there is no certainty that the amounts disclosed will be sufficient to accomplish the objectives listed herein month  to  internet office supplies and telephone costs funds to be used for office supplies internet and telephone bills the president will be responsible to pay the bills and to purchase office supplies month  to  development phase we began on searching for the suitable third party company or individuals to develop our product we intend to purchase baggage back packs suitcases luggage etc for measurements and placement of our product the companys president will be responsible for the purchase and hiring of third party developers we would also need to find the best option for hinges for the top door which would allow to insert the valuables and for the inside door to open and retrieve the valuables we would need to determine the ideal thickness of the safe walls considering the cost for the installation of our product without changing too much the final appearance of the luggage we intend to search for third party professional developers because they would be more qualified and experienced and it would probably result in a better final product we also plan on using part of the proceeds from this offering designated to this phase to secure the intellectual property of our products month  to  testing phase after our product is developed we plan on testing it in varied circumstances we intend to hire a third party company to conduct the tests if finances allow the companys president will be responsible for finding the third party testing company and overseeing process if necessary he will conduct the tests month  to  selling phase after we have fully developed and tested our products we intend to search for baggage manufactures and license our products we intend to license it for  in perpetuity of the gross sale of our products but it will be dependent on negotiations we intend to acquire photos of our products and email mail and fax it to prospected buyers capital resources if the company is unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a private placement offering it will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing which would be highly difficult for a new development stage company to secure therefore the company is highly dependent upon the success of the anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in the company having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing which may not even be available to the company however if such financing were available because the company is a development stage company with no operations to date it would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate at such time these funds are required management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load if the company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its common stock or secure debt financing it would be required to cease business operations as a result investors in the companys common stock would lose all of their investment off balance sheet arrangement the company is dependent upon the sale of its common shares to obtain the funding necessary to carry its business plan our president bunloet sriphanorm has undertaken to provide the company with operating capital to sustain its business over the next twelve month period as the expenses are incurred in the form of a nonsecured loan however there is no contract in place or written agreement securing these agreements investors should be aware that mr sriphanorms undertaking is neither under a contract nor agreement between him and the company other than the above described situation the company does not have any offbalance sheet arrangements that have or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the companys financial condition changes in financial condition revenues or expenses results of operations

in the state of nevada on september   pack fuerte inc intends to develop a built in safe with a combination lock that can store personal and or valuable items inside of backpacks carryon luggage and suitcases this safe would be assessable from the outside of the luggage for inserting valuables and the inserted items would be only recoverable from the inside we plan on generate revenue licensing our tobedeveloped products to luggage manufacturing companies after our prototypes is fully developed we expect to start generating revenues only after we are able to successfully implement our plan of operation   we have registered  of our common stock for sale to the public  our registration statement became effective on october   and we are in the process of seeking equity financing to fund our operations over the next  months  the company will fail if funds are not either raised in this offering or by loans either from the president or from other interested parties if we are unable to raise enough funds through this offering the company would have to seek additional capital through debt or equity as of the date of this report the current funds available to the company will not be sufficient to continue maintaining its reporting status the company  s sole officer and director mr sriphanorm is committed to provide funds required to maintain the reporting status in the form of a nonsecured loan for the next twelve months as the expenses are incurred if no other proceeds are obtained by the company however there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement management believes if the company cannot maintain its reporting status with the sec it will have to cease all efforts directed towards the company as such any investment previously made would be lost in its entirety should the company fail to raise capital through this offering and mr sriphanorm is unwilling or unable to loan the company funds to proceed with its plans the company will have to cease all business activities until such time further funds are raised  as the company does not currently have enough cash to fund its business plan and may not have enough to pay all of its liabilities if the company is unable to raise funds from this offering it may be able to issue restricted common shares to its creditors to satisfy their debts the company would only offer its creditors shares to settle debt if unable to raise equity financing the company would not settle any related party debt with this type of share offering  the company  s current debts are to its attorney and edgarizer there is no assurance that any of the company  s creditors would accept restricted shares from the company in exchange for their debts  results of operations as of august   we

compared to  in the threemonth period ended august   during the ninemonth period ended august   operating expenses totalized  compared to  during the ninemonth period ended august   plan of operation over the next  months provided that we have raised enough funds our company expects to start generating revenue after completing the steps described below if we do not raise enough cash through this offering the following plan of operation below will take effect after we raise enough funds to do so the expenses referenced herein including the costs for the materials and equipment were estimated based on the president  s personal expectations and it is not based in any market research or third party professional  s opinion for this reason there is no certainty that the amounts disclosed will be sufficient to accomplish the objectives listed herein month  to  internet office supplies and telephone costs funds to be used for office supplies internet and telephone bills the president will be responsible to pay the bills and to purchase office supplies month  to  development phase we began on searching for the suitable third party company or individuals to develop our product we intend to purchase baggage back packs suitcases luggage etc for measurements and placement of our product the companys president will be responsible for the purchase and hiring of third party developers we would also need to find the best option for hinges for the top door which would allow to insert the valuables and for the inside door to open and retrieve the valuables we would need to determine the ideal thickness of the safe walls considering the cost for the installation of our product without changing too much the final appearance of the luggage we intend to search for third party professional developers because they would be more qualified and experienced and it would probably result in a better final product we also plan on using part of the proceeds from this offering designated to this phase to secure the intellectual property of our products month  to  testing phase after our product is developed we plan on testing it in varied circumstances we intend to hire a third party company to conduct the tests if finances allow the companys president will be responsible for finding the third party testing company and overseeing process if necessary he will conduct the tests  month  to  selling phase   after we have fully developed and tested our products we intend to search for baggage manufactures and license our products we intend to license it for  in perpetuity of the gross sale of our products but it will be dependent on negotiations we intend to acquire photos of our products and email mail and fax it to prospected buyers capital resources if the company is unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a private placement offering it will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing which would be highly difficult for a new development stage company to secure therefore the company is highly dependent upon the success of the anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in the company having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing which may not even be available to the company however if such financing were available because the company is a development stage company with no operations to date it would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate at such time these funds are required management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load if the company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its common stock or secure debt financing it would be required to cease business operations as a result investors in the company  s common stock would lose all of their investment  off balance sheet arrangement the company is dependent upon the sale of its common shares to obtain the funding necessary to carry its business plan  our president bunloet sriphanorm has undertaken to provide the company with operating capital to sustain its business over the next twelve month period as the expenses are incurred in the form of a nonsecured loan however there is no contract in place or written agreement securing these agreements  investors should be aware that mr sriphanorm  s undertaking is neither under a contract nor agreement between him and the company

obligations and therefore are not required to provide the information  requested by this item item  controls and procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures our principal executive and financial officer  has concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly  report on form q our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae or de under the exchange act were not effective   the material weaknesses in our disclosure control procedures are as follows               lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions   the company utilizes a third party independent contractor for the preparation of its financial statements although the financial statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions the third party independent contractor is not involved in the day to day operations of the company and may not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reportingconsideration of certain transactions                audit committee and financial expert  the company does not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert and thus the company lacks the board oversight role within the financial reporting process we intend to initiate measures to remediate the identified material weaknesses including but not necessarily limited to the following     establishing a formal review process of significant accounting transactions that includes participation of the chief executive officer the chief financial officer and the company  s corporate legal counsel     form an audit committee that will establish policies and procedures that will provide the board of directors a formal review process that will among other things assure that management controls and procedures are in place and being maintained consistently changes in internal controls over financial reporting as reported in our report on form k for the annual year ended november   management is aware that there a significant deficiency and a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and therefore has concluded that the company  s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of august   the significant deficiency relates to a lack of segregation of duties due to the small number of employees involvement with general administrative and financial matters  the material weakness relates to a lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions   there have not been any changes in the companys internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended august   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to

from your auditor · you issue penny stock · you have nominal assets consisting only of cash · you anticipate that you will need additional funding to implement your business plan but there appear to be no efforts or current plans for obtaining this funding and your disclosure focuses only on the amount of funds necessary to remain a reporting company · the registration statement contains very general disclosure related to the nature of your business plan and · note  to your audited financial statements indicates that you may merge with an operating company these facts suggest that you are a blank check company and thus the terms of your offering should comply with rule  under the securities act of  as amended please revise this registration statement accordingly please see rule  and securities act release no  april   response we anticipate that we will need additional funding to implement your business plan accordingly all our focus at this time is on the success of this offering we believe that remaining a reporting company could facilitate the process to obtain additional financing if not enough proceeds are obtained by us through this offering it is our opinion that being a reporting company we would have more credibility we have also extended our business plan and deleted the indication on note  about merging with an operating company we have disclosed on page  pack fuerte inc is not a blank check company we have no plans arrangements commitments or understandings to engage in a merger with or acquisition of another company   please provide the disclosure

luggage manufacturing companies after you successfully develop prototypes as suggested on page  please disclose this in a clear manner response we have revised our disclosures on pages   and  to state

growth company page   we note your disclosure on page  that you are exempt from say on pay say on frequency and say on golden parachute payments under section ae of the exchange act however the disclosure that appears on page  that you may be entitled to exemptions under section a and b of the securities exchange act of  appears to be in error in this regard we note disclosure elsewhere that you intend to register the common stock under the securities exchange act please advise or revise response we have removed the exemptions under section a and b of the securities exchange act of  from page  and we have included the following in the same page the company intends to file in a period up to  days after the termination of this offering a form a making the company a mandatory reporting issuer under the securities and exchange act of  as amended the offering page   please disclose how the company will announce an extension of the offering for an additional  days if it chooses to do

include a discussion of the risks that investors face if less than  of the shares offered in this registration statement are sold in this regard we note disclosure that you believe you will need proceeds from the sale of at least   of the shares offered in order to implement your plan of operation and file sec reports response we have added the following risk factor starting on page  if less than  of the shares offered in this registration statement are sold we will need further investments in order to develop our business we believe we will need proceeds from the sale of at least   of the shares offered in order to implement your plan of operation and file sec reports if less than  of the shares offered in this registration statement are sold we will need further funding in order to develop our business there are no guarantees that we will be able to sell enough shares or that we will find other source of funding for our operations investors are at risk of losing all their investment risks related to this offering page   please include a discussion of the risks surrounding mr sriphanorm s ability as the companys sole employee in this selfunderwritten offering to market and consummate sales of the securities offered in light of his location in khok kruat the limited amount of time available to administer this offering and if true his lack of experience in raising funds in a public offering response we have added the following risk factor on page  this is a selfunderwritten offering and our sole employee has limited time available and no prior experience in raising funds in a public offering mr sriphanorm our sole officer and director lives in thailand and currently devotes about  hours per week to pack fuerte inc he is prepared to devote more time to our operations as may be required but there are no guarantees he will be able to also he has no proven ability to market and consummate sales of the securities offered herein as he had no prior experience in raising funds in a public offering  please include a discussion of how the lack of cumulative voting rights concentrates power in the hands of a majority shareholder under the heading since our companys sole officer and director currently owns  of the outstanding common stock investors may find that his decisions are contrary to their interests response we have added on page  the following as the first paragraph in the risk factor mentioned above the lack of cumulative voting rights concentrates power in the hands of a majority shareholder and in conjunction with nevadas control share law and business combination law it may prevent transactions that are in the best interests of investors  please include a discussion of the risk that the lack of cumulative voting rights in conjunction with nevadas control share law and business combination law may prevent transactions that are in the best interests of investors this may be combined with the discussion called for in comment  above response we have combined the response for this comment with the response to comment  risks associated with management and control persons page     under an appropriate subheading in this section please include a discussion of the risks posed by mr sriphanorm  s lack of experience as an executive officer as the head of a public company or any company as a director or in the luggage or safe industries response we have added the following risk factor on page  our sole officer and director has no prior experience managing our line of business or as the head of any company mr sriphanorm our sole officer and director has no prior experience as an executive officer as the head of a public company or any company as a director or in the luggage or safe industries his inexperience may affect our business negatively our company may not be able to establish and maintain disclosure controls procedures and internal control over financial reporting page   the possibility that enforcing american legal rights against mr sriphanorm may be difficult due to his residence in khok kruat appears to be distinct from risks related to disclosure and internal controls please place the second paragraph under this heading under a separate appropriately titled heading response we have separated the second paragraph of the above mentioned risk factor and added a new heading on page  because our sole officer and director resides abroad shareholders may have difficulties enforcing their legal rights under united states securities laws since our sole officer and director resides in nakhon ratchasimathailand shareholders may have difficulties enforcing their legal rights under united states securities laws therefore if any event which would request his personal presence in the united states including judgment or legal matters concerning him for instance it may be difficult to get him at the needed time this may lead to delays unforeseen situations and lack of investors trust in our sole officer and director such matters could have a significant negative effect on the success of our business however mr sriphanorm is willing to adjust his timetable to devote more time to the companys business and accommodate with travel if the business requires to if we are unable to succeed in marketing establishing partnerships or develop sic our products we will not be able to achieve profitable operations and our business may fail page     we note your statement in both the heading and discussion of this risk factor that failure to enter into partnerships may cause your business to fail this would seem to imply that you intend to seek out partnerships to enter however you state on pages  and  that you have no plans to partner with another business please revise as appropriate response we have revised the following risk factor starting on page  if we are unable to succeed in marketing or developing our products we will not be able to achieve profitable operations and our business may fail if we are unable to succeed in marketing or developing our products we will be unable to achieve profitable operations any time new products are introduced into a market there is a substantial risk that revenue will not meet expectations or even cover the cost of operations while we anticipate the ability to attract clients there is no way to predict the volume that will occur or even if it will be sufficient enough to support our future operations numerous factors beyond our control may affect the marketability of our business these factors include but are not limited to consumer demand and emerging competition the exact effect of these factors cannot be accurately predicted but it is possible they may result in our not receiving an adequate return on our invested capital we have limited experience in marketing products and we may experience development or manufacturing problems which could increase our losses existing and future laws or regulations can affect our business and we may not have the ability to comply with these laws or regulations page   please revise this risk factor to better describe the risk that future law and regulation could impact you adversely given the specific types of activities you plan to engage in please also revise the first paragraph under this heading to better identify the industry whose growth you are referring to and revise to clarify the meaning of the final two sentences in this paragraph response we have revised the risk factor on page  existing and future laws or regulations can affect our business and we may not have the ability to comply with these laws or regulations changes to laws and regulations are often unpredictable and out of anyones control  governments can adopt and enforce new and stricter regulations  which could ultimately vary from state to state and country to country our company could be affected by new regulations towards our line of business depending on the regulation there is a possibility of us having to reformat all of the existing structure of the product at that time  without an established business and enough capital to comply with such regulations we could lose operations as a result  the second and third paragraphs under this heading appear to address risks unrelated to the effect of laws or regulations on your business please revise to present them under appropriatelytitled headings response we have added new headings for the second and third paragraphs of the above mentioned risk factor on page  our dependency on third party professionals may be adverse to our results our dependence on hiring the appropriate third parties to perform essential services could result in material adverse effects on the companys potential future operations as well as with the companys business including operating results and financial condition further such third party contractors have no fiduciary duty to our shareholders and may not perform these services as expected the capacity of certain third parties for these services may be limited for economic or other reasons we depend on additional capital to implement our business and generate revenue the company is presenting this offering in order to raise capital the company will fail if funds cannot be raised in this offering or by loans from other interested parties if we are unable to raise enough funds through this offering the company would have to seek additional capital through debt or equity plan of distribution page   please revise the second to last paragraph under this heading to clarify what rules and regulations under the exchange act you are referring to response             we have revised the above mentioned paragraph on page  our common stock is currently considered a penny stock under federal securities laws securities exchange act section a a since its market price is below  per share penny stock rules generally impose additional sales practice and disclosure requirements on brokerdealers penny stock reform act who sell or recommend such shares to certain investors information with respect to registrant page   your disclosure in the first paragraph under this heading states that on november   mr peralta resigned as sole officer and director of pack fuerte inc and mr sriphanorm was appointed sole officer and director we note that the  shares currently owned by mr sriphanorm were issued to mr peralta please disclose the manner in which ownership of the company was transferred see item a which calls for disclosure of major corporate events response we have added the paragraph below on pages    and  initially mr sriphanorm was expected to become a member of the board mr peralta was unable to fulfill his fiduciary duties as president and ceo due to personal reasons therefore mr sriphanorm purchased the  shares initially issued to mr peralta at par value in a private transaction market opportunity page   please clarify the second and third paragraphs under this heading specifically please clarify the language in the parenthetical in the second paragraph and substantiate the assertions made in the third paragraph response we have revised the above mentioned paragraphs on page  and  people who travel may often have visitors in their hotel room or may be traveling with an unreliable companion eg friends minor children teenagers andor family members these people could have access to wallets passports or other valuable possessions some people can take cash or credit cards from friendsparents wallets without consent and there is always the risk of robbery from the housekeeping while the guest is absent tourists are also a target for pickpocketing it is our opinion that our tobedeveloped product would substantially increase the security against petty thefts we also believe that the concept for our security product is innovative and it could be of great interest for the general public because of its security and convenience for these reasons our opinion is that it could be excellent for the manufacturer to have our security products installed in their products therefore offering a new line of novelty products could increase their sales description of our services page   please clarify your description of your tobedeveloped safe it is unclear how it differs from the standard pieces of luggage with builtin locks that you refer to in the fifth bullet point under this heading please also address what distinguishes your product on page  under competitive advantages response we have added the  paragraphs below on pages  our planned product would differ from the existing pieces of luggage with built in locks because it would be an independent safe connected inside the luggage with the option to have it locked even when the luggage is wide open because the locks for the luggage and for the safe would not be interconnected our product would give the option to use the same or a different code to unlock the safe and the luggage this feature is especially useful to give some privacy and security to the main user when sharing the luggage with another person the main innovative feature would be the opening system on the outside of the luggage that would allow valuables to be inserted but restricted from being taken out through the outside of the bags we have also included the below paragraph on page  our brochures would have all the specs of our product and a simulated cost of implementation for our clients our president would hire someone to develop our brochure and if no funds are available at the time he would try and develop our brochures himself intellectual property page   we note that your business proposes to generate revenue through licensing arrangements however neither here nor in your plan of operation do you discuss measures you will take to protect the intellectual property you propose licensing or account for the costs of acquiring defensible intellectual property rights please revise this section thoroughly or add a discussion under risk factors relating to the fact that your source of revenue may be intellectual property that is not subject to copyright trademark or patent protection that you have no plans to secure protections for your intellectual property and have made no provisions for the costs of securing such protections in addition if you plan to include nondisclosure and noncompetition provisions in any license agreement that you would enter into please discuss that here as well as any limitations or shortcomings of those types of provisions response we have included the following statement on page  we plan on using part of our proceeds from our development phase to secure the intellectual property of our products see plan of operations for more details employees and employment agreements page   you state that mr sriphanorm is employed elsewhere please disclose if true that this is a reference to his being selfemployed as stated on page  we also note that mr srinaphanorm has flexibility to work on pack fuerte up to  hours per week however the following sentence states that he is prepared to devote more time to your operations as may be required please reconcile these mutually contradictory statements response we have revised the above mentioned paragraph starting on page  as the date of this prospectus pack fuerte has no permanent staff other than its sole officer and director mr bunloet sriphanorm who is the president and chairman of the company mr sriphanorm is selfemployed and currently works on pack fuerte about  hours per week he is prepared to devote more time to our operations as may be required he is not

analysis of financial condition and results of operations page  plan of operation page   please elaborate on the steps you plan to take in each of the three phases you list here for example in the development stage please explain what is involved in developing the product and why you need to hire a third party to do this in the testing phase explain what type of testing you plan to do and again why you would need to hire a third party to conduct testing response we have elaborated the steps of our plan of operation starting on page  month  to  development phase we plan on searching for the suitable third party company or individuals to develop our product we intend to purchase baggage back packs suitcases luggage etc for measurements and placement of our product the companys president will be responsible for the purchase and hiring of third party developers developing our product consists in measuring and analyzing existing baggage back packs suitcases luggage etc to figure out the best way to have our product in it without compromising excessive space weight and the look of each product at this time we plan on having it installed on the inside back part of the baggage possibly we may use plastic or aluminum due to its resistance lower weight and durability however we need to consider factors like security check points in airports no metal the best possible shape for the safe round or sharp corners for example we would also need to find the best option for hinges for the top door which would allow to insert the valuables and for the inside door to open and retrieve the valuables the best way to have the doors placed and working will also need developed we would analyze the best possibility for the openings considering the width and height the way it would open close and lock without compromise too much of space we would need to determine the ideal thickness of the safe walls considering the material chosen and also the cost for the installation of our product without changing too much the final appearance of the luggage we intend to develop third party professional developers because they would be more qualified and experienced and it would probably result in a better final product wed look for someone with knowledge on different materials costs weight and resistance we also plan on using part of the proceeds from this phase to secure the intellectual property of our products depending on the funds acquired through this offering according to the percentage of shares sold some compromises may be needed if we can sell all shares offered herein wed have  to invest and if we can only sell  of the shares offered herein wed only have  with a higher amount to be invested wed be able to hire a third party company or individuals to develop our product with higher qualifications and experience wed be able to buy betternew materials and hire attorneys to secure our intellectual property with a lower amount to be invested wed only be able to hire a third party company or individuals to develop our product with lower qualifications and little or no experience we could also have to negotiate a compensation based on our licensing results if we cannot pay for their services at that time however there are no guarantees that this would be accepted by the developers wed have to buy cheaperused materials and hire an attorney to advise us on the process to secure our intellectual property also with more funds to be used in this phase we could develop more types of prototypes for different types of luggage with limited funds wed have to focus on only one type of luggage planed use of proceeds for development phase  of shares sold  of shares sold  of shares sold  of shares sold purchase of baggage and materials     third party contractors     intellectual property     month  to  testing phase after our product is developed we plan on testing it in varied circumstances we intend to hire a third party company to conduct the tests if finances allow the companys president will be responsible for finding the third party testing company and overseeing process if necessary he will conduct the tests the tests are necessary to assure quality and functionality of our final product we plan on having the specs on size temperature resistance security and resistance of the safe and locks including shock absorption also important would be the final test with the end user we would use a certain number of people to try our product we would need to test our product under hard circumstances dropping it hammering it trying to break in etc but more importantly we are willing to consider the end user feedback and adjust our product to assure the highest quality possible we believe that the use of third party testing companies would be cost efficient as it would be done in a faster and more objective nonbiased way it is our opinion that having results from a third party would give us more credibility depending on the funds acquired through this offering according to the percentage of shares sold some compromises may be needed if we can sell all shares offered herein wed have  to invest and if we can only sell  of the shares offered herein wed only have  with a higher amount to be invested wed be able to hire a third party company to conduct the tests on our prototypes with a lower amount to be invested wed have to rely on acquaintances for low or no compensation and the president would be responsible for conducting all the tests planed use of proceeds for testing phase  of shares sold  of shares sold  of shares sold  of shares sold hire third party testing companies      month  to  selling phase  after we have fully developed and tested our products we intend to search for baggage manufactures and license our products we intend to license it for  in perpetuity of the gross sale of our products but it will be dependent on negotiations we intend to acquire photos of our products and email mail and fax it to prospected buyers our brochures would have all the specs of our product and a simulated cost of implementation for our clients our president would hire someone to develop our brochure and if no funds are available at the time he would try and develop our brochures himself depending on the funds acquired through this offering according to the percentage of shares sold some compromises may be needed if we can sell all shares offered herein wed have  to invest and if we can only sell  of the shares offered herein wed only have  with a higher amount to be invested wed be able to hire professional photographers and hire a third party company to help us finding possible clients wed also be able to reach a bigger number of prospected clients with a lower amount to be invested wed have to take our own photos of our products and wed have to search for baggage manufactures with no help from professionals wed be able to reach a smaller number of prospected clients the companys president will be responsible for all negotiations  planed use of proceeds for selling phase  of shares sold  of shares sold  of shares

discuss what you would expect to do if you do not raise sufficient funds including the likelihood that you would enter into a sale of the company an acquisition of another business or other business combination response we have inserted the  paragraphs below on page  because funding is critical to our ability to complete the phases of our plan of operation in the case we are not able to raise enough funds through this offering we would have to focus on finding another source of funds possibly try to raise equity financing however being a development stage company with no revenues to date it could be very difficult we have no plans to enter into a sale of the company an acquisition of another business or other business combination capital resources and liquidity page   please disclose the amount of funds you believe you need in order to complete all three phases of your plan of operations and thereby become operational we note that you believe that  of the offering amount must be raised in order to maintain your reporting status for  months we also note that you have an understanding with mr sriphanonn that he will contribute up to  for this purpose however this does not address what funds will be necessary before the company can begin generating revenue response we have revised our prospectus to add the information below on page  and  we believe that we could possibly start generating revenue with the sale of at least  of the shares offered herein however we would have to compromise our plan of operations  we would depend on the acceptance from the third party developers to have a compensation based on our future licensing results and we would have to focus on only one type of luggage  please clarify whether even if your offering is fully subscribed you will need to raise additional funds to complete all three phases of your plan of operation for example we note your disclosure that  m anagement believes that if subsequent private placements are successful we will generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof which suggests that you may already believe that subsequent private placements will be necessary in order to become operational regardless of the amount of proceeds raised in the offering response we have revised the above mentioned paragraph on page  management believes that if we are able to raise enough funds through this offering or if we are not able to sell enough shares and subsequent private placements are successful we will generate sales revenue within the following twelve months thereof    clearly discuss what other sources of liquidity you would likely pursue if the offering does not provide the amount of proceeds you need to become operational also discuss any limitations on your ability to actually obtain liquidity from such other sources response we have revised the paragraph below on page  if this offering does not provide the amount of proceeds we need to become operational we would have to focus on finding another source of funds possibly try to raise equity financing however being a development stage company with no revenues to date additional equity financing could not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all and thus we would fail to satisfy our future cash requirements we would be unable to develop our product and generate revenue directors and executive

company will fail if funds are not either raised in this offering or by loans either from the president or from other interested parties if we are unable to raise enough funds through this offering the company would have to seek additional capital through debt or equity as of the date of this report the current funds available to the company will not be sufficient to continue maintaining its

months as the expenses are incurred if no other proceeds are obtained by the company however there is no contract in place or written agreement securing this agreement management believes if the

raise funds from this offering it may be able to issue restricted common shares to its creditors to satisfy their debts the company would only offer its creditors shares to settle debt if unable to raise equity financing the company would not settle any related party debt with this type of share offering the companys current debts are to its attorney   and edgarizer there is no assurance that

of third party developers we would also need to find the best option for hinges for the top door which would allow to insert the valuables and for the inside door to open and retrieve the valuables we would need to determine the ideal thickness of the safe walls considering the cost for the installation of our product without changing too much the final appearance of the luggage we intend to search for third party professional developers because they would be more qualified and experienced and it would probably result in a better final product we also plan on using part of the proceeds from this

the company is unsuccessful in raising the additional proceeds through a private placement offering it will then have to seek additional funds through debt financing which would be highly difficult for a new development stage company to secure therefore the company is highly dependent upon the success of the anticipated private placement offering and failure thereof would result in the company having to seek capital from other sources such as debt financing which may not even be available to the company however if such financing were available because the company is a development stage company with no operations to date it would likely have to pay additional costs associated with high risk loans and be subject to an above market interest rate at such time these funds are required management would evaluate the terms of such debt financing and determine whether the business could sustain operations and growth and manage the debt load if the company cannot raise additional proceeds via a private placement of its common stock or secure debt financing it would be required to cease business operations as a result investors in the companys common stock would lose all of

procedures evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures based upon an evaluation of the effectiveness of disclosure controls and procedures our principal executive and financial officer  has concluded that as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on form q our disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules ae or de under the exchange act were not effective   the material weaknesses in our disclosure control procedures are as follows               lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions   the company utilizes a third party independent contractor for the preparation of its financial statements although the financial statements and footnotes are reviewed by our management we do not have a formal policy to review significant accounting transactions and the accounting treatment of such transactions the third party independent contractor is not involved in the day to day operations of the company and may not be provided information from management on a timely basis to allow for adequate reportingconsideration of certain transactions                audit committee and financial expert  the company does not have a formal audit committee with a financial expert and thus the company lacks the board oversight role within the financial reporting process we intend to initiate measures to remediate the identified material weaknesses including but not necessarily limited to the following     establishing a formal review process of significant accounting transactions that includes participation of the chief executive officer the chief financial officer and the company  s corporate legal counsel     form an audit committee that will establish policies and procedures that will provide the board of directors a formal review process that will among other things assure that management controls and procedures are in place and being maintained consistently changes in internal controls over financial reporting as reported in our report on form k for the annual year ended november   management is aware that there a significant deficiency and a material weakness in our internal control over financial reporting and therefore has concluded that the company  s internal controls over financial reporting were not effective as of may   the significant deficiency relates to a lack of segregation of duties due to the small number of employees involvement with general administrative and financial matters  the material weakness relates to a lack of formal policies and procedures necessary to adequately review significant accounting transactions    there have not been any changes in the companys internal control over financial reporting during the quarter ended may   that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect the companys internal control over financial reporting     part ii  other information item  legal
