restaurant at  second street san francisco on february   the hongrykong food truck and the ovo cafe restaurant order their food and drink products through our subsidiary royal bakery sourcing and trading inc therefore we still placed orders to majestic production of peninsula to support the food truck and ovo cafe through november   at which time we ceased sales activity however we are still working with egg tart cafe united holdings to identify other opportunities for food distribution we are considering initiating another food distribution operation to utilize our existing central kitchen we presently plan that the prospective distribution could go through mobile units and or through online ordering services critical accounting policies and estimates basis of presentation the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated statements and reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period actual results could differ significantly from these estimates principles of consolidation the books and records of the parent company royal bakery

provision recorded for the year ended december   shipping costs are included in the cost of products purchased amortization intangible assets are stated at cost and are amortized using the straightline method over their estimated useful lives impairment of longlived asset we review our longlived assets including intangible assets subject to amortization for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable when such factors and circumstances exist we compare the projected undiscounted future cash flows associated with the future use and disposal of the related assets or group of assets to their respective carrying amounts impairment if any is measured as the excess of the carrying amount over the fair value based on market value when available or discounted cash flows of those assets and is recorded in the period in which the determination is made these tests were performed for the year ended december   and it was determined that the carrying value of the asset was impaired accordingly an impairment expense for the year ended december   amounting to  was recognized results of operations

about our company for the years ended december   and  december  balance sheet data   cash     total assets     total liabilities     shareholders equity deficiency      going concern royal bakery holdings inc is a development stage company and currently has limited operations our independent auditor has issued an audit opinion for royal bakery which includes a statement raising substantial doubt as to our ability to continue as a going concern liquidity and capital resources our cash balance at december   was  our total current assets were  and our total current liabilities were  resulting in a working capital deficit of  total expenditures over the next  months are expected to be approximately  if we experience a shortage of funds prior to generating revenues from operations we may utilize funds from our director who has informally agreed to advance funds to allow us to pay for operating costs however they have no formal commitment arrangement or legal obligation to advance or loan funds to us management believes our current cash balance will not be sufficient to fund our operations for the next twelve months plan of operation our plan of operations over the month period consists of creating a new brand and reselling bakery and food products to wholesalers and retailers we are planning to get into the online catering businesses since we have contracted the central kitchen in belmont california in connection with our business of reselling bakery and food products we will monitor the quality of the products we purchase a substantial portion of which are produced by majestic production which is owned by egg tart cafe if necessary we will assist majestic production in refining the menu and providing technical assistance to improve its productivity although we are not required to do so we believe that it is in our best interest to coordinate closely with majestic production and share our expertise if it can improve the quality of the food offered to our customers on a timing level we anticipate that we will take the following actions over the following periods  in the days from december   we will work with egg tart cafe to find a brand to develop our franchise operation we expect to develop a smaller operation then a full services restaurant such as a deli and cafe type of food business we have developed the website and will be ready for online catering operation  in the  days we hope we can establish another brand for our catering operation and review the performance of this online catering business  in the  days management hopes to evaluate the result of our planning operation and assist egg tart cafe to fine tune this business model particular the online catering operation we plan to develop an online food delivery service and a line of grocery items we plan to bottle our sauces such as curry sauce cream sauce tomato sauce and black pepper sauce as grocery items we believe that these products will help maintain operations we plan to work with a mobile grocery truck operator to sell the sauces and our existing frozen food items we currently provide food and grocery products to this mobile grocery operator and use online ordering to prearranged pick up locations for the customers we believe the above mentioned programs have the potential to help royal bakery to generate income to maintain operations our future is dependent upon our ability to obtain further financing the successful development of our planned food services a successful marketing and promotion program and achieving a profitable level of operations the issuance of additional equity securities by us could result in a significant dilution in the equity interests of our current stockholders obtaining commercial loans assuming those loans would be available will increase our liabilities and future cash commitments there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain further funds required for our continued operations even if additional financing is available it may not be available on terms we find favorable at this time there are no anticipated sources of additional funds in place failure to secure the needed additional financing will have an adverse effect on our ability to remain in business off balance sheet transactions we have had no off balance sheet transactions apr   c  cybernet data systems inc all rights
