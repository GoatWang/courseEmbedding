email us think green homeenvironmental impact think green compacting trash is socially responsible and benefits the environment compactors are ecofriendly appliances for handling trash with compactors in your quickservice restaurant your customers notice efforts to reduce trash volume and become more environmentally friendly it simply improves guests’ perception of restaurant cleanliness and “green” efforts here are some facts to consider of how trash compactors can help the planet we live on compaction decreases the number of trash bags going into our landfills one compactor can prevent  plastic bags from entering our landfills each year plastic trash bags are necessary to keep trash containers from becoming stained and to make it easier to handle trash but plastic bags create a physical barrier moisture barrier and oxygen barrier that inhibit the decomposition of solid waste in landfills reducing the quantity of plastic is a step in the right direction to help improve the degradation of solid waste by compacting trash the number of trash bags required goes down for example if a dining room has  trash containers that are emptied  times per day then switches to a compactor that is emptied  time per day that’s a daily savings of  plastic trash bags per day  per week over  per month or  plastic trash bags per year  plastic trash bags that don’t get into landfills every year – that’s green compaction saves fuel and reduces the carbon footprint trash trucks are absolutely necessary to collect and transport solid waste to landfills but trash trucks are not exactly fuel efficient compacting trash in the dining room reduces the volume of trash in the dumpster and reduces the number of times per week the dumpster needs to be emptied for example if a trash dumpster is emptied  times per week and as a result of compacting dining room trash can be emptied  times per week it would save trash haulers  of their operating costs for a trash truck that gets  mpg and is driven  miles per year a  reduction amounts to  gallons of diesel per year – that’s green once trash gets to a landfill operators try to cover the loose trash with dirt and compact the trash as much as possible the idea being to get as much loose trash into a landfill as possible for two reasons  to avoid opening more landfills and  to promote the biodegradation of the trash and produce methane gas landfill operators know compacting trash is good thats why they use gigantic earthmoving equipment to cover trash and roll it down tight compacting trash where it is created dining room of a qsr is more efficient than hauling it loose then trying to compact it in the landfill its hard to put a number on it but directionally it makes sense to compact at the point of origin and save the expense in fuel and equipment compacting in a landfill impact award recipients  va medical centers awards we are proud to be recognized for the following awards bold award finalist –  ahe

inc located in the minneapolis suburb of brooklyn park offers an exciting new solution to waste management our frontofhouse trash compactors and ptc restroom paper towel compactors  can save you time and money by collecting and compacting trash in one step on site best of all our at the source compacting gives you have the freedom to install a unit anywhere customers dispose of their own trash in a public setting  what is “at the source” trash compacting trash compactors or balers have been around for decades in “backofhouse” applications where filled trash bags are smashed together into lb cubes   these very large cubes are then tiedoff moved and lifted into the trash dumpster  our compactors give the same benefit of reducing volume immediately upon collection without the added labor intense step  when your customer disposes of trash in a receptacle provided by compaction technologies the unit automatically flattens and reduces the size of the solid waste  they don’t have to push open a door or cram trash through a small hole  our handsfree deposit system uses a motion sensor to automatically open the trash door  after trash is deposited it’s compacted automatically and taken to the dumpster  not only does this decrease your organizations carbon footprint and increase cleanliness it eliminates the need for your staff to empty the waste container several times a day and avoids the added steps of compacting or baling in the back of the house depending on the trash volume your customers produce your staff may only need to empty the frontofhouse trash compactors once a day  that saves a tremendous amount of labor that can be redirected elsewhere  benefits of choosing compaction over traditional waste management bins besides labor savings having a customerfacing trash compactor improves the customer’s perception of your organization business with one glance  we are proud to help facilitate your sustainability efforts through our ecotrash® line of compactors   the ecofriendly logo on each unit shows your commitment to the environment and makes people feel good about their choice to patronize your company however the benefit goes far beyond what they can see  by replacing a single garbage can with a trash compactor you could prevent  plastic bags from ending up in landfills this reduces the negative impact plastic bags have on although plastic bags are essential to contain the trash they have physical moisture and oxygen barriers that slow the decomposition of solid waste in landfills compaction also reduces the number of trips trash haulers must make to retrieve  and haul trash to a landfill since these trucks average only three miles per gallon of fuel reducing the number of trips can save over  miles per truck per year why compaction
