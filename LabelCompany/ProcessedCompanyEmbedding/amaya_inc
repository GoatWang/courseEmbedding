amayas primary market is the european union eu and it currently operates some or all of its online gaming verticals in various eu jurisdictions through national licenses or approvals additionally rational groups subsidiaries that hold malta licenses use the same to offer some or all of its online gaming verticals to residents in eu member states in compliance with established eu rules and principles on the free movement of services amaya believes there is an ongoing trend for eu member states to establish national regulatory licensing and taxation systems for online gaming including but not limited to poker casino sportsbetting or a combination thereof according to the european commission all national regulatory systems for online gaming must comply with applicable eu principles amaya intends to seek licensure in more eu member states if and when such member states introduce their own national regulatory and licensing systems outside the eu the licenses and approvals granted to amaya subsidiaries by the applicable gaming authorities in the isle of man and malta generally permit the applicable entity to operate and accept customers in various jurisdictions around the world where no national regulatory and licensing system specifically requires licensure by foreign operators amaya anticipates there is a potential for national regulation of online gaming outside the eu and that this may result in potential licensing or partnerships with private operators in various jurisdictions  with respect to online gaming amaya supports regulation including licensing and taxation regimes which it believes will promote sustainable online gaming markets that are beneficial for consumers governments and the citizens of the regulating jurisdiction operators and the industry as a whole amaya strives to work with applicable governmental authorities to develop regulations that it expects would protect consumers encourage responsible gaming ensure efficient taxation and promote regulated gameplay amaya also strives to be among the first of the licensed operators in newly regulated jurisdictions in each case to the extent it would be in

of canadas most attractive growth opportunities buy now before its too latethe worlds largest online gambling website operator  of the online poker marketcorporate strategy that will deliver doubledigit revenue growth for years to comegreat macroeconomic exposure in a rapidly expanding industryamaya inc nasdaqaya a brief introduction headquartered in pointeclaire québec amaya according to the companys website is a leading provider of technologybased solutions products and services in the global gaming and interactive entertainment industries when david baazov founded the company in  the main segment of operations was businesstobusiness bb they were a software provider for lottery gaming and landbased gaming operations casinos this was the main business segment prior to the acquisitions made sequentially becoming quoted on the tsx on july  amaya gaming group inc went public on the tsx venture exchange in  it was graduated to the much larger canadian exchange the tsx on august st  they acquired oldford group for cad  billion the holding company of rational group this acquisition completely changed the companys corporate strategy which will be discussed in much more detail below as of june th the company also traded on the nasdaq my interest was sparked as the company began a shift towards becoming a businesstoconsumer bc provider of online and mobile gaming services as of july th  amaya is the worlds largest publicly traded real money online gaming company accountable for approximately  of the global online poker market and over  billion hands of online poker the following analysis will take an indepth look at amayas strategy operating environment as well as valuation i am recommending a strong buy on a company that is fairly valued offers exciting revenue growth opportunities as well as holding a competitive economic moat in a rapidly growing industry source stock charts corporate growth strategies and segmented operations the companys corporate strategy is fairly simple be the biggest most efficient online gambling not only poker operator in the world as they acquired the likes of pokerstars and fulltilt poker amaya became the worlds largest poker site they represent approximately  of the market with pokerstars alone representing a bit above  of the global online poker market as can be seen below also provided below is the revenue breakdown of amaya and their main competitors the pie chart examined below shows just how impressive amayas market power is we could almost qualify amaya as being a monopoly in the online cashgame poker industry source amaya investor presentation their reliance on a single product is very clear and is one of the reasons why management is looking to diversify its vertical markets in the q mda document management emphasizes that they have begun the process of developing their current online platforms in order for them to generate approximately  of their revenues from casino and sports books in  they launched an online casino product as a test run in the same year amaya conducted a survey which revealed that  of their active users have igaming igaming and online gambling are interchangeable nouns accounts on other platforms in order to access different segments this crossselling opportunity will undoubtedly help topline growth but even more so the bottomline as platforms are for the most part already developed i am personally very skeptical of surveys but there is no doubt that these markets exist indeed by looking at the competition see graph below they all offer a diversified portfolio of products source amaya investor presentation the fact that amaya had  of total revenues from poker in  approximately  in q of  would be cause for concern if not for the strength of their brands and platforms i believe that going forward diversification to their revenue streams can only be beneficial for the company albeit they are able to maintain the very high operating margins they have been accustomed to other than getting money from more pockets the diversification into the sports books and casino segments is very beneficial for geographic diversification with approximately  of revenues coming from the eu the launch of sports book and daily fantasy betting will undoubtedly increase us revenues the fact of the matter is online gambling whether it be poker bingo sports casino  you name it is still illegal in the majority of the us to help visualize the situation here is a map that was neatly put together by the competitive enterprise institute cei source cei there are a total of three states that online gambling is explicitly legal in new jersey nevada and delaware while this may seem bleak an interesting aspect of the us market is that while online gambling is widely banned play money poker is a very common pasttime party poker and fulltilt poker rose to fame in northamerica by offering a free online poker game the two brands possess approximately  of the market share of the free services many of which are players who would participate in money games if not for it being illegal considering amaya is launching pokerstars in new jersey in q of  we expect revenues from the us to slowly ramp up if we consider that some states are pushing forward with legislative reforms to allow online gambling the opportunities in the us could be even more substantial for amaya the main strategic theme that managers are expressing is to diversify into more vertical markets as expressed above that being said i believe and so does management that poker must remain amayas core competency amaya states that they aim at doubling their poker revenues in the next five years they plan on doing this through the use of superstar brand ambassadors like cristiano ronaldo and neymar jr as well as producing and promoting international live poker tours and events ept lapt appt they plan on increasing exposure to emerging markets mainly in southamerica and asia the entry into the us market in  will also help drive revenue growth as poker is set to be the fastest growing segment of the igaming industry as shown below source amaya investor relations before concluding on the strategy section i think its important to have a quick side note on the legal issues the firm has faced since the end of  amaya has been under investigation by the amf as of december without any formal accusations made for more info click hyperlink above while being a legitimate threat to the company i believe it is overly emphasized by investors the reason why i say this is because the company has a compliance committee in place which will safeguard the company follows on track with their strategy without prosecution here are some of the notable individuals on the committee ben soave former chief superintendent to the rcmp harlan goodson former director of californias division of gambling control and tom auriemma former chair of the nj division of gaming enforcement the committee is there to insure that the business model amaya has is sustainable and ethical going forward lastly the company has proven their commitment on the more profitable bc segment by divesting bb assets on march th  innova gaming group inc filed a preliminary prospectus in connection to a proposed ipo innova was a wholly owned subsidiary of amayas amaya received gross proceeds of cad  million while maintaining approximately  ownership could be reduced to  if underwriters exercise options most recently on march th of  the company entered into a definitive agreement to sell  of the outstanding shares of amaya americas corporation the parent company of cadillac jack inc for approximately cad  million the message is clear and amaya is heavily focused on building a leader in the bc segment of the igaming industry allinall i believe the strategy going forward is very ambitious yet attainable im convinced the significant growth opportunities presented above will be achieved by the competent management group at amaya topdown investment thesis as some of you might know im a very topdown oriented investor and i dont necessarily love stock picking ok i do but its not my cup of tea a few weeks ago i posted an article showing why i believe that information technology stocks more precisely the it services and software subsector would outperform the broader tsx composite index while i did not focus on the igaming subsector i do recognize that they share very similar traits first of all it is outgrowing the larger economy and most other industries according to ibis industry reports the global casinos  online gambling industry march  is still in its growth phase from the years  to  revenues for the industry grew at a cagr of  they forecast that for the years  the industry will grow at a cagr of  supporting this hefty growth rate is the emergence of casinos and online gambling in asia mainly in macau and singapore hyperlinks are two interesting articles on the casino and gambling industry in the mentioned geographies as growth picks up in the coming years they also cite progressive legislation in the us and japan as strongly beneficial another interesting aspect of the report explains that the five years leading to  the number of enterprises in the industry grew at approximately  less than half of revenue this suggests that the industry grew organically and less through the emergence of new competition this is beneficial for those already operating in the sector the data described above from the ibis report is a combination of brickandmortar casinos and igaming platforms they are grouped as one industry as they cater to a similar consumer that being said the ease of access to the internet is much greater to that of brickandmortar casinos globally as a young adult with a certain interest in sports books and poker i am much more enticed with the opportunity to spoil my gambling vice on my tablet or computer then to visit a casino while this may not be true for highrollers and baby boomers i feel the longterm industry trend is leaning towards more flexible and cheaper online alternatives when i say cheaper i meant for me the consumer i could also have meant that the capital required to operate an online gambling venture is much less than that of a casino ie a server and domain vs ppe and a significant amount of labour costs hence this why i believe that the growth mentioned above is potentially understating revenue growth for igaming in itself a second strong theme is the favourable macroeconomic exposure the company has most notably to the european consumer ≈ of revenues as i love economics let me bust out a couple of indicators i feel support the theory of a recovering eu economy and consumer first of all the unemployment rate is trending downwards the last two months it was reported at  with the eu at  lowest since july  considering wage growth has been positive on a yoy basis since the beginning of   in march it is fair to say that the labour market is improving source trading economics consumer spending hit a record high in the euro area in q of  at  billion €  i feel that consumer spending is set to continue rising as favorable lending rates will encourage borrowing and increasing credit qe is set to continue for the duration of  putting unremitting pressure on interest and loan rates i would mention that consumer sentiment is approaching  year highs that being said this is a measure of optimism based off a phone survey so i dont consider it valid data phone surveys are even more ridiculous then written ones if you ask me source trading economics while this topdown point of view is what brought me to analyzing amaya the fundamentals as well as the cashflow analysis that are presented below are what transformed my interest into a solid buy recommendation fundamentals analysis as it is amaya has a very large economic moat in the online poker industry this advantage is the basis for why this company is so attractive amayas strong valuable brand equity as well as its sheer size will allow it to ensure longterm profits and market share in the igaming industry the fact that financials are average at best is less important to me then the competitive advantage they have in the industry lets not forget amayas bc business model only started in  the more amaya grows and diversifies the more the barriers to entry increases for firms attempting to take a share of the pie amayas assets are primarily centered around goodwill and intangible assets the biggest two components of this branch are goodwill and customer relationships the problem i have with this is that this value seems very bias unless customer relationships come in the form of contracts and ensured future cashflows the balance sheet does indicate significant leverage  billion cad in longterm debt as amaya has a de ratio of approximately  as of q  the high levels of ltdebt arose following the acquisition of the oldford group fortunately with  million cad in cash on hand amaya has no problem with meeting short term interest payments i believe the company is highly leveraged but shouldnt be seen as a threat to solvency although it may slow further acquisition processes the balance sheet isnt all that impressive but the income statement screams growth with the help of the oldford group acquisition amaya experienced  revenue growth in  yes this is the result of an acquisition thus essential to mention that the company has been growing at a cagr of  over the past  years if not had been for the loss on discontinued operations cadillac jack and innova amaya would have made their first profits in the year ending dec   in q of  the company reported a net profit of  million cad an eps of  while profits were realized in q losses on discontinued operations remained they had a loss of  million cad these losses have been decreasing over the past two quarters and i look for them to disappear by the end of  at latest q  eps and net income growth are forecasted to see significant growth in the coming  months amayas margins are better then its competitors in parentheses profit ebitda and operating margin were     and   respectively it is important to note that this doesnt only compare with online providers like bwin and  but also with competing casino operators such as las vegas sands company and industry data are from ycharts as i mentioned previously amaya is a growth opportunity amaya doesnt offer dividends and it has a very rudimentary share buyback plan maximum of  was allowed by the tsx on feb   thankfully it offers great value considering its growth potential dcf valuation model amaya currently sits at a ttm pe of  this is considering the very small bottom line the yr forward pe is slated to lower to  according to morningstar much lower than industry averages domestically and internationally i have put together a dcf model that reflects my optimism in the company while setting realistic assumptions going forward please see the table below in brief my growth assumptions are a tad below those of the company they expect to double poker revenues by  which would equate to approximately cad  billion they also plan on having other vertical markets casino sportsbooks etc representing  as soon as next year im convinced that by  it should be approximately  considering it is a less saturated revenue stream for the company to recapitulate the latter statements what this would mean is that the company expects revenues of approximately  billion cad by  using my forecasts i have a terminal year ebit of  billion cad which is derived from sales of approximately  billion cad using a wacc of  i end up with a pv of cashflows of  billion cad other notable assumptions sga is set to decrease from approximately  of sales to  of sales by  the risk freerate used in the wacc is the canadian yr bond yield at  the equity risk premium  was derived from aswath damodarans yearly premium list and lastly i added a legal and entry risk premium of  with a cumulative pv of fcf of cad  billion and an exit multiple of x evebit calculated using the approximate ttm evebit of the industry we get an ev of  billion and an equity value of  billion cad this gives me an implied target price of  cad and a price appreciation of  im new to dcfs spending most of my time on economics and sector based research id be glad to hear your comments and critiques of my model for any questions on assumptions and structure feel free to message me through seeking alpha conclusion amaya is the largest operator of online gambling websites in the world with a heavy focus on poker it operates in a growing industry and has exposure to favorable macroeconomic conditions in amaya you are you purchasing shares of a company that is set to continue to grow revenues in the double digits for at least  years to come without any further acquisitions management has established structured growth strategies that will complement the already existing economic moat of the company with a target price of  cad  usd i believe that amaya is undervalued at this time and is thus a strong buy morningstar broker analyst rating  nasdaq yr target  usd  cad desjardins rating buy
