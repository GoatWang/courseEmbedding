officer of specialist utilities and infrastructure investor ecofin says the firms newlylaunched china power  infrastructure fund is well poised to capitalise on the growth opportunities arising from chinas usdbn stimulus spending much of which is being directed toward the infrastructure and energy space gfm what is the background to your company and fund bl ecofin is a leading specialist in the utilities and infrastructure sectors worldwide managing over usdbn across a range of hedge funds longonly funds and mandates and invests through both public equities and private situations the firm has a global team of  utility specialists four of whom specialise in china ecofin was founded in  and has offices in london new york hong kong and geneva the ecofin china power  infrastructure fund is the latest addition to ecofins global utilities investment platform the fund pursues a longbiased longshort equity strategy and focuses on investment in largecap liquid public equities it aims to generate compelling riskadjusted returns in greater china and capitalise on the longterm growth potential in chinas utility and infrastructure space the fund seeks to generate absolute returns through dynamic portfolio construction and sector allocation based on macro and fundamental research the fund was launched on july  with a starting capital of usdm before the launch ecofin was already investing some of its assets in china though its global funds gfm who are your key service providers bl the key service providers for the ecofin china power  infrastructure fund are morgan stanley international and deutsche bank as custodians and prime brokers citi hedge fund services ireland as administrator ernst  young as auditor and simmons  simmons in the uk and maples and calder in cayman as legal advisers gfm have there been any recent changes to the management team bl for the firm overall the only change to the team has been the addition of david silverstein in new york earlier this year he came from merrill lynch where he was the no  analyst in utilities highyield debt as ranked by institutional investor for four of the past five years he brings strong fixedincome expertise to our specialised utilities team gfm how and where do you distribute your funds what is the profile of your current and targeted client base bl for the firm in general we have longterm relationships across the investor spectrum we have more than  current investors spread fairly evenly between north america europe and asia around  per cent of our hedge fund assets under management come from private banks and family offices with the rest from funds of funds and institutional clients we continue to work with a sovereign wealth fund managing a custom longonly mandate and we are developing strong relationships with more institutions especially as we will reach the fiveyear anniversary for our global utilities hedge fund in october the china power  infrastructure fund will be distributed globally gfm what is your investment process bl as with our other funds the china power  infrastructure investment team combines topdown macro analysis and bottomup company fundamental research in making investment decisions and develops investment thesis using both catalyst events and mismatches between valuation and stock price on the macro side the investment team takes into consideration a range of factors such as economic activities interest rates commodity prices and the regulatory environment and assesses the sensitivity of subsectors to each of these macro drivers the team also leverages ecofins global platform as well as the firms dedicated commodity research efforts the investment team is split between london and hong kong and frequently meets with companies in china both absolute and relative valuation metrics are considered in making investment decisions gfm how do you generate ideas for your funds bl ecofins investment strategy in china focuses on subsector allocations the team develops a detailed understanding of the subsectors and isolates key macro and fundamental drivers for each the team also spends time looking at each company including management visits in order to understand key fundamental drivers the combination of topdown and bottomup views leads to a clearly articulated view on subsectors that inform our subsector allocations we have often found our specialist angle enables us to establish views that differ from market consensus and to identify catalysts and valuation arbitrage opportunities gfm what is your approach to managing risk bl the china power  infrastructure fund employs ecofins existing risk management process and technology infrastructure the risk team monitors the portfolio in terms of beta exposure leverage and longshort ratios quantitative models are run to assess the portfolios exposure to a range of factors such as the broader equity market movement and commodity prices gfm how has your recent performance compared with your expectations and track record bl the existing investments in china within the global hedge fund portfolio have delivered performance for the year to date more than  per cent higher than the broader chinese market performance but with  per cent of the volatility going forward we expect the fund to continue to produce superior riskadjusted returns gfm what opportunities are you looking at right now bl the majority of chinas ongoing usdbn stimulus spending will go into the infrastructure and energy space which accelerates longterm growth and also provides catalysts and dispersion among the subsectors gfm what events do you anticipate in your sector in the year ahead bl we will continue to witness the growth effect generated by chinas stimulus spending efforts we expect to see further market liberalisation of manyheavily regulated sectors and tariff reforms as lower commodity prices and an inflationary environment create good conditions for a smoother transition to a more marketdriven system furthermore we expect explosive development in the renewable energy sectors the new renewable energy development targets that the government is setting will drive chinas domestic investment in the sector while at the same time global demand will provide huge opportunities for chinas lowcost equipment manufacturers gfm how will these developments affect your own portfolio bl we see exciting opportunities both on a longbiased basis in selective sectors but also dispersions among subsectors and companies the portfolio will have a clear overweight toward sectors that we believe are likely to benefit from upward tariff adjustments and high growth as well as winners in the renewable energy space gfm are investors expectations moving towards capital preservation bl our investment universe covers the entire value chain from cyclical upstream suppliers to defensive downstream asset operators the defensive portion of our universe which consists of traditional utility companies tends to outperform the market in downturns hence if we take a more conservative outlook on the market we can still manage capital in a way that delivers superior riskadjusted returns in the market overall we do believe that capital preservation and risk management have become more important since the credit crisis however the defensive characteristics of fund allocations in china despite the rally this year is reassuring in the sense that there is capital available to be allocated and any correction is unlikely to be too long or too deep gfm what differentiates you from other managers in your sector bl there is a lack of specialisation in chinas equity market and very few sector specialist funds at the moment this provides a great opportunity for us to extract alpha on companies and industries ecofin has longstanding experience investing in the sectors worldwide and it is the same expertise and understanding of these industries that we are trying to apply to china by investing in us and european companies that form part of the same value chain as chinese companies ecofin forms a more rounded understanding of the demand supply situation for the chinese companies our global commodity market research is also very relevant to their fundamentals gfm do you foresee problems in raising mandates from investors through  if so what factors will drive investors back to your funds bl investors are very cautious and many are facing liquidity constraints themselves capital is scarcer in the current environment and liquidity is becoming a primary concern for investors in this environment ecofins china fund provides investors with dedicated exposure to chinas infrastructure and utility space high liquidity monthly with  days notice and no financial leverage on capital china especially through our sectors offers a rare spot of countercyclical and consistent growth as well as dispersion opportunity amid the global economic slowdown we believe the supportive macro backdrop combined with ecofins specialist fundamental investment approach will enable us to achieve attractive returns gfm do you have any plans for other product launches in the near future bl we continue to think about how we can generate profits for our investors using our specialist investor knowledge across the industries that we cover and across capital structures we believe there are some great opportunities in renewables where we are already quite active and in credit where we have recently added to our team like this article  get the free daily newsletter

the manager believes egls strategy could be applied to a much larger fund expanding egls size should lower its ongoing charges ratio and improve liquidity in its shares strategy has room to grow egl had a market capitalisation of £m and total net assets of £m as at  may  the manager believes that its strategy could easily be applied to a much larger fund egls board believe that its high income and defensive growth characteristics should prove attractive to investors and allow egl to attract new shareholders and grow its asset base over time all things being equal expanding the size of the trust should have the dual benefits of lowering the ongoing charges ratio as fixed costs are spread over a wider base and improving liquidity in egls shares uk listed utilities sector has shrunk during the past decade egl is the only uk listed closedend fund to offer developed markets utilities and other economic infrastructure exposure the number of names in the listed utilities sector has shrunk considerably over the past decade through takeover activity which has reduced the opportunity set for investors looking for domestic uk utilities exposure egls manager says that as a consequence utilities exposure is under represented in the portfolios of uk investors both institutional and retail and that those looking for exposure need to look further afield this is in marked contrast to the us where private client portfolios traditionally include some meaningful utilities exposure the manager finds this surprising given the usually high level of income and the stability of returns that utilities offer utilities tend to offer stable returns as they engage in activities that are essential to the economy of which they are a part there are two utilities focused funds listed on the lse  egl and premier energy and water trust pew and they are distinctly different propositions they might even be considered to be potentially complementary allocations pew which is also a client of marten  co is smaller than egl its ordinary shares have a market capitalisation of £m as at  may  has a high level of structural gearing that is provided by zero dividend preference shares zdps and has a high allocation to higher growth emerging markets  as at  march  in this regard egl with its focus on developed market utilities and other economic infrastructure offers a unique proposition in the uk listed closedend funds space established as a rollover vehicle for ecofin water and power opportunities‌‌ egl was established in september  as one of two rollover vehicles for ecofin water and power opportunities ewpo like egl ewpo was a london listed closed end fund managed by ecofin that aimed to provide a high secure dividend yield and longterm capital growth however ewpo operated with a wider investment remit than egl like egl ewpo also used gearing borrowing or leverage with the aim of enhancing income but ewpos gearing was structural and was provided via zero dividend preference shares zdps and convertible unsecured loan stock culs while egls is all through its prime brokerage facility ewpo invested in unquoted investments and had a greater capacity to invest in companies outside of the oecd up to  the second rollover vehicle for ewpo is ef realisation limited this is listed on the lse under the ticker efr and was established to hold the illiquid and unquoted assets that were owned by ewpo prior to its reconstruction with the aim of conducting an orderly realisation by  september  the realisation is to be effected in a manner that seeks to achieve a balance between returning cash to shareholders and maximising the value of its portfolio ecofin remains the manager of this fund at the time of ewpos reconstruction shareholders were offered a cash exit of up to  of ewpos net assets less the cost of the reconstruction more information on ewpo and ef realisation can be found at the managers website no formal benchmark egl does not have a formal benchmark and is not constructed with reference to any index egl does not have a formal benchmark and its portfolio is not constructed with reference to an index however for the purposes of comparison egl compares itself to the msci world utilities index the msci world index and the allshare index in its own literature a similar approach has been used in this note although the msci uk index has been used to represent the uk market of the three indices the msci world utilities is arguably the most relevant although it should be noted that this index has a strong bias towards us companies  as at  march  market outlook and valuations recent history and valuations as illustrated in figures  and  global utilities have broadly underperformed global equity markets during the last five years much of this underperformance came during  and  which as illustrated in figure  was a period that saw global equity markets performing strongly relative performance was much more stable during  but  saw some sharper moves as markets became concerned about the outlook for china and its then inflated stock market early  saw a marked improvement in relative performance as concerns over china came to a head the prospect of interest rate rises receded and other concerns such as the uks referendum on eu membership and the us election came to the fore an improving global outlook has since seen global equity markets move up another leg so that global equity market valuations based on priceearnings pe ratios as illustrated in figure  are close to five year highs global utility valuations in comparison are much less demanding figure  msci world utilitiesmsci world rebased to  over five years   broad trend of underperformance by global utilties as global outlook improves

source bloomberg marten  co source bloomberg marten  co reflecting this performance both global equity market valuations and global utility valuations are now towards the top end of their fiveyear ranges although of the two global utility valuations are less demanding relative to their history for example as illustrated in figure  the msci world utilities index was trading at a month forward pe ratio of x at  may  this being  above its fiveyear average of x and  below its fiveyear high fiveyear range x to x this compares with the msci world index which was trading at a month forward pe ratio of x this being  above its fiveyear average of x and  below its fiveyear high five year range x to x as also illustrated in figure  global utility valuations appear to be inherently less volatile than broader global equity markets global utilities and interest rate sensitivity rising interest rates are generally considered to be negative for equities as an asset class with utilities being at the more sensitive end of the spectrum the conventional logic is that utilities tend to have stable cash flows and so can support higher levels of debt within their capital structures than many other equities however with higher levels of debt comes greater sensitivity of profits to changes in interest rates in reality the relationship may actually be more complicated taking a medium to longer term perspective there is evidence to suggest that the correlation between the performance of the utilities sector and interest rates is weak a simplistic view might say higher interest rates tend to depress the earnings of indebted companies such as many utilities and also increase the discount rate used by the market to ascribe a value to their future earnings both depressing valuations however utilities are largely regulated businesses whose pricing is periodically reset through tariff reviews most regulators will allow interest rate movements to be passed through to the end user thereby offsetting the longerterm impact of interest rate rises and allowing utilities to earn a real return reflective of market conditions similarly in more inflationary environments which are usually accompanied by rising interest rates utilities are frequently permitted to increase their tariffs in nominal terms both effects will tend to have a positive impact on earnings and exert upward pressure on valuations other sectors may not benefit from such automatic adjustments egls manager says that pure regulated utilities have some correlation to interest rates but globally and especially in europe utilities tend to be diversified with a variety of business models and degrees of regulation looking forward there is the prospect of further market volatility as interest rates move along the path towards normalisation however comparing utility valuations against the broader market suggest that some of this might already factored into current prices the manager thinks that this could be an attractive entry point for the longer term investor particularly given the prospect of increasing volatility in equity markets managers view strong demand for infrastructure spending globally will support higher returns for providers of capital high demand for infrastructure spending globally global infrastructure spending in both developed and emerging markets is forecast to grow strongly over the next decade or more the manager expects that this high demand will allow providers of capital for infrastructure investments to earn higher returns figure  global annual infrastructure

outlook to  data modeller source iea world energy investment outlook  in the developed world the average age of infrastructure assets has been rising steeply in recent years aided by a period of austerity in the post financial crisis period increasingly there are calls to upgrade large swathes of transport power water and telecommunications infrastructure to replace ageing infrastructure to adapt it to the development of new technologies notably renewable energy and to support economic growth emerging markets in comparison already dedicate a large proportion of their gdp to developing infrastructure but clearly further investment is required as they are still unable to meet the needs of large proportions of their populations the manager points out that climate change and population growth also create their own challenges despite ever increasing efficiency the world needs to produce more energy in a cleaner way this is driving spending to alter the energy mix a reduction in dirtier fossil fuels and nuclear power with an increase in renewables and shale gas reflecting these developments data from pwcs outlook to  data modeller suggests a marked acceleration in annual investment in utilities and transportation power water roads rail airports and ports infrastructure during the next eight years see figure  above data from the international energy agencys world energy investment outlook  see figure  suggests that a significant portion of investment in power generation transmission and distribution will occur in developed markets and china north america and europe combined account for just over  of global infrastructure spending between  and  while china should account for c  the manager considers that this growth in capital expenditure is a very positive trend  capital expenditure is largely regulated and therefore guarantees a return on assets in the managers view investment process egls portfolio is managed using an investment process that

more realistic upper limit is between  in the managers view egls manager is positive on what he describes as suezs leading position in the global water market he says that this is enhanced by the recent acquisition of ge water suez  suez wwwsuezcomen is a french based utility company which operates in the water treatment and waste management businesses in over  countries the company was formerly a division of suez group and was spun out as a standalone entity in  engie formerly gdf suez is the largest shareholder with a  stake egls manager considers that suez has a dominant market position a welldefined growth strategy and a commitment to financial discipline he says that while organic growth has been strong in international markets it has been subdued in the eurozone and the group would be a clear beneficiary from a pickup in inflation and economic growth in europe he is positive on the recent acquisition of ge water which he says expands the companys position in the us and in the asia pacific region and increases its presence in industrial water a high valueadded segment of the water market innogy  egls manager believes innogy offers a sustainable  yield he likes innogys defensive qualities and believes it could be an attractive acquisition target innogy wwwinnogycom was formed in  by ipo as a new company owning the renewables retail and grid and infrastructure businesses of its parent the german energy company rwe rwe and its main competitor eon both restructured their operations last year reflecting the german governments programme to phase out nuclear power in germany and radically increase the proportion of power generation from renewable sources innogy now  owned by rwe is a regulated utility which provides electricity and natural gas to consumers the company has a market capitalisation of €bn and its shares which have traded at a valuation discount to its peers since the ipo in october  offer a prospective yield of c  well above long german bund yields and in egls managers view sustainable jeanhugues says that the shares have defensive qualities and there is potential for merger and acquisition activity in the sector innogy would be an attractive target in his view sse  egls manager believes that sse could benefit from inflation in the uk sse wwwssecom is the second largest british energy utility and the uks largest generator of electricity from renewable sources sse supplies electricity and gas to some  million homes offices and businesses in the uk and ireland and has a  interest in scotia gas networks the uks second largest gas distribution company which supplies gas to  million customers in scotland and the south of england sses renewable energy production is from hydroelectric and wind sources egls manager says that sses commitment to real dividend growth remains at the core of its financial targets the companys shares yield about  currently and jean hugues believes that the reappearance of some inflation in the uk will be beneficial to the companys bottom line williams companies  egls manager believes that williams companies is well positioned to benefit from growth in demand for natural gas and natural gas liquids williams companies cowilliamscom is an energy infrastructure company which together with a master limited partnership which it controls is engaged in the gathering treatment and processing of natural gas principally in texas oklahoma and the rocky mountain region of the united states and in interstate gas transportation williams operates some  miles of interstate pipelines and its crown jewel is one of the major natural gas pipelines in the us transco which connects several large producing regions in the northeast with the major demand centres in the southeast and gulf coast its pipelines deliver approximately  of the natural gas consumed in the united states williams is a pipeline infrastructure company which jeanhugues believes is well positioned to capitalise on demand growth for natural gas and natural gas liquids he says that since a proposed merger with energy transfer was called off in  williams business model has been deleveraged and derisked through asset sales and contract renegotiations and its structure has been simplified he expects earnings and distributable cash flows will grow at higher rates than are currently factored into its share price covanta  egls manager likes covantas wastetoenergy services and the companys potential for free cash flow growth this could support deleveraging and dividend growth us based covanta wwwcovantacom is a leading provider of wastetoenergy services circa  share of the us market the majority of its operations are in the us but it also has three facilities in europe and one in china the company generates revenues from waste disposal contracts with municipalities as well as from sales of the electricity and recycled metals produced as outputs jeanhugues considers that covanta provides municipalities with an environmentally sustainable alternative to landfill for waste while also generating electricity he says that it generates stable cash flows backed by contracts and hedges on  of revenues and further supported by solid  ebitda margins he believes that covanta is capable of delivering more than  free cash flow growth through  and says that this will support deleveraging and dividend growth in the meantime covantas dividend yield of  is both attractive and sustainable in his view you can see uptodate information on the quoteddata website performance since the november downdraft egls nav has outperformed the full selection of indices whilst its share price has lagged the full selection of indices it has been just over seven months since egls launch and so it would be misleading to make any concrete conclusions regarding its performance record this is particularly pertinent as the period since egls inception has been quite volatile for global equity markets this has been exacerbated for utilities which were broadly left behind during the cyclical rally that followed president trumps electoral victory see figure  below global equity markets are now trading at or close to alltime highs this is illustrated in figure  which shows that while egls performance since launch has been comparable to that of the msci world utilities index although with lower nav volatility these performances are behind those of the msci uk and msci world egls share price has been more volatile than all three indices this may reflect egls size and its shareholder base which appears to have a strong presence of longerterm investors that may be slow to turnover their shares despite this aggregate volumes are respectable an average of k shares per day since launch and the manager has observed a general trend of institutional holders being replaced by private wealth managers it would still seem reasonable to us that if egls board is successful in its ambitions to grow the trust liquidity should improve and share price volatility should reduce as a consequence figure  shows the discrete monthly performances of egl versus the indices since its launch these show that november  the month of president trumps election saw negative returns for egls share price nav and all three indices and utilities underperformed global markets as represented by the msci world and the uk market as represented by the msci uk markedly with gradual reassessment of the policy implications of trumps electoral victory and changes in the relative performance of european utilities december  saw rebounds for all of the metrics although of the indices the msci world utilities saw the strongest recovery with egls nav not that far behind egls share price also saw a recovery but with a noticeable lag as most of this came through in january  as illustrated in figure  utilities outperformed global and uk markets in february  as investors took a slightly more

this index in q as egls portfolio had significantly less invested in us securities which rose in the wake of president trumps election while uk and european utilities declined however since the november downdraft egls nav has outperformed cumulatively all three indices over the following five months figure  also illustrates that there has been a marked uplift in relative performance during march and april the manager says that the portfolio had been positioned for and therefore benefitted from an improvement in a number of european holdings quarterly dividend payments targeting at least  of nav per annum‌ dividends are paid on the last business day of february may august and november egl has a clear dividend policy it targets a dividend yield of at least  on its net assets and can use gearing and if necessary distributable reserves to augment its portfolio yield as a new company egl does not have revenue reserves and plans to distribute all of its net revenues it does however have distributable reserves the result of cancelling its share premium account and these can also be used to smooth dividends dividends are paid quarterly on the last business day of february may august and november each year for egls first accounting period from launch to  september  the maiden dividend was paid in november  at p per share which was followed by a second interim dividend at the end of february of p per share and a third at the end of may declared egls manager has advised us that it is expected that this initial period being longer than a year will include five dividend payments however going forward it is expected that for a given financial year the first interim dividend will be paid in february with the second third and fourth interim dividends paid in may august and november respectively the board advises that it seeks to pursue a progressive dividend policy and so barring exceptional circumstances it seems reasonable that the board will only want to make upwards revisions when changing the quarterly dividend rate and so should be seeking to ensure that any increases are sustainable the board has said that it will at least maintain the current quarterly rate of p for the current financial year this suggests a minimum total annual dividend of p for the year ending  september  this is equivalent to a yield of  on the share price of p as at

discount  premium as illustrated in figure  egl began trading at a discount of  but this quickly narrowed post launch reaching a minimum discount of  on  october  this initial tightening was short lived and egls discount widened and then settled into a trading range this may in part reflect the cyclical rally towards the end of  with investors appetite for more defensive exposures such as that offered by egl being less in demand as well as an increased prospect of interest rate rises particularly in the us the market has traditionally seen interest rate rises as being negative for equities in general but particularly for utilities which tend to have relatively high levels of debt in their capital structures as discussed on page  there have been sales by some institutions since the reconstruction of ewpo but these holders have been replaced by private wealth managers for example charles stanleys share of egl increased from  as at  october  to  as at  march  whilst asset value investors sold its  stake in its entirety over the same period egl is trading in a discount range of  to  the average discount since launch is  share repurchases could be counterproductive egl may be better served by focusing on growing in recent times egl has traded at discounts in a range of between  and  while its average discount since launch has been  the discount as at  may  was  which is considerably wider than the board would like or expect it to be the trust is authorised to repurchase up to  and allot up to  of its issued share capital which gives the board a mechanism with which it can influence the discount any repurchases or allotments must be nav accretive for remaining shareholders after transactions costs the board says that it will consider using share repurchases to assist in limiting any sustained discount and discount volatility but there is no formal discount control mechanism or discount target more resources are being allocated to increase awareness of egl this includes the appointment of michael hart who is focused on marketing egl to date the trust has not repurchased any of its shares given egls current size share repurchases might have a limited impact on the discount as they would also serve to reduce liquidity and put upward pressure on egls ongoing charges ratio its fixed costs being spread over a smaller asset base instead egl might be better served by working to increase its size the board and manager share this view and more resource is being allocated to increase awareness of the trust among investors this includes the appointment of michael hart to market egl and work alongside elspeth dick in investor relations the trust has also moved to making daily nav announcements instead of the previous weekly announcements the board and manager hope that this improved visibility will allow the market to form superior nav estimates that should provide investors with a greater degree of comfort and ultimately contribute
