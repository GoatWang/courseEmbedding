the european market to the brazilian airline and the internal brazilian market to the portuguese airline the largest foreign airline in brazil instead tap portugal chose to cooperate with tam airlines tam linhas aéreas on february   gol announced to be in advanced talks to join oneworld alliance which would allow it to catch up with rival tam a recent member of star alliance however on october   the airline announced a change in position by denying any interest in joining an alliance preferring to remain independent and to establish a patchwork of codesharing agreements following this trend on september   gol and aerolíneas argentinas announced the intention to implement a codeshare feeder and frequent flyer programs agreement on a date yet to be announced and pending approval from the governments of brazil and argentina on march   gol unveiled the expansion of its maintenance base located at belo horizonteconfins  tancredo neves international airport originally opened in  with the capacity to service  aircraft per year mainly boeing  and  the expansion allowed gol to increase the number to  gol later started also using the base to service aircraft from other airlines and as of  it also serviced airplanes from azul brazilian airlines and copa airlines on december   gol airlines started an operational partnership with brazilian carrier passaredo linhas aéreas the agreement was rescinded on july   when passaredo established a similar interline agreement with tam airlines instead on december   gol announced the intention of delta air lines to purchase  of its shares the

 boeing  maxs references did not specify the type of max aircraft on october   gol started seasonal operations to miami and orlando available for smiles account holders and originating in brazil only technically they are considered charter flights although they are not necessarily part of an inclusive tour package the use of miles or miles plus money is mandatory as well as a minimum day stay at the destination on  january  the jet airliner crash data evaluation centre jacdec announced that gol airlines had the fourth worst safety record in the world the ratings take into account the number and deadliness of the hull losses destroyed airplanes they have suffered in the past  years how they have fared more recently and how many flights they have flown without incident the results do not take into account the cause of the hull losses or whether the airline is at fault so they are not a perfect measure of how safely an airline behaves it should be noted that since gol is a relatively young airline with only one hull loss but with a large number of casualties flight  that single fatal accident significantly affects the calculation in february  air france–klm announced it would invest  million in gol linhas aéreas inteligentes in advance of the  fifa world cup and the  olympics some disagreement exists as to whether gol is a lowcost carrier in  gol was ranked the second best lowcost airline in south america after azul gol refers to itself as a lowcost carrier but it is increasingly not regarded as such according to ufrj specialist elton fernandes gols costs are not very different from those of tam airlines people are accustomed to calling gol lowcost but gol is not that it is not even lowfare anymore purchase of varigedit logo of the new varig brand on march   gol officially purchased part of the assets of varig  vrg linhas aéreas informally known as the new varig a new company that owned the varig brand for us million from volo group and matlinpatterson global opportunies hedge fund at that time the old varig was under bankruptcy protection gol announced that the varig brand would continue doing business operating as such rather than its official name vrg linhas aéreas the transaction via its gti subsidiary required a us million cash payment with the balance through the allocation of nonvoting shares to varig logística and volo which had acquired varig in june  for us million the transaction did not involve the original airline informally known as old varig which continued to exist until its own bankruptcy in mid under the name flex linhas aéreas in  gol was merged into vrg linhas aéreas vrg linhas aéreas thus became an airline that operates two brands gol and varig although in reality flights are operated only under gol flight numbers initially the varig brand operated to mediumhaul scheduled and charter international destinations within south america and to the caribbean with boeing s configured in two classes and to longhaul charter international destinations in north america europe and africa with boeing ers configured in economy only the latter were also used in wetlease operations this scheme was later dropped the brand gol operates most of the flights of the network and had aircraft configured in alleconomy class used for scheduled domestic and international operations within south america because of contractual obligations between  and  the new varig vrg linhas aéreas was obliged to purchase a minimum of  hoursmonth of services from the old varig flex linhas aéreas therefore at that time some of vrg linhas

how many flights they have flown without incident the results do not take into account the cause of the hull losses or whether the airline is at fault so they are not a perfect measure of how safely

continue doing business operating as such rather than its official name vrg linhas aéreas the transaction via its gti subsidiary required a us million cash payment with the balance through the

continued to exist until its own bankruptcy in mid under the name flex linhas aéreas in  gol was merged into vrg linhas aéreas vrg linhas aéreas thus became an airline that operates two brands gol and

to the caribbean with boeing s configured in two classes and to longhaul charter international destinations in north america europe and africa with boeing ers configured in economy only the latter were also used in wetlease operations this scheme was later dropped the brand gol operates most of the flights of the network and had aircraft configured in alleconomy class used for scheduled domestic and international operations within south america because of contractual obligations between  and  the new varig vrg linhas aéreas was obliged to purchase a minimum of  hoursmonth of services

of casualties flight  that single fatal accident significantly affects the calculation in february  air france–klm announced it would invest  million in gol linhas aéreas inteligentes in advance of

portuguese airline the largest foreign airline in brazil instead tap portugal chose to cooperate with tam airlines tam linhas aéreas on february   gol announced to be in advanced talks to join oneworld alliance which would allow it to catch up with rival tam a recent member of star alliance however on october   the airline announced a change in position by denying any interest in joining an alliance preferring to remain independent and to establish a patchwork of codesharing agreements following this trend on september   gol and aerolíneas argentinas announced the intention to implement a codeshare feeder and frequent flyer programs agreement on a date yet to be announced and pending approval from the governments of brazil and argentina on march   gol unveiled the expansion of its maintenance base located at belo horizonteconfins  tancredo neves international airport originally opened in  with the capacity to service  aircraft per year mainly boeing  and  the expansion allowed gol to increase the number to  gol later started also using the base to service aircraft from other airlines and as of  it also serviced airplanes from azul brazilian airlines and copa airlines on december   gol airlines started an operational partnership with brazilian carrier passaredo linhas aéreas the agreement was rescinded on july   when passaredo established a similar interline agreement with tam airlines instead on december   gol announced the intention of delta air lines to purchase  of its shares the agreement also includes the creation of mutual codeshare flights alignment of

necessarily part of an inclusive tour package the use of miles or miles plus money is mandatory as well as a minimum day stay at the destination on  january  the jet airliner crash data evaluation centre jacdec announced that gol airlines had the fourth worst safety record in the world the ratings take into account the number and deadliness of the hull losses destroyed airplanes they have suffered in the past  years how they have fared more recently and how many flights they have flown without incident the results do not take into account the cause of the hull losses or whether the airline is at fault so they are not a perfect measure of how safely an airline behaves it should be noted that since gol is a relatively young airline with only one hull loss but with a large number of casualties flight  that single fatal accident significantly affects the calculation in february  air france–klm announced it would invest  million in gol linhas aéreas inteligentes in advance of the  fifa world cup and the  olympics some disagreement exists as to whether gol is a lowcost carrier in  gol was ranked the second best lowcost airline in south america after azul gol refers to itself as a lowcost carrier but it is increasingly not regarded as such according to ufrj specialist elton fernandes gols costs are not very different from those of tam airlines people are accustomed to calling gol lowcost but gol is not that it is not even lowfare anymore purchase of varigedit logo of the new varig brand on march   gol officially purchased part of the assets of varig  vrg linhas aéreas informally known as the new varig a new company that owned the varig brand for us million from volo group and matlinpatterson global opportunies hedge fund at that time the old varig was under bankruptcy protection gol announced that the varig brand would continue doing business operating as such rather than its official name vrg linhas aéreas the transaction via its gti subsidiary required a us million cash payment with the balance through the allocation of nonvoting shares to varig logística and volo which had acquired varig in june  for us million the transaction did not involve the original airline informally known as old varig which continued to exist until its own bankruptcy in mid under the name flex linhas aéreas in  gol was merged into vrg linhas aéreas vrg linhas aéreas thus became an airline that operates two brands gol and varig although in reality flights are operated only under gol flight numbers initially the varig brand operated to mediumhaul scheduled and charter international destinations within south america and to the caribbean with boeing s configured in two classes and to longhaul charter international destinations in north america europe and africa with boeing ers configured in economy only the latter were also used in wetlease operations this scheme was later dropped the brand gol operates most of the flights of the network and had aircraft configured in alleconomy class used for scheduled domestic and international operations within south america because of contractual obligations between  and  the new varig vrg linhas aéreas
