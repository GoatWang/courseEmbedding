chief administrative officer cummins inc stretching into more than  countries through a network of  companyowned and independent distribution facilities and more than  dealers columbusbased engine company cummins inc has long been one of the biggest players in the indiana business community so when its chief administrative officer talks people listen and marya rose is the one doing the talking she led cummins’ stand against the state’s controversial religious freedom restoration act making the company one of the state’s first to do so she was the voice of cummins at legislative hearings and the indiana general assembly speaking out against the bill early this year her commitment to the issues goes deeper though a year earlier she testified against a proposed amendment to the indiana constitution banning samesex marriage and helped cummins lobby in  against a similar ban in minnesota she fought a similar fight against california’s proposition  a statewide ballot initiative to make samesex marriage illegal a native hoosier and the daughter of two lawyers rose graduated from williams college then moved to washington dc and los angeles “i honestly never intended to come back to indiana” she said but she wanted to go to law school and ended up at the iu robert h mckinney school of law in indianapolis—“my husband went to bloomington which he always tells me is the superior school” she quipped—and became an attorney with bose mckinney  evans “i thought that’s what i wanted” she said “but i’m a pretty social person working solitary in my office with depositions didn’t turn out to be the most exciting thing” her restlessness led to work as assistant general counsel with the indiana family and social services administration and then as senior aide to former govs evan bayh and frank o’bannon eventually a former coworker now at cummins lured her to columbus initially skeptical of the idea she was convinced by the “wonderful people and the values of the company” she worked her way up to general counsel and took over the chief administrative officer job in  “i didn’t think that corporate america would be someplace i could thrive in and express my values in and be an advocate for the things that are important to me but it’s just been fantastic” among her achievements spearheading the launch of unified communications  collaboration an initiative designed to tie all of cummins’ communications capabilities into one integrated platform to foster innovation empower employees and improve productivity she transformed cummins’ legal organization from  decentralized lawyers to more than  lawyers paralegals and other professionals around the world  outside cummins she serves as board chairwoman for planned parenthood of indiana and kentucky “i’ve been a supporter my entire life” she said “and i finally asked to be put on the board” of course it’s a volatile time for that organization the idea that planned parenthood “would be defunded doesn’t make sense” she said “there are not the resources and clinics available in the country and across indiana to take on that load of patients” and as the leader of the corporate local diversity council she has been a champion for inclusion “i’m really proud of the work we’ve done on civil rights issues” she said rose has personally recruited people who she said “i think are talented but that might not otherwise be viewed as someone who would thrive at cummins”• click here for other interviews email tweet advertisement arts  entertainment editor lou harry’s ae arts blog moderator harry joined ibj in  having

broglie knows his wine along with fellow global beverage buyer and coconspirator doug bell he’s part of a team with more than  years of experience and don’t forget get  off when you buy  bottles or more prev next home » whole foods market » store departments » store departments » wine add share button to marquee box  the wine experts “they’re their own perfect little tornado” see what prompted noted winemaker joel gott to say this about the formidable winebuying duo of devon and doug colors and bubbles – the main wine types red wines color runs the gamut from dark pink to ink common flavors everything red everything dark dark fruits dark berries leather tobacco coffee cocoa warm spices black pepper — you get the idea darker grape varieties are often used for making red wines but it’s the amount of contact with the skin of the grape that truly determines color more contact with the skin darker wine skin contact also imparts a kaleidoscope of possible flavors and textures contributing to body and complexity extra credit tannins those sometimes bitter or astringent notes often very pleasant in wellbalanced wines come from grape skins you won’t find tannins in a white wine try these el terrano tempranillo dark fruit aromas loads of blackberry and currant flavors wild herbs in the mouthwatering finish monterustico rosso amazing quality from one of the best producers out there intense structure more please criterion coonawarra cabernet sauvignon grilling steak or ribs try this cherry black plum hint of eucalyptus quintessential complexity white wines color near clear to honey common flavors white fruits tropical fruits citrus peaches butter honey vanilla chalky minerality white pepper — and many more minimal grape skin contact allows room for the juice in a white wine to speak more clearly subtle notes taking on greater significance because flaws in color or flavor are difficult to mask a delicate hand is highly prized in the making of white wines extra credit broadly speaking as vineyards move farther north they produce wines with more acidity creating crisp refreshing mouthwatering white wines try these andover estate chardonnay beautifully balances between apricot flavors buttery notes and a crisp finish super foodfriendly el terrano albariño zippy fresh saline minerality yes to paella grilled shrimp or tapas you can’t find it anywhere else criterion pinot grigio friuli grave an ideal example of pinot grigio peachy juicy crisp — perfect with seafood light pasta or risotto rosé wines color gentle pink to light orange common flavors strawberry raspberry cranberry pomegranate pink grapefruit red currant watermelon rosé wines came about as a way to quench a french summer thirst like a white wine but with a flavorful nod to the red wines that france highly treasures today rosés are on fire making up nearly  of all wine purchases and rightfully so — they’ve thrown off their “sweet and simple” shackles and are unabashedly delicious extra credit in the most common method very short contact times with grape skins  days as opposed to weeks for reds are dialed in by rosé makers to get just the profile they want secondary method sometimes winemakers wanting a denser red wine will siphon off some early pink juice this pink juice is then made into rosé try these globerati rosé crisp delicate notes of wild strawberry perfect match for pork loin rich salads aged soft cheeses innovación malbecsyrah rosé fresh strawberries blackberries light and elegant finish more than  glasses of wine per liter bottle el terrano rosado sipping feels like diving into a bowl of fresh raspberries and strawberries pair with goat cheese tapas pork chops bubbly “always have a backup bottle of bubbly on hand” – doug bell global beverage buyer bubbly exists in its own world apart from all other wines in both style and winemaking process and…it’s a blast the key players champagne to be called champagne it must be from the same named region of france the most complex of the bunch often with tantalizing notes of freshbaked brioche and running the spectrum from brut driest to demisec a dessert sparkler there’s a reason it’s the king of bubbly prosecco italy’s offering to the world of sparkling wine is the fastest growing style in the category while it lacks the complexity of its french counterpart it makes up for it with reliably vibrant peach and apricot notes and prosecco bubbles are famously unstoppable cava spain’s sparkler because it is inbottle fermented like champagne shares more in common with its french counterpart than prosecco almost always dry cava often displays floral aromatics and citrus notes try these presto prosecco pair with brunch crisp lively apple and orange blossom notes touch of honey madame liberté brut a celebration bubbly zippy acidity refreshing green apple notes touch of toast serve well chilled j lassalle champagne brut premier cru a masterful example of a grower champagne refined crisp white peach and a graceful floral component the criterion® line certain regions of the world are famous for a specific style of wine like malbec from argentina sauvignon blanc from new zealand or syrah from australia have you ever wanted to know exactly what these soughtafter wines are supposed to taste like our criterion line of wines answers that question with each wine providing a reference point for just how a wine from that region should taste each wine is an educational guide — the tastiest one you’ll ever try how to store your wine for shortterm storage keep your unopened wine bottles in a cool dark place with a constant temperature — the main thing is to avoid big temperature changes a closet cabinet or under the bed works well here ideally under °f for longterm storage wine is best when laid on its side especially if it has a cork — otherwise the cork will dry out in a cool dark place between  and °f cooking with wine bay scallop linguine with white wine and
