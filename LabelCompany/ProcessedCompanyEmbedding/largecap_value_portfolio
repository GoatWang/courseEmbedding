outperformed its benchmark the russell  value index for the quarter ended june   delta air lines inc  portfolio weighting shares have performed well amidst an improving industry backdrop and positive commentary from their recent analyst day revenue strength is building broadly as business travel markets continue to recover in addition management expects positive momentum to continue delta has demonstrated continued yield improvement better prasm results cost discipline and restrained capacity growth we view delta as a high quality industrial with multiple revenue and earnings growth initiatives we like that it generates significant free cash flow and management returns cash to shareholders through a growing dividend and repurchases citigroup inc  portfolio weighting shares did well under the backdrop of higher rates which caused sentiment to turn more positive on the financials broadly the combination of decent loan growth rising rates and ample capitalreturn yield creates a compelling picture for the financials in the last week of the quarter stellar comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar results acted as an additional catalyst as citigroup’s return of capital plan was approved suggesting that citigroup has made sufficient progress improving its financial profile improvements in the business are a function of management controlling expenses and investing in the card wealth management and mexican franchises looking ahead we think there’s room for the additional return of capital to shareholders we originally purchased macys inc  portfolio weighting because of its attractive valuation particularly as we considered two factors first based on credit card data checks trends appeared to be better than department store peers second we felt the company had real estate optionality our thesis has not played out macy’s has underperformed as investors are frustrated with the slow pace of management’s ability to monetize the company’s real estate position we exited the position since we were similarly disappointed with management’s commentary about its real estate strategy despite reporting strong quarterly results the market yawned as investors are more concerned about weakening original equipment manufacturer oem fundamentals which caused general motors co  portfolio weighting to be among the portfolio’s laggards we own gm because of its superior cost discipline inventory management and product cycle relative to oem peers the valuation is attractive and management is highly focused on driving performance and increasing shareholder value with a track record of prudent capital allocation looking ahead our approach leads us to invest in companies with compelling valuations combined with contrarian sentiment and risk control we remain overweight in the more cyclical areas of the market and underweight in the bond proxies three themes that we expect to persist are  downward pressure on oil prices  relative economic strength in europe and  higher interest rates globally these macroeconomic views have been reflected in the portfolio by neutralizing our relative underweights to some of the large multinationals in our benchmark we continue to think that higher rates will be a tailwind for financials and we’ve intentionally tilted this exposure to firms with a greater international presence we continue to be underweight in energy yet prefer to have exposure to permian basin producers the portfolio continues to have large exposures to stocks that are identified as cheap within our dividend discount model

outperformed its benchmark the russell  value index for the quarter ended june   delta air lines inc  portfolio weighting shares have performed well amidst an improving industry backdrop and positive commentary from their recent analyst day revenue strength is building broadly as business travel markets continue to recover in addition management expects positive momentum to continue delta has demonstrated continued yield improvement better prasm results cost discipline and restrained capacity growth we view delta as a high quality industrial with multiple revenue and earnings growth initiatives we like that it generates significant free cash flow and management returns cash to shareholders through a growing dividend and repurchases citigroup inc  portfolio weighting shares did well under the backdrop of higher rates which caused sentiment to turn more positive on the financials broadly the combination of decent loan growth rising rates and ample capitalreturn yield creates a compelling picture for the financials in the last week of the quarter stellar comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar results acted as an additional catalyst as citigroup’s return of capital plan was approved suggesting that citigroup has made sufficient progress improving its financial profile improvements in the business are a function of management controlling expenses and investing in the card wealth management and mexican franchises looking ahead we think there’s room for the additional return of capital to shareholders we originally purchased macys inc  portfolio weighting because of its attractive valuation particularly as we considered two factors first based on credit card data checks trends appeared to be better than department store peers second we felt the company had real estate optionality our thesis has not played out macy’s has underperformed as investors are frustrated with the slow pace of management’s ability to monetize the company’s real estate position we exited the position since we were similarly disappointed with management’s commentary about its real estate strategy despite reporting strong quarterly results the market yawned as investors are more concerned about weakening original equipment manufacturer oem fundamentals which caused general motors co  portfolio weighting to be among the portfolio’s laggards we own gm because of its superior cost discipline inventory management and product cycle relative to oem peers the valuation is attractive and management is highly focused on driving performance and increasing shareholder value with a track record of prudent capital allocation looking ahead our approach leads us to invest in companies with compelling valuations combined with contrarian sentiment and risk control we remain overweight in the more cyclical areas of the market and underweight in the bond proxies three themes that we expect to persist are  downward pressure on oil prices  relative economic strength in europe and  higher interest rates globally these macroeconomic views have been reflected in the portfolio by neutralizing our relative underweights to some of the large multinationals in our benchmark we continue to think that higher rates will be a tailwind for financials and we’ve intentionally tilted this exposure to firms with a greater international presence we continue to be underweight in energy yet prefer to have exposure to permian basin producers the portfolio continues to have large exposures to stocks that are identified as cheap within our dividend discount model

outperformed its benchmark the russell  value index for the quarter ended june   delta air lines inc  portfolio weighting shares have performed well amidst an improving industry backdrop and positive commentary from their recent analyst day revenue strength is building broadly as business travel markets continue to recover in addition management expects positive momentum to continue delta has demonstrated continued yield improvement better prasm results cost discipline and restrained capacity growth we view delta as a high quality industrial with multiple revenue and earnings growth initiatives we like that it generates significant free cash flow and management returns cash to shareholders through a growing dividend and repurchases citigroup inc  portfolio weighting shares did well under the backdrop of higher rates which caused sentiment to turn more positive on the financials broadly the combination of decent loan growth rising rates and ample capitalreturn yield creates a compelling picture for the financials in the last week of the quarter stellar comprehensive capital analysis and review ccar results acted as an additional catalyst as citigroup’s return of capital plan was approved suggesting that citigroup has made sufficient progress improving its financial profile improvements in the business are a function of management controlling expenses and investing in the card wealth management and mexican franchises looking ahead we think there’s room for the additional return of capital to shareholders we originally purchased macys inc  portfolio weighting because of its attractive valuation particularly as we considered two factors first based on credit card data checks trends appeared to be better than department store peers second we felt the company had real estate optionality our thesis has not played out macy’s has underperformed as investors are frustrated with the slow pace of management’s ability to monetize the company’s real estate position we exited the position since we were similarly disappointed with management’s commentary about its real estate strategy despite reporting strong quarterly results the market yawned as investors are more concerned about weakening original equipment manufacturer oem fundamentals which caused general motors co  portfolio weighting to be among the portfolio’s laggards we own gm because of its superior cost discipline inventory management and product cycle relative to oem peers the valuation is attractive and management is highly focused on driving performance and increasing shareholder value with a track record of prudent capital allocation looking ahead our approach leads us to invest in companies with compelling valuations combined with contrarian sentiment and risk control we remain overweight in the more cyclical areas of the market and underweight in the bond proxies three themes that we expect to persist are  downward pressure on oil prices  relative economic strength in europe and  higher interest rates globally these macroeconomic views have been reflected in the portfolio by neutralizing our relative underweights to some of the large multinationals in our benchmark we continue to think that higher rates will be a tailwind for financials and we’ve intentionally tilted this exposure to firms with a greater international presence we continue to be underweight in energy yet prefer to have exposure to permian basin producers the portfolio continues to have large exposures to stocks that are identified as cheap within our dividend discount model
