securities and exchange commission “sec” the new york stock exchange “nyse” the financial accounting standards board “fasb” and other governing bodies which impact on rudolph the board is responsible for determining the number of directors on the board based upon the nature and scope of rudolph’s operations and the need for diversity of board views the current board consists of seven  directors the board periodically reviews the appropriate size of the board the board is responsible for selecting rudolph’s chairman of the board and the ceo the board will make its selections in a manner that it deems is optimal for rudolph its business its shareholders and the board itself the roles of the chairman and ceo may be separate or combined and the chairman may be either an employee or nonemployee director rudolph’s ceo and chairman of the board are currently separate roles on an annual basis the board reviews and approves a succession plan that is proposed for rudolph’s ceo and other senior executives the board and its committees have complete and unrestricted access to contact and consult with any of the officers and employees of rudolph the board as an entity and each of its committees has the right at any time to retain independent financial legal or other advisors with funding provided by rudolph from time to time the board may designate a lead director who shall be an independent director the board currently does not have a lead director  the responsibilities of a lead director include presiding at executive sessions of the independent directors serving as principal liaison between the independent directors and the chairman working with the chairman to establish the schedule and agenda for meetings of the board and its committees working with the chairman on the quality and timeliness of information submitted by rudolph’s management for board and committee meetings recommending to the chairman the retention of advisors and consultants by the board and if requested by major shareholders of rudolph being available for consultation and direct communication with such shareholders election of directors rudolph’s stockholders elect a class of directors each year at the annual stockholder meeting rudolph’s certificate of incorporation provides that the directors shall be divided into three classes with the classes serving for staggered threeyear terms currently there are two directors in each of class i and class ii and three directors in class iii the board will select nominees and recommend them for election by stockholders and fill any vacancies that may arise as part of its selection process the board may consider recommendations from other sources in order to identify director candidates with diverse backgrounds and experience that could enhance the quality of the board serve stockholders’ longterm interests and contribute to rudolph’s overall corporate goals the nominating and governance committee is responsible for proposing candidates to the board stockholders may also propose nominees for consideration by the nominating and governance committee in accordance with the policy published on the rudolph website wwwrudolphtechcom in selecting nominees the board will assess factors such as character judgment independence age area of expertise diversity of experience length of service and potential conflicts of interest while rudolph has not established specific minimum qualifications for director candidates rudolph’s nominating and governance committee believes that candidates and nominees must reflect a board that is comprised of directors who i to the extent possible meet the independence requirements of the sec and nyse ii are of the highest integrity iii have qualifications that will increase the overall board effectiveness iv represent the potential for a significant contribution to the board and v meet other requirements as may be required by governing bodies which impact on rudolph in addition to the foregoing consideration will be given to the following characteristics senior executive customer background accountingfinance cpa background industry background legal background academic credentials femaleminority larger company experience and geography the board believes that in its ongoing review of board recruiting refreshment and succession planning it is important to maintain the balance between the premature loss of active directors who have valuable knowledge and insight about the companys history operations and markets with the novel perspectives potentially brought by new board members and its continuing obligation to shareholders in planning board refreshment  as a result the board has adopted the policy that no director shall be appointed to the board or nominated as a candidate for election to the board in the year in which said director attains the age of  years or after  notwithstanding the policy the board does it believe that directors should expect to be renominated as a matter of course and utilizes its selfevaluation process discussed below as an important determinant of board tenure standards for directors at least a majority of the directors will be “independent directors” pursuant to sec and nyse rules although the majority of directors must be independent it is recognized that directors who do not meet the independence standards also make valuable contributions to the board and to rudolph by reason of their experience knowledge and familiarity with rudolph directors must be willing to devote sufficient time to carry out their duties and responsibilities effectively and should be committed to serve on the board for an extended period of time each board member is expected to ensure that other existing and planned future commitments do not materially interfere with hisher service as an active and contributing director of rudolph directors are limited to a total of six  public boards on which they may serve to ensure that they can meet their commitments to rudolph the nominating and governance committee from time to time reviews the appropriate skills and characteristics required of board members taking into account the current composition of the board and the changing needs of rudolph this assessment shall include the areas of core competency established by the board and shall strive for a mix of

compounds in the case of specialized applications hundreds of steps performed by specialized process tools are required before the wafer moves to a final packaging facility the focus of packaging and assembly is to ensure an electrical connection from the die to the circuit board to encapsulate the package for mechanical integrity and to withstand thermal variations the era of slim formfactor

electronic devices and electrical equipment it is a multiplestep process during which electronic circuits are gradually built by adding elements and layers of material on a substrate made of pure silicon or various compounds in the case of specialized applications hundreds of steps performed by specialized process tools are required before the wafer moves to a final packaging facility the focus of packaging and assembly is to ensure an electrical connection from the die to the circuit board to encapsulate the package for mechanical integrity and to withstand thermal variations the era of slim formfactor devices such as smart phones implies high level of functionality in very dense footprint due to these requirements the challenges in packaging assembly and test have significantly

with n freebase deleted triples we also provide a dump of triples that have been deleted from freebase over time this is a onetime dump through march  in the future we might consider providing periodic updates of recently deleted triples but at the moment we have no specific timeframe for doing so and are only providing this onetime dump the dump is distributed as a targz file gb compressed gb uncompressed it contains  deleted triples in  files there is no particular meaning to the individual files it is just easier to manipulate several smaller files than one huge file thanks to chun how tan and john giannandrea for making this data release possible total triples  million updated june   data format csv license ccby  gb gzip gb uncompressed download the data format is essentially csv with one important caveat the object field may contain any characters including commas as well as any other reasonable delimiters you could think of however all the other fields are guaranteed not to contain commas so the data can still be parsed unambiguously the columns in the dataset are defined as creationtimestamp unix epoch time in milliseconds creator deletiontimestamp unix epoch time in
