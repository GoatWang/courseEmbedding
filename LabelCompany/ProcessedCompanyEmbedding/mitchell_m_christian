on november vashawn mitchell isnt making album sales and billboard chart placement a priority with his seventh album secret placethe sixtime stellar award and twotime dove awardwinning singer and producer is focused on obeying a call from god to release an international sound with his new album that was recorded during a worship experience in south africai believe that in the music industry this album this body of work this message as long as its released to the world internationally i will have accomplished what it is god wants me to mitchell told the christian post thats what its all about god has given me an international sound that will change this generationthe veteran singersongwriter whos known for his popular grammynominated gospel song nobody greater believes his international sound can raise the bar even higher by impacting people all over the worldi purposely wanted to create an international sound that can be sung all over the world nobody greater and things like that can get picked up all over the world but i purposely wanted this music this sound thats being recorded to become international he told cp my other records were more focused on songs and not soundsaside from just another high energy and encouraging project mitchell believes his decision to record in south africa with artists from the region made each song quite an experienceits a body of music to encourage and inspire this generation but because its live in south africa its actually even more blessed we did it live and the experience in the room i believe added to the experience of the project he said whenever i talk about it i talk about the experience and not just the songs because each song has a life of its own im looking forward to sharing this with the worldalong with some african artists mitchell also welcomed famous faces in the industry bebe winans and tasha cobbs to record with himpeople dont have to be nice to be honest i was humbled and honored for their support bebe winans is my mentor of course and tasha cobbs is like a sister to me ive produced her records and so this is more relationship than anything elsewhile winans has been his mentor cobbs has become a close friend to mitchell when he decided to remake the classic nobody greater on his album both contributed to a remixing of the record that is nothing short of a spiritual experience for the singersits been two years since mitchells last album but that doesnt mean he has taken a break from the industry even though people may not hear the worship leaderturnedgospel music singers voice on a song that doesnt mean hes not hard at work in the industrysince his  album unstoppable mitchell has been working behind the scenes producing records for the likes of cobbs the continuous industry work outside of his own album may be whats keeping him connected to god in a way that inspires his own musicwhile im preparing or while im not preparing for my own album im trying to get to that secret place between me and god where i can hear what to do and what not to do he said its always movement when youre doing work in the lord and i think that thats where it comes to memitchell is constantly working to tap into the sound that god has called him to create but it took some time and tough lessons for the chicago native to be obedient during a time when he spent the same amount of time in clubs as he did in church a yearold mitchell ended up in jailit was there that mitchell was able to recognize the importance of becoming serious about his walk with godi had to spend a few days in the county jail in chicago i was driving on a suspended license he revealed i was still directing the choir in my church and i was traveling i heard god clearly say youre either going to live for me or abort your destinymitchell decided to take the road paved by godfrom that day forth i began to purposely turn my life around it was life changing just to have that experience and to understand there are different roads we can take he said our future is dependent on the road we choosenow  years later mitchell is working hard to do his part in an industry that many believe is not thriving as it once was but for the singersongwriter its important to continue to push through to create sounds of worshipi would look at it and say the gospel music industry is exactly where its supposed to be today as we continue to change we find success today is not what it was  years ago he said if success is selling a lot of records and thats what our goal is then thats what we do but if the success of it is making sure we try to put out great gospel music that is changing lives then thats what we do as wellfor more information about vashawn mitchell click
