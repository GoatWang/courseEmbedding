posted   pm edt  updated on   comments anne fuchs contributed becoming one of the most accomplished and recognized businesswomen and publishers in the country was never anne sutherland fuchs’s intent in fact she might have thought it impossible but that’s exactly what happened fuchs was born in brazil to as she described them an english mother and a very american father when she was still a child the family moved to the midwest and she grew up in chicago she graduated from new york university with a bachelor of arts degree in french literature when she went to study at the sorbonne fuchs decided that she wanted to live out the rest of her days in france but that didn’t happen “i had a lifethreatening accident” fuchs said “that’s when i became a serious person and began confronting a lot of issues before that i never took anything seriously i had no business skills and my background in french literature didn’t present many career opportunities” fuchs arrived in new york flat broke and in need of a job—quickly she went to a personnel agency that advertised in the new yorks times hoping to find a job at an art gallery or similar institution advertisement “the interviewer looked at my résumé and noted that my degree was in french literature not art” fuchs recalled “’but she said you’d be perfect for hertz’ as in rentacar’ i don’t know how she determined this would be suitable for me but i said yes this is called survival i only had five dollars to my name at the time “at hertz i interviewed with this wonderful irishman who hired me as his assistant when he asked if i could type i said no but i quickly learned how to be a customer relations manager by listening to him deal with clients” a fast learner fuchs was offered a job in sales she begged off at first since she knew her boss always fired people in sales who didn’t make their numbers but then she took the job anyway and became the number one salesperson in the country and the only woman in the industry to reach that mark “to me everyone was a potential client” fuchs explained “so i went after insurance companies like new york life which was huge i understood the margins and would rewrite contracts to make them more attractive—but still profitable and i just kept bringing in new accounts” word was out that fuchs was a phenomenon in the business and job offers came pouring in “i didn’t even have a briefcase” she said “i didn’t know i was going to be successful in business i was just trying to survive when i used to give speeches to women’s groups they always asked who my mentors were my mentor was survival it teaches you a great deal fast” after three years in the car rental business fuchs went on to work with the new york times as manager of the national food business to sell media to regional sales managers an untapped resource that proved very profitable for everyone “my jobs always seemed to be for threeyears or so” fuchs said “the first year was spent figuring out the job the second year would be working and selling by the third year i was successful and then something else would come my way” her next opportunity came from the publishing industry she was offered a job with charter publishing which owned the ladies home journal redbook and sport magazine she began producing inserts for the magazine with special promotions and eventually started a division called charter contest where they put all their special interest publications as she approached each new challenge—and became known for her business expertise and her willingness to try something new—fuchs carved out an incredible career path she became publisher of cuisine which led to her work with two magazine publishing titans hearst and conde nast where fuchs became the first female publisher of vogue at hearst she served as senior vicepresidentgroup publishing director of hearst magazines which included management of the publications known as the “women’s group” o the oprah magazine town  country harper’s bazaar marie claire redbook and victoria she also launched the american edition of elle she was responsible for an incredible assortment of some of the most prestigious magazines in the country “it was a very exciting time for me” fuchs said “in the magazine business you creating a product you want someone to like all the time each issue has to be a different flavor but you need some consistency so the consumer isn’t confused” a challenging task at best in order to raise sales the product always had to be right “i love being around creative people but my strength is the business side i’m not capable of producing extraordinary photo essays and understanding the nuance of things editorial is the driver” fuchs explained “i have to applaud the extraordinary editors i was privileged to work with i don’t create the product it’s the editors who do that and if they can come up with a product that consumers want i can do the rest “women’s day is a perfect example when i was there newsstand sales were at fiveanda half million copies women purchased the magazine because they saw something on the cover they wanted to read and buying at the newsstand is so much faster than taking out a subscription you want to grab the consumer immediately” as fuchs talks about her publishing experiences one can see that she clearly loved being involved in the industry and is proud of what she achieved but how does one keep up the momentum “i love the challenge of taking something to a new level” fuchs said “changing the format trying something no one else has done before it’s risky but terribly exciting it’s wonderful to feel the muscle twitch across the country for the product you’re involved with” fuchs became known as an innovator with extensive branding experience within the media industry and has been recognized for her achievements with numerous awards including the matrix award for magazines by women of communication advertising women of the year and the woman of the year award by the ny police athletic league she was also named one of the “ leaders for the st century” by women enews under mayor bloomberg she was made chairwoman of the nyc commission on women’s issues serving as a liaison between the mayor and the female community in that capacity she worked to brand new york city as a desirable place for women to thrive raising opportunities for education and a place to build both a career and a family balancing a career and family was of great concern to fuchs when she decided to have children it is a dilemma many career women face “children are not for every women” said fuchs “but all along i always wanted children it was a challenge i was used to working  when my boys were younger i still worked all the time but running home to attend school meetings sports events helping with homework—in between appointments when i became a single mom i just stopped i put my briefcase and my ambition on a shelf—where i could easily pick them up again you have to decide with kind of parent you’re going to be my only way was to be there to be a wall of constant strength” her sons nicky  and slater  are both at southern methodist university in texas “it was their idea to attend the same school it’s perfect—they are wonderful friends and support each other i feel very blessed” fuchs said in  fuchs made washington conn her permanent residence “my life in new york had changed” she explained “i had worked with jc penney and started online retail stores for them i was going back and forth to dallas and chicago but i didn’t need to be in new york city i decided i wanted to wake up to beautiful so here i am in this wonderful place—it was a big decision but it seems as natural as daylight for me to be here all the time” but living in the country has not affected fuchs’s energy and need to be involved in new projects “at the moment i sit on two corporate boards gartner inc and pitney bowes inc” locally she was named to the board of directors of the community foundation of northwest connecticut she is also on the board of greenwoods counseling referral inc in this idyllic setting with her many commitments fuchs does manage to do some recreational things she loves most “i love to entertain” she said “’entertain’ being the operative word because i am not a great cook and taking long walks with our black lab watching her splash in stream so much energy” however fuchs is always looking for the next challenge “if you are open to people as well as opportunities you never stop learning and that’s what i love” digital subscribe
