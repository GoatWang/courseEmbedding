video series that will begin to appear on the world’s largest social network later this yearfacebook is closing deals for its first batch of shows including two that the hollywood reporter unveiled earlier this week  reality competition series “last state standing” and a second season of comedy “loosely exactly nicole” which first appeared on mtv the shows will be available via a new video tab on facebook that hasn’t been releasedby funding a slate of original programs facebook hopes to entice more production companies to upload premium video which facebook will then use to siphon advertising dollars away from television the lucrative advertising market inspires tv networks to create hundreds of shows and newer media companies teenagers and aspiring filmmakers to upload billions of hours of video a day to youtube snapchat and other online portals facebook isn’t trying to compete with the highest end of that market  paid services netflix hbo and showtime it has its sights set on cable networks and advertisingsupported online services with young viewers“funding video is a way for facebook to figure out its greater advertising program” said matthew segal chief executive officer of attn a digital media company that publishes video to facebook “it’s clear they want to be a bigger player in the space they want to eclipse tv” read more a bloomberg intelligence midyear report on internet companiesfacebook has been hosting video for a few years and two years ago began sharing advertising revenue with some companies that uploaded clips while many of those companies found large audiences on the social network few generated enough advertising revenue to treat facebook as a primary distribution outlet for highend videofacebook executives have compared funding original videos to priming the pump at an oilfield giving creators a financial incentive to upload more video get a taste of the large audiences they can attract and come back for more facebook has paid celebrities to use its live video feature and encouraged tv networks and movie studios to stream live events and trailers on the social network for free promotion facebooks money machine targets tv ad dollars facebook is funding two kinds of programs  a handful of more expensive series from established tv producers that will take a few months to produce hero shows they are called and a bunch of shorter cheaper videos from publishers like vox media inc and buzzfeed inc called spotlight shows all shows will be episodic and designed to spur conversation among facebook usersfor the hero shows facebook is willing to spend a couple hundred thousand dollars an episode according to people familiar with the matter budgets that compare favorably with many cable networks the shows will be exclusive to facebook which has expressed a desire for programs that appeal to young women think “pretty little liars” or “the bachelor” said the people who asked not to be identified discussing private informationfor spotlight shows facebook is giving publishers a minimum guarantee of  to  an episode up front and will have exclusive rights to the program for a period of time before the videos can be made available elsewhere the people said facebook will share advertising revenue with the publishers who can start to sell their own advertisements after a brief periodfacebook has been assembling a team of executives to shepherd its entree into hollywood starting with ricky van veen cofounder of comedy site college humor the company has since hired netflix inc executive sarah madigan to acquire video programs and former mtv executive mina lefevre to oversee the development of new shows now van veen is looking to hire a head of unscripted development to work under lefevre people familiar with the matter saidfacebook’s interest in funding video tantalizes hollywood where producers drool at the thought of another deeppocketed patron alongside fellow tech giants amazoncom inc apple inc and alphabet inc other new players like verizon communications inc have had a harder time often committing less money to less ambitious showswith  billion people checking their news feed every month facebook reaches more people than any tv network “not only do nearly  percent of people under  have an account but they are spending over  minutes a month on facebook” said attn’s segalyet some elements of facebook’s video strategy are still uncertain according to employees and partners facebook hasn’t detailed how advertisements will be displayed on the programming it’s funding and has yet to show many of its partners a demo of its new video tab which is also called spotlight publishers and producers are eager for facebook to create a new destination for video since most users don’t watch clips in the news feed for more than a minute or two“getting people past  seconds is still a challenge” segal saidthe debut of spotlight was supposed to be earlier this year was later pushed to june and may now not happen until the fall the people said facebook had successfully bid to host a live stream of singer katy perry around the debut of her new album but had to forfeit the rights due to the delay of spotlight they said the fourday event witness worldwide aired on youtube last weekend exclusive insights on technology around the world get fully charged from bloomberg technology sign up facebook is also developing a second tab that will be devoted to the more highend programming the people said facebook prefers not to put details of the video product in writing and will only discuss it by phone according to people who have dealt with the company facebook has also rankled some potential partners by insisting on selling advertising itself and inserting ads into the middle of live broadcasts the people saidfacebook has a small staff handling original programming not enough to manage a robust operation facebook would rather share money from advertising sales than pay for content in the long term“the sustainable model is some sort of revenue sharing” fidji simo facebook’s head of video product said in an interview “the goal is really to get a lot of different partners to come to facebook share their content and find success it’s very hard to find that over the long term by funding”that approach appeals to companies uploading shortform videos but it may not make sense to highend creators accustomed to large budgets tv networks typically pay a licensing fee for a show and then keep revenue from the ads they sell the studios still often retain the right to sell the program overseas or sell reruns to other networks which benefits writers and actors as welllive sports an area of growing interest to facebook is also very expensive facebook has added live feeds of baseball games and soccer matches through deals with different leagues and previously pursued the rights to stream thursday night football games for now leagues are using facebook to test how many viewers they can reach on the site they also hope early experiments will convince facebook to spend big on future rights before its here its on the

rs  from rs  in rural areas and rs  from rs  in urban areas the dollar business bureau by increasing the income cap for the eligibility of a microloan borrower as well as the permissible total borrower indebtedness the reserve bank of india rbi has indicated its strong support to nonbanking financial companies – microfinance institutions ‘nbfcmfis’ role in financial inclusion the new move is likely to significantly increase the potential market size without affecting borrowers’ servicing ability and improve operating efficiency of nbfcmfis said a report by the rating agency india ratings  research indra this move could also be a precursor to expanding nbfcmfis’ role in financial inclusion if they maintain and strengthen their underwriting standards also existing mfis may be tempted to slow down their branch expansion in nonsouth states providing opportunities for new players rbi proposes to widen the consumer base of mfis by nearly doubling the income limits of an eligible borrower to rs  from rs  in rural areas and rs  from rs  in urban areas it also proposes to increase the total borrower indebtedness to rs  from rs  these changes could nearly double the long – term potential of the sector and bring a wider section of poor within the ambit of microfinance at the same time mfis would also have the incentive to increase penetration for existing borrowers as they would qualify for loans with higher amounts in – line with the growth in rural incomes nbfc – mfis’ current underwriting standards seem adequate this is because in spite of rbi allowing them to lend up to rs  only few districts especially in south india and some other states have been saturated in terms of borrower indebtedness or having microloans from two or more mfis the report said they have now been provided sufficient headroom to grow for the next five years if mfis ensure a correlation between income needs and loans they will not be under pressure to dilute underwriting standards to showcase portfolio growth recently the prime minister narendra modi has asked the bankers to study the successful micro finance models being followed in other parts of the world and try to adapt them according to the local requirements speaking after the launch of the pradhan mantri mudra yojana aimed at funding the small entrepreneurs of india modi said that while there are a number of facilities provided for the large industries in india there is a need to focus on  crore 7 lakh selfemployed people who use funds of rs  lakh crore with an average per unit debt of merely rs 7 to employ  crore indians reported a pib release the prime minister said that mudra scheme is aimed at “funding the unfunded” mudra will build on experiences of some of the existing players who have demonstrated ability to cater to the non corporate small business segment to build a financing architecture and right ecosystem for both the entrepreneurs as well as the last mile financiers to the segment access to finance in conjunction with rational price is going to be the unique customer value proposition of mudra the establishment of mudra would not only help in increasing access of finance to the unbanked but also bring down the cost of finance from the last mile financiers to the informal microsmall enterprises sector the approach goes beyond credit only approach and offers a credit – plus solution for these myriad micro enterprises creating a complete ecosystem spread across the country said the prime minister   be sociable share tweet related posts access to formal
