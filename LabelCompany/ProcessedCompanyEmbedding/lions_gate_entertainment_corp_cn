expenses table of contents general and administration expenses include salaries and other overhead critical accounting policies table of contents revenue recognition revenue from the theatrical release of feature films is recognized at the time of exhibition based on our participation in box office receipts revenue from the sale of dvds and bluray discs in the retail market net of an allowance for estimated returns and other allowances is recognized on the later of receipt by the customer or street date when it is available for sale by the customer under revenue sharing arrangements including digital and est arrangements such as downloadtoown downloadtorent videoondemand and subscription videoondemand revenue is recognized when we are entitled to receipts and such receipts are determinable revenues from television or digital licensing for fixed fees are recognized when the feature film or television program is available to the licensee for telecast for television licenses that include separate availability windows during the license period revenue is allocated over the windows revenue from sales to international territories are recognized when access to the feature film or television program has been granted or delivery has occurred as required under the sales contract and the right to exploit the feature film or television program has commenced for multiple media rights contracts with a fee for a single film or television program where the contract provides for media holdbacks defined as contractual media release restrictions the fee is allocated to the various media based on our assessment of the relative fair value of the rights to exploit each media and is recognized as each holdback is released for multipletitle contracts with a fee the fee is allocated on a titlebytitle basis based on our assessment of the relative fair value of each title the primary estimate requiring the most subjectivity and judgment involving revenue recognition is the estimate of sales returns associated with our revenue from the sale of dvdsbluray discs in the retail market which is discussed separately below under the caption sales returns allowance sales returns allowance revenues are recorded net of estimated returns and other allowances we estimate reserves for dvdbluray returns based on previous returns experience pointofsale data available from certain retailers current economic trends and projected future sales of the title to the consumer based on the actual performance of similar titles on a titlebytitle basis in each of the dvdbluray businesses factors affecting actual returns include among other factors limited retail shelf space at various times of the year success of advertising or other sales promotions and the near term release of competing titles we believe that our estimates have been materially accurate in the past however due to the judgment involved in establishing reserves we may have adjustments to our historical estimates in the future our estimate of future returns affects reported revenue and operating income if we underestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period then we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amounts if we overestimate the impact of future returns in a particular period then we may record additional revenue in later periods when returns are less than estimated an incremental change of  in our estimated sales returns rate ie provisions for returns divided by gross sales of related product for home entertainment products would have had an impact of approximately  million and  million on our total revenue in the three and nine months ended december    table of contents our quarterly income tax provision benefit and our corresponding annual effective tax rate are based on expected income statutory tax rates and tax planning opportunities available in the various jurisdictions in which we operate for interim financial reporting except in circumstances as described in the following paragraph we estimate the annual effective tax rate based on projected taxable income for the full year and record a quarterly tax provision in accordance with the expected annual effective tax rate as the year progresses we refine the estimates of the years taxable income as new information becomes available including yeartodate financial results this continual estimation process often results in a change to our expected annual effective tax rate for the year when this occurs we adjust our income tax provision during the quarter in which the change in estimate occurs so that the yeartodate income tax provision reflects the expected annual effective tax rate significant judgment is required in determining our annual effective tax rate and in evaluating our tax positions when a small change in our estimated pretax results would create a large change in our expected annual effective rate such that a reliable estimate of the expected annual effective tax rate cannot be made as was the case for the quarter ended december   we calculate the income tax provision benefit using the cutoff method consolidation we consolidate entities in which we own more than  of the voting common stock and control operations and also variable interest entities for which we are the primary beneficiary investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own more than  of the voting common stock or otherwise exercise significant influence over operating and financial policies but not control of the nonconsolidated affiliate are accounted for using the equity method of accounting investments in nonconsolidated affiliates in which we own less than  of the voting common stock are accounted for using the cost method of accounting business combinations we account for our business combinations under the acquisition method of accounting identifiable assets acquired liabilities assumed and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree are recognized and measured as of the acquisition date at fair value goodwill is recognized to the extent by which the aggregate of the acquisitiondate fair value of the consideration transferred and any noncontrolling interest in the acquiree exceeds the recognized basis of the identifiable assets acquired net of assumed liabilities determining the fair value of assets acquired liabilities assumed and noncontrolling interest requires managements judgment and often involves the use of significant estimates and assumptions including assumptions with respect to future cash flows discount rates and asset lives among other items recent accounting pronouncements table of contents in september  the fasb issued new guidance on adjustments to provisional amounts recognized in a business combination which are currently recognized on a retrospective basis under the new requirements adjustments will be recognized in the reporting period in which the adjustments are determined the effects of changes in depreciation amortization or other income arising from changes to the provisional amounts if any are included in earnings of the reporting period in which the adjustments to the provisional amounts are determined an entity is also required to present separately on the face of the income statement or disclose in the notes the portion of the amount recorded in currentperiod earnings by line item that would have been recorded in previous reporting periods if the adjustment to the provisional amounts had been recognized as of the acquisition date the guidance is effective for our fiscal year beginning april   with early adoption permitted and is required to be implemented on a prospective basis we adopted
