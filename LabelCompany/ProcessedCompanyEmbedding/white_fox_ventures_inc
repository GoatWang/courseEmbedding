the company uses the blackscholes option pricing model to determine the fair value of the stockbased compensation that it grants to officers and directors the company is required to make certain

security held at the time of sale   income taxes   the company uses the liability method of accounting for income taxes under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the estimated future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized as part of the provision for income taxes in the period that includes the enactment date deferred tax liabilities are always provided for in full deferred tax assets are recognized to the extent that it is probable that they will be able to be utilized against future taxable income deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only when the company has a right and intention to set off current tax assets and liabilities from the same taxation authority valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to amounts that are expected to be realized   the company accounts for income taxes pursuant to the provision of asc  “accounting for income taxes” “asc ” which requires among other things an asset and liability approach to calculating deferred income taxes the asset and liability approach requires the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities a valuation allowance is provided to offset any net deferred tax assets for which management believes it is more likely than not that the net deferred asset will not be realized   the company follows the provision of asc  related to accounting for uncertain income tax position when tax returns are filed there may be uncertainty about the merits of positions taken or the amount of the position that would be ultimately sustained   in accordance with the guidance of asc  the benefit of a tax position is recognized in the financial statements in the period during which based on all available evidence management believes it is more likely than not that the position will be sustained upon examination including the resolution of appeals or litigation processes if any tax positions taken are not offset or aggregated with other positions   tax positions that meet the more likely than not recognition threshold are measured as the largest amount of tax benefit that is more than  percent likely of being realized upon settlement with the applicable taxing authority the portion of the benefits associated with tax positions taken that exceeds the amount measured as described above should be reflected as a liability for uncertain tax benefits in the accompanying balance sheet along with any associated interest and penalties that would be payable to the taxing authorities upon examination the company believes its tax positions are all highly certain of being upheld upon examination as such the company has not recorded a liability for uncertain tax benefits   the company has adopted asc  “definition of settlement” which provides guidance on how an entity should determine whether a tax position is effectively settled for the purposes of recognizing previously unrecognized tax benefits and provides that a tax position can be effectively settled upon the completion and examination by a taxing authority without being legally extinguished for tax positions considered effectively settled an entity would recognize the full amount of tax benefit even if the tax position is not considered more likely than not to be sustained based solely on the basis of its technical merits and the statute of limitations remains open the federal and state income tax returns of the company are subject to examination by the irs and state taxing authorities generally for three years after they were filed     f table of contents     white fox

for derivative financial instruments requires that the company record the conversion option and related warrants at their fair values as of the inception date of the agreements and at fair value as of each subsequent balance sheet date should the characteristics of these instruments warrant the need to record the derivative liability   during the year ended december   as a result of entering into the convertible notes the company was required to classify certain nonemployee warrants as derivative liabilities and record them at their fair values at each balance sheet date any change in fair value was recorded as a change in the fair value of derivative liabilities for each reporting period at each balance sheet date the company reassessed the classification at each balance sheet date if

classified as a liability until the debt was converted by the note holders or paid back by the company the fair value was affected by changes in inputs to that model including the stock price expected stock price volatility the contractual term and the riskfree interest rate the company continued to classify the fair value of the conversion option as a liability until the conversion option was exercised expired or amended in a way that would no longer require these conversion options to be classified as a liability whichever comes first the company has adopted a sequencing policy that

course of business the company has generated net losses from continuing and discontinued operations attributable to common shareholders totaling  and  for the nine months ended september   and  respectively the company’s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon amongst other things developing a new line of business as well as continued financial support from its shareholders and lenders attaining a satisfactory revenue level attainment of profitable operations and the generation of cash from operations and the ability to secure new financing arrangements and new capital to carry out its business plan these matters are dependent on a number of items outside of the company’s control and there exist material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt about the company’s ability to continue as a going concern the company can give no assurance that it will achieve profitability or be capable of sustaining profitable operations in its new business of white fox these condensed consolidated financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of the carrying amounts of assets or the amount and classification of liabilities that might result if the company is unable to continue as a going concern these factors raise substantial doubt regarding the ability of the company to continue as a going concern the company recently raised  in net debt proceeds for which full settlement was attained by the issuance of common stock of the company and  of equity proceeds during the nine months ended september   to pay for the reorganization costs   item  quantitative and q ualitative disclosuresabout market risk   not applicable   item  controls and p rocedures   as of the end of the period covered by this quarterly report on form q the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer conducted an evaluation of the company’s disclosure controls and procedures as defined in rules a and d of the securities exchange act of  based upon this evaluation the company’s chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the company’s disclosure controls and procedures were not effective as of such date    changes in internal control over financial reporting   there were no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the period covered by this quarterly report on form q that have materially affected or are reasonably likely to materially affect our internal control over financial reporting   part ii – other information   item  l egal p roceedings   from time to time we may be involved in various claims lawsuits and disputes with third parties actions involving allegations of discrimination or breach of contract actions incidental to the operation of our business however we are not currently involved in any litigation which we believe could have a materially adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations          item a   risk factors   we have limited capital and will need to raise additional capital in the future   white fox does not currently have sufficient capital to fund both our continuing operations and its planned growth  the company will require additional capital to continue to expand its operations  the company may be unable to obtain additional capital when required  future business development activities as well as our administrative requirements such as salaries insurance expenses and general overhead expenses as well as legal compliance costs and accounting expenses will require a substantial amount of additional capital and cash flow   white fox may pursue sources of additional capital through various financing transactions or arrangements including joint venturing of projects debt financing equity financing or other means  the company may not be successful in identifying suitable financing transactions in the time period required or at all and we may not obtain the capital we require by other means  if white fox does not succeed in raising additional capital white fox’s operations will terminate and there is a risk of loss of your entire investment   any additional capital raised through the sale of equity may dilute the ownership percentage of our stockholders  raising any such capital could also result in a decrease in the fair market value of your equity securities because our assets would be owned by a larger pool of outstanding equity  the terms of securities we issue in future capital transactions may be more favorable to our new investors and may include preferences superior voting rights and the issuance of other derivative securities and issuances of incentive awards under equity employee incentive plans which may have a further dilutive effect   the company’s ability to obtain financing may be impaired by such factors as the capital markets both generally and in our industry in particular our limited operating history national unemployment rates and the departure of key employees  further economic downturns will likely decrease our revenues may increase our requirements for capital  if the amount of capital we are able to raise from financing activities together with our revenues from operations is not sufficient to satisfy our capital needs even to the extent that we reduce our operations we may be required to cease our operations divest our assets at unattractive prices or obtain financing on unattractive terms   we may not be able to successfully manage our growth which could lead to our inability to implement our business plan   our growth is expected to place a significant strain on our managerial operational and financial resources especially considering that we currently only have a small number of executive officers employees and advisors further as we enter into various contracts or other transactions we will be required to manage multiple relationships with various consultants businesses and other third parties there can be no assurance that our systems procedures andor controls will be adequate to support our operations or that our management will be able to achieve the rapid execution necessary to successfully implement our business plan if we are unable to manage our growth effectively our business results of operations and financial condition will be adversely affected which could lead to us being forced to abandon or curtail our business plan and operations      table of contents     item  unregistered sales of e quity
