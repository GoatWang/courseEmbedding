varietal cabernet sauvignon and blends  cabernet sauvignon has come a long way from its role as a blending varietal however dominant in the wines of bordeaux today it is the most planted red varietal in the world identified as a descendent of cabernet franc and sauvignon blanc the lateripening cabernet sauvignon needs to be planted in warmer climates to fully ripen its small berries can easily be identified for their distinctive blue color thick skins and high tannins and while the varietal has its own definitive characteristics green pepperlike aromas and black currant flavors among them it is perhaps most prized for its ability to convey terroir vintage and winemaking a relatively new varietal cabernet sauvignon started making inroads into the wines of the médoc and graves in the lateth century today it is also dominant in the upandcoming entredeuxmers region of bordeaux and can also be found in southwest france it is the companion varietal to sangiovese in italys super tuscans and is planted all over europe stretching to lesserknown winegrowing regions like russia and lebanon in the americas cabernet sauvignon has found champions in every nook and cranny of california and among

exalted sacrashe vineyard takes center stage and is the basis of this blend the vineyard contributes the mouthcoating richness and complexity offering deep dark earthy cassis flavors and powerfully dense tannins from there we search out complementary vineyards usually from the most regarded mountain appellation to create balance symmetry and finesse in the wine lastly we introduce vineyards with profound depth and decadence to heighten the voluptuousness and opulence that have become a hallmark character of our flagship wine  varietal composition  cabernet sauvignon  merlot  petit verdot
