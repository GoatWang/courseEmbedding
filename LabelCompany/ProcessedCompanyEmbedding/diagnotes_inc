indianapolisbased health it company with a hipaacompliant mobile communication system that gives medical groups the tools to improve communication among providers patients and staff the diagnotes system is available on smartphones tablets and the web and is comprised of five interlocking components secure texting provider scheduling clinical documentation answering service automation and ehr integration by enabling more effective communication diagnotes increases revenue decreases cost and enhances both provider and patient experience we created original concept behind diagnotes we were involved from idea phase to the beta testing phase and to marketing phase of the product emrabc emrabc is a userfriendly webbased electronic medical record system designed to work hand in hand with the aging brain care model emrabc is an enhanced electronic medical record patient registry tracking and automated decision support system this proprietary webbased tracking software is designed to work hand in hand with the aging brain care model to support care coordination for patients and their family caregivers emrabc was specifically designed and developed to capture patient and caregiver demographics patient er visits and hospital admissions depression and cognition tracking medication adherence and anticholinergic burden emrabc is accessible and specifically designed for users with little to no experience in clinical software applications it can be customized to the needs of your health system such as including additional reporting modules for individual tracking and can be linked with other patient information systems such as commercial electronic medical record systems ultimately emrabc helps clinicians diagnose evaluate and manage dementia patients and their family caregivers more effectively mavensphere developed the whole solution starting with mockups design development alpha  beta testing we have implemented this at both eskenazi health hospital and iu health arnett cicoa cicoa aging  inhome solutions is a notforprofit agency and one of  area agencies on aging nationwide prior to emr care managers often didn’t know about changes in health status between quarterly visits making it difficult to coordinate the best care and access to available services now cicoa’s managed care options counselors mcocs will be the first staff to use this system to coordinate services simultaneously with anthem care managers mcocs will know immediately if one of their clients has been hospitalized visited the emergency department discharged from the hospital visited their physician or is prescribed a change in medication cicoa plans to roll out this same system in the future with its inhome services care management staff the emr interfaces with the indiana health information exchange this allows cicoa’s hospitalembedded health care collaboration staff who determine transitional services for atrisk seniors before discharge to communicate more efficiently and effectively with hospital staff about their plan of care the goal is to ensure patients don’t end up back in the emergency room or rehospitalized within  days because of lack of support at home “the ability to provide realtime uptodate information is the emr’s biggest value” said paul watkins cicoa’s director of health care collaboration added “it allows us to better coordinate services to help people stay at home in better health with better care and at a lower cost” the emr system is being piloted with anthem indiana medicaid patients who are at high risk of hospital readmission by providing day care transition services cicoa anticipates that the emr will be fully implemented for all referred anthem indiana medicaid clients by the end of february the service will extend to anthem’s hoosier care connect aged blind or disabled patients beginning in early april fifteen other indiana area agencies on aging have expressed interest in bringing the emr system to their markets cicoa currently is investigating how to best scale the program statewide to guarantee uniformity and hipaa compliance “this is a very significant step forward in terms of integrating care managers in the overall care and health of our seniors” watkins said mavensphere worked with cicoa to develop this software and successfully implemented with all  aaas in the state of
