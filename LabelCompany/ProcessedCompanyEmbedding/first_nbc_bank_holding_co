purchase option based on the initial public offering price of  per share and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses we intend to use the net proceeds to us generated by this offering to support our organic growth and for other general corporate purposes we believe that these net proceeds can be deployed to support our organic growth without significantly diluting our earnings per share although we may from time to time in the ordinary course of our business evaluate potential acquisition opportunities that we believe are complementary to our business and provide attractive riskadjusted returns we do not have any immediate plans arrangements or understandings relating to any material acquisition we compete with a wide range of financial institutions in our market including local regional and national commercial banks thrifts and credit unions and our primary competitors are the larger regional and national banks consolidation activity involving outofstate financial institutions has altered the competitive landscape in our market within recent years as of june   approximately  of the deposits in the new orleans market were held in banks that were based in this market based on deposit data as of june   that number had decreased to less than  due in large part to the acquisition of several large locallybased financial institutions by large outofstate banks two of which held in the aggregate more than  of the inmarket deposits at the time of their respective acquisitions although competition within our market area is strong we believe that the customer disruption associated with these acquisitions as well as the loss of inmarket decisionmaking and relationshipbased banking will continue to provide us with additional growth opportunities as the largest bank holding company headquartered in the new orleans market the following table depicts the top depository institution competitors within our marketplace by holding company and presents the respective market share of each competitor within the new orleans market as of june   these figures have been adjusted to reflect subsequent acquisitions market rank

with mortgage companies investment banking firms brokerage houses mutual fund managers investment advisors and other “nonbank” companies for certain of our products and services some of our competitors are not subject to the degree of supervision and regulatory restrictions that we are interest rates both on loans and deposits and prices on feebased services are significant competitive factors among financial institutions generally many of our competitors are much larger financial institutions that have greater financial resources than we do and that compete aggressively for market share these competitors attempt to gain market share through their financial product mix pricing strategies and banking center locations due to the benefits of scale our larger regional and national bank competitors can in many cases offer pricing that is more attractive than that which we can offer although this pricing has historically been reserved for customers of a size for which we generally would not compete other important competitive factors in our market area include office locations and hours quality of customer service community reputation continuity of personnel and services capacity and willingness to extend credit and ability to offer sophisticated cash management and other commercial banking services many of our competitors are organized along lines of business and use efficient but impersonal approaches to providing products and services to customers while we seek to be competitive with respect to rates we believe that we compete most successfully on the basis of our service and relationshipbased culture we adjust our pricing to maximize our share of each customer’s total financial service spending because we are unburdened by legacy main frame computer systems we believe that our technology platform enables us to be more flexible in developing and implementing new services in a competitive marketplace company description we are a bank holding company headquartered in new orleans louisiana which offers a broad range of financial services through our whollyowned banking subsidiary first nbc bank a louisiana state nonmember bank our primary market is the new orleans metropolitan area and the mississippi gulf coast we serve our customers from our main office located in the central business district of new orleans  full service branch offices located throughout our market and a loan production office in gulfport mississippi we believe that our market exhibits attractive demographic attributes and presents favorable competitive dynamics thereby offering longterm opportunities for growth our strategic focus is on building a franchise with meaningful market share and strong revenues complemented by operational efficiencies that we believe will produce attractive riskadjusted returns for our shareholders as of december   on a consolidated basis we had total assets of  billion net loans of  billion total deposits of  billion and shareholders’ equity of  million we are the largest bank holding company by assets headquartered in new orleans as of december   we are led by a team of experienced bankers all of whom have substantial banking or related experience and relationships in the greater new orleans market we believe that recent changes and disruption within our primary market caused by significant acquisitions of local financial institutions and the operating difficulties faced by many local competitors have created an underserved base of small and middlemarket businesses and high net worth individuals that are interested in banking with a company headquartered in and with decisionmaking authority based in the new orleans market we believe our management’s longstanding presence in the area gives us insight into the local market and the ability to tailor our products and services particularly the structure of our loans to the needs of our targeted customers we seek to develop comprehensive longterm banking relationships by crossselling loans and core deposits offering a diverse array of products and services and delivering high quality customer service in addition to the
