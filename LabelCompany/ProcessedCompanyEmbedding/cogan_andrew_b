jul   join core today submit your projects for publication favorite this y m u  x h 8 views this years cooperhewitt national design award for corporate and institutional achievement was given to furniture design company knoll the award is a timely vindication for the designfocused company which continued to invest in design even as the economy tanked knoll stock price in the first quarter of  sank to just over  shares are now over  andrew cogan left has been ceo of the east greenville pennsylvaniabased company since  i talked with him about the companys ongoing commitment to innovation and he described how knoll has learned to evolve and adapt along with the market even as it continues to emphasize the importance of design to the bottom line workspaces top are a new introduction designed by famed new yorkbased company antenna an edited transcript of our conversation followshelen walters can you describe the research process at knollandrew cogan florence knoll started the knoll planning unit in 46 she was wellknown for trying to understand the problem clients were trying to solve for particularly as they were moving into the modern workplace she spent time studying what was going on in an office how people interface with each other and equipment and tools and we continue to do that to this day were very clientdriven we engage with a range of individual clients looking at all the problems theyre solving and we think about how furniture can play a role in that we also do research on a broader level so we think about a topic such as office seating and spend hundreds of hours filming people in office chairs to see how they sit and move and that gives insight into designing products then we also do third party trend research looking at trends in the workplace we bring all those insights together into our product design process can you give an example of a clientbased projectwe recently did a major program with ebay they were trying to go to a more collaborative environment with a lower height horizon so we looked at how our products could facilitate that it evolved into a very particular solution of a collection of products that met their needs both in how theyre working today and how they want to work down the roadwhat does lower height horizon mean and what are some of the other office space trends youre watching right nowthe lowering of the horizon is driven by social issues of people wanting to collaborate and see whats going on more its also driven by environmental issues leed certification calls for more natural light to reach the core of a space and high panels interfere with the penetration of light so we go lower that trend is coupled with miniaturization and the mobility of tech people are spending more time online and doing email and less time on the telephone so you can create a smaller more efficient environment people dont want to feel like theyre at some big dining table getting work done so within a space you have different levels of privacy adjustability and enclosureyour most recent introductions include a conference table collection by lehman smith mcleish the idea of the huge conference table is pretty old school what made you think this was a good time for that linetheyre much smaller than the tables of old theyre not the  foot boardroom table theyre for groups of up to  and are really more meeting room than board room you can integrate and access technology through the products attach speakers for video conferencing plug in ipads project on a shared screen what we do at knoll is integrate technology into our product technology changes at a much faster pace than the furniture a building changes every  years furniture changes every 0 years technology changes every  years so weve never believed in the idea of designing furniture for tech instead its about accepting the technology thats out there and designing a table where people can come around and plug in whatever device they have to share the content that the meeting is aboutdesign is so complex these days that were arguably moving away from the individual heroic designer and toward more collective approaches that cater to design systems rather than design artifact agreeiconic heroic product always has a role at knoll richard sappers monitor arm is shown above look at the work of frank gehry whose work is iconic we work with the rodarte sisters who create a heroic textile product we are not going to sell a ton of it and its not integrated into our office portfolio but we do believe in it and we continue to invest yet the mainstay of the business is office environments so to that extent we need to orchestrate the roles of several designers that means we share research and have designers meet together periodically to work on the part of program theyre attacking as well as working individually—so groups such as antenna in the united states or formway design in new zealand are aware of whats going on we believe in working with the best talent wherever they are we dont put designers in a building and say design we go to the best talent in the world to take on a design projecthow do you manage all those moving partsthe important thing at knoll is that all the pieces come together or it could be cacophonous at industry showcase neocon youll see showrooms where all these things come together and its a mess were focused on coordination and orchestration florence knoll did that a lot of her solutions were rectilinear and square which she learned from mies van der rohe and then she added the organic so you had a crisp desk and a saarinen womb chair its a mixture of foreground and background with antenna we have the square crisp desk then with generationregeneration a line of chairs from knoll we have organic elastic products to bring humanity into the spacebut practically speaking how do you juggle all of thisthere arent a ton of us who do this were getting back to a billion dollars in sales now net sales tallied  million for q of  but theres still a core group that leads the shared vision of what were trying to do in individual workplaceshow much of what you do is directly driven by your customer is customization for clients when they want to do something quickly when we dont already have a solution we can respond in a matter of weeks and we constantly monitor how those individual requests break down if we see patterns that suggests theres something lacking in our standard offer and that might kick itself to should we look at a permanent solution for that so our work is both clientbased and architecturedesignbased its a constant feedback loop of specials and standardsso your focus is not always going to be at the bleeding edge of designyou dont have to be the first mover in some cases its good to see others try things out what knoll is historically terrific at is watching and then finding the right way to pounce take cubicles we werent the first but we came in with tremendous force and refinement we also dont do a lot but we try to do everything well were less about speed than thoroughness the workplace evolves very slowly were not ge were not in high tech this is more gradual and evolutionary companies dont throw out their workplaces they constantly upgrade them so we try to ensure that everything we design integrates with what weve already done of course we end up creating new platforms because you can only extend things so far but even those work with the things weve already doneabout helen walters helen walters is a
