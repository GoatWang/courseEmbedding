taken advantage of in investments related to oil and gas there are two types of investment losses in oil and gas securities that are potentially recoverable through the firna arbitration process or via lawsuit unsuitable investment recommendations in oil and gas stocks bonds master limited partnerships and mutual funds negligence based unsuitable investment recommendations in oil gas and energy related companies make up a majority of the cases we’ve handled for investors for example brokers at full service brokerage firms recommended oil and gas stocks master limited partnerships and other related investments heavily to investors between  and  with the massive slide in oil prices in  and  caused by the jump in domestic oil stockpiles due to new highly efficient drilling techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking techniques companies affiliated with the oil industries have lost substantial value resulting in devastating investment losses for many investors unfortunately many small oil and gas producers have lost a majority of their value in  and  these companies have heavy debt loads that simply couldn’t be maintained with the oil price slide dozens of master limited partnerships have declined in value in  and  the  billion masterlimitedpartnership sector is the sausage maker of the investment world buyers love the yields — now averaging about  — but many know little about how the yields are generated the bullish pitch by brokers in favor of the investments centered around the highyielding way to participate in the booming us energy infrastructure buildout unfortunately the investments while providing generous yields masked the substantial high risks of these investments many of these investments were pitched to elderly and conservative investors because of the relatively high dividends and yields that the investments paid out these losses are potentially recoverable through either finra arbitration claims against the brokerage firms whose brokers recommended the investments or lawsuits against the promoters of the investments fraud based claims the second type of oil and gas actions deal with fraud based claims oil and gas investments take many forms including limited partnership interests master limited partnerships ownership of fractional undivided interests in leases and general partnerships risk level tax consequences and investor liability vary according to the type of program drilling partnerships have always been a gamble but unfortunately many oil and gas scams have been perpetrated by bad actors in the securities industry although some of the con artists moved on to more lucrative venues since the oil boom ended in the mids many continued to linger on in the oil field and the results of their actions are being felt now fraudulent oil and gas deals are frequently structured with the limited partnership or other legal entity in one state the operation and physical presence of the field in a second state and the offerings made to prospective investors in states other than the initial two states thus there is less chance of an investor dropping by a well site or a nonexistent company headquarters such a structure also makes it difficult for law enforcement officials and victims to identify and expose the fraud our securities law firm holds financial advisors accountable brokers at major brokerage firms like linsco lpl ubs merrill lynch raymond james citgroup and stifel nicolaus also sometimes engage in an activity called “selling away” when a broker sells a customer an “investment” outside the investment products offered by the brokerage firm and outside the client’s account there may be a selling away issue these investments known as private securities often involve investments in oil and gas related limited partnerships privately held companies private placements promissory notes and other similar investments sometimes they are real investments other times they are completely bogus and used as a means for the advisor to convert client funds unfortunately unscrupulous oil promoters and stockbrokers frequently use the internet and “boiler room” offices with banks of phones manned by salespeople with little or no background in energy exploration but plenty of experience in highpressure sales their techniques include repeated unsolicited phone calls to potential investors hyping the profitability of the deal and promises of safe but secure returns some examples of these pitches include • you will have an interest in a well that cannot miss • the risks are minimal • a geologist has given the salesperson a tip • the broker or salesperson has personally invested in the venture • the promoter has “hit” on every well drilled so far • there has been a tremendous “discovery” in an adjacent field • a large reputable oil company like chevron is operating or planning to operate in the area • only a few interests remain to be sold and you should immediately send in your money in order to assure the purchase of an interest • this is a special private deal open only to a lucky chosen few investors oil gas and energy deals we are

our strategy to acquiring grassroots leases to supplement our legacy acreage position and begins exploring our first unconventional reservoirs using horizontal drilling and modern hydraulic fracturing technology this allows us to access oil trapped in lowpermeability rock formations to produce significant returns from plays that had been written off as nonviable  strategy shift begins given an ongoing sluggish economy and a poor public equity market chaparral sells a  percent equity stake in the company to a private equity firm ccmp capital advisors llc generating  million in new capital allowing the company to continue to grow as we shift from acquisitions to drillingthis new strategy supplemented with more than two decades of successful management lays the groundwork for even

plummet to  a barrel chaparral survives intact while many oil companies meet their demise  growing in stature we make our single largest acquisition to date by acquiring calumet oil company out of tulsa oklahoma calumet a pioneer in early oklahoma oil had acquired numerous large oilfields chaparral funds this acquisition by selling a  percent equity stake in the company and entering the public debt market for the first time with  million in highyield bonds the acquisition also nearly doubles our employee base and unlocks a vast array of ep and eor opportunities as a result we become one of osage county’s largest operators generating  percent of the oil royalties for the osage nationto control our debtrisk profile we also hedge forwardsell much of our oil and gas for the next five years

bristol resources acquisition dealarmed with a thorough knowledge of these properties after five years of operations chaparral recognizes a tremendous upside for the company with this purchase and still generates a  million profit for our partner  growing co eor to support our growing co eor business chaparral enters into the co transportation business acquiring  miles of pipeline running from

major acquisition acquiring bristol resources for approximately  million through a partnership with a leading financial entity this acquisition greatly increases our presence in several different states and even includes some offshore operations  first step into co eor continuing to grow chaparral seeks new opportunities to convert undervalued oilfields into moneymakers by acquiring an existing co eor project from henry petroleum in southern oklahoma we gain our first handson eor experience using modern injection techniques some wells see production more than double  thriving despite the market oil prices plummet  percent in just a few months from  a barrel to  a barrel chaparral does more than merely weather the storm thanks to prudent financial management and welltimed oilprice hedging we continue to thrive  a place to call home chaparral purchases an squarefoot building located on britton road for our corporate headquarters in oklahoma city providing a true home and base of operations  from risk to reward chaparral excels with a talent for identifying acquiring and unlocking the value of plays that other companies have written off as having “no remaining

several oil and gas formations that sit stacked atop one another these formation layers are vertically stacked hundreds to even thousands of feet on top of each other creating overlapping layers known as “stacked pays” stacked pays allow operators such as chaparral access to drill multiple formations from a single location with the ability to drill up to  separate horizontal wells from a single

realizing they have been taken advantage of in investments related to oil and gas there are two types of investment losses in oil and gas securities that are potentially recoverable through the firna arbitration process or via lawsuit unsuitable investment recommendations in oil and gas stocks bonds master limited partnerships and mutual funds negligence based unsuitable investment recommendations in oil gas and energy related companies make up a majority of the cases we’ve handled for investors for example brokers at full service brokerage firms recommended oil and gas stocks master limited partnerships and other related investments heavily to investors between  and  with the massive slide in oil prices in  and  caused by the jump in domestic oil stockpiles due to new highly efficient drilling techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking techniques companies affiliated with the oil industries have lost substantial value resulting in devastating investment losses for many investors unfortunately many small oil and gas producers have lost a majority of their value in  and  these companies have heavy debt loads that simply couldn’t be maintained with the oil price slide dozens of master limited partnerships have declined in value in  and  the  billion masterlimitedpartnership sector is the sausage maker of the investment world buyers love the yields — now averaging about  — but many know little about how the yields are generated the bullish pitch by brokers in favor of the investments centered around the highyielding way to participate in the booming us energy infrastructure buildout unfortunately the investments while providing generous yields masked the substantial high risks of these investments many of these investments were pitched to elderly and conservative investors because of the relatively high dividends and yields that the investments paid out these losses are potentially recoverable through either finra arbitration claims against the brokerage firms whose brokers recommended the investments or lawsuits against the promoters of the investments fraud based claims the second type of oil and gas actions deal with fraud based claims oil and gas investments take many forms including limited partnership interests master limited partnerships ownership of fractional undivided interests in leases and general partnerships risk level tax consequences and investor liability vary according to the type of program drilling partnerships have always been a gamble but unfortunately many oil and gas scams have been perpetrated by bad actors in the securities industry although some of the con artists moved on to more lucrative venues since the oil boom ended in the mids many continued to linger on in the oil field and the results of their actions are being felt now fraudulent oil and gas deals are frequently structured with the limited partnership or other legal entity in one state the operation and physical presence of the field in a second state and the offerings made to prospective investors in states other than the initial two states thus there is less chance of an investor dropping by a well site or a nonexistent company headquarters such a structure also makes it difficult for law enforcement officials and victims to identify and expose the fraud our securities law firm holds financial advisors accountable brokers at major brokerage firms like linsco lpl ubs merrill lynch raymond james citgroup and stifel nicolaus also sometimes engage in an activity called “selling away” when a broker sells a customer an “investment” outside the investment products offered by the brokerage firm and outside the client’s account there may be a selling away issue these investments known as private securities often involve investments in oil and gas related limited partnerships privately held companies private placements promissory notes and other similar investments sometimes they are real investments other times they are completely bogus and used as a means for the advisor to convert client funds unfortunately unscrupulous oil promoters and stockbrokers frequently use the internet and “boiler room” offices with banks of phones manned by salespeople with little or no background in energy exploration but plenty of experience in highpressure sales their techniques include repeated unsolicited phone calls to potential investors hyping the profitability of the deal and promises of safe but secure returns some examples of these pitches include • you will have an interest in a well that cannot miss • the risks are minimal • a geologist has given the salesperson a tip • the broker or salesperson has personally invested in the venture • the promoter has “hit” on every well drilled so far • there has been a tremendous “discovery” in an adjacent field • a large reputable oil company like chevron is operating or planning to operate in the area • only a few interests remain to be sold and you should immediately send in your money in order to assure the purchase of an interest • this is a special private deal open only to a lucky chosen few investors oil gas and energy deals we
