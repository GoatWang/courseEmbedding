unique chemical and physical properties make gilsonite a highperformance multipurpose additive that is also a costeffective solution there’s only one gilsonite gilsonite is only found in one place in the world—the uinta basin of northeastern utah where american gilsonite controls significant reserves some companies claim to offer “gilsonite” from other parts of the world but these products are simply misidentified in order to take advantage of gilsonite’s internationally recognized quality and proven performance because these other materials are not true uintaites they have inferior performance due to their different physical and chemical properties if it doesn’t come from american gilsonite company it simply isn’t gilsonite purity and quality gilsonite is found in nearly straight vertical veins across an area approximately  kilometers long and  kilometers wide gilsonite was formed by a unique geologic event millions of years ago that caused a protopetroleum deposit forming at that time to fill large surface cracks later solidifying into the pure resinous rock mined today gilsonite is handmined in underground shafts using pneumatic jack hammers we separate gilsonite by temperature grade dry and screen it size it to customer specifications and submit it to extensive quality control procedures before shipping to over  countries worldwide if you’d like to

end markets » oil  gas » cementing gilsonite is an effective lost circulation material that assures zonal isolation and reduces environmental risk as the challenges presented by today’s wellbore configurations increase a properly designed cementing process is critical to keeping the wellbore isolated protected and environmentally sound  for more than  years the industry has depended on gilsonite® as a lost circulation material and a critical component for primary cementing operations in some of the world’s toughest drilling environments adding gilsonite during cementing operations enhances the characteristics that are critical to effectively cementing the casing isolating hydrocarbon formations and preventing annular gas flow with its unique physical and chemical properties gilsonite provides a range of important benefits in slurry and set cement that are unmatched by any other single additive cement slurry benefits increases yield reduces slurry weight controls free water lowers slurry water ratio promotes favorable rheologies resulting in lower ecds prevents lost circulation scours wellboreenhances mud removal set cement benefits maintains compressive strength unlike coal or fly ash increases flexibility reduces cracking heals microfissures reduces permeability strengthens bond to the formation and the casing reduces environmental risk assures zonal isolation gilsonite eliminates the problems of free waterby controlling free water gilsonite helps stabilize slurry and eliminates the need for – and cost of – additional freewatercontrol agents as a lost circulation material it also improves zonal isolation by preventing water channeling on the upper side of the wellbore selfhealing properties help maintain zonal isolationgilsonite is flexible deformable swellable impermeable and nonporous these characteristics give gilsonite selfhealing properties that can plug induced microfissures in the cement sheath         abouthistory what is

alerts client login home » about » history history of american gilsonite company  expand all  discovery of uintaite and its commercialization the original discoverers of the natural deposits of gilsonite® are unknown but it is clear that the local ute tribe was aware of these striking geologic features before their discovery by the first pioneers of utah during the s samples of this unique natural bitumen were sent to leading scientists for analysis william phipps blake classified it as an asphaltite and gave it its official name of “uintaite” after its source location in the uinta basin our trademarked name gilsonite comes from the colorful character samuel h gilson the flamboyant sheriff rancher horse trader and supplier of horses for the pony express who was instrumental in developing this resource gilson’s name became linked through his persistent search for its uses and markets and he is credited with the first real commercialization of the product gilson formed a partnership with bert seabolt in  that became the gilsonite manufacturing company in  the two joined with charles o baxter a mining engineer to rename the company as the st louis gilsonite company in  anheuserbusch bought out gilson’s share and changed the name to the gilson asphaltum company in those early days gilsonite was mined by pickaxe and hauled by oxcart to rifle colorado the earliest uses of gilsonite included asphalt road paving paints and waterproofing for timbers anheuserbusch used gilsonite as a safe and effective lining for the inside of its beer barrels  development of mines the year  marked the completion of the uintah railway linking the rich black dragon vein to mack colorado by a oneofakind narrow gauge rail that wound over  miles of mountains to reach a transfer point only  miles away as the crow flies the rail line was extended to the rainbow vein in  and together with the dragon vein this area was the major production center for gilsonite from  to  the rainbow vein one of the most productive in this period was over  miles in length  feet wide at the surface and mined to a depth of over  feet in  the gilson asphaltum company moved its principal operations to bonanza utah and began mining from the bonanza cowboy and other large veins near the plant the bonanza vein was  feet wide at it widest point and it and the other veins near the town of bonanza are still being actively mined nearly  years later after the move to bonanza almost all of the products were trucked to craig colorado and the uintah railway was abandoned in  the company changed its name to the barber asphalt company later part of barber oil company in this period gilsonite continued to be used primarily as an asphaltpaving modifier and in paints for example gilsonite was in the paint formula for the legendary ford model t its uses also expanded to include a diverse range of products including black telephone receivers and switchboards printing inks rubber substitutes car battery casings waterproof packaging roofing paper floor coverings electric insulation and phonograph records  the chevron era in  barber oil company formed a joint venture with standard oil of california now chevron the new company was named american gilsonite company by  the town of bonanza had grown to more than  people and the company increased its research and development efforts seeking to increase capacity american gilsonite company introduced hydraulic mining with pressure hoses and mechanical cutters using water pressure during this period we achieved record mining volumes and through intensive research expanded our product line to include sealers and adhesives oil drilling fluid and cementing additives and construction materials such as fiberboards  development of current end markets chevron sold the company in  and between  and  the company consolidated its efforts as a smaller privately owned entity during this period we expanded our international sales and established our preeminence as a highquality performance additive in drilling fluids and cementing printing inks asphaltic paints foundry castings such as iron engine blocks and brake calipers construction materials and asphalt applications such as road paving and emulsions for surface treatments  substantial investment in mining capacity to meet surging demand between  and  demand for gilsonite increased so rapidly that it outpaced our mine development efforts in the prior years to address the surge in demand we doubled the size of our workforce greatly expanded the number of mines under development and increased our capital spending by a factor of ten we invested in research for new mining and innovations in shaftsinking recognizing the need to be closer to our largest end market we added a new office in houston texas and also expanded our sales team with drilling fluid and other technical experts these combined actions allowed us to significantly expand the production and sales of gilsonite throughout the world  and beyond continuing to expand production capacity while partnering with our customers to solve their technical challenges to ensure our ability to reliably meet demand cycles looking forward we launched a strategic plan to greatly increase our mining capacity by developing more mines and by training new miners we will continue expanding our sales force to

conducted for the national toxicology program ntp where mice and rats were fed diets containing either  or  gilsonite for their lifetimes in another study  gilsonite in benzene applied  times a week for  weeks to the skin of mice caused no increase in skin cancer over what was observed in the control group in a third study a sample of gilsonite heated to �f �c and cooled was not found to be mutagenic in the ames assay the national institute for occupational safety and health was unable to detect polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons in gilsonite the information presented above suggests that gilsonite has a low order of toxicity and is not carcinogenic although er resin is not a carcinogen processes in which gilsonite is brought to very high temperatures may alter its complex hydrocarbon structure and may produce carcinogenic substances thermal cracking of complex hydrocarbon is known to produce polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons some of which are known to be carcinogenic and mutagenic ames mutagenicity screening tests were conducted on samples of gilsonite which were heated a sample heated to �f �c and allowed to cool was found to be mutagenic in another study gilsonite distilled at approximately �f �c and dissolved in benzene was carcinogenic when applied  times a week for  weeks to the skin of mice handling er resin is not expected to cause cancer however skin contact and breathing of vapor or mists derived from certain processes in which er resin is heated to high temperatures should be avoided please refer to the special precautions section of this document
