innovation vs reform  finjan holdings inc fnjn sign up for email updates be the first to receive breaking news sign up home technology innovation vs reform technology innovation vs reform finjan supports a balanced approach to patent reform and believes that the original intent for granting ownership rights to inventors  a us patent system that promotes innovation will strengthen the us economy  remains true today as shown in our schematic we propose reforms which restrict abusive patent behaviors on the one hand while incentivizing good faith licensing and enforcement practices on the other hand specifically those who comply with certain transparent and elevated standards on ownership disclosure notice letters claim charts complaints and efficient use of the judicial system should be exempt from the currently proposed reforms such as feeshifting bond requirements oneside discovery reforms and joinder otherwise imposed on abusive patent owners without the exemption ethical individual innovators startups and small established companies who each contribute significantly to the uss global role as a leader in innovation will face challenges in direct conflict with their due process rights join us in supporting this proposal patent reform letter to the honorable chris coons dde us senate march   updated blueprint patent reform  innovation march  executive

finjan holdings inc fnjn sign up for email updates be the first to receive breaking news sign up home technology enforcement glossary technology enforcement glossary affirmative defenses facts other than those pled by plaintiff if proven by defendant defeats or mitigates the legal consequences of the defendants otherwise unlawful conduct certain waiveable defenses must be pled at time of answering the complaint eg noninfringement due to invalidity unenforceability due to misuse or inequitable conduct during prosecution of patent application etc nonwaiveable affirmative defenses include lack of subject matter jurisdiction case management conference cmc brief proceedings with the court following filing of complaint to address various scheduling discovery or status issues timing and scope of these conferences vary among the courts claim chart sets forth each limitation in a claim and charts the limitations against the components of the allegedly infringing product claim construction a fundamental issue in patent cases strictly in the province of the courts both infringement and validity are twostep processes requiring construction of the patent claims first and then application of the appropriately construed claims to the accused device or the prior art respectively claim construction gives scope and meaning to the patent claims the applicant may be its own lexicographer and assign a specific definition to the terms used in the patent specification however if no special meaning is explicitly assigned to a term it will be given their ordinary meaning contributory infringement  usc §c whoever sells a component of a patented machine for use in practicing the patented process that does not have a substantial noninfringing use shall be liable as a contributory infringer declaratory judgment action a preemptive action by an alleged infringer to bring suit to resolve a threat of litigation by a patent owner must show an actual controversy ie the threat of being sued for patent infringement is imminent defensive action usually a defendant or in a position of defending against an assertion in district court patent litigation a defendant defends for example against assertions of patent infringement in reexamination proceedings before the us patent office uspto the patent owner defends the validity of its issued patent direct infringement infringement is directly by the accused and not through third parties enhanced damages upon a finding of willful infringement the court has the discretion to enhance patent damages up to three times  usc § and attorneys fees and costs under  usc § indirect infringement infringement occurs through the inducement of another by the accused eg defendant intentionally knowingly encouraged patent infringement by another see “induced infringement” induced infringement  usc §b whoever actively induces infringement of a patent shall be liable as a direct infringer requires a finding that the defendant engaged in some affirmative act and not simply failed to take steps to prevent infringement injunction federal law also allows courts to grant injunctions if necessary to prevent a violation of patent rights requires a showing that monetary damages is insufficient for making the patent owner whole ex parte in context of uspto proceedings challenging the validity of an issued patent ex parte means a legal proceeding brought by one person in the absence of and without representation of other parties fre  evidence rules federal rules of evidence rule  provides that certain evidence eg of furnishing promising or offering or accepting promising to accept or offering to accept a valuable consideration in compromising or attempting to compromise a claim or statements made during compromise negotiations about a claim with exceptions are inadmissible at trial inter partes between the parties in the context of uspto proceedings challenging the validity of an issued patent inter partes means all interested parties patent owner and patent challenger are given reasonable opportunity to attend and be heard markman hearing markman or claim construction hearing although the courts need not follow a particular formal process for claim construction courts typically allow briefing expert testimony and oral argument in a markman hearing before issuing a claim construction order often once claims are construed the parties will file a summary judgment motion of infringement or invalidity depending on the party position which may eliminate the need for a jury trial mediation a form of alternative dispute resolution that most district courts require litigation parties to participate in early in a case mediation is generally court mandated is supervised by a certified mediator appointed by the court for the purpose of providing an early opportunity for the parties to meet and explore settlement of their dispute the discussions written submissions and results of the mediation are not reported to the presiding judge rather the mediator may only report the fact that mediation took place whether the parties settled or whether the parties wish to continue mediation or not continue meet  confer a requirement of courts for counsel and their clients to meet and confer to try to resolve the matter or at least determine the points of conflict offensive usually a plaintiff or in a position of asserting a claim against another in district court patent litigation a plaintiff asserts for example assertions of patent infringement in reexamination proceedings before the us patent office uspto the petitioner seeks reexamination of anothers patents validity reexamination reexam reexamination is a specialized proceeding in which the uspto reconsiders an issued patent the process can result in invalidation of some or all of the patent claims reexamination may be initiated by the uspto or by the patent owner but increasingly third parties start the process as part of an overall strategy to challenge a patent reexam accepted when the uspto accepts a petition to reexamine the validity of an issued patent or rules in favor of the petitioner ie invalidates all or some of the patent claims reexam denied when the uspto rejects a petition to reexamine the validity of an issued patent or rules against the petitioner ie affirms the validity of the patent stay a courtordered shortterm delay in judicial proceedings summary judgment motion sj sj is a dispositive ruling appropriate in patent cases where the only real dispute is between the parties concerns the proper meaning of the patent claims infringement is a question of law for the court and sj is appropriate if there is no material fact sufficient to preclude the grant of summary judgment the burden of proving infringement is on the patent owner which must be by a preponderance of the evidence invalidity may also be disposed of by a sj motion if the party seeking to invalidate the patent can prove the patent is invalid in light of prior art or is unenforceable due to misconduct on the part of the patent owner by clear and convincing evidence technical or technology tutorial
