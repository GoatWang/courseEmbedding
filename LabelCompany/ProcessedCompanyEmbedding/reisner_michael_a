land was greenspring and was surveyed which without further explanation was patented on feb   to michael michael owned two sections of land greensprings and smiths lot these were located in what was called upper germans in frederick county md michael reisner and thomas cresap along with others settled on the west side of the susquehanna river and was claiming the land as marylanders there was an attack on one their homes led by the high sheriff of lanchester county one man was carried as a prisoner the the susquehanna river in route to jail in lanchester but were met by five men michael
