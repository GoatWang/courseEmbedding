drive everything we do and they’ve never been more important in  the world will generate  times the amount of data as in  and  times the number of information sources idc  within these data are huge opportunities for human advancement but to turn opportunities into reality people need the power of data at their fingertips tableau is building software to deliver exactly that our products are transforming the way people use data to solve problems we make analyzing data fast and easy beautiful and useful it’s software for anyone and everyone we are tableau software it began with three guys from stanford it started with a brilliant computer scientist an academyaward winning professor and a savvy business leader with a passion for data they came together to solve one of the most challenging problems in software – making data understandable to ordinary people these were the fundamental ingredients for tableau the catalyst the mind behind pixar “i see the future” close catalyst pixar future chris stolte cofounder and technical advisor the catalyst a department of defense dod project aimed at increasing people’s ability to analyze information brought to the stanford university computer science department the project took flight with chris stolte stolte then a phd candidate was researching visualization techniques for exploring and analyzing relational databases and data cubes his early career as a database programmer helped him see the problems with existing data analysis tools hungering for a project to change the world he knew this was it whenever i helped people get direct access to data they were shocked and grateful i’ve never forgotten that pat hanrahan tableau’s chief scientist and cofounder the mind behind pixar the mind behind pixar and stolte’s phd advisor professor pat hanrahan realized too it was a project that could change the world a founding member of pixar and chief architect for renderman pat had already transformed the world of animated film we create pictures that answer questions but we do it for businesses that want to know things about their data chris pat and a team of stanford phds realized that computer graphics could deliver huge gains in people’s ability to understand data the breakthrough arose when they brought together two computer science disciplines for the first time computer graphics and databases their invention vizql™ let people analyze data just by building drag  drop pictures of what they wanted to see christian chabot cofounder and chairman “i see the future” “i see the future” was christian chabot’s reaction when he saw what they invented chabot had spent years analyzing data before studying entrepreneurship at stanford business school together christian chris and pat formed a company and spun out of stanford in  with christian on board as ceo tableau rapidly hit one success after another first customers multiple awards international expansion the first million in revenue multiple new inventions tableau is revolutionizing business analytics and this is only the beginning we’ve become a democratizing force in one of the world’s greatest areas of need breakthrough after breakthrough it’s not enough to be on a mission that matters you must have the ideas and technologies to match we do vizql™ live query engine inmemory data engine tableau public tableau mobile close vizql live query engine inmemory data engine vizql™ natively visual naturally faster vizql is a visual query language that translates draganddrop actions into data queries and then expresses that data visually vizql delivers dramatic gains in people’s ability to see and understand data by abstracting the underlying complexities of query and analysis the result is an intuitive user experience that lets people answer questions as fast as they can think of them we believe that vizql represents a foundational advancement in the area of data analysis and visualization don’t take our word for it jim gray a turing award winner and a legendary figure in the field of databases wrote about vizql in a research highlight “if you have ever been frustrated when trying to plot a useful graph from a simple spreadsheet you would appreciate the value of a system that allows users to create stunning graphs interactively and easily from large multidimensional datasets” high praise from one of the greatest minds of computer science live query engine data in your hands tableau’s live query engine is the first technology to let people natively query databases cubes warehouses cloud sources even hadoop without any programming or advance development it lets people query diverse data sources with a pointandclick interface anyone can use people connect to data of any size with a few clicks layer in additional data sources on the fly connecting to and combining data are easy enough for database novices to achieve inmemory data engine blazing speed when data sources are slow or just not right for the job tableau’s data engine is the answer it’s a breakthrough inmemory analytics database designed to overcome the limitations of existing databases and data silos capable of being run on ordinary computers it leverages the complete memory hierarchy from disk to l cache it shifts the curve between big data and fast analysis and it puts that power into the hands of everyone we believe in powerfor the people building a company that fundamentally changes how people see and understand data requires a different philosophy so tableau founders imbued their company with disruptive points of view liberate data empower people design for people close liberate data empower people design for people liberate data we believe data analysis should be about asking questions not about learning software we make inspiring easytouse products that help people achieve greatness with data so that data can reach its full potential and positively impact the world data yearns to be free to tell its stories to all those who care about its revelations discovering and sharing those stories should be easy but it’s not why most software intended to help people access and understand data is hard to use for too long data has been trapped behind scripts wizards and code today all that changes today people can choose another way join us in the cause to liberate data for everyone empower people when a company gives people selfservice analysis tools they feel different respected capable powerful people start to drive their organization forward in ways that could never have been anticipated they express their full ingenuity and creativity unfortunately most business analytics products are built to centralize and control data not democratize it as a result people at most companies are reliant on specialists just to answer basic questions they stumble through escherlike spreadsheets to work around inflexible business systems or they’re being stonewalled by enterprisewide business intelligence platforms that spend more time in development than helping anyone theres no power in that approach the power is in giving people the ability to think act and deliver tableau desktop is an

databases download article principles of visual understanding perceptual and cognitive factors drive our product design we painstakingly deliberate over every aspect of visual analytics when we considered color selection we hired one of the world’s foremost color cognition experts to engineer tableau’s color palettes to encode how shapes are represented we studied people’s comprehension of shapes when they overlap we customdesigned our maps because the usual online maps are meant for driving directions not for data analysis why all the effort because the right visual representation of data sparks just the right insights a story unfolds as people navigate from one visual summary to another visual analytics creates the exploratory experience necessary for ordinary people to answer questions quickly read about visual analytics in the paper from our development leaders chris stolte pat hanrahan and jock mackinlay “visual analysis for everyone” download whitepaper the cycle of visual analysis we study how people ask a question analyze data to get an answer and then ask their next question we call this the “cycle of visual analysis” an iterative nonlinear process where people ask questions forage for data create pictures and discover new questions to ask the process is rarely sequential a specific view of data typically generates more questions it might suggest the need for more data an insight might suggest a new task the act of communicating a finding may require a new visualization we design our products to support the cycle of visual analysis and to guide people through it our patented show me™ technology recommends the best way to visualize data based on heuristic models from years of proven research tableau defines the right kind of visualization
