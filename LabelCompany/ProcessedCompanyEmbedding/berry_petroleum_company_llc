directory oil  gas investment fraud scams  lawsuits attorneys oil  gas investment scams with the drop in oil prices in  and  thousands of investors are realizing they have been taken advantage of in investments related to oil and gas there are two types of investment losses in oil and gas securities that are potentially recoverable through the firna arbitration process or via lawsuit unsuitable investment recommendations in oil and gas stocks bonds master limited partnerships and mutual funds negligence based unsuitable investment recommendations in oil gas and energy related companies make up a majority of the cases we’ve handled for investors for example brokers at full service brokerage firms recommended oil and gas stocks master limited partnerships and other related investments heavily to investors between  and  with the massive slide in oil prices in  and  caused by the jump in domestic oil stockpiles due to new highly efficient drilling techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking techniques companies affiliated with the oil industries have lost substantial value resulting in devastating investment losses for many investors unfortunately many small oil and gas producers have lost a majority of their value in  and  these companies have heavy debt loads that simply couldn’t be maintained with the oil price slide dozens of master limited partnerships have declined in value in  and  the  billion masterlimitedpartnership sector is the sausage maker of the investment world buyers love the yields — now averaging about  — but many know little about how the yields are generated the bullish pitch by brokers in favor of the investments centered around the highyielding way to participate in the booming us energy infrastructure buildout unfortunately the investments while providing generous yields masked the substantial high risks of these investments many of these investments were pitched to elderly and conservative investors because of the relatively high dividends and yields that the investments paid out these losses are potentially recoverable through either finra arbitration claims against the brokerage firms whose brokers recommended the investments or lawsuits against the promoters of the investments fraud based claims the second type of oil and gas actions deal with fraud based claims oil and gas investments take many forms including limited partnership interests master limited partnerships ownership of fractional undivided interests in leases and general partnerships risk level tax consequences and investor liability vary according to the type of program drilling partnerships have always been a gamble but unfortunately many oil and gas scams have been perpetrated by bad actors in the securities industry although some of the con artists moved on to more lucrative venues since the oil boom ended in the mids many continued to linger on in the oil field and the results of their actions are being felt now fraudulent oil and gas deals are frequently structured with the limited partnership or other legal entity in one state the operation and physical presence of the field in a second state and the offerings made to prospective investors in states other than the initial two states thus there is less chance of an investor dropping by a well site or a nonexistent company headquarters such a structure also makes it difficult for law enforcement officials and victims to identify and expose the fraud our securities law firm holds financial advisors accountable brokers at major brokerage firms like linsco lpl ubs merrill lynch raymond james citgroup and stifel nicolaus also sometimes engage in an activity called “selling away” when a broker sells a customer an “investment” outside the investment products offered by the brokerage firm and outside the client’s account there may be a selling away issue these investments known as private securities often involve investments in oil and gas related limited partnerships privately held companies private placements promissory notes and other similar investments sometimes they are real investments other times they are completely bogus and used as a means for the advisor to convert client funds unfortunately unscrupulous oil promoters and stockbrokers frequently use the internet and “boiler room” offices with banks of phones manned by salespeople with little or no background in energy exploration but plenty of experience in highpressure sales their techniques include repeated unsolicited phone calls to potential investors hyping the profitability of the deal and promises of safe but secure returns some examples of these pitches include • you will have an interest in a well that cannot miss • the risks are minimal • a geologist has given the salesperson a tip • the broker or salesperson has personally invested in the venture • the promoter has “hit” on every well drilled so far • there has been a tremendous “discovery” in an adjacent field • a large reputable oil company like chevron is operating or planning to operate in the area • only a few interests remain to be sold and you should immediately send in your money in order to assure the purchase of an interest • this is a special private deal open only to a lucky chosen few investors oil gas and energy deals we are investigating cushing royalty

directory oil  gas investment fraud scams  lawsuits attorneys oil  gas investment scams with the drop in oil prices in  and  thousands of investors are realizing they have been taken advantage of in investments related to oil and gas there are two types of investment losses in oil and gas securities that are potentially recoverable through the firna arbitration process or via lawsuit unsuitable investment recommendations in oil and gas stocks bonds master limited partnerships and mutual funds negligence based unsuitable investment recommendations in oil gas and energy related companies make up a majority of the cases we’ve handled for investors for example brokers at full service brokerage firms recommended oil and gas stocks master limited partnerships and other related investments heavily to investors between  and  with the massive slide in oil prices in  and  caused by the jump in domestic oil stockpiles due to new highly efficient drilling techniques like horizontal drilling and hydraulic fracking techniques companies affiliated with the oil industries have lost substantial value resulting in devastating investment losses for many investors unfortunately many small oil and gas producers have lost a majority of their value in  and  these companies have heavy debt loads that simply couldn’t be maintained with the oil price slide dozens of master limited partnerships have declined in value in  and  the  billion masterlimitedpartnership sector is the sausage maker of the investment world buyers love the yields — now averaging about  — but many know little about how the yields are generated the bullish pitch by brokers in favor of the investments centered around the highyielding way to participate in the booming us energy infrastructure buildout unfortunately the investments while providing generous yields masked the substantial high risks of these investments many of these investments were pitched to elderly and conservative investors because of the relatively high dividends and yields that the investments paid out these losses are potentially recoverable through either finra arbitration claims against the brokerage firms whose brokers recommended the investments or lawsuits against the promoters of the investments fraud based claims the second type of oil and gas actions deal with fraud based claims oil and gas investments take many forms including limited partnership interests master limited partnerships ownership of fractional undivided interests in leases and general partnerships risk level tax consequences and investor liability vary according to the type of program drilling partnerships have always been a gamble but unfortunately many oil and gas scams have been perpetrated by bad actors in the securities industry although some of the con artists moved on to more lucrative venues since the oil boom ended in the mids many continued to linger on in the oil field and the results of their actions are being felt now fraudulent oil and gas deals are frequently structured with the limited partnership or other legal entity in one state the operation and physical presence of the field in a second state and the offerings made to prospective investors in states other than the initial two states thus there is less chance of an investor dropping by a well site or a nonexistent company headquarters such a structure also makes it difficult for law enforcement officials and victims to identify and expose the fraud our securities law firm holds financial advisors accountable brokers at major brokerage firms like linsco lpl ubs merrill lynch raymond james citgroup and stifel nicolaus also sometimes engage in an activity called “selling away” when a broker sells a customer an “investment” outside the investment products offered by the brokerage firm and outside the client’s account there may be a selling away issue these investments known as private securities often involve investments in oil and gas related limited partnerships privately held companies private placements promissory notes and other similar investments sometimes they are real investments other times they are completely bogus and used as a means for the advisor to convert client funds unfortunately unscrupulous oil promoters and stockbrokers frequently use the internet and “boiler room” offices with banks of phones manned by salespeople with little or no background in energy exploration but plenty of experience in highpressure sales their techniques include repeated unsolicited phone calls to potential investors hyping the profitability of the deal and promises of safe but secure returns some examples of these pitches include • you will have an interest in a well that cannot miss • the risks are minimal • a geologist has given the salesperson a tip • the broker or salesperson has personally invested in the venture • the promoter has “hit” on every well drilled so far • there has been a tremendous
