prospectus performance results for periods under one year are short  term and may not provide an adequate basis for evaluating the performance potential of the fund over varying market conditions or economic cycles risk considerations investors should consider the following risk factors and special considerations associated with investing in the fund which may cause you to lose money including the entire principal amount that you invest equity risk the value of the equity securities held by the fund will fall due to general market and economic conditions perceptions regarding the industries in which the issuers of securities held by the fund participate or factors relating to specific companies in which the fund invests for example an adverse event such as an unfavorable earnings report may depress the value of equity securities of an issuer held by the fund the price of common stock of an issuer may be particularly sensitive to general movements in the stock market or a drop in the stock market may depress the price of most or all of the common stocks and other equity securities held by the fund in addition common stock of an issuer in the fund’s portfolio may decline in price if the issuer fails to make anticipated dividend payments because the issuer of the security experiences a decline in its financial condition common stock is subordinated to preferred stocks bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and therefore will be subject to greater dividend risk than preferred stocks or debt instruments of such issuers in addition while broad market measures of common stocks have historically generated higher average returns than fixed income securities common stocks have also experienced significantly more volatility in those returns energy sector risk the profitability of companies in the energy sector is related to worldwide energy prices exploration and production spending such companies also are subject to risks of changes in exchange rates government regulation world events depletion of resources and economic conditions as well as market economic and political risks of the countries where energy companies are located or do business oil and gas exploration and production can be significantly affected by natural disasters oil exploration and production companies may be adversely affected by changes in exchange rates interest rates government regulation world events and economic conditions oil exploration and production companies may be at risk for environmental damage claims foreign investment risk the fund’s investments in nonus issuers may involve unique risks compared to investing in securities of us issuers including less market liquidity generally greater market volatility than us securities and less complete financial information than for us issuers in addition adverse political economic or social developments could undermine the value of the fund’s investments or prevent the fund from realizing the full value of its investments financial reporting standards for companies based in foreign markets differ from those in the united states finally the value of the currency of the country in which the fund has invested could decline relative to the value of the us dollar which may affect the value of the investment to us investors the fund will not enter into transactions to hedge against declines in the value of the fund’s assets that are denominated in a foreign currency canadian risk as the fund invests in canadian royalty trusts and stocks listed on the tsx the fund is subject to the following risks commodity exposure risk the canadian economy is very dependent on the demand for and supply and price of natural resources the canadian market is relatively concentrated in issuers involved in the production and distribution of natural resources there is a risk that any changes in these sectors could have an adverse impact on the canadian economy reliance on exports risk the canadian economy is dependent on the economies of the united states as a key trading partner reduction in spending on canadian products and services or changes in the us economy may cause an impact in the canadian economy canadian royalty trust risk investing in canadian royalty trusts is subject to the following risks lack of diversification the royalty trusts in which the fund invests are heavily invested in oil and gas potential sacrifice of growth potential growth may be sacrificed because revenue is passed on to a royalty trust’s unit holders such as the fund rather than reinvested in the business no guarantees royalty trusts generally do not guarantee minimum distributions or even return of capital if the assets underlying a royalty trust do not perform as expected the royalty trust may reduce or even eliminate distributions the declaration of such distributions generally depends upon various factors including the operating performance and financial condition of the royalty trust and general economic conditions potential for tax recharacterization or changes under amendments to the income tax act canada passed in  the “sift rules” certain trusts defined as “sift trusts” are taxable on certain income and gains on a basis similar to that which applies to a corporation with the result that tax efficiencies formerly available in respect of an investment in the trust may cease to be available a royalty trust may be a sift trust in addition as a result of the sift rules some trusts may undertake reorganization transactions the costs of which may affect the return earned on an investment in the trust after any such conversion tax efficiencies that were formerly available in respect of an investment in the trust may cease to be available accordingly the sift rules have had and may continue to have an effect on the trading price of investments in royalty trusts and consequently could impact the value of shares of the fund us economic risk the canadian economy may be significantly affected by the us economy given that the united states is canada’s largest trading partner and foreign investor since the implementation of the north american free trade agreement nafta in  total twoway merchandise trade between the united states and canada has more than doubled to further this relationship all three nafta countries entered into the security and prosperity partnership of north america in march  which addressed economic and security related issues the new agreement may further affect canada’s dependency on the us economy structural risk political risk in addition past periodic demands by the province of quebec for sovereignty have significantly affected equity valuations and foreign currency movements in the canadian market in addition the funds are subject to small and mediumsized company risk noncorrelation risk passive management risk issuerspecific

bonds” frequently asked questions what is the adviser’s investment philosophy and process the adviser believes that rigorous credit research deep industry expertise and valuation conviction are critical to identifying superior investment opportunities and managing downside risk the adviser believes that its broad relationships with management teams financial sponsors and capital markets professionals creates opportunities for unique investment opportunities and its deep understanding of underfollowed companies and complex capital structures creates opportunities to drive better investment outcomes the adviser’s investment process is structured around its core beliefs properly pricing risk and assessing value is a complex process therefore the adviser employs extensive resources to analyze companies and capital structures in their entirety and regularly meets with a company’s competitors suppliers and customers in order to get a complete view of the company and its position within its industry portfolios should be driven by best investment opportunities not a benchmark therefore the adviser sources investment opportunities from a broad universe and constructs portfolios that are less exposed to the largest issuers in the benchmark underfollowed companies can be compelling investment opportunities therefore the adviser seeks to utilize guggenheim partners’ extensive corporate credit platform to uncover value in companies that are often overlooked by other investors legal nuances can determine an investment’s success or failure therefore the adviser’s large inhouse legal team plays an active role in covenant analysis and reviewing credit agreements proactive relative value decisions contribute to outperformance therefore the adviser seeks to position the fund’s portfolio to reflect guggenheim partners’ macro views and relative value analysis monitors portfolio allocations on an ongoing basis and maintains individual portfolio holdings in line with original research conclusions the adviser operates on the thesis that a disciplined researchintensive process can uncover compelling investment opportunities by analyzing a broad set of opportunities up and down the capital structure as well as overlaying macroeconomic research the adviser gains better insight into the dynamics of the business enterprise value and where it may seek to deliver the best packages of risk and return the adviser’s rigorous research process is described below sourcing the depth of the adviser’s industry coverage combined with the size and scope of its capital markets footprint relationships with deal sponsors banks and corporate entities allows the adviser to source transactions from multiple sources rigorous due diligence the adviser distinguishes itself by its industry expertise and valuation insights which enable the adviser to identify relative value and investment opportunities across the entire capital structure of a borrower the

facilities and discussions with customers suppliers competitors and industry experts the adviser’s extensive financial analysis focuses on understanding the industry and company fundamentals

investments based in both new york and houston the team has a long history of energy investing across the credit spectrum including both syndicated and private transactions transaction structuring and execution in addition to detailed due diligence the adviser believes that protecting capital through structuring transactions is equally important the adviser’s investment team includes a dedicated

investment professionals take an active approach to monitoring investments including continuous financial review industry analysis and regular discussions with management and industry participants the adviser’s investment team takes an investigative approach to all news announcements and credit developments to achieve a detailed reporting and monitoring process when the adviser’s investment analysts receive new financial information or news on a company they update financial models and projections and assess how the investment is performing compared to the thesis at the time the original investment was made in addition to company specific news and reporting members of the investment team continuously monitor the overall industry in which they focus to be aware of trends and how they may affect investments within the fund’s portfolio global macroeconomic team the adviser’s global macroeconomic team provides a top down view on the commodity price environment and outlook while the investment team performs bottomsup fundamental credit analysis on each potential investment the investment team overlays the macroeconomic teams views on top of their analysis this allows the investment team to get the most wholesome picture of the economic and credit specific landscape   the adviser divides the energy sector into five distinct subsectors which include upstream exploration and production energy services provide equipment and services to energy companies midstream pipeline companies downstream refiners and power and chemical produce and distribute to end users the adviser believes that each of these subsectors exhibits different levels of energy price sensitivity in addition to considering the unique dynamics of each subsector it is also important to understand each company’s cash liquidity commodity exposures basin exposures and capital spending requirements when evaluating their ability to service their debt the adviser applies its macroeconomic and credit expertise to the unique characteristics of the energy sector subsectors and individual companies in doing so the investment team seeks to identify those high yielding debt instruments that it believes

factors and special considerations associated with investing in the fund an investment in the fund is subject to investment risk including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest no operating history the fund is a newlyorganized nondiversified closedend management investment company with no operating history as a result prospective investors have no track record or history on which to base their investment decision not a complete investment program an investment in the common shares of the fund should not be considered a complete investment program the fund is intended for longterm investors the fund is not meant to provide a vehicle for those who wish to play shortterm swings in the market each common shareholder should take into account the fund’s investment objectives as well as the common shareholder’s other investments when considering an investment in the fund before making an investment decision a prospective investor should consider i the suitability of this investment with respect to his or her investment objectives and personal situation and ii factors such as his or her personal net worth income age risk tolerance and liquidity needs investment and market risk an investment in the common shares is subject to investment risk including the possible loss of the entire principal amount that you invest an investment in the common shares represents an indirect investment in the securities owned by the fund the value of the securities owned by the fund may fluctuate sometimes rapidly and unpredictably which will affect the net asset value and may affect the market price of the common shares the value of securities owned by the fund may decline due to general market conditions that are not specifically related to a particular issuer such as real or perceived economic conditions changes in interest or currency rates or changes in investor sentiment or market outlook generally at any point in time your common shares may be worth less than your original investment including the reinvestment of fund dividends and distributions nonlisted closedend fund risk the fund is designed for longterm investors who are prepared to hold the common shares of the fund until the end of the fund’s term and not as a trading vehicle an investment in the common shares unlike an investment in a traditional listed closedend fund should be considered illiquid the common shares are appropriate only for investors who are seeking an investment in less liquid portfolio investments within an illiquid fund an investment in common shares is not suitable for investors who need access to the money they invest unlike shares of openend funds commonly known as mutual funds which generally are redeemable on a daily basis the common shares will not be redeemable at an investor’s option unlike traditional listed closedend funds the fund does not intend to list the common shares for trading on any securities exchange and the fund does not expect any secondary market to develop for the common shares in the foreseeable future the net asset value of the common shares may be volatile and the fund’s use of leverage will increase this volatility as the common shares are not traded investors may not be able to dispose of their investment in the fund no matter how poorly the fund performs shareholder liquidity event risk the fund intends to complete a shareholder liquidity event on or before the liquidity event date july   if the board of trustees determines that under then current market conditions it is in the best interests of the fund to do so the fund may extend the liquidity event date for one year to july   without a shareholder vote the fund’s investment objectives and policies are not designed to seek to return to investors that purchase common shares in this offering their initial investment on the liquidity event date or any other date  tender offer risk beginning  months after the completion of the offering the fund intends but is not obligated to conduct quarterly tender offers for up to  of the common shares then outstanding in the sole discretion of the board of trustees in a tender offer the fund will offer to repurchase common shares at the fund’s net asset value per common share or a percentage of the fund’s net asset value per common share on the last day of the offer in any given quarter the fund may choose not to conduct a tender offer or may choose to conduct a tender offer for less than  of the common shares then outstanding accordingly there may be periods during which no tender offer is made and it is possible that no tender offers will be conducted during the term of the fund if a tender offer is not made common shareholders may not be able to sell their common shares as it is unlikely that a secondary market for the common shares will develop or if a secondary market does develop common shareholders may be able to sell their common shares only at substantial discounts from net asset value if the fund does conduct tender offers it may be required to sell its more liquid higher quality portfolio securities to purchase common shares that are tendered which may increase risks for remaining common shareholders and increase fund expenses as a percentage of net assets in addition while the fund is permitted to borrow money to finance the repurchase of common shares pursuant to tender offers there can be no assurance that the fund will be able to obtain such financing if it attempts to do so moreover if the fund’s portfolio does not provide adequate liquidity to fund tender offers the fund may extend the last day of any tender offer or choose to pay tendering common shareholders with a promissory note which will cause the common shareholders to be paid at a later date than if the tender offer were not extended or if the promissory note were not issued bestefforts offering risk this offering is being made on a best efforts basis there is no minimum number of common shares by all common shareholders in aggregate required to be sold there is no assurance that the fund will raise sufficient proceeds in this offering to allow the fund to purchase a portfolio of investments allocated in accordance with the adviser’s investment strategy the distributor is an affiliate of the fund as a result its due diligence review and investigation of the fund and this prospectus cannot be considered to be an independent review management risk the fund is subject to management risk because it has an actively managed portfolio the adviser will apply investment techniques and risk analysis in making investment decisions for the fund but there can be no guarantee that these will produce the desired results income risk the income investors receive from the fund is based in part on the interest it earns from its investments which can vary widely over the short and longterm if prevailing market interest rates drop investors’ income from the fund could drop as well the fund’s income could also be affected adversely when prevailing shortterm interest rates increase and the fund is utilizing financial leverage concentration risk because the fund’s investments are focused in companies operating in the energy sector of the economy the fund will be more susceptible to risks associated with the energy sector and to adverse economic environmental or regulatory developments affecting the energy sector a downturn in the energy sector will have a larger impact on the fund than on an investment company that does not concentrate in such sector commodity price risk energy companies may be affected by fluctuations in the prices of energy commodities fluctuations in energy commodity prices may be influenced by changes in general economic conditions or political circumstances especially of key energy producing and consuming countries market conditions and uncertainty changes in supply of and consumer demand for electricity gas or other commodities weather patterns domestic production levels volume of imports the price and availability of alternative electric generation options which may be effected by government subsidies tax credits or other support energy conservation competitive position of electricity ethanolbiodiesel oil gas or coal as a source of energy as compared with other energy sources domestic and foreign governmental regulation international politics policies of the organization of petroleum exporting countries “opec” taxation tariffs the availability and costs of local intrastate and interstate transportation methods among others the industrywide and or local refining transportation or processing capacity new technologies catastrophic events or terrorist acts speculation and other factors that are beyond the control of the fund and the adviser supply and demand risk companies operating in the energy sector may be impacted by the levels of supply and demand for energy commodities the volume of production of energy commodities and the volume of energy commodities available for transportation storage processing or distribution could be affected by a variety of factors energy sector dislocation risk recently oil prices declined significantly and experienced significant volatility this may adversely impact companies operating in the energy sector if the prices for commodities experience a substantial downturn or remain relatively weak for the medium to long term the ability of businesses whose financial performance depends in part on commodity prices to grow or maintain revenues in future years may be adversely affected and at certain long term price levels for a given commodity extractive operations with respect to that commodity may not be economically viable there can be no assurance as to the duration of any perceived market dislocation regulatory risk the energy sector is highly regulated by us and nonus federal state and local laws and regulations energy companies are subject to significant regulation of nearly every aspect of their operations stricter laws or regulations or stricter enforcement policies with respect to existing regulations would likely increase the costs of regulatory compliance and could have an adverse effect on the financial performance of energy companies such regulation can change rapidly or over time in both scope and intensity environmental risk there is an inherent risk that energy companies may incur environmental costs and liabilities due to the nature of their businesses and the substances they handle energy companies could be subject to substantial liabilities for environmental cleanup and restoration costs claims made by neighboring landowners and other third parties for personal injury and property damage and fines or penalties for related violations of environmental laws or regulations fracturing risk certain energy companies may require the use of hydraulic fracturing to produce commercial quantities of oil and natural gas from reservoirs in which they operate changes in laws or government regulations regarding hydraulic fracturing could increase certain energy companies’ costs of doing business limit the areas in which such companies can operate and reduce oil and natural gas production by such companies any such developments could adversely impact companies that provide fracturing services and materials depletion risk energy companies engaged in the exploration development management or production of energy commodities face the risk that commodity reserves are depleted over time such companies seek to increase their reserves through expansion of their current businesses acquisitions further development of their existing sources of energy commodities exploration of new sources of energy commodities or by entering into longterm contracts for additional reserves however there are risks associated with each of these potential strategies acquisition risk certain energy companies may depend on the ability of to make acquisitions the ability of such companies to make future acquisitions is dependent on their ability to identify suitable targets negotiate favorable purchase contracts obtain acceptable financing and outbid competing potential acquirers to the extent that such companies are unable to make future acquisitions or such future acquisitions fail to have the desired impact their growth will be limited interest rate risk rising interest rates could increase the costs of capital thereby increasing operating costs and reducing the ability of energy companies to carry out acquisitions or expansions in a costeffective manner weather risk weather plays a role in the seasonality of some energy companies’ cash flows no amount of preparation can protect an energy company from the unpredictability of the weather extreme weather conditions or possible climate change technology risk energy companies may be subject to technology risks including the risk of mechanical breakdown spare parts shortages failure to perform according to design specifications and other unanticipated events which adversely affect operations some energy companies are focused on developing new technologies and are strongly influenced by technological changes these companies may bear high research and development costs which can limit their ability to maintain operations during periods of organizational growth or instability infrastructure risk energy companies may rely heavily on infrastructure assets for the storage and transportation of energy and power outputs infrastructure intensive energy companies may be susceptible to a variety of factors that may adversely affect their business and operations including high interest costs in connection with capital construction programs high leverage costs associated with environmental and other regulations surplus capacity costs and reduced investment in public and private infrastructure projects power purchase agreement risk certain energy companies may enter into power purchase agreements “ppas” there can be no assurance that any or all of the power purchasers will fulfill their obligations under their ppas or that a power purchaser will not become bankrupt or that upon any such bankruptcy its obligations under its respective ppa will not be rejected by a bankruptcy trustee land title risk certain energy companies may require large areas of land to install and operate their equipment and associated infrastructure the rights to use the necessary land may be obtained through freehold title easements leases and other rights of use different jurisdictions adopt different systems of land title and in some jurisdictions it may not be possible to ascertain definitively who has the legal right to enter into land tenure arrangements independent contractors risk independent contractors are typically used in operations in the energy industry to perform various operational tasks in periods of high commodity prices demand for such contractors may exceed supply resulting in increased costs or lack of availability of key contractors since an energy company may not have the same control over independent contractors as they may have over their own employees there is a risk that such contractors will not operate in accordance with its own safety standards or other policies insurance risk certain losses of a catastrophic nature such as wars natural disasters terrorist attacks or other similar events may be either uninsurable or insurable at such high rates that to maintain such coverage would cause an adverse impact on the energy companies’ operations or profitability utilities companies risk a variety of factors may adversely affect the business or operations of utilities including high interest costs in connection with capital construction and improvement programs governmental regulation of rates charged to customers costs associated with compliance with and changes in environmental and other regulations effects of economic slowdowns and surplus capacity increased competition from other providers of utilities services inexperience with and potential losses resulting from a developing deregulatory environment costs associated with reduced availability of certain types of fuel the effects of energy conservation policies effects of a national energy policy technological innovations potential impact of terrorist activities the impact of natural or manmade disasters regulation by various governmental authorities including the imposition of special tariffs and changes in tax laws regulatory policies and accounting standards federal power act natural gas act state regulations risk companies owning or operating electric generation and transmission assets may be subject to regulatory requirements under the federal power act other federal utility statutes state and local public utility laws regulatory approvals risk an energy company could be materially and adversely affected as a result of statutory or regulatory changes or judicial or administrative interpretations of existing laws and regulations that impose more comprehensive or stringent requirements on such company there can be no assurance that an energy company will be able i to obtain all required regulatory approvals that it does not yet have or that it may require in the future ii to obtain any necessary modifications to existing regulatory approvals or iii to maintain required regulatory approvals siting challenges risk energy and energyrelated infrastructure projects may be subject to siting requirements siting of energy projects is also frequently subject to regulation by applicable state county and local authorities proposals to site an energy project may be challenged by a number of parties including special interest groups based on alleged security concerns disturbances to natural habitats for wildlife and adverse aesthetic impacts tax risk it is possible that new us or nonus taxes on the energy industry could be implemented andor us or nonus tax benefits could be eliminated or reduced reducing the profitability of energy companies and their available cash flow certain federal income tax deductions currently available with respect to oil and natural gas exploration and development may be eliminated as a result of future legislation political legal and commercial instability risk the fund may invest globally and may invest in businesses that have operations in regions with varying degrees of political legal and commercial stability political civil and social pressures may result in administrative change policy reform andor changes in law or governmental regulations which in turn can result in expropriation or nationalization of the investments of a company in which the fund invests andor adversely affect the value or liquidity of such company’s investments or such company’s underlying business sovereign risk the right of certain energy companies to extract mineral resources generate deliver or sell energy or related services and equipment may be granted by or derive from approval by governmental entities and are subject to special risks including the risk that the relevant governmental entity will exercise sovereign rights and take actions contrary to the rights of company there can be no assurance that the relevant governmental entity will not legislate impose regulations or change applicable laws or act contrary to the law in a way that would materially and adversely affect the business of any energy company in which the fund invests strategic asset risk energy companies may control significant strategic assets strategic assets are assets that have a national or regional profile and may have monopolistic characteristics given the national or regional profile andor their irreplaceable nature strategic assets may constitute a higher risk target for terrorist acts or adverse political actions hedging policies and commodities price risk energy companies may employ hedging techniques designed to reduce currency commodity price interest rate exposure or other investment risks or as a means of structuring an investment in a company in light of applicable legal tax or regulatory considerations if an energy company engages in any such hedging activities it may be exposed to creditrelated losses in the event of nonperformance by counterparties to the physical or financial instruments additionally if commodity prices interest rates or exchange rates increase above or decrease below those levels specified in any future hedging agreements such hedging arrangements may prevent an energy company from realizing the full benefit of such increases or decreases cyclical industry risk the energy industry is cyclical and from time to time may experience a shortage of drilling rigs equipment supplies or qualified personnel or due to significant demand such services may not be available on commercially reasonable terms catastrophic event risk energy companies are subject to many dangers inherent in the production exploration management transportation processing and distribution of natural gas natural gas liquids crude oil refined petroleum and petroleum products and other hydrocarbons these dangers include leaks fires explosions damage to facilities and equipment resulting from natural disasters inadvertent damage to facilities and equipment and terrorist acts any occurrence of such catastrophic events could bring about a limitation suspension or discontinuation of the operations of energy companies below investment grade securities risk the fund may invest without limitation in securities of below investment grade quality which are commonly referred to as “highyield securities” or “junk bonds” loans in which the fund intends to invest are generally expected to be of below investmentgrade quality investment in securities of below investment grade quality involves substantial risk of loss securities of below investment grade quality are considered predominantly speculative with respect to the issuer’s capacity to pay interest and repay principal when due and therefore involve a greater risk of default or decline in market value due to adverse economic and issuerspecific developments issuers of below investment grade securities are not perceived to be as strong financially as those with higher credit ratings these issuers are more vulnerable to financial setbacks and recession than more creditworthy issuers which may impair their ability to make interest and principal payments securities of below investment grade quality display increased price sensitivity to changing interest rates and to a deteriorating economic environment the market values for securities of below investment grade quality tend to be more volatile and such securities tend to be less liquid than investment grade debt securities to the extent that a secondary market does exist for certain below investment grade securities the market for them may be subject to irregular trading activity wide bidask spreads and extended trade settlement periods because of the substantial risks associated with investments in below investment grade securities you could have an increased risk of losing money on your investment in common shares both in the shortterm and the longterm to the extent that the fund invests in securities that have not been rated by a rating agency the fund’s ability to achieve its investment objectives will be more dependent on the adviser’s credit analysis than would be the case when the fund invests in rated securities issuer risk the value of securities in which the fund invests may decline for a number of reasons which directly relate to the issuer such as management performance financial leverage reduced demand for the issuer’s goods and services historical and projected earnings and the value of its assets credit risk credit risk is the risk that one or more debt obligations in the fund’s portfolio will decline in price or fail to pay interest or principal when due because the issuer of the obligation experiences a decline in its financial status interest rate risk interest rate risk is the risk that fixedincome securities will decline in value because of changes in market interest rates when market interest rates rise the market value of fixed income securities generally will fall these risks may be greater in the current market environment because interest rates are near historically low levels the prices of longerterm securities fluctuate more than prices of shorterterm securities as interest rates change the fund’s use of financial leverage will tend to increase common share interest rate risk the fund may utilize certain strategies including taking positions in futures or interest rate swaps for the purpose of reducing the interest rate sensitivity of fixed income securities held by the fund and decreasing the fund’s exposure to interest rate risk the fund is not required to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk and may choose not to do so in addition there is no assurance that any attempts by the fund to reduce interest rate risk will be successful or that any hedges that the fund may establish will perfectly correlate with movements in interest rates reinvestment risk reinvestment risk is the risk that income from the fund’s portfolio will decline if the fund invests the proceeds from matured traded or called securities at market interest rates that are below the portfolio’s current earnings rate a decline in income could affect the common shares’ market price or the overall return of the fund prepayment risk during periods of declining interest rates borrowers may exercise their option to prepay principal earlier than scheduled forcing the fund to reinvest in lower yielding securities valuation risk because the secondary markets for certain investments may be limited they may be difficult to value where market quotations are not readily available or deemed unreliable the fund will value such securities in accordance with fair value procedures adopted by the board of trustees valuation of illiquid securities may be more difficult may require more research and may involve more uncertainty than for more liquid investments in addition elements of judgment may play a greater role in valuation in such cases than for investments with a more active secondary market because there is less reliable objective data available a security that is fair valued by the fund may be valued at a price higher or lower than the value determined by other funds using their own fair valuation procedures and such differences may be material prices obtained by the fund upon the sale of such securities may not equal the value at which the fund carried the investment on its books which would adversely affect the net asset value of the fund and such differences could be material corporate bond risk the market value of a corporate bond may be affected by factors directly related to the issuer such as investors’ perceptions of the creditworthiness of the issuer the issuer’s financial performance perceptions of the issuer in the market place performance of management of the issuer the issuer’s capital structure and use of financial leverage and demand for the issuer’s goods and services there is a risk that the issuers of corporate bonds may not be able to meet their obligations on interest or principal payments at the time called for by an instrument corporate bonds of below investment grade quality are often high risk and have speculative characteristics and may be particularly susceptible to adverse issuerspecific developments senior loans risk the fund may invest in senior loans made to corporations and other nongovernmental entities and issuers a “borrower” senior loans typically hold the most senior position in the capital structure of a business entity are typically secured with specific collateral and typically have a claim on the assets andor stock of the borrower that is senior to that held by subordinated debt holders and stockholders of the borrower senior loans in which the fund will invest are generally rated below investment grade or unrated but believed by the adviser to be of below investment grade quality and are considered speculative because of the credit risk of their issuers the risks associated with such senior loans are similar to the risks of other lower grade securities although senior loans are typically senior and secured in contrast to subordinated and unsecured debt securities senior loans’ higher standing has historically resulted in generally higher recoveries in the event of a corporate reorganization although the senior loans in which the fund will invest generally will be secured by specific collateral there can be no assurance that liquidation of such collateral would satisfy the borrower’s obligation in the event of nonpayment of scheduled interest or principal or that such collateral could be readily liquidated in the event of the bankruptcy of a borrower the fund could experience delays or limitations with respect to its ability to realize the benefits of the collateral securing a senior loan in addition because their interest payments are adjusted for changes in shortterm interest rates investments in senior loans generally have less interest rate risk than other lower grade securities which may have fixed interest rates second lien loans subordinated secured loans unsecured loans risk second lien loans subordinated secured loans and unsecured loans risk generally are subject to similar risks as those associated with investment in senior loans and below investment grade securities however such loans may rank lower in right of payment than any outstanding loans or other debt instruments with higher priority of the borrower and therefore are subject to additional risk that the cash flow of the borrower and any property securing the loan may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments and repayment of principal in the event of default or bankruptcy after giving effect to the higher ranking secured obligations of the borrower such loans are expected to have greater price volatility than loans with higher priority and may be less liquid loan participations and assignments risk the fund may acquire senior loan assignments or participations the purchaser of an assignment typically succeeds to all the rights and obligations of the assigning institution and becomes a lender under the credit agreement with respect to the debt obligation however the purchaser’s rights can be more restricted than those of the assigning institution a participation typically results in a contractual relationship only with the institution participating out the interest not with the borrower in purchasing participations the fund generally will have no right to enforce compliance by the borrower with the terms of the loan agreement against the borrower and the fund may not directly benefit from the collateral supporting the debt obligation in which it has purchased the participation as a result the fund will be exposed to the credit risk of both the borrower and the institution selling the participation mezzanine investments risk the fund may invest in certain lower grade securities known as “mezzanine investments” which are subordinated debt securities that are generally issued in private placements in connection with an equity security eg with attached warrants or may be convertible into equity securities mezzanine investments are generally subject to similar risks associated with investment in senior loans second lien loans and other below investment grade securities however mezzanine investments may rank lower in right of payment than any outstanding senior loans second lien loans and other debt instruments with higher priority of the borrower or may be unsecured ie not backed by a security interest in any specific collateral and are subject to the additional risk that the cash flow of the borrower and available assets may be insufficient to meet scheduled payments and repayment of principal after giving effect to any higher ranking obligations of the borrower mezzanine investments are expected to have greater price volatility and exposure to losses upon default than senior loans and second lien loans and may be less liquid preferred securities risk in addition to equity securities risk credit risk and below investment grade securities risk with respect to preferred securities of below investment grade quality there are special risks associated with investing in preferred securities deferral subordination limited voting rights special redemption rights and risks associated with new types of securities convertible securities risk the fund may invest in convertible securities which consist of bonds debentures notes preferred stocks and other securities that entitle the holder to acquire common stock or other equity securities of the same or a different issuer convertible securities generally offer lower interest or dividend yields than non convertible securities of similar quality the market values of convertible securities tend to decline as interest rates increase and conversely to increase as interest rates decline convertible securities also tend to reflect the market price of the underlying stock in varying degrees depending on the relationship of such market price to the conversion price in the terms of the convertible security convertible securities rank senior to common stock in an issuer’s capital structure and consequently entail less risk than the issuer’s common stock distressed and defaulted securities risk investments in the securities of financially distressed issuers involve substantial risks these securities may present a substantial risk of default or may be in default at the time of investment the fund may incur additional expenses to the extent it is required to seek recovery upon a default in the payment of principal or interest on its portfolio holdings in any reorganization or liquidation proceeding relating to a portfolio company the fund may lose its entire investment or may be required to accept cash or securities with a value less than its original investment among the risks inherent in investments in a troubled entity is the fact that it frequently may be difficult to obtain information as to the true financial condition of such issuer the adviser’s judgment about the credit quality of the issuer and the relative value and liquidity of its securities may prove to be wrong smallcap and midcap company risk certain of the companies in which the fund may invest may have small or mediumsized market capitalizations “smallcap” and “midcap” companies respectively investing in the securities of smallcap or midcap companies presents some particular investment risks these companies may have limited product lines and markets as well as shorter operating histories less experienced management and more limited financial resources than larger companies and may be more vulnerable to adverse general market or economic developments stocks of these companies may be less liquid than those of larger companies and may experience greater price fluctuations than larger companies in addition smallcap or midcap company securities may not be widely followed by investors which may result in reduced demand middle market company risk middle market issuers may have limited financial resources and may be unable to meet their obligations under their debt securities that the fund may hold middle market issuers typically have shorter operating histories narrower product lines limited distribution channels and smaller market shares than larger businesses which tend to render them more vulnerable to competitors’ actions and changing market conditions as well as general economic downturns there is generally little public information about privately held middle market issuers privately held middle market issuers and their financial information generally are not subject to the reporting requirements and other regulations that govern public companies middle market issuers are more likely to depend on the management talents and efforts of a small group of persons middle market issuers generally have less predictable operating results middle market issuers may have difficulty accessing the capital markets to meet future capital needs which may limit their ability to grow or to repay their outstanding indebtedness upon maturity foreign securities risk the fund may invest without limitation in securities of nonus issuers including issuers in emerging markets investing in foreign issuers may involve certain risks not typically associated with investing in securities of us issuers due to increased exposure to foreign economic political and legal developments including favorable or unfavorable changes in currency exchange rates exchange control regulations including currency blockage expropriation or nationalization of assets imposition of withholding taxes on payments and possible difficulty in obtaining and enforcing judgments against foreign entities furthermore issuers of foreign securities and obligations are subject to different often less comprehensive accounting reporting and disclosure requirements than domestic issuers the securities and obligations of some foreign companies and foreign markets are less liquid and at times more volatile than comparable us securities obligations and markets these risks may be more pronounced to the extent that the fund invests a significant amount of its assets in companies located in one country or geographic region in which case the fund may be more exposed to regional economic risks and to the extent that the fund invests in securities of issuers in emerging markets emerging markets risk investments in securities the issuers of which are located in countries considered to be emerging markets are subject to heightened risks relative to foreign investing generally and are considered speculative investing in emerging markets involves certain heightened risks associated with smaller market capitalization of securities markets which may suffer periods of relative illiquidity significant price volatility restrictions on foreign investment and potential restrictions on repatriation of investment income and capital foreign currency risk the fund’s investment performance may be negatively affected by a devaluation of a currency in which the fund’s investments are denominated or quoted further the fund’s investment performance may be significantly affected either positively or negatively by currency exchange rates because the us dollar value of securities denominated or quoted in another currency will increase or decrease in response to changes in the value of such currency in relation to the us dollar portfolio liquidity risk the fund may invest without limitation in unregistered securities restricted securities and securities for which there is no readily available trading market or which are otherwise illiquid the fund may invest in privately issued securities of both public and private companies which may be illiquid the fund may acquire its investments directly from the issuer in privately negotiated transactions substantially all of these securities may be subject to legal and other restrictions on resale or may otherwise be less liquid than publicly traded securities the fund may not be able to readily dispose of illiquid securities and obligations at prices that approximate those at which the fund could sell such securities and obligations if they were more widely traded and as a result of such illiquidity the fund may have to sell other investments or engage in borrowing transactions if necessary to raise cash to meet its obligations the fund may face other restrictions on its ability to liquidate an investment to the extent that the adviser or the fund has material nonpublic information regarding the issuer in addition market credit and other events may affect the prices of securities with limited liquidity held by the fund to a greater extent than such events affect more liquid securities thereby adversely affecting the fund’s net asset value and ability to make distributions financial leverage risk the fund initially expects to employ financial leverage through the issuance of indebtedness andor the use of reverse repurchase agreements the adviser anticipates that the use of financial leverage may result in higher income to common shareholders over time however there can be no assurance that the adviser’s expectations will be realized or that a leveraging strategy will be successful in any particular time period use of financial leverage creates an opportunity for increased income and capital appreciation but at the same time creates special risks financial leverage is a speculative technique that exposes the fund to greater risk and increased costs than if it were not implemented there can be no assurance that a leveraging strategy will be utilized or will be successful the use of financial leverage by the fund will cause the net asset value of the common shares to fluctuate significantly in response to changes in interest rates and other economic indicators as a result the net asset value and dividend rate of the common shares of the fund is likely to be more volatile than those of a closedend management investment company that is not exposed to financial leverage in a declining market the use of financial leverage may result in a greater decline in the net asset value of the common shares than if the fund were not leveraged financial leverage will increase operating costs which may reduce total return the fund will have to pay interest on its indebtedness if any which may reduce the fund’s return this interest expense may be greater than the fund’s return on the underlying investment which would negatively affect the performance of the fund increases in interest rates that the fund must pay on its indebtedness will increase the cost of financial leverage and may reduce the return to common shareholders this risk may be greater in the current market environment because interest rates are near historically low levels during the time in which the fund is utilizing financial leverage the amount of the fees paid to the adviser for investment advisory services will be higher than if the fund did not utilize financial leverage because the fees paid will be calculated based on the fund’s managed assets including proceeds of financial leverage this may create a conflict of interest between the adviser on the one hand and the common shareholders on the other hand as holders of indebtedness preferred shares or other forms of financial leverage do not bear the investment advisory fee rather common shareholders bear the portion of the investment advisory fee attributable to the assets purchased with the proceeds of financial leverage which means that common shareholders effectively bear the entire advisory fee in order to manage this conflict of interest the board of trustees will receive regular reports from the adviser regarding the fund’s use of financial leverage and the effect of financial leverage on the management of the fund’s portfolio and the performance of the fund nondiversification risk the fund is a nondiversified investment company under the  act a fund classified as nondiversified under the  act can invest a greater portion of its assets in obligations of a single issuer than a “diversified” fund an investment in the fund may present greater risk to an investor than an investment in a diversified fund because changes in the financial condition or market assessment of a single issuer or small number of issuers may cause greater fluctuations in the value of the common shares or have a greater impact on the fund’s returns inflationdeflation risk inflation risk is the risk that the value of assets or income from investments will be worth less in the future as inflation decreases the value of money as inflation increases the real value of the common shares and distributions can decline in addition during any periods of rising inflation the dividend rates or borrowing costs associated with the fund’s use of financial leverage would likely increase which would tend to further reduce returns to common shareholders inflation risk may be mitigated to some degree by the fund’s investments in floating rate investments deflation risk is the risk that prices throughout the economy decline over time— the opposite of inflation deflation may have an adverse effect on the creditworthiness of issuers and may make issuer default more likely which may result in a decline in the value of the fund’s portfolio common equity securities risk common equity securities prices fluctuate for a number of reasons including changes in investors’ perceptions of the financial condition of an issuer the general condition of the relevant stock market and broader domestic and international political and economic events they may also decline due to factors which affect a particular industry or industries such as labor shortages or increased production costs and competitive conditions within an industry the prices of common equity securities are also sensitive to general movements in the stock market so a drop in the stock market may depress the prices of common stocks and other equity securities to which the fund has exposure common equity securities in which the fund may invest are structurally subordinated to preferred stock bonds and other debt instruments in a company’s capital structure in terms of priority to corporate income and are therefore inherently more risky than preferred stock or debt instruments of such issuers dividends on common equity securities which the fund may hold are not fixed but are declared at the discretion of an issuer’s board of directors mlp risk an investment in mlp units involves some risks that differ from an investment in the common stock of a corporation as compared to common stockholders of a corporation holders of mlp units have more limited control and limited rights to vote on matters affecting the partnership in addition there are certain tax risks associated with an investment in mlp units and conflicts of interest may exist between common unit holders and the general partner including those arising from incentive distribution payments a portion of the benefit the fund derives from its investment in equity securities of mlps is a result of mlps generally being treated as partnerships for us federal income tax purposes partnerships do not pay us federal income tax at the partnership level a change in current tax law or a change in the business of a given mlp could result in an mlp being treated as a corporation for us federal income tax purposes which would result in such mlp being required to pay us federal income tax on its taxable income to the extent that the fund invests in the equity securities of an mlp the fund will be a partner in such mlp accordingly the fund will be required to include in its taxable income the fund’s allocable share of the income gains losses deductions and credits recognized by each such mlp regardless of whether the mlp distributes cash to the fund privately issued securities risk the fund may invest in privately issued securities of both public and private companies privately issued securities have additional risk considerations than investments in comparable public investments whenever the fund invests in companies that do not publicly report financial and other material information it assumes a greater degree of investment risk and reliance upon the adviser’s ability to obtain and evaluate applicable information concerning such companies’ creditworthiness and other investment considerations certain privately issued securities may be illiquid if there is no readily available trading market for privately issued securities the fund may not be able to readily dispose of such investments at prices that approximate those at which the fund could sell them if they were more widely traded privately issued securities are also more difficult to value privately issued debt securities are often of below investment grade quality frequently are unrated and present many of the same risks as investing in below investment grade public debt securities other investment companies risk investments in other investment companies present certain special considerations and risks not present in making direct investments in securities in which the fund may invest investments in other investment companies involve operating expenses and fees that are in addition to the expenses and fees borne by the fund such expenses and fees attributable to the fund’s investments in other investment companies are borne indirectly by common shareholders accordingly investment in such entities involves expense and fee layering investments in other investment companies may expose the fund to an additional layer of financial leverage to the extent management fees of other investment companies are based on total gross assets it may create an incentive for such entities’ managers to employ financial leverage thereby adding additional expense and increasing volatility and risk structured finance investments risk holders of structured finance securities bear risks of the underlying investments index or reference obligation and are subject to counterparty risk the fund may have the right to receive payments only from the issuer of the structured finance security and generally does not have direct rights against the issuer or the entity that sold the assets to be securitized while certain structured finance investments enable the investor to acquire interests in a pool of securities without the brokerage and other expenses associated with directly holding the same securities investors in structured finance securities generally pay their share of the structured finance security issuer’s administrative and other expenses the prices of indices and securities underlying structured finance securities and therefore the prices of structured finance securities will be influenced by and will rise and fall in response to the same types of political and economic events that affect issuers of securities and capital markets generally if the issuer of a structured finance security uses shorter term financing to purchase longer term securities the issuer may be forced to sell its securities at below market prices if it experiences difficulty in obtaining shortterm financing which may adversely affect the value of the structured finance securities owned by the fund certain structured finance securities may be thinly traded or have a limited trading market the fund may invest in structured finance securities collateralized by low grade or defaulted loans or securities investments in such structured finance securities are subject to the risks associated with below investment grade securities such securities are characterized by high risk it is likely that an economic recession could severely disrupt the market for such securities and may have an adverse impact on the value of such securities the fund may invest in senior and subordinated classes issued by structured finance vehicles the payment of cash flows from the underlying assets to senior classes take precedence over those of subordinated classes and therefore subordinated classes are subject to greater risk furthermore the leveraged nature of subordinated classes may magnify the adverse impact on such class of changes in the value of the assets changes in the distributions on the assets defaults and recoveries on the assets capital gains and losses on the assets prepayment on assets and availability price and interest rates of assets structured finance securities are typically privately offered and sold and thus are not registered under the securities laws as a result investments in structured finance securities may be characterized by the fund as illiquid securities however an active dealer market may exist which would allow such securities to be considered liquid in some circumstances derivatives transactions risk the fund may engage in various derivatives transactions for hedging and risk management purposes to facilitate portfolio management and to earn income or enhance total return the use of derivatives transactions to earn income or enhance total return may be particularly speculative derivatives transactions involve risks there may be imperfect correlation between the value of derivative instruments and the underlying assets derivatives transactions may be subject to risks associated with the possible default of the other party to the transaction derivative instruments may be illiquid certain derivatives transactions may have economic characteristics similar to leverage in that relatively small market movements may result in large changes in the value of an investment certain derivatives transactions that involve leverage can result in losses that greatly exceed the amount originally invested furthermore the fund’s ability to successfully use derivatives transactions depends on the adviser’s ability to predict pertinent securities prices interest rates currency exchange rates and other economic factors which cannot be assured derivatives transactions utilizing instruments denominated in foreign currencies will expose the fund to foreign currency risk to the extent the fund enters into derivatives transactions to hedge exposure to foreign currencies such transactions may not be successful and may eliminate any chance for the fund to benefit from favorable fluctuations in relevant foreign currencies the use of derivatives transactions may result in losses greater than if they had not been used may require the fund to sell or purchase portfolio securities at inopportune times or for prices other than current market values may limit the amount of appreciation the fund can realize on an investment or may cause the fund to hold a security that it might otherwise sell derivatives transactions involve risks of mispricing or improper valuation the documentation governing a derivative instrument or transaction may be unfavorable or ambiguous derivatives transactions may involve commissions and other costs which may increase the fund’s expenses and reduce its return various legislative and regulatory initiatives may impact the availability liquidity and cost of derivative instruments limit or restrict the ability of the fund to use certain derivative instruments or transact with certain counterparties as a part of its investment strategy increase the costs of using derivative instruments or make derivative instruments less effective in connection with certain derivatives transactions the fund may be required to segregate liquid assets or otherwise cover such transactions andor to deposit amounts as premiums or to be held in margin accounts such amounts may not otherwise be available to the fund for investment purposes the fund may earn a lower return on its portfolio than it might otherwise earn if it did not have to segregate assets in respect of or otherwise cover its derivatives transactions positions to the extent the fund’s assets are segregated or committed as cover it could limit the fund’s investment flexibility segregating assets and covering positions will not limit or offset losses on related positions swap risk the fund may enter into swap transactions including credit default swaps total return swaps index swaps currency swaps commodity swaps and interest rate swaps as well as options thereon and may purchase or sell interest rate caps floors and collars if the adviser is incorrect in its forecasts of market values interest rates or currency exchange rates the investment performance of the fund may be less favorable than it would have been if these investment techniques were not used such transactions are subject to market risk risk of default by the other party to the transaction and risk of imperfect correlation between the value of derivative instruments and the underlying assets and may involve commissions or other costs swaps generally do not involve the delivery of securities other underlying assets or principal accordingly the risk of loss with respect to swaps generally is limited to the net amount of payments that the fund is contractually obligated to make or in the case of the other party to a swap defaulting the net amount of payments that the fund is contractually entitled to receive total return swaps may effectively add leverage to the fund’s portfolio because the fund would be subject to investment exposure on the full notional amount of the swap total return swaps are subject to the risk that a counterparty will default on its payment obligations to the fund thereunder when the fund acts as a seller of a credit default swap agreement with respect to a debt security it is subject to the risk that an adverse credit event may occur with respect to the debt security and the fund may be required to pay the buyer the full notional value of the debt security under the swap net of any amounts owed to the fund by the buyer under the swap such as the buyer’s obligation to deliver the debt security to the fund as a result the fund bears the entire risk of loss due to a decline in value of a referenced debt security on a credit default swap it has sold if there is a credit event with respect to the security when the fund sells a credit default swap it effectively adds leverage to its portfolio if the fund is a buyer of a credit default swap and no credit event occurs the fund may recover nothing if the swap is held through its termination date however if a credit event occurs the fund generally may elect to receive the full notional value of the swap in exchange for an equal face amount of deliverable obligations of the reference entity whose value may have significantly decreased counterparty risk the fund will be subject to credit risk with respect to the counterparties to the derivative contracts entered into by the fund if a counterparty becomes bankrupt or otherwise fails to perform its obligations under a derivative contract the fund may experience significant delays in obtaining any recovery under the derivative contract in bankruptcy or other reorganization proceeding the fund may obtain only a limited recovery or may obtain no recovery in such circumstances concerns about or a default by one large market participant could lead to significant liquidity problems for other participants if a counterparty’s credit becomes significantly impaired multiple requests for collateral posting in a short period of time could increase the risk that the fund may not receive adequate collateral synthetic investment risk the fund may be exposed to certain additional risks should the adviser uses derivatives transactions as a means to synthetically implement the fund’s investment strategies customized derivative instruments will likely be highly illiquid and it is possible that the fund will not be able to terminate such derivative instruments prior to their expiration date or that the penalties associated with such a termination might impact the fund’s performance in a materially adverse manner synthetic investments may be imperfectly correlated to the investment the adviser is seeking to replicate portfolio turnover risk the fund’s annual portfolio turnover rate may vary greatly from year to year portfolio turnover rate is not considered a limiting factor in the execution of investment decisions for the fund a higher portfolio turnover rate results in correspondingly greater brokerage commissions and other transactional expenses that are borne by the fund high portfolio turnover may result in an increased realization of net shortterm capital gains by the fund which when distributed to common shareholders will be taxable as ordinary income additionally in a declining market portfolio turnover may result in realized capital losses whenissued and delayed delivery transactions risk securities purchased on a whenissued or delayed delivery basis may expose the fund to counterparty risk of default as well as the risk that securities may experience fluctuations in value prior to their actual delivery the fund generally will not accrue income with respect to a whenissued or delayed delivery security prior to its stated delivery date purchasing securities on a whenissued or delayed delivery basis can involve the additional risk that the price or yield available in the market when the delivery takes place may not be as favorable as that obtained in the transaction itself short sales risk the fund may make short sales of securities a short sale is a transaction in which the fund sells a security it does not own if the price of the security sold short increases between the time of the short sale and the time the fund replaces the borrowed security the fund will incur a loss conversely if the price declines the fund will realize a capital gain any gain will be decreased and any loss will be increased by the transaction costs incurred by the fund including the costs associated with providing collateral to the brokerdealer usually cash and liquid securities and the maintenance of collateral with its custodian although the fund’s gain is limited to the price at which it sold the security short its potential loss is theoretically unlimited the fund may have to pay a premium to borrow the securities and must pay any dividends or interest payable on the securities until they are replaced which will be expenses of the fund potential conflicts of interest risk the adviser and its affiliates provide a wide array of portfolio management and other asset management services to a mix of clients and may engage in ordinary course activities in which their interests or those of their clients may compete or conflict with those of the fund the adviser and its affiliates may provide investment management services to other funds that follow investment objectives similar to that of the fund the management of the fund and of these accounts may raise potential conflicts of interest relating to the cross trading allocation of investment opportunities and aggregation and allocation of trades the adviser and its affiliates have adopted policies and procedures designed to address such and other potential conflicts of interests recent market developments risk global financial markets have experienced periods of severe turmoil volatile financial markets can expose the fund to greater market and liquidity risk and potential difficulty in valuing portfolio instruments held by the fund risks to a robust resumption of growth persist a return to unfavorable economic conditions or sustained economic slowdown could adversely impact the fund’s portfolio legislation and regulation risk at any time after the date of this prospectus legislation may be enacted that could negatively affect the assets of the fund or the issuers of such assets changing approaches to regulation may have a negative impact on the fund or entities in which the fund invests legislation or regulation may also change the way in which the fund itself is regulated there can be no assurance that future legislation regulation or deregulation will not have a material adverse effect on the fund or will not impair the ability of the fund to achieve its investment objectives additional risks additional risks relating to investments in the fund include “subordinated securities risk” “floatingrate and fixedtofloatingrate securities risk” “risks
