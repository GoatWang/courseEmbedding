robinhoodstrategy longshort equity portfolio strategy etf investing research analystrobinhood strategysummaryafter the merger between praxair and linde praxair now dominates the market with  billion in sales globallypraxairs economic moat comes from its product distribution models and its limited exposure to low margin areaspraxair stock price has broken out from the  level to  in just a couple monthsmomentum stocks are plentiful in  there are numerous stocks that have been on a complete tear this year while momentum plays are nice and exciting diversifying into asset classes that will provide less risk and more stability is essential one name from our portfolio that might be a little less well known is praxair inc nysepx praxair recently confirmed a merger deal with linde group otcpklnagf otcpklnegy creating the worlds largest supplier of industrial gases investors looking for a growth stock with a strong moat should consider praxair overview praxair founded in  has grown to become the largest industrial gas supplier in north and south america and among the largest in the world praxairs primary products in its industrial gas business are atmospheric gases oxygen nitrogen argon rare gases and process gases carbon dioxide helium hydrogen electronic gases specialty gases acetylene in addition the company builds equipment that produces industrial gases in the industrial gas sector there were four major players praxair linde lair liquide otcpkaiquf otcpkaiquy and air products and chemicals nyseapd after the merger between praxair and linde praxair now dominates the market with  billion in sales globally data from company website praxairs economic moat comes from its product distribution models and its limited exposure to low margin areas onsite sales represent about  of praxairs total sales basically a large customer will enter into a  year takeorpay contract with praxair to build an onsite facility or facility close by praxair will then deliver gases by pipelines this model allows praxair to have low distribution costs as well as lock in a customer for a long time it is extremely difficult for existing customers to break contract and switch suppliers so these sales are safe the second type distribution comes in the form of merchant sales this represents about  of total sales these contracts are typically three to five year agreements tanker trucks will distribute gases to customers within a  mile radius praxair basically creates a local monopoly because regional demand may only be large enough to accommodate a single distributor praxair is very good at spacing its facilities to most efficiently meet customer demand the final form of distribution for praxair is shortterm one to three year packaged gas contracts this makes up the final third of praxairs business the design of these contracts makes them more vulnerable to shortterm economic conditions but two thirds of praxairs business involves longterm contracts praxair has stellar operating margins as well since praxair focuses much of its business in selling industrial gases and not selling low margin equipment unlike its peers praxair to has limited exposure to low margin areas praxairs operating margins are  basis points higher than the average of its major competitors dominance in a given industry is what we want to see in a stock comparable to apple nasdaqaapl in the consumer electronics industry or starbucks nasdaqsbux in the restaurant industry fundamentalsoutlook at an initial glance one might look at the fundamentals of praxair and be underwhelmed revenue growth has been below its usual trend since  falling at an average rate of about  annually the decline in revenue can mainly be attributed to soft global industrial production and a stronger dollar year revenue in billions eps                data from morningstar despite declining revenue and eps we expect growth to resume in the coming years as commodity prices stabilize global economic activity accelerates and currencies stabilize for example in  praxair was seeing strong revenue growth in south america mostly attributed to brazil however the brazilian economy entered into a recession as a result of weaker commodity market and currency prices in brazil alone praxair saw revenue decline  from  billion to  billion looking forward the merger with linde will help praxair diversify from north and south america as commodity prices stabilize and economic activity accelerates so should praxairs revenue growth technicals analyzing the weekly chart of praxair you will notice that praxair created a high volume w bottom back in late  to the first half of  this w bottom with an extended base was a strong foundation to send praxairs stock higher as you can see the stock has broken out from the  level to  in just a couple months most of this move can be attributed to the anticipation and completion of the linde merger praxairs stock is extended too far past the day moving average to consider building a position here with a forward pe of  and peg of  we suggest waiting for this one to pullback before entering we have held this stock for all of  and continue to see it as a core holding moving forward remember even as the market continues to rally diversification is key the technology sector has been on fire no doubt but continue to diversify and cycle

comparison with air products and chemicals  praxair inc nysepx  seeking alphasign in  join nowgo»praxair  a comparison with air products and chemicalsjan  about praxair inc px khen elazar value dividend growth investingkhen elazarsummaryin a previous article i analyzed air products and chemicals as i was looking at the industrial gases sub sector while i found air products and chemicals not as attractive as i would want it to be i decided to look deeper into the sector praxair is going through a big merger and it is a great time to take another look at it introduction i wanted to take another look at the basic materials sector i decided to focus on the industrial gases sub sector as i already analyzed it over a year ago i started by analyzing air products and chemicals nyseapd and found it to be a great company that is currently trades at an unattractively valuation in this article i will look deeper into its peer praxair nysepx at the moment i dont own any stocks from the basic materials sector i allocate  of my portfolio to energy and basic materials both sectors are very volatile and tend to be very cyclical and this is why i only allocate a small part of my portfolio to these sectors praxair is very interesting right now as it is merging with its giant german peer linde i will analyze praxair using my analysis thesis which is summarized in the following flowchart praxair produces sells and distributes industrial gases in north america europe south america and asia the company offers atmospheric gases such as oxygen nitrogen argon and rare gases it serves various industries such as healthcare petroleum refining manufacturing beverage carbonation steel making aerospace chemicals and water treatment fundamentals the chart below shows very nicely how cyclical the basic materials sector is the industrial gases subsector and praxair in particular are not excluded the goals is to keep the top line and the bottom line growing in the long run take a look at the chart the  recession can be seen easily and so is the latest drop in prices of commodities that lowered the demand for industrial gases the merger of course will have a huge impact on the revenues that will grow significantly px revenue nysettm data by ycharts while revenues will grow fcf will follow as the two companies are merging however on per share basis we will probably see little effect in the short term the graph below shows how well px managed to deal with business cycles and still growing the fcf and eps tremendously in the medium term the merger will bring a massive boost to eps as well as the fcf the company plans to save roughly  billion after the merger even if you find this figure optimistic half of it will have a massive effect as well the company is forecasted to grow in  and the eps will reach its all time high px free cash flow ttm data by ycharts praxair is just two years away from becoming a dividend aristocrat it has raised its annual dividend every year for the past  years in the past decade the dividend grew at over  a year and it expended the payout ratio right now i believe that dividend growth will go along eps growth with the opportunities that the merger offers the dividend will be able to grow fast using the  eps estimates the payout ratio will stand at roughly  therefore the dividend is sustainable has room to grow and the  is a pretty attractive entry yield px dividend data by ycharts over the past decade the company did manage to lower the amount of shares outstanding the decrease was very slow but as you probably know i like it when companies dont dilute shareholders the merger however is going to add millions of shares as it is a  merger the eps and fcf per share should not be affected by the merger hopefully the management will use some of the cash flow for a buyback plan px shares outstanding data by ycharts while apd managed to bring faster fcf growth i still believe that px has stronger and better fundamentals i dont look only at the past i also look at the  outlook that includes a successful merger therefore in this category i prefer px over apd valuation when i compare the valuation i expect to find apd valued more attractively however the chart below shows me that my expectations were wrong px is valued much more attractively based on eps estimates for  since the elections in november apd experienced pe expansion as the price went up while the outlook remained the same px pe ratio forward data by ycharts when i am looking at the valuation based on the fcf i see that both companies are not attractively valued px trades for  times its fcf in  however i accept the higher valuation as the company offers a more positive outlook and a huge merger that will change the company while i believe that px is valued more attractively i still find both valuations not compelling enough px wins the valuation battle with apd but it still doesnt offer an attractive valuation at  forward pe and  forward price to fcf the company is a little bit overvalued if you believe that the company will perform perfectly then it might be fairly valued opportunities the first opportunity is not unique for praxair and air products and chemicals will also enjoy it the whole industry is consolidating air gas was acquired and praxair is merging to form a giant global industrial gases company the consolidation will reduce the competition in the us and will help the companies competing their asian peers praxair itself has a very strong position in the united states if president trump is able to revive the american manufacturing industries the demand for industrial gases will grow significantly the company will be able to use technology from linde in order to strengthen its position in the americas the merger with linde can offer a lot for praxair it starts with bigger exposure to the european markets it continues with the  billion in cost cuts that will be translated to the bottom lines moreover the merger will unite linde which is a global leader due to its technological advantages and praxair which has an extremely efficient business model while both apd and px will enjoy the trends in the sector i believe that px offers more opportunities mainly due to the merger with linde this merger will lower competition and will strengthen praxairs position globally risks the first risk i wish to discuss besides the cyclical nature of the sector and the little margin of safety offered at the current valuation is trade wars while a successful trump administration might offer great opportunities to px it also might lead us into a trade war with some of our largest trade partners if other countries especially in south and central america where px has a major market share will impose tariffs it will hurt the business for the medium and long run moreover the strengthening usd can also offer a risk to earnings growth however i believe this can be only a short term risk the business environment that includes the monetary and fiscal policies is still unknown and uncertainty is always a risk for investors after the merger as px becomes a huge multinational based in the us the strong usd can really hurt eps for the short term while the number of competitors in the us is lower apd is still a major competitor its management is aiming at becoming the most profitable company in the country moreover the competition in asia and especially china is still a major threat for px is the emerging markets are a major growth catalysts for the future of the company i believe that both companies have the same risks while the merger is complicated it does make sense and the management will be able to monetize it in my opinion both companies share the same risks and i find it to be a draw conclusion both companies are great enterprises they have strong fundamentals and many opportunities to grow in the future personally after analyzing both of them i learned to appreciate px a little bit more they are in the beginning of a very ambitious plan to accelerate growth using the mega merger with linde however even great companies like these two should only be bought if the price is right this is not the case here both apd and px are overvalued in my opinion i believe that the market expectations are too high and therefore using the flowchart i presented above i will keep both of them in my watchlist disclosure iwe have no positions in any stocks mentioned and no plans to initiate any positions within the next  hours i wrote this article myself and it
