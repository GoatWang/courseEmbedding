by the founder of ddiscounts direct with a request for operating capital the company had generated slightly more than  in revenue the previous year by liquidating excess inventory online byrne found the idea of online closeouts intriguing and invested  million for a  percent equity stake in the company in the spring of  in september the same year he took over as ceo and the following month the company was renamed overstockcom worldstockedit during a vacation in southeast asia byrne found that many village artisans were held back by the lack of retail channels as their production was fragmented and the quantities produced were small he decided that the overstock model was perfectly suited for their needs so in  he set up the worldstock division of overstock worldstock searches through villages all over the world for people capable of producing quality products by  there were approximately  producers contributing on average about  percent of the retail price on all worldstock items sold goes directly to the artist dutch auction ipoedit byrne initiated a dutch auction ipo of overstockcom in  the company was one of the first to go public under a system advanced by wr hambrecht  co to retain a greater share of capital within the company rather than going to the investment bank underwriters used in conventional public offerings byrne has said that competing banks reacted against this attempting to obstruct the success of the offering through negative reports and by shorting the companys stock when google later in  went public via a dutch auction ipo byrne commented that wall street firms similarly pushed negative stories but did not keep it from going forward successfully four years after the openipo one official of hambrecht its now former coceo clay corbus was added to overstocks board of directors campaign against naked shorting and analystsedit in a conference call with analysts in august  byrne said that theres been a plan since we were in our teens to destroy our stock drive it down to –  and even a plan for how the company would then get whacked up he said that the conspirators were part of a miscreants ball headed by a sith lord who he refused to identify but said hes one of the master criminals from the s byrne said the conspiracy included hedge funds journalists investigators trial lawyers the sec and eliot spitzer fortune writer bethany mclean said that byrne had become a hero to those who believe that shortsellers are the operators of wall streets ultimate black box predators who destroy companies through innuendo bullying political connections—and sometimes through an illegal practice known as naked shorting byrne financed and largely wrote a fullpage advertisement in the washington post which said naked shortselling  is literally stealing money from the widows retirees and other small investors in a letter to the wall street journal in april  byrne contended that blackguards have practiced failure to deliver of securities were destroying businesses and probably destabilizing our capital markets since  overstock has filed two lawsuits relating to the matters under byrnes direction in the first lawsuit filed  overstockcom filed suit against hedge fund rocker partners and the equities research firm gradient analytics formerly camelback research alliance saying they illegally colluded in shortselling the company while paying for negative reports to drive down share prices the defendant ie gradient analytics et al moved to have the case dismissed however the california court ruled in august  that the suit should be allowed to proceed gradient filed a countercomplaint against byrne for libel a portion of this suit was settled out of court on october   when overstockcom and gradient dropped the claims against each other after gradient retracted allegations that overstocks reporting methods did not comply with rules established by the fasb stated they believed overstockcom complied with gaap standards and that three directors were independent and apologized in december  the suit against rocker whose name had since been changed to copper river partners was settled by copper river paying  million payment of which byrne stated he received on december   overstockcom filed a second lawsuit in  against a number of large investment banks relating directly to alleged illegal naked short selling all parties have settled with overstock except for merrill lynch byrnes campaign against naked short selling and others who he feels have targeted him and his company has attracted controversy though after the crisis in the north american markets in  byrne received positive press a salt lake tribune article reported that these days when people talk of byrne the word vindication comes up a lot libel suitedit in october  vancouver businessman altaf nazerali sued byrne for libel and defamation in the supreme court of british columbia for articles published in byrnes deep capture website the articles described nazerali as being involved with “osama bin laden’s favorite financier” and that he worked with criminal syndicates including the colombian drug cartel the russian mafia and various “jihadi terrorist groups” including al qaeda’s golden chain deep capture also accused nazerali of “delivering weapons to war zones in africa and to the mujahedeen in afghanistan” of orchestrating “smalltime ‘pump and dump’ scams… and bustouts death spiral finance and naked short selling” and of carrying out dirty work for “a pakistani isi asset” who “works for the iranian regime”  in may  the court found that the allegations in the deep capture articles were spurious and nazerali was awarded  million in damages including  in aggravated damages  in punitive damages and  in special damages byrne was permanently banned from publishing these accusations the court found byrne his employee mark mitchell and deep capture engaged in a calculated and ruthless campaign to inflict as much damage on mr nazerali’s reputation as they could achieve the page decision said “it is clear on the evidence that their intention was to conduct a vendetta in which the truth about mr nazerali himself was of no consequence in december  following a hearing before the supreme court of british columbia nazerali was awarded special costs by the court obliging byrne and deep capture to pay nazeralis legal fees and disbursements the judgement in awarding special costs specifically cites the deep capture defendants have been indifferent to the effect on the plaintiff of their singleminded determination to cause him damage byrne filed an appeal in june  in november  byrne consented to a court of appeal order requiring him to post security of approximately  million as a condition of hearing his appeal in february  byrne consented to a court of appeal order requiring him to add special costs to the security for a total of approximately  million he was given until february   to post the security into court awards and media attentionedit numerous national media outlets have covered byrnes campaign against naked shorting among them are the wall street journal abc

threequarters of its  million funding opponents of vouchers funded mostly by the teacher unions spent  million approximately  million came from the national education association when that bill was
