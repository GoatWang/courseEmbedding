the battery foundation roxane is passionate about womens rights including access to education healthcare jobs voting rights and other inequities facing women and people across the globe how has your life experience made you the leaders you are today im half french and half colombian and have lived in france colombia and the us being a global citizen has had a big influence on the leader i am today for instance i constantly consider diversity of thought on my teams  this can come from various educational professional cultural or gender backgrounds during my upbringing anything less than excellence was considered not good enough  this set high aspirations for me and taught me to be ambitious which translates to what i expect of my teams and how i lead i also became sensitized early on being one of few women pursuing a stem career i think that plays into my leadership style as wellhow has your previous employment experience aided your tenure at symantec i was a management consultant for  years before coming to symantec the nature of that work was projectdriven so having the experience of constant new projects and new things to solve has been helpful in what symantec is going through with its own change and transformation in management consulting youre exercising all the muscles given it spans such a wide roadmap  marketing sales profit improvement etc  and youre also tasked with asking a lot of questions to understand the problem and quickly provide a solution my role at symantec has changed five times since i started but my consulting background has given me the flexibility to actually enjoy this changewhat have the highlights and challenges been during your tenure at symantec there have been many highlights i have embraced my changing roles ive had a fantastic time with it because there are some big things symantec needs to resolve and to be a part of that  accelerating towards the answer  is really fulfilling my current highlight is the gm role accountability in the business and what that entails i am very motivated by the responsibility i have over a highly functional team and the way to take that to the next level in terms of challenges i have faced some skepticism after  years i was assumed to be a lifetime consultant people feared i would be paralyzed by my desire to analyze too demanding not practical enough this was also exacerbated by how i came across demanding yes but with a different tone style and voice  driven by my background and my gender this created a double disconnect sometimes that i needed to overcome i have also had to learn how to operate in a world where you  and your team are running the sahara ultramarathon as opposed to a sprint to the corner store it is a different operating model where you need to blend sense of urgency with sustainability what advice can you offer to women who want a career in information security the ideal combination is meaning and opportunity and there is huge meaning and opportunity in this field i would definitely encourage women to consider this field indeed were living increasingly digital lives and in that context information security is a critical component of progress  a career in this space provides many opportunities especially because we have a big talent shortage and in addition youre doing something good my advice for succeeding in this field is to find people and sponsors who believe in you if you are interested in this topic theres no reason not to go for itwhat is the most important lesson youve learned in your career to date grit and resilience among successful people i think the single thing that stands out is resilience be tough and hang on this has manifested in multiple ways for me  for example after i had kids i made the choice to come back to a career with a lot of travel  it was all about grit soon after the economy went down and i had to reinvent myself  i had to push through and stay tough in the face of adversity at the end of the day its about resilience and grithow do you maintain a worklife balance i think the core of leadership work is a job that you derive meaning from so i continually get fulfillment from my career i try to minimize time spent on things that arent fulfilling or arent what i want to take on another huge factor is who your spouse or life partner is in my case it takes two to make it doable manage what gives you energy my situation works because we have a family construct and we set expectations with our childrenwhat do you think is the biggest issue for women in the workplace it is all about biases the first and most insidious one was that people didnt ask me if i wanted to take on hard assignments when i came back from maternity leave they just assumed id say no because of my increased maternal responsibilities this was extremely disempowering because people didnt even ask  they just assumed i know they were wellintended but at the same time blinded by their biases in addition it is frequent for groups in high tech to question womens competencies that goes away in groups where the talent pool becomes more balancedhow has mentorship made a difference in your professional and personal life well for starters im not good at asking for help but there have been people looking out for me who created a safety net without me even knowing when i first joined symantec a former colleague gave my boss advice on working with me and said to give me challenging assignments  a week later the scope of my responsibility was increased i can think of a handful of individuals who created real tangible opportunities for me during my career because they had seen me rise to the challengewhich other female leaders do you admire and why i admire the decision sheryl sandberg made to be an activist on womens issues ive spent a lot of time on this topic and shes taken it to a whole new level i also admire christine lagardes managing director international monetary fund imf journey as a french woman in an americanbased institution watching her success has been inspiringwhat do you want symantec to accomplish in the next year symantec is in the middle of a split so executing that successfully is a business priority as well as the momentum gained coming out of the split i dont just want to meet deadlines during this process i want it to create momentum for the company our renewed focus on improving the diversity of our workforce and the inclusiveness of our culture will help us better meet our customer needs and rise to this challenge our multiyear diversity strategy will help us better compete for global talent especially those women who see information security is a field for them to thrive follow laura dunn on twitter wwwtwittercomlauraemilyd

california on monday november   left to rightsvp of product marketing sales cloud sara varni vp work wasn’t the same after tech consultant roxane divol returned from maternity leave she no longer received the best assignments especially those requiring travel because her colleagues assumed she wanted to stay close to home as she had a child she confronted a senior male colleague telling him to stop asking if she was ok and to help her tap into the best opportunities at the firm women and tech lee silicon valley needs women board members ebay becomes latest tech firm to boost parental leave policy opinion perfection is the enemy of ‘having it all’ “i get it” she recalled the male colleague saying “i guess you are the man in your family” it’s the kind of sexism women still face daily as they push for equal representation in the workplace especially in tech which has specific and unusual gender problems female engineers represent a tiny minority at many companies with even fewer women in the upper echelons of leadership a chronicle analysis of the bay area’s top  publicly traded tech firms by workforce shows that only a handful have a significant number of female managers reporting directly to the ceo at several companies women represented  percent or less of a company’s executive team the company with the highest percentage was cisco systems inc with women representing  percent of the executive team while the lowest was fremont’s synnex corp which lists no women on its leadership team studies have shown that companies with more female leaders have better financial results experts said without more diversity marketing campaigns can play to gender stereotypes or release products taking into account only a man’s perspective “companies that do not utilize women in top management positions are really giving up  percent of the talent” said michalle mor barak author of “managing diversity toward a globally inclusive workplace” those firms “are not only not doing the right thing but also harming themselves in the long run” she said few peers photo lea suzuki the chronicle image of captionclose image  of  roxane divol right senior vice president and general manager

diversity pays    back to gallery to be sure some tech companies have highprofile female executives but those women have few peers at their companies that’s the case at facebook for chief operating officer sheryl sandberg and chief financial officer ruth porat at google’s parent company alphabet the sexism directed toward top female executives can be blatant in a meeting with investors michelle forsythe ceo of notestream in lake forest orange county fielded questions about what it was like working with her husband and whether they had any children meanwhile her husband — the company’s chief technology officer — got questions about the business behind the startup’s learning app “the raw truth is this sexism is alive and well in the tech industry it hides behind polite smiles and discreet glances at the clock it masquerades as interest but manifests as condescension” forsythe said later adding “i’m a woman ceo with data to back the success of my app let’s talk about that” trend in other industries the trend of fewer women at the top isn’t just in tech but across other industries a study released in  by mckinsey  co and nonprofit leaninorg showed that even though women and men are almost equally represented in entrylevel positions fewer women get promoted to each higher level by the time women reach senior vice president they represent just  percent of the positions the study said csuite representation is even less at just  percent according to the study’s data which tracked  companies including  in tech “we’ve lost women every step of the way” said lareina yee a partner at mckinsey  co as women climb the corporate ladder many of them are promoted through “staff roles” or positions related to legal human resources and it while fewer highranking women hold “line roles” that deal directly with the company’s finances or core operations according to the study in the csuite — the highest level of executive leadership — only  of the female executives are in “line” positions such as chief development officer the people who hold these roles often later become ceo photo lea suzuki the chronicle roxane divol senior vice president and general manager symantec

they don’t want the top job because of the stress associated with it and they don’t feel they can balance their work and family commitments according to the mckinsey survey of roughly  employees unconscious bias biases also influence why women don’t advance to higher positions within a company yee said referring to unconscious bias where “women are often looked at for their performance and men just on their potential” some tech companies are working to address this through mentorship programs and special opportunities for employees to learn about their companies’ other departments photo liz hafalia the chronicle vice president of product marketing jamie domenici leaves the salesforce lobby many women face challenges because they are seen as being so different by male colleagues in the workplace vice president of product marketing jamie domenici leaves the san francisco cloud computing company salesforce piloted a program for roughly  highpotential female leaders mostly at the vice president level through the program sara varni a vice president of marketing networked with senior executives around the company broadening her perspective about what she could do at salesforce she worked with a coach on improving her presentation skills the experience gave her the confidence to speak in front of more than  people at dreamforce in september and ultimately what she learned helped her land a promotion to senior vice president of marketing for sales cloud challenges at top but once you reach senior circles with few or no other women there are still hurdles divol now senior vice president and general manager of trust services at symantec said there’s still the “challenge of being so different” “if you are asking different questions you look different you dress different you sound different — it can be offensive to folks” divol said photo liz hafalia the chronicle vp of product marketing jamie domenici background listens to svp of product marketing sales cloud sara varni during a gathering at a salesforce conference room in san francisco california on monday november   vp of product marketing jamie domenici background listens to svp author mor barak said it’s important that companies allow women and other underrepresented communities to show perspectives that make them unique rather than force them to fit into the existing culture the talent “will be stifled if they are expected to behave like the mainstream” mor barak said after divol joined symantec some people said she was hard to work with her executive coach interviewed her peers about it and learned that because everything about her was different it was a lot for people to absorb one of the male colleagues as she recalled said “you know roxane you bring up really good questions but everything about you is so surprising you dress different you have a different angle on things — it’s a lot of things for us to take on” ultimately divol realized she needed to treat her colleagues like she did her clients when she was a consultant “with a little bit of care and cocooning with how i support the same topic” pay inequality persists female executives in tech are still struggling with equal compensation median pay for female executive officers was about  million nearly 9 less than their male counterparts according to research firm equilar that gap was more pronounced in tech compared with other sectors including finance consumer goods and utilities equliar said with many male founders think google’s larry page or facebook’s mark zuckerberg owning equity in their companies that factors into the pay the disparity stems from the very beginning with a higher percentage of startups founded by white men landing more venture funding it will take a while before the percentage of female leaders increases across all industries mckinsey  co’s study says it will take more than 0 years to reach parity at the csuite level and  years at the senior vice president level at the rate progress has happened since  having their say divol is doing her part to reduce that wait at symantec she learned that a male employee was up for a promotion but a female employee in a similar position who was also ranked very well was not getting promoted “when these numbers are off balance it gives me the opportunity to ask why” divol said she asked her team to either promote them both or keep them at the same level both were promoted maggie wilderotter executive chairman of frontier communications corp was instrumental in the shift at her company when she joined as ceo and president in 0 there were no women on the board or any female executive reporting directly to the top boss today three out of seven female executives report to the president and  percent of the board are female “the good news for our company was i was at the top i am also a woman” wilderotter said “i basically said this is good business and this is what we are going to do”

share this article on twitter share this article on facebook email this article download this article as the marketing power of social media grows it no longer makes sense to treat it as an experiment here’s how senior leaders can harness social media to shape consumer decision making in predictable ways executives certainly know what social media is after all if facebook users constituted a country it would be the world’s third largest behind china and india executives can even claim to know what makes social media so potent its ability to amplify wordofmouth effects yet the vast majority of executives have no idea how to harness social media’s power companies diligently establish twitter feeds and branded facebook pages but few have a deep understanding of exactly how social media interacts with consumers to expand product and brand recognition drive sales and profitability and engender loyalty we believe there are two interrelated reasons why social media remains an enigma wrapped in a riddle for many executives particularly nonmarketers the first is its seemingly nebulous nature it’s no secret that consumers increasingly go online to discuss products and brands seek advice and offer guidance yet it’s often difficult to see where and how to influence these conversations which take place across an evergrowing variety of platforms among diverse and dispersed communities and may occur either with lightning speed or over the course of months second there’s no single measure of social media’s financial impact and many companies find that it’s difficult to justify devoting significant resources—financial or human—to an activity whose precise effect remains unclear what we hope to do here is to demystify social media we have identified its four primary functions—to monitor respond amplify and lead consumer behavior—and linked them to the journey consumers undertake when making purchasing decisions being able to identify exactly how when and where social media influences consumers helps executives to craft marketing strategies that take advantage of social media’s unique ability to engage with customers it should also help leaders develop launch and demonstrate the financial impact of socialmedia campaigns for insight into the world’s biggest socialmedia market see “understanding social media in china” in short today’s chief executive can no longer treat social media as a side activity run solely by managers in marketing or public relations it’s much more than simply another form of paid marketing and it demands more too a clear framework to help ceos and other top executives evaluate investments in it a plan for building support infrastructure and performancemanagement systems to help leaders smartly scale their social presence companies that have these three elements in place can create critical new brand assets such as content from customers or insights from their feedback open up new channels for interactions twitterbased customer service facebook news feeds and completely reposition a brand through the way its employees interact with customers or other parties the social consumer decision journey companies have quickly learned that social media works 9 percent of companies we’ve surveyed already use socialmedia services as their primary digital tool to reach customers and that percentage is expected to rise to  percent within the next four years  see “what marketers say about working online mckinsey global survey results” november  fueling this growth is a growing list of success stories from mainstream companies creating buzz eighteen months before ford reentered the us subcompactcar market with its fiesta model it began a broad marketing campaign called the fiesta movement a major element involved giving 0 socialmedia influencers a european model of the car having them complete “missions” and asking them to document their experiences on various social channels videos related to the fiesta campaign generated  million views on youtube and ford received  requests for information about the vehicle primarily from nonford drivers when it finally became available to the public in late  some  cars sold in the first six days learning from customers pepsico has used social networks to gather customer insights via its dewmocracy promotions which have led to the creation of new varieties of its mountain dew brand since 0 the company has sold more than  million cases of them targeting customers levi strauss has used social media to offer locationspecific deals in one instance direct interactions with just 00 consumers led 00 people to turn up at the company’s stores— an example of social media’s wordofmouth effect yet countless others have failed to match these successes knowing that something works and understanding how it works are very different things as the number of companies with facebook pages twitter feeds or online communities continues to grow we think it’s time for leaders to remind themselves how social media connects with an organization’s broader marketing mission marketing’s primary goal is to reach consumers at the moments or touch points that influence their purchasing behavior almost three years ago our colleagues proposed a framework—the “consumer decision journey”—for understanding how consumers interact with companies during purchase decisions  see david court dave elzinga susan mulder and ole jørgen vetvik “the consumer decision journey” mckinsey quarterly june 09 expressing consumer behavior as a winding journey with multiple feedback loops this new framework was different from the traditional description of consumer purchasing behavior as a linear march through a funnel social media is a unique component of the consumer decision journey it’s the only form of marketing that can touch consumers at each and every stage from when they’re pondering brands and products right through the period after a purchase as their experience influences the brands they prefer and their potential advocacy influences others interactive a social journey for more on social media’s relationship to the consumer decision journey explore this interactive exhibit narrated by coauthor david edelman open interactive popup the fact that social media can influence customers at every stage of the journey doesn’t mean that it should depending on the company and industry some touch points are more important to competitive advantage than others  readers interested in a detailed approach for understanding which touch points matter—based on research techniques that reveal what consumers are seeing saying and doing—should read david edelman “branding in the digital age you’re spending your money in all the wrong places” harvard business review december  volume  number  pp –9 what’s more our work with dozens of companies adapting to the new marketing environment strongly suggests that the most powerful socialmedia strategies focus on a limited number of marketing responses closely related to individual touch points along the consumer decision journey the ten most important responses range from providing customer service to fostering online communities exhibit one of those ten—monitoring what people say about your brand—is so important that we see it as a core function of social media relevant across the entire consumer decision journey the remaining nine responses organized in three clusters in the exhibit underpin efforts to use social media to respond to consumer comments to amplify positive sentiment and activity and to lead changes in the behavior and mindsets of consumers exhibit social media enables targeted marketing responses at individual touch points along the consumer decision journey  monitor gatorade a sports drink manufactured by pepsico has been diligently working toward its goal of becoming the “largest participatory brand in the world”  comment by carla hassan gatorade’s senior marketing director consumer and shopper engagement for more see adam ostrow “inside gatorade’s social media command center” mashablecom june   it has created a chicagobased “war room” within its marketing department to monitor the brand in real time across social media there are seats where team members can track custombuilt data visualizations and dashboards including terms related to the brand sponsored athletes and competitors and run sentiment analyses around product and campaign launches every day all of this feedback is integrated into products and marketing—for example by helping to optimize the landing page on the company’s web site since the war room’s creation the average traffic to gatorade’s online properties the length of visitor interactions and viral sharing from campaigns have all more than doubled such brand monitoring—simply knowing what’s said online about your products and services—should be a default socialmedia function taking place constantly even without engaging consumers directly companies can glean insights from an effective monitoring program that informs everything from product design to marketing and provides advance warning of potentially negative publicity it’s also critical to communicate such feedback within the business quickly whoever is charged with brand monitoring must ensure that information reaches relevant functions such as communications design marketing public relations or risk  respond valuable though it is to learn how you are doing and what to improve broad and passive monitoring is only a start pinpointing conversations for responding at a personal level is another form of socialmedia engagement this kind of response can certainly be positive if it’s done to provide customer service or to uncover sales leads most often though responding is a part of crisis management last year for example a hoax photograph posted online claimed that mcdonald’s was charging africanamericans an additional service fee the hoax first appeared on twitter where the image rapidly went viral just before the weekend as was retweeted with the hashtag seriouslymcdonalds it turned out to be a working weekend for the mcdonald’s socialmedia team on saturday the company’s director of social media released a statement through twitter declaring the photograph to be a hoax and asking key influencers to “please let your followers know” the company continued to reinforce that message throughout the weekend even responding personally to concerned tweeters by sunday the number of people who believed the image to be authentic had dwindled and mcdonald’s stock price rose  percent the following day responding in order to counter negative comments and reinforce positive ones will only increase in importance the responsibility for taking action may fall on functions outside marketing and the message will differ depending on the situation no response can be quick enough and the ability to act rapidly requires the constant proactive monitoring of social media—on weekends too by responding rapidly transparently and honestly companies can positively influence consumer sentiment and behavior  amplify “amplification” involves designing your marketing activities to have an inherently social motivator that spurs broader engagement and sharing this approach means more than merely reaching the end of planning a marketing campaign and then thinking that “we should do something social”—say uploading a television commercial to youtube it means that the core concepts for campaigns must invite customers into an experience that they can choose to extend by joining a conversation with the brand product fellow users and other enthusiasts it means having ongoing programs that share new content with customers and provide opportunities for sharing back it means offering experiences that customers will feel great about sharing because they gain a badge of honor by publicizing content that piques the interest of others in the initial phases of the consumer decision journey when consumers sift through brands and products to determine their preferred options referrals and recommendations are powerful socialmedia tools a simple example is the way online deal sites such as groupon and gilt groupe provide consumers with credit for each firsttime purchaser they refer our research shows that such direct recommendations from peers generate engagement rates some  times higher than traditional online advertising does once a consumer has decided which product to buy and makes a purchase companies can use social media to amplify their engagement and foster loyalty when starbucks wanted to increase awareness of its brand for example it launched a competition challenging users to be the first to tweet a photograph of one of the new advertising posters that the company had placed in six major us cities providing winners with a  gift card this socialmedia brand advocacy effort delivered a marketing punch that significantly outweighed its budget starbucks said that the effort was “the difference between launching with millions of dollars versus millions of fans”  see claire cain miller “new starbucks ads seek to recruit online fans” nytimescom may  09 marketers also can foster communities around their brands and products both to reinforce the belief of consumers that they made a smart decision and to provide guidance for getting the most from a purchase software company intuit for example launched customer service forums for its quicken and quickbooks personalfinance software so users could help one another with product issues the result users rather than intuit employees answer about 0 percent of the questions and the company has employed user comments to make dozens of significant changes to its software  lead social media can be used most proactively to lead consumers toward longterm behavioral changes in the early stages of the consumer decision journey this may involve boosting brand awareness by driving web traffic to content about existing products and services when groomingproducts group old spice introduced its old spice man character to viewers during the us national football league’s  super bowl for example the company’s ambition was to increase its reach and relevance to both men and women the commercial became a phenomenon starring former player isaiah mustafa it got more than 9 million hits across all platforms and yearonyear sales for the company’s products jumped by  percent within six months marketers also can use social media to generate buzz through product launches as ford did in launching its fiesta vehicle in the united states for example social media played an integral role in the success of “small business saturday” the us shopping promotion created by american express for the weekend immediately following thanksgiving for american express cmo john hayes’s perspective on that launch see “how we see it three senior executives on the future of marketing” in addition when consumers are ready to buy companies can promote timesensitive targeted deals and offers through social media to generate traffic and sales online menswear company bonobos for example provided an incentive for its twitter followers by unlocking a discount code after its messages were resent a certain number of times as a result of this effort almost 0 consumers bought products from the site for the first time the campaign delivered a 0 percent return on investment in just  hours finally social media can solicit consumer input after the purchase this ability to gain productdevelopment insights from customers in a relatively inexpensive way is emerging as one of social media’s most significant advantages intuit for example has its community forums starbucks uses mystarbucksideacom to collect its customers’ views about improving the company’s products and services and then aggregates submitted ideas and prominently displays them on a dedicated web site that site groups ideas by product experience and involvement ranks user participation and shows ideas actively under consideration by the company and those that have been implemented converting knowledge to action despite offering numerous opportunities to influence consumers social media still accounts for less than  percent of an average marketing budget in our experience many chief marketing officers say that they want to increase that share to  percent one problem is that a lot of senior executives know little about social media but the main obstacle is the perception that the return on investment roi from such initiatives is uncertain without a clear sense of the value social media creates it’s perhaps not surprising that so many ceos and other senior executives don’t feel comfortable when their companies go beyond mere “experiments” with socialmedia strategy yet we can measure the impact of social media well beyond straight volume and consumersentiment metrics in fact we can precisely determine the buzz surrounding a product or brand and then calculate how social media drives purchasing behavior to do so—and then ensure that social media complements broader marketing strategies—companies must obviously coordinate data tools technology and talent across multiple functions in many cases senior business leaders must open up their agendas and recognize the importance of supporting and even undertaking initiatives that may traditionally have been left to the chief marketing officer as our colleagues noted last year “we’re all marketers now”  see tom french laura laberge and paul magill “we’re all marketers now” mckinsey quarterly july  consider the experience of a telecommunications company that proactively adopted social media but had no idea if its efforts were working the company had launched twitterbased customer service capabilities several promotional campaigns built around social contests a fan page with discounts and tech tips and an active response program to engage with people speaking about the brand in socialmedia terms the investment was relatively large and the company’s senior executives wanted more than anecdotal evidence that the strategy was paying off as a starting point to ensure that the company was doing a quality job designing and executing its social presence it benchmarked its efforts against approaches used by other companies known to be successful in social media it then advanced the following hypotheses if all of these socialmedia activities improve general service perceptions about the brand that improvement should be reflected in a higher volume of positive online posts  there’s no shortage of methods purporting to measure social media’s presence and impact the company in this example used buzzmetrics a suite of tools developed by nm incite a joint venture between nielsen and mckinsey if social sharing is effective added clicks and traffic should result in higher search placements if both of these assumptions hold true socialmedia activity should help drive sales—ideally at a rate even higher than the company could achieve with its average gross rating point grp of advertising expenditures  gross rating points measure the size of the audience a specific media vehicle reaches to calculate them multiply the percentage of the target audience an advertisement reaches by the number of times it airs the company then tested its options at various times it spent less money on conventional advertising especially as socialmedia activity ramped up and it modeled the rising positive sentiment and higher search positions just as it would using traditional metrics the company concluded that socialmedia activity not only boosted sales but also had higher rois than traditional marketing did thus while the company took a risk by shifting emphasis toward socialmedia efforts before it had data confirming that this was the correct course the bet paid off what’s more the analytic baseline now in place has given the company confidence to continue exploring a growing role for social media in other cases social media may have a more specific role such as helping to launch a new product or to mitigate negative word of mouth similar types of analyses can focus on mixing the impact of buzz search and traffic correlating that with sales or renewals or whatever the key metric may be and then gauging the result against total costs this approach can give executives the confidence and focus they need to invest more money time and resources in social media as these socialmedia activities gain scale the challenges center less around justifying funding and more around organizational issues such as developing the right processes and governance structure identifying clear roles—for all involved in socialmedia strategy from marketing to customer service to product development—and bolstering the talent base and improving performance standards new capabilities abound and socialmedia best practices are barely starting to emerge we do know this because socialmedia influences every element of the consumer decision journey communication must take place between as well as within functions that complicates lines of reporting and decisionmaking authority if insights from monitoring social media are relevant to nonmarketing functions such as product development for instance how will you identify and disseminate that information efficiently and effectively—and then ensure that it gets used if you spot an opportunity to have a meaningful conversation with a key influencer how will you quickly engage the right senior executive to follow through if you recognize a fastmoving service concern how will you respond rapidly and openly—and when should you do so outside the traditional service organization senior executives across the company must recognize and begin to answer such questions social media is extending the disruptive impact of the digital era across a broad range of functions meanwhile the perceived lack of metrics the fear and the limited sense of what’s possible are eroding executives can identify the functions touch points and goals of socialmedia activities as well as craft approaches to measure their impact and manage their risks the time
